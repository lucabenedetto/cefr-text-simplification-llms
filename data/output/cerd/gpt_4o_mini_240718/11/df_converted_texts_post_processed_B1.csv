CPE_15,C2,"'Garbage in, garbage out'**
Charging families for each bag of rubbish they throw away seems like a good idea for the environment and for saving money. However, it might not be. In many developed countries, the way we collect rubbish is similar. Rubbish bags or bins are picked up regularly by special trucks and taken to a dump. Economists find this strange because, in most places, this service is free. Households pay for it through local taxes, but a family that throws away four bags of rubbish each week pays the same as an elderly couple that only throws away one bag. However, rubbish disposal does cost money. The more rubbish people throw away, the more rubbish collectors and trucks are needed, and the more local authorities have to pay for dumping it. This creates a basic economic problem: if rubbish disposal is free, people will throw away too much rubbish. 
One solution is to make households pay for the cost of throwing away their waste. This would encourage them to throw away less and recycle more, as long as local governments provide places to recycle. But two American economists, Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman, found that this logical solution can have complicated and sometimes disappointing results. They studied several American towns that started charging households for rubbish. The most common method was to sell stickers or tags that people had to put on their rubbish bags or cans. Only bags with these tags were picked up during the weekly collection.
In a study published last year, Fullerton and Kinnaman looked at a scheme started in July 1992 in Charlottesville, Virginia, a town with about 40,000 people. Residents had to pay 80 cents for each tagged bag of rubbish. This seemed like a good use of market forces. However, the authors found that the benefits of the scheme did not cover the costs of printing the tags, paying sellers, and the workers running the program. Although the number of bags collected fell sharply by 37%, this was mainly because people started to cram more rubbish into each bag instead of buying more tags. This method, known as the 'Seattle stomp', is not as effective as using machines at landfill sites. The weight of rubbish collected fell by only 14% in Charlottesville. In 25 other Virginian cities without a pricing scheme, the weight of rubbish also fell by 3.5%.
Worse still, some people began to dump their rubbish illegally instead of paying for collection. Although it is hard to measure, the authors estimate that illegal dumping may account for 30-40% of the reduction in collected rubbish. The only positive outcome was a 15% increase in the weight of materials recycled, suggesting that people chose to recycle (which is free) instead of paying to have their rubbish taken away. However, this increase may not be directly related to the fee, as many people were already recycling in Charlottesville.
In a more recent study, Fullerton and Kinnaman looked at rubbish disposal in more detail. They found that charging for rubbish does reduce the amount of waste, but not by much. On average, a 10% increase in sticker prices only reduces the amount of rubbish by 0.3%. This is less than in other studies, but it is not surprising. To significantly reduce rubbish, people would need to buy less of everything. A small tax on rubbish is unlikely to make a big difference. 
If this is true, we should think about whether other factors, like income and education, are just as important as price. For example, in richer towns, people throw away more rubbish than in poorer towns, and they have less time to recycle. Should we say that charging households for rubbish is a bad idea? Not really; free disposal is probably too cheap. But the effects of simple policies can be complex. Detailed economic models are often needed to understand them, and sometimes the results are not very pleasant."

Theodore Zeldin talks about how our work life could change. Do you feel respected and appreciated at work? Success in a job is not enough anymore. Many people feel that their work is not valued or understood. Even famous people can feel unhappy despite their success. Loving your job used to be enough to make you special, but now you need to think about how your job affects you as a person, your mind, character, and relationships. This question is very important. No matter how skilled you are, if your work makes you boring and unable to talk to others, then no amount of money or status can make up for that.
Zeldin wants to find ways to make work more fulfilling and meaningful for everyone, not just a way to make money. Work should help us live better lives, discover new talents, and meet different people. However, just trying to end unemployment is not enough. As more people get educated, they want jobs that are interesting and helpful.
Even jobs that used to be respected, like doctors and accountants, are not as appealing anymore. Doctors often feel more stressed than their patients, and accountants worry about their profession's ethics. Many architects do not get to use their creativity, and managers feel stuck in their own rules. A study shows that many middle managers are losing their confidence. At the same time, companies and organizations are getting smaller. Efforts to improve decision-making and rewards have not made employees feel more committed. In Britain, only 8% of workers feel that their values match those of their organizations.
Zeldin is studying different jobs to see how they affect people. He is looking at important topics like happiness, love, friendship, and respect. Now, he is focusing on finding better ways to earn a living. Many experts work to help companies make more money, but we also need to think about ourselves as people and who we want to spend our time with.
How many of us feel truly alive at work? How many of us feel like we are stuck in our jobs, unable to leave because of our qualifications and careers? For example, many hotel workers are very smart and lively, but they often have low pay and long hours. This is because the idea of what a hotel is has not changed much since the Ritz, which represents old-fashioned luxury. A hotel is not just a place to sleep; it is a place where people from all over the world meet, even if they do not talk to each other.
Many hotel staff are foreigners who want to learn a new language and culture, but they often have only simple interactions with guests. Hotels could be cultural centers that connect guests with the city and each other. Hotel owners could use the knowledge of their staff instead of just giving them basic tasks. If they listened to their staff's dreams, they would see that hotels could offer many more services. However, accountants often tell them to focus only on making money.
It is time to rethink what work means, not just from a financial point of view, but from a human one. For Zeldin, work is about relationships. Many people want more than just following orders; they want to design their own jobs and choose their colleagues and customers. This requires good communication skills, which are different from just talking. Real conversation creates a bond of respect and helps us understand each other better. This kind of conversation is important for equality. Every time we have a meaningful conversation, we change the world a little bit."
CPE_24,C2,"'BROADCASTING: The Social Shaping of a Technology'**
The word 'broadcasting' originally meant to spread seeds widely by hand. This idea is not just about farming; it also represents hope for growth and success. It suggests that with the right conditions, we can achieve a good outcome. The idea of broadcasting assumes that there are central resources available to help spread information.
We need to understand why a new technology that sends words and pictures electronically was organized in a way that fits this farming idea. Television, as a technology, is connected to other forms of communication like the telegraph and the telephone. However, from the beginning, it was seen as a central 'mass' medium. This means that it was designed to send information from one central place to many homes, which matched the social and economic structures of modern societies.
There were some attempts to create different ways of using television. For example, in the early 1930s, radio enthusiasts in Britain experimented with two-way television, which could have replaced regular telephones. Popular science magazines like Radio News published articles on how to build television equipment, and many people tried these experiments. However, in 1938, big companies agreed on standards for television that pushed these amateur efforts aside. This marked the end of a chance for television to develop as a more community-based form of communication.
Broadcasting was not only influenced by strong economic interests but also by the social structures of modern life. In the early 1930s, television in the USA was mainly used for public shows and was seen as competition for the film industry. Most people in Britain and Germany experienced television in public places rather than at home.
The idea of community-based or amateur television was unlikely to succeed. Instead, television systems that focused on public viewing were common in several countries during the 1930s. However, manufacturers saw a chance to sell television sets for homes, and as living standards improved, more people could afford entertainment at home. This trend is now happening worldwide.
There is a clear link between social changes and the way broadcasting is organized. As societies modernized, power and wealth became more concentrated, and traditional communities broke apart. People became more mobile, which made them feel more isolated compared to earlier, stable communities. Centralized broadcasting helped governments share important information with all citizens and created a sense of community within the nation.
While broadcasting has often been seen as a way to support democracy, it has also been shaped by the need for equal access to information for political and social participation. Television is changing, and there is a chance that the term broadcasting may become outdated. If that happens, it will only refer to a specific way of using audio-visual technology during a certain time of social change."
CPE_13,C2,"Clutter**
Sometimes, it feels like no matter how many things you own, you never feel secure. It is normal to want a home that meets your needs, but there comes a point when wanting more things becomes too much. Modern advertising is designed to make us feel insecure. One common message is that if you don’t have certain products, you are not as good as others. To see how much advertising affects you, try not to look at any billboards the next time you walk down the street. We are surrounded by advertisements on television, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, t-shirts, and the internet, all telling us to buy more.
**Caves**
Research teams and universities around the world have spent many years studying caves. They focus on where caves come from, how water moves in them, and the living things inside them. Caves are a small but interesting part of nature. They make us curious and encourage us to learn more, which is why many researchers study them. Because caves are natural features, they have been studied for a long time, especially in places where they affect our lives. However, visiting many caves requires physical skill, so cave research often involves both scientists and people who explore caves for fun.
**Weather Watch**
Many careful people, using only their senses, started the study of weather, known as meteorology, which has become a complex science since the 17th century. Today, satellites and electronic tools give us a lot of weather information quickly. Computers can solve complicated math problems much faster than humans. Meteorology uses many difficult words that are hard for non-professionals to understand. However, human experience is still very important for making weather forecasts. Observations made by people can provide valuable information that helps professionals understand the atmosphere better."
CPE_16,C2,"**MUSIC AND THEATRE**
Until recently, I believed that opera is mainly theatre. Now, I think differently. After working at a national opera house, I learned that opera is mostly about music, and theatre comes second. This is how it should be. However, I come from the world of theatre, where the words and the actors are the most important. In theatre, once the show starts, there is no one directing the action, and the performers and the audience usually speak the same language.
At any music performance, whether in a concert hall or an opera house, there are many people who, like me, do not have a lot of knowledge about music. Some may feel embarrassed about what they don’t know, while most are amazed by the talent of the performers. A great singer or a skilled musician is easy to admire. Even a good musician shows us the results of years of hard work. Watching top-class music is similar to watching an athletics match. We know athletes are doing something similar to what we do when we run for a bus, but we also see how much better they are.
Theatre audiences have different expectations. They often do not understand the skills of an actor and may not be impressed by a long and difficult speech. They usually ask, “How do you learn all those lines?” This does not mean that theatre audiences are less demanding than music audiences; many of them are the same people. It may mean that audiences and performers are more equal in theatre than in music, no matter how difficult the material is.
The question is, does music need to learn anything from theatre? I believe it does. I have seen how a different approach can change the experience for concert-goers. Live music is very theatrical, full of emotions, and can connect with the audience in a special way. However, the rules that still exist in music, like strict dress codes and showing too much respect to conductors and soloists, create a gap between performers and listeners that can feel uncomfortable.
On the other hand, when contemporary music audiences clap between movements or after a great performance, it can be a way to show appreciation, but it can also disrupt the flow of the music. Is there a solution? Yes, a lot is being done. Many projects are happening across the country to invite new audiences into concert halls and opera houses and to break down the barriers that make people feel that “serious” music is not for them.
I remember a special event, the community opera ""In Search of Angels,"" which took place in a cathedral and then moved into the town. It was an amazing musical experience where the skills of the musicians were very important, and it changed many audience members' lives. They were not just there to watch and listen; they also contributed directly.
What I wish for in music is a bit more of the excitement and boldness that the best theatre can show. Sometimes this can come from using unusual or challenging locations, which can surprise both performers and audiences. People may have to give up some comforts, like a good sound or warmth, but theatre audiences have learned to be brave and follow artists into unexpected places.
I know that most plays are performed in a traditional way, similar to concerts. However, I believe that something should change in how we experience music. I can only speak as a fan: I love theatre and spend as much time (and money) as I can enjoying music. I want both to succeed and for more people to enjoy the pleasure I get from being in the audience."
CPE_21,C2,"**Text:**
**Sand**  
I admire how sand can be changed into useful things like glass and concrete, but I do not like it when it is just sand. To me, it is mostly a problem that gets in the way between a parking lot and the sea. It blows in your face, gets into your food, and can hide important things like car keys and coins. When you are wet, it sticks to you and is hard to remove, even with a strong hose. But, strangely, when you step onto a beach towel, get into a car, or walk on a clean carpet, it falls off you easily. For days after, you find sand on the floor every time you take off your shoes, and even more when you take off your socks. Sand stays with you longer than many illnesses. So, I would rather not have sand around.
**Lock and Key**  
People have always wanted a safe home for privacy and security. The old way of using a rope to lock a door has changed to using electronic locks with plastic cards. But people still want to keep out the ""bad guys."" The idea of a lock and key is partly about feeling safe. Some companies have tried using smart cards to open electronic locks, but many people do not like them. You might accept them at work, but at home, everyone wants to turn a real key in a lock. Because of this, when a locksmith company made a new electronic lock, they included a real metal key.
**Modern Art**  
I was nervous about visiting the new Tate Modern gallery because, like many people, I do not understand modern art. I know I like some of it, especially furry things, neon light sculptures, and big photographs. Maybe if I knew more about it, I would have more opinions. But art is not just about understanding; it is about feeling something from it. This is a nice idea, but it has not worked for me before. However, this new gallery has tried to help visitors understand the art better. The first thing I noticed was the labels that explained the art and what it means. Instead of just looking at the pictures, these labels helped me understand them better."
CPE_46,C2,"**Every Picture Tells a Story**
**Adapting Novels for Film**
Turning a novel into a film often means cutting down the story. This can be frustrating for the writer, but it can also be helpful. While writing a script, I noticed that I could remove a lot of dialogue and descriptions from the book and still keep the main idea. This does not mean that the original words were unnecessary. It is about how each medium asks the audience to pay attention and how they repeat information. 
In a novel, repetition can help readers remember important character traits and who is speaking. Even though we can often guess who is talking from the dialogue, having tags like ""he said"" makes it easier to read. In stage plays, the dialogue often mimics real speech, sometimes using a lot of unnecessary words just to keep the conversation going, which can make it hard to understand the main message.
**Watching Movies**
When we watch movies, we can feel like we are part of the story. It takes us away from our everyday lives for the time the film lasts. However, once the movie ends and the lights come on, we return to reality. People often do not feel guilty about the time spent watching a film, and this feeling of unreality can make it hard to take movies seriously. Many people from older generations, including our teachers, did not see movies as art; they thought of them as just entertainment. 
**The Film Studios**
The Leiper Film Company studios were made up of many different buildings. The layout was confusing, with only a few recognizable places like the Script Department. Most of the rooms looked the same and were used for meetings. Finding a specific room was not easy. The studio had three main entrances, which made it even more confusing for visitors. There was no clear way to ask for help or get directions. However, most people who worked there knew how to get around. Thanks to their hard work, stories of romance and adventure could be shared with audiences. 
**Film-Makers**
Many people want to make movies. Bookstores have many guides on scriptwriting and film production. Universities offer courses, and there are competitions for aspiring filmmakers. For example, Robert Rodriguez made his film *El Mariachi* for just $7,000, which helped him become a well-known director. He wrote about how he felt pressure to succeed quickly, comparing himself to famous directors like Orson Welles and Steven Spielberg, who made their first big films at a young age.
In the past, filmmakers had to take their time to learn the craft. They often started as editors, writers, or cinematographers before directing their own films. For example, John Huston was 35 when he made *The Maltese Falcon*, and Fred Zinnemann was in his forties when he directed *High Noon*. Today, without the support of studios or television, new filmmakers often have to work independently."
CPE_3,C2,"
In the past, the council houses were all over the western side of the city. They were rows of small, old houses made of orange brick or pale white plaster. In summer, the smell from the May and Baker factory, which was two miles away, filled the air with a strong smell of sulphur. In the mornings, a common sight in that part of Norwich was a paperboy making a face as he walked up someone’s front path. I have forgotten most of my early life, but I remember sitting near an upstairs window and looking at the houses as they disappeared into the distance. 
I also have memories of my mother, who was ironing towels in a house that I don’t think was ours, and of snow falling on a big mansion at Earlham. My mother appears in my early memories because I remember her as a small, precise, and often angry woman. I never really understood why she was angry, so I couldn’t do anything to make her feel better. Even as a child, when I went with her to small shops or into the city, I noticed that she was very lonely. She felt alone even in a room full of people. 
My mother had strict rules that I didn’t understand. For example, we were not allowed to walk into our neighbors' gardens or disturb their rose bushes. We had to sit quietly in the dining room for long periods, with our hands folded, listening to the radio shows she liked. There were many rules like this. 
Over time, I remember other people in our lives. Even though my mother was lonely, she had some friends. There was Mrs. Buddery, who loved the Royal Family, Mrs. Winall, who hardly spoke, and Mrs. Laband, who was more lively but not always liked by the others. Looking back, I see that they were not very good company. They often talked about their bad legs, the cold weather, and their ungrateful children, which made me feel included in their complaints. 
I felt like a heavy weight, made up of the West Earlham houses, my mother, her friends, and the need to ""behave properly,"" was on my shoulders. I felt I had to grow up quickly and find a way to lift this weight. Growing up in West Earlham followed a clear pattern. Until you were five, you stayed at home and bothered your parents. I remember long, boring days when I played on a rug while my mother sat in an armchair. 
Then, after your fifth birthday, you went to Avenue Road infants school, which was half a mile away. Some lucky kids had mothers with old bikes that had child seats. I think my mother let me go with other children from the street. If I remember anything from those early years, it’s the summer holidays. During those days, I saw glimpses of the world outside West Earlham. There was an old man next to Mrs. Buddery who told stories about being in the Merchant Navy. Once, there was a charity fair at a house far away where a kind woman gave out lemonade and tried to get me interested in something called the League of Pity, which was a junior charity. But my mother dismissed it, saying the organizers just wanted money. 
My mother often talked about how people were only after money, and she had a very low opinion of politicians. If she thought about the House of Commons, she probably imagined it as a place where rich people opened letters full of money sent by gullible people. I might be exaggerating, and I might not see her good qualities, but my mother did not show much kindness. 
To be fair, my mother knew she was responsible for my education. Sometimes, she would take me on the bus to the Norwich Castle Museum. We would walk through rooms full of paintings by local artists. My mother didn’t completely dislike this, and she even started to have opinions about the art. I remember once she stopped in front of a painting of a Roman soldier and said, ""Well, I wouldn’t want to meet him on a dark night!"" This was one of the few times I remember her trying to make a joke.

CPE_10,C2,"Philadelphia Avenue**
I walked down Philadelphia Avenue on the odd-numbered side. The evening was getting darker, and the air was humid with a light drizzle that made my walk feel secretive. I knew this side of the street very well; our neighbors were the Matzes and the Pritchards, and there was Han Kieffer's grocery store. The Krings and the Pottses lived nearby, and they were my first friends, all girls. 
These houses were familiar to me, even if I didn’t know everyone’s name. I remembered the small channels in the cement that carried rain from the roofs to the sidewalk, which I would skate or scoot over. As the street went downhill, the houses seemed to get simpler: the porches were lower, and the front yards were smaller. 
Over the years, things changed: wooden porch railings were replaced with iron ones that looked a bit Southern or Spanish. In Shillington, some houses I remembered as homes became stores, and strangely, some stores, like Pep Conrad's and Han Kieffer's, became homes again. I wondered how the people used those spaces and how they lived with the smells of the products.
**Bachelor Fads Furniture Designer Rick Gilbert**
Rick Gilbert lives in a flat that used to be a curtain warehouse. It has the typical features of a loft, like exposed brick and big doors where curtains were once lifted from trains. But Gilbert did not want a completely open space. He said it was hard to relax or work when everything was in view. 
To create a separate area near the entrance, he used a large piece of corrugated plastic. This helped hide his office, made a hallway, and led to the kitchen in the middle of the flat. He wanted the kitchen to be a neutral space where he could cook for friends or make coffee for clients. 
To balance the modern look of his plastic screen and stainless steel kitchen, Gilbert chose light wood for the floors. His flat has futuristic chairs and sofas, but it also has sentimental furniture from his parents or things he bought at markets.
**Bruce Chatwin**
Bruce Chatwin lived a very romantic and wandering life, which has puzzled many people. His life and writing were full of secrets and some lies, but he was a brilliant and unique writer. His first book, *In Patagonia*, published in 1977, is a wonderful work of imagination. It is a travel book that changed travel writing, full of excitement and deep insights. 
Even in this book, Chatwin mixed facts with fiction. When he described people and events, he sometimes changed the truth to make a better story or to highlight what he wanted to say: that through travel, we can discover amazing histories that seem to be waiting for future explorers.
**Swimming**
During a warm summer rain, I ran across the lawn behind my house and jumped into the pool. As I swam, I kept my eyes just above the water. Each raindrop created a small splash that turned into bubbles. The best moments were when the rain got stronger, drowning out the birdsong, and steam rose from the water as if the pool was meeting the sky.
In the summer of 1996, while enjoying this rain, I thought about swimming across Britain. I wanted to follow the rain as it traveled to the sea, escaping the frustration of swimming back and forth in the pool like a tiger in a cage. 
Many of us live in a world where everything is labeled and explained. This makes our reality feel more like a visual experience. That’s why walking, cycling, and swimming are important. They help us reconnect with the wild and old parts of our world by getting off the main paths and discovering things for ourselves. A swimming journey would let me explore the mysterious parts of our world, like dark woods or high mountains."
CPE_67,C2,"'CRYING**
Charles Darwin thought that crying did not have a clear purpose in human evolution. However, he was likely wrong. Recently, scientists have shown that crying is important for social connections. Psychiatrist John Bowlby pointed out that crying helps create a bond between a mother and her child. Many people believe that tears, especially in children, show feelings of helplessness. 
It is harder to understand why adults cry. The sound of crying is less important than the way it looks. Crying may have helped early human groups build trust and connect with each other. People cry for many reasons. We might cry to show sympathy for someone who is suffering. Sometimes, we cry without meaning to, like when we hear beautiful music or moving speeches. We may also cry when watching a sad movie, and interestingly, this happens more often when we are with others than when we are alone. The social role of crying is clear, but research is still ongoing.'"
CPE_27,C2,"**The Heat is On**
We have all heard about global warming, but how much warmer will the Earth get, and how will it affect our lives? Most people know what global warming is, but few understand its effects. A warmer climate will likely change the weather in many parts of the world. Since the atmosphere is connected to everything on our planet, any climate changes will significantly impact plants, animals, water, and soil.
Humans have learned to use natural resources to help us grow food, build cities, and support billions of people. Any changes to these resources are serious. The challenge we face is understanding how the world will change and what is causing these changes. Over the last 100 years, human actions have increased the amount of certain gases in the atmosphere, which are linked to global temperature. These gases are likely affecting the global climate, but we do not fully understand how the climate system works.
We know that greenhouse gas levels have changed in line with global temperatures over the past 40,000 years, suggesting a strong connection between the two. Evidence shows that the Earth's surface has warmed by about 6°C in the last century. Most scientists believe this warming is not just a natural process but is partly due to human pollution.
A lot of research has been done to predict what will happen because of higher global temperatures. Scientists use computer programs called general circulation models (GCMs) to analyze how temperature, pressure, sunlight, and other factors interact to predict climate conditions. However, these models are not perfect and can be slow and expensive to use. We do not fully understand all the processes in the climate system, but we know it is complex.
Despite these challenges, most people agree that climate change will happen faster than we have seen before. Current predictions suggest that by the year 2100, the average global surface temperature could rise by 1°C to 3.5°C, sea levels could rise by 15 to 95 cm, and rainfall patterns will change. Scientists also expect more extreme weather events, like heatwaves, floods, and droughts, in some areas. These changes will likely impact the natural environment and human life.
Climate change can affect where ecosystems, like forests and grasslands, are located, the types of species in them, and their ability to provide resources we need. This includes food, water, and places to live. Some effects may be harmful, but not all changes will be negative. For example, in Australia, research shows that wheat production has increased due to warmer temperatures, which have reduced frost damage.
However, many predicted effects of climate change are concerning. Even small changes in climate can affect water availability, especially in dry areas. The Mediterranean region has already seen less rainfall in some areas. In southern Portugal, for example, rain is now falling more in autumn and winter, with less in spring.
Another issue is the melting of glaciers, which affects ice and can harm wildlife and human structures. The Arctic ice is at risk of melting completely, which could make shipping and oil exploration easier but also increase the risk of icebergs.
One of the most serious effects of global warming will be rising sea levels. Warmer water takes up more space, and melting ice adds to this. Since about half of the world's population lives near coastlines, rising sea levels could lead to severe flooding in cities like London, New York, and Tokyo. Many people could lose their homes and jobs, creating millions of environmental refugees. Small island nations could be especially hard hit, as they might completely disappear, causing devastating effects for their people and cultures, as well as for countries that would need to help those displaced."
CPE_66,C2,"Mission to Mars**
Wanted: a married couple, around middle age, for a 501-day trip to Mars. Applicants must be strong both physically and emotionally. This couple could be the first astronauts on Mars if Dennis Tito's plans to launch a spacecraft on January 5, 2018, succeed. The spacecraft will take the crew to about 160 km above Mars. It will use Mars' gravity to return to Earth without using extra fuel, which is very important. The 2018 date is set because the next time Mars and Earth will be in the right position for a launch is in 2031. 
It is a big challenge, but there is a race to create new technologies for this mission. If these technologies are ready in time, the spacecraft might succeed. Even if it does not leave Earth, the work done for this mission will help future space missions."
CPE_44,C2,"**AESTHETICS**
Sometimes, the existence of art makes it hard to understand art itself. This is because art is a physical object, like a building, book, painting, or statue, that exists outside of our personal experiences. People often think of art only as these objects, not as what they mean or how they affect us. 
When a piece of art becomes very famous or is considered a classic, it can be hard to see it in a new way. This fame can create rules and ideas that block fresh thoughts about the art. When we separate art from the people and experiences that created it, we lose its meaning. Art then seems to exist in its own world, away from everything else that humans do.
A key job for anyone writing about art is to connect these beautiful works with everyday life. Just like mountains are part of the earth, art is part of human experience. Those who study the earth, like geographers and geologists, show how mountains relate to the earth. Similarly, those who study art must also show how art connects to our daily lives.
To understand art better, we sometimes need to forget about the art itself and focus on ordinary experiences that we usually don’t think of as artistic. We can enjoy flowers without knowing much about plants, but to understand how they grow, we need to learn about soil, air, water, and sunlight. In the same way, to understand art, we should start with simple experiences that catch our attention and bring us joy.
Many people enjoy things like movies, jazz, and comic strips, but they don’t always see these as art. When people think of art as only what is found in museums, they miss out on the joy found in everyday experiences. Even those who disagree with the idea of art being only in museums often still separate art from daily life. The best appreciation of art happens when it is connected to the things we do every day."
CPE_22,C2,"Observing Lions**
Many people think that lions hunting for food are amazing to watch. In the fading light of sunset, a group of lions quietly comes out from the shadows and surrounds their unsuspecting prey. They seem to be perfect social animals, working together to achieve a common goal - getting their next meal. However, after many years of studying these animals in the wild, we have a different view. 
When we began our research in 1978, we wanted to find out why lions hunt together, raise their young, and scare off rivals with their loud roars. If we measure an animal's success by how many offspring survive, then working together does not always help. If one animal is too generous, its friends may benefit while it suffers. So, why do lions seem to ignore the rules of self-interest? We thought we would find the answer in two or three years. But lions are very good at doing nothing. 
It has taken many different research methods to learn about their behavior. Since wild lions can live up to 18 years, we are only now starting to understand the answers to our questions.
**Pop Music Review**
The release of Bedrock's third album was an important moment for a talented band that had struggled before. ""New Life"" started a movement that changed rock music in this country for the rest of the decade. Gone were the serious themes and heavy guitars of the past; instead, a lighter mix of catchy local styles came in. 
The album combined social observations and strong emotions with sounds from fairground organs and brass bands. Humor and irony were also present, and the singers did not hide their backgrounds. The album showed that Bedrock was skilled at collecting ideas and writing songs. They wrote about traditional English topics like sunbathing and Sunday afternoons. However, the album's true strength was in its deeper, sadder songs like ""So Low,"" which had a beautiful melody about weather, and ""To the Brink,"" a serious ballad. 
The beauty of ""New Life"" is its high quality - 16 tracks with no weak songs, which is impressive in an era of long CDs.
**Extract from an Autobiography**
As a child, I was always interested in stories about 'The Sibyl,' wise women who had great influence in the ancient world. At first, I only knew of one from a story my mother told me. An old woman from Cumae offered King Tarquin of Rome nine books for 300 gold pieces. He refused, so she burned three books and offered him six for the same price. When he refused again, she burned three more. He finally bought the last three for the full price. I understood that there was an important lesson in this story about sales and life.
I was often a lonely only child. I would ask to play with other kids, but they would say no. My mother told me to do something interesting so that the other children would want to join me. It worked, and it was a lesson I have never forgotten.
When I got the chance to write a travel book, I had to find something I wanted to learn about, something that mattered to me. I am not a keen traveler - at the first chance, I sent my editor a long list of places I did not want to visit. I am only interested in ruins because I prefer to travel through time in my mind.
**What Happens to Your Manuscript?**
When you send your manuscript, it will likely join a pile of other manuscripts waiting to be read - this is called the slush pile. Usually, a junior member of the editorial team (often under 18) or an experienced person who works part-time will look at it. Neither of them has much power, but they want to find something original. The junior member hopes to make a name for themselves, while the experienced person wants to keep their job.
If they think your novel is good, they will pass it to a senior editor. This editor will have to explain why they should accept your novel based on its quality and potential sales. They will also consider if you, as an author, seem like a good long-term choice. It is important to publishers that you are promotable, as a new novel needs all the help it can get. Because of this, publishers often like to meet potential authors before making an offer."
CPE_39,C2,"Advertising on Trial**
If you work for an advertising agency, the early 1990s may have been very hard for you. The recession was worse than expected, affecting many countries for thirty years. In Britain, in 1991, the economy shrank, interest rates were very high, and many people lost their jobs. More than half a million people were unemployed, and about 75,000 homes were taken back by banks. Every business was affected, especially the vehicle and building industries, which saw a 30% drop in work. Many people and companies suffered during this time.
Advertising workers were not the only ones losing their jobs, but those who kept their jobs felt a lot of pressure. They were expected to help their companies make money, and they felt their work was being closely watched by their bosses. At the same time, they had to do their jobs with smaller budgets. They were told that doing less could be better. However, the importance of marketing was growing. Companies started to realize they needed to create products that customers wanted, not just what was easy for them to make. 
In the last ten to fifteen years, many companies began to focus more on marketing. This change meant that marketing activities received more attention from management, and some brands started to be marketed properly. This increased the status of marketing workers, but it also added to their workload. Marketing was often seen as a solution to all problems, but about half of marketing budgets were spent on advertising. 
The 1980s were a good time for advertising, but the early 1990s brought the worst times for the industry in a long time. This was partly due to the bad economy, but there were also deeper changes happening. The recession made companies rethink their advertising budgets and question the value of advertising. Many companies wanted to know what they were getting for their money and what return they were seeing on their investment. Advertising was under more scrutiny than ever.
Client companies wanted better strategies, better targeting, better creativity, and better media placement. They wanted the best people from advertising agencies to work on their projects and to be motivated to create great work. While this situation is tough for advertising workers, it also means they face the same problems as their clients: how to do more with less.
Several factors made creating effective advertising difficult. Some were due to the recession, like worries about production costs and a reluctance to take risks, which are often necessary for good advertising. Other changes were happening regardless of the economy, such as demographic shifts, the growing power of retailers, changing consumer needs, the rise of sponsorship, and stricter advertising laws. Some companies also faced the challenge of advertising in other countries.
Because of the economic situation and these changes, advertising professionals had to think about the saying: ""Only half my advertising works. The trouble is I don't know which half."" Now, more than ever, there is pressure to make sure that advertising is effective. Unfortunately, help for those who want to improve their advertising is not easy to find. Companies and advertising agencies have been too busy dealing with these challenges to share their experiences. Those who have managed to succeed often want to keep their successful strategies private. 
As a result, while conferences and seminars may offer some useful information, the available books on advertising do not provide much help. Many of these books treat the advertising process with too much respect, suggesting that all advertising work is of high quality and great value, which is not true and does not help the employees responsible for the advertising."
CPE_18,C2,"**The Lure of the Kitchen**
When I was in university, I decided I wanted to be a chef. This was an unusual choice among my friends. Most people wanted different jobs. Cooking seemed like a hard and unattractive job. Chefs work long hours, face a lot of pressure, do simple tasks, and do not earn much money. However, these reasons did not stop me. I was unhappy at university. The work was difficult, and the social life felt closed and self-important. Being a chef seemed like a good escape from this. It promised a seriousness and honesty that I felt was missing in my college life.
My desire to cook was not just because I was unhappy as a student. It also came from a love for beautiful food. I first felt this when I had a meal at a famous restaurant in London. It was amazing. I still remember my first dish. After that meal, I wanted to kneel and thank the chef who made it. I felt happy for days. This experience made me want to learn the secrets of cooking. I changed my student life into a preparation for becoming a chef. My history degree felt unimportant, and I learned about cooking by reading cookbooks, visiting markets, and making special meals.
**Extract from a Novel**
The swimming instructor at my school was a tough man, small and strong, with tattoos on his arms. When I asked him to teach me how to dive, he told me to sit on the edge of the pool, put my hands above my head, and roll forward, pushing off with my feet. I practiced this until the hour was over. The next time, he had me stand up and dive off the edge. He was strict, and every time I came up from the water, he looked at me with disapproval: ""Don't look down, look up!"" ""Keep your legs straight."" ""Point your toes!"" 
The following week, I went up to the high diving board. It was fixed and bent slightly down at the front. It looked very high as I stood there, trying to gather my courage. Slowly, the noise around me faded, and I felt like I was in a quiet bubble. I waved my arms like I had been taught, tried to look up, and jumped into the air. For a moment, I felt like I was flying. When I hit the water, I fell awkwardly, and my legs were everywhere. The instructor looked at me with disappointment and shook his head. But even he could not take away my happiness. I thought, ""This is what they mean by 'free as a bird.'""
**The Traveller**
For those of us who value a comfortable bed, running water, and the chance to live until tomorrow, the idea of a traveller seems strange and fascinating. These are people who choose to take risks, like climbing dangerous mountains or sailing alone on small boats. They might eat insects if there is nothing else to eat and can live for months in uncertain conditions. It is easy to see them as odd or eccentric, like hermits or extreme sports enthusiasts. We know they exist, but their unusual world is far from our daily lives. We can ignore them and feel thankful for our own safe lives, where the biggest risk is crossing a busy street.
**SAILING**
Jonathan Raban is afraid of the sea, which is probably why he spends so much time on it. He does not say he is a world-class sailor, but he is skilled. He sails because, as a writer, he enjoys writing about his sailing experiences. Sailing gives him stories to tell. Raban's small boat has a device that tells sailors their exact location anywhere on Earth. While he likes this tool, he also believes that using a compass was a mistake. He thinks it changed how people relate to the sea. Since the compass was invented, sailors do not pay attention to the waves and the ocean as much. The sea, which used to be full of life, has become just a space to cross. Because of this, a sailor can let a machine steer the boat for long periods. This might be why Raban has time to observe the waves closely."
CPE_62,C2,"**Holiday Reading**
Summer gives us two great joys: escaping home and reading books. These joys are closely connected. Books can help us feel more at home in the world. We can relate our own experiences to those in great books written long ago or in faraway places. In the stories of others, we find our own thoughts and feelings. Authors can express what we feel but in a clearer way. What we feel shy or confused about is clearly described in their words, which is even more surprising if the author is from a different time or place. We feel thankful to these authors for helping us understand ourselves better.
Through reading and traveling, we can break free from our daily routines. Our eyes are most open during the first few days in a new place, just like when we read a great book. A good book can show us things we might have ignored before. Our minds become more aware of the details around us, like the colors of the sky, the expressions on people's faces, or feelings we didn’t know we had.
**Author's Note**
These reflections on travel were published as articles in the Observer newspaper over seven years. I have made some small changes to fit the articles better, but not much else. I corrected a few mistakes, but only minor details. If I were to rewrite some parts, I would have to change the original meaning. For example, in my article about China, I thought the Hong Kong dollar would stay strong, but it fell a year later. If I changed my writing to include this fact, it would no longer be a report of what I thought at that time. Like any traveler, I was there, not knowing what would happen next, just trying to understand what I had experienced.
**Ecotourism**
If there were awards for tourism phrases that have been misused, ""ecotourism"" would win first prize. This term started in the early 1980s when people became more aware of the environment. Tour operators realized that many travelers wanted to make sure their trips would not harm the places they visited. The term quickly became popular. Now, ""ecotourism"" can mean anything from living with remote tribes for two weeks to a short boat trip through an Australian gorge. Any tour that includes cultural experiences, beautiful nature, wildlife, or a bit of adventure is likely to be called ecotourism. While the original idea was to help travelers make better choices, the lack of clear rules has left many confused about what ecotourism really means.
**Transylvanian Journey**
I lost my notebook about my journey in Transylvania for 50 years, but I found it again a few years ago. It has helped me remember that time, but it was not always perfect. In Transylvania, I had a much easier time than I expected, staying in friendly country houses for weeks. When I stayed in one place for a long time, I stopped writing because I thought there was nothing to record. I was slow to start writing again when I moved on, and sometimes I only wrote short notes instead of full stories. I worried that some details might be out of order when I started writing this book, so I added many warnings. But then I realized that these pages were not meant to be a guidebook, so I let the story flow without too many worries."
CPE_49,C2,"Fashion**
Fashion is often thought of as a new idea that started with capitalism in the 19th and 20th centuries. However, many fashion historians say that fashion, in terms of style and design, has a long history. They often begin their studies with the growth of trade in the 16th and 17th centuries. As societies have become more complex, populations have grown, and new technologies for making different types of clothing have been created, the meanings of clothing have also become more complex. Because of this, it is hard to say what any piece of clothing really means today. For example, a man's suit, which seems to be very uniform, can mean different things in different situations and to different people.
**Writer**
Reports in newspapers about publishers fighting over young writers' books can give a false idea of what life is like for most novelists. In my part of the business, where I am not on the best-seller lists, there are two ways to make a living. The smartest writers work in the evenings and have other full-time jobs that will still be there even if their book is not quickly published or made into a movie. Others, like me, do different writing jobs, teaching, workshops, and articles to get by. I have heard of a writing job at a chocolate factory, but I have never found anything like that. Somehow, by balancing part-time jobs and using credit cards, and often thanks to the help of people mentioned in the Acknowledgements, I manage to write my novel.
**Sudden Fame**
The small places we were performing in around the country were starting to sell out, and we needed extra security to control the growing number of excited fans. We had to use secret entrances to the village halls and ballrooms to avoid being overwhelmed by fans. On the few nights we were not working, it was hard to leave the house without being followed by fans. In just a few days, we became celebrities. Our fans watched our every move, and our management took care of all our needs. Even though I still felt shy, I also felt a strange confidence that only shy people who suddenly become famous can understand. In short, I felt completely out of my comfort zone."
CPE_31,C2,"Music - The Challenge Ahead**
Technology is changing our lives at work, home, and during our free time. Susan Hallam talks about how this affects music in Britain. In the late 20th century, there were many new ways to listen to music, like radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, and videos. However, there has been a decrease in live music performances and full-time jobs for professional musicians. 
It is clear that more people will continue to have access to music because it meets many human needs. Music is important for national events and for personal activities, both formal and informal. A society without music is hard to imagine. The question is not if there will be music in the 21st century, but what kind of music it will be and if people will still want to learn to play instruments. I believe that people will still want to learn. 
The music industry is a major source of income in Britain, and musical skills will remain important for many jobs, especially in media. There is also evidence that playing an instrument can help develop skills in young people. Research in the USA shows that listening to or making music can improve spatial reasoning, which is a part of intelligence. While these results need more study, other research in Europe suggests that group music lessons can improve social skills and concentration in children, especially those with behavioral issues.
Current research is looking into how playing an instrument can help develop useful skills. For example, regular practice can help students develop good study habits and focus. Playing in concerts can teach punctuality and organization. Because of these reasons, there will likely be a continued demand for music lessons in the near future.
What about the future? Will there be changes, and if so, what will they be? I think there are two likely possibilities. First, the types of music people listen to will become more varied, with new styles mixing together. Second, technology will be used more in creating and performing music. This will make it easier for more people to compose music, but it may also reduce the need for live performances and musicians.
At the same time, more people of all ages will want to participate in making music. These activities will likely be community-based and reflect the musical traditions of those communities. If we want this future to happen, the music profession needs to prepare. 
Music lessons will need to change to help more people learn different instruments throughout their lives. This will affect the music curriculum and how progress is measured, making it relevant for a wider audience. Musicians will need training to motivate and teach learners of all ages, work with diverse groups, and develop skills in communication, social interaction, and management for community work. 
This is a big change from traditional methods, and it will require accountability. However, this is a chance for everyone in music education to show the high quality of music teaching available. Finally, we need to raise awareness of the importance of music in our lives. Music is essential, but it is often taken for granted. Everyone in the music profession needs to work together to change this."
CPE_58,C2,"**The Actor's Craft**
Sometimes, people make fun of actors. This negative view often comes from the actors themselves when they talk about their work in interviews. Instead of explaining their art, they often use boring phrases or get caught up in gossip. Paul Scofield, a famous actor, once wrote to a friend that an actor's work is only interesting when they perform. He believed that talking about acting makes it feel less real. Each time an actor performs, they start fresh, learning about their character and the story. After a play ends, they feel empty until the next performance. This emptiness shows when people discuss acting.
**A Review of Hamlet**
Adrian Lester plays Hamlet in a way that shows he is between being a boy and a man. His performance is simple but very strong. He controls his body and emotions well, showing both anger and humor, making his character both tough and lovable. Even though he seems calm, his talent shines through. You can see how he holds his body, waiting to act. Another actor, Handy, plays Horatio in a way that also shows a strong inner feeling.
**What is Acting?**
What does it mean to act? Is acting just copying real behavior, or is it something deeper? This question is important in the world of theatre.
**One Director's Approach to Rehearsal**
This director has a special way of starting rehearsals called ""dropping in."" The stage manager shows the script on a screen. While one person speaks, the other actors listen quietly. When it’s their turn, they look at the screen, think about the words, and find the right moment to speak. For example, if the line is, ""Queuing all night, the rain, do you remember?"" they take a breath and let the memory come to them. They might picture a queue at a bus stop or a concert. The director encourages actors to be open and trust that something will happen when they perform.
**The Perfect Theatre**
A perfect theatre makes you feel important as an audience member. Going to the theatre should feel special, and the staff should understand this too. It feels strange if the workers act like it’s just a job. The theatre should connect the performers and the audience. People in the audience should be able to see and hear everything clearly. The size of the theatre is important; it should fit the human voice and body. If the theatre is too big, it feels wrong because drama is about people. Many theatres built in the late 1800s got this right by creating a space that feels welcoming. I like theatres that have a history, like old stone steps in a church, showing the presence of many people over time. When you go to the theatre, you want to see something surprising and new; otherwise, you might as well stay home."
CPE_37,C2,"Paul Simon**
Rock and roll in the 1950s was mainly for young people, but it also had a big effect on the middle class and older people. It opened the door for the next generation of rock stars, who listened to it and knew that this new and exciting music would be important in their lives. For Paul Simon and other young people in the US, the best way to hear this new music was through Alan Freed's radio show, Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party. Freed's show was very popular and important for many young rock stars. Like John Lennon, who was 3,000 miles away in Liverpool, listening to Radio Luxembourg, Paul Simon was captivated by the music from Freed's show. He was getting ready to make his own music instead of just listening to others.
**Snow**
I could not see a clear path, but I thought I would be okay if I was careful. The wind was strong, pushing me down as I slipped on the ice. Suddenly, the snow that looked safe gave way, and I fell into a hole about four feet deep. The snow had formed a roof over a gap between two rocks, and when it melted, it left only a thin layer that I fell through. I pulled myself out, feeling shaken and scared, and I wondered what I would have done if the hole had been thirty feet deep. I sat against a pine tree that was sticking out of the snow to think about what to do next. In an hour, I had only gone about half a mile. It was clear that I would have to change my plans.
**Qualitative Research**
There are many books that help researchers understand qualitative research. While there is a lot of information about collecting data, these books often do not explain how to analyze the data. There is still some mystery about how researchers study their data. Because of this, we asked different social scientists who have worked on qualitative projects to talk about their methods. The goal was to share their experiences and understanding of analyzing qualitative data, not to create a guidebook for new researchers. This task involves making unclear processes clearer. While this may seem easy, we found it to be quite difficult. We have allowed our contributors to share their work in different styles, including personal stories and more formal writing."
CPE_2,C2,"Screen Learning**
A few days ago, I saw my six-year-old son eating noodles in a funny way. He was pulling them up with his teeth and pretending to be fierce. ""I'm a little dinosaur,"" he said. He was acting out a scene from a recent TV show, so I asked him what he remembered about dinosaurs. He didn’t remember much. 
Many people are excited about learning through the internet and computers, but is this a good way to learn? One writer shared his experience with an interactive program he tried with his son. The father read the words while the son played with the pictures. The father thought that if his son had spent ten minutes reading a book, he might have learned something. 
Research shows that learning happens best in an environment where there is conversation with teachers or parents. It needs to be guided. Using new technology to teach our children is fine, but traditional education is still very important.
**Hollywood**
By 1918, most of the world’s film-making had moved to Hollywood. The local people did not like this change, seeing their neighborhood in Los Angeles affected by these newcomers. But in the end, they accepted it because of the American value of success. Success is measured by how much money a film makes. 
Hollywood knows a good film when it sees one. In less than a hundred years, Hollywood has changed from a small village to a town as famous as New York, Rome, or Paris. A hundred years ago, you would walk through orange groves to get to the village store. 
However, in some ways, it is still a village, with a narrow view of the world. People in Hollywood mostly talk about films: how much money they have made, who is dating whom, and who is working on which project. Many successful people try to leave Hollywood to live elsewhere, but it is still the main place for anyone in show business.
**Photography**
Photography was created by artists in the 1800s as a new way to show their surroundings. They wanted a lasting record of what they saw. The new technology of light, lenses, and chemicals created images that were more real and detailed than what painters could make by hand. 
This upset many artists. They first liked the new images, but then they said photography could not be considered art. They believed that photography was too connected to reality and not a product of human creativity. 
Despite the critics, photographers knew they had found a new art form. They used photography like other artists use brushes and pencils to show their view of the world, nature, and people.
**Book Illustration**
In the time of black-and-white book illustrations, it was clear that every children's book needed illustrations. This also applied to many novels for older readers, which started to have fewer copies printed. 
Children's publishing was still active, but it was mostly low-budget, leading to many average works. However, the best artists always gave their best work. The black-and-white collection is a mix of both ordinary and amazing pieces, making it a great place for research or casual browsing. 
The best works will likely be shown to the public again, either through new editions of classic books or exhibitions of original illustrations. There are signs that after being ignored for a while, this is starting to happen, and we can see a revival of interest in this artistic period. In time, a creative publisher will likely create a series of classic children's book illustrations from this time, either by reprinting them or designing new editions using the original artwork."
CPE_68,C2,"Blogging: Sharing Your Life Online**
Some time ago, a website talked about the risks of sharing your location online. The website's message was clear: when you say, ""Hey, I'm at this place,"" you are also telling many people where you are, including some you might not want to meet. This shows that sharing everything online can have negative effects. 
The internet gives us many chances to share our lives with a large audience. We might think this will bring us wealth or fame, but we can also get lost in all the sharing. It can feel overwhelming. However, we should not lose hope. There is a path to follow, shown to us by early internet users who took risks. 
In the early days of the web, these pioneers explored the internet and learned about its dangers. They faced challenges like losing jobs and friends, long before social media existed. These early bloggers have valuable experiences that we can learn from. 
In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started sharing his life online. At that time, the web was mostly used by students and scientists. Hall saw a chance to share his personal story. He created a blog where he wrote about his life and shared photos. In January 1996, he began posting daily, and many people became interested in his adventures. Hall was open about everything; he would write about any topic. 
One day, visitors to his blog found that his homepage was gone, replaced by a video called Dark Night. In the video, Hall shared that he had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it, he was told to choose between his blog and his relationship. He felt that sharing his life online made people not trust him. The blog ended, but the problem of sharing online continues. 
Sharing online can be fun, but if you think it will make people want to be with you, you might be disappointed. In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a young woman in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job. One day, a colleague sent her blog link to the bosses at her company, including some she had made fun of, and she lost her job. 
Experts call this the ""online distribution effect,"" which means people often say things online that they would never say in person. However, our online lives are connected to our real lives. If we forget this, we can make serious mistakes. 
Armstrong's story had a happy ending. After being upset and taking a break from blogging, she got married and started a new blog about her family. Now, she is popular among ""mommy bloggers,"" and her writing helps support her family. She learned an important lesson: the internet lets us say anything, but that doesn’t mean we should."
CPE_23,C2,"Enough Sleep?**
Many people today feel tired all the time. In richer and busier countries, not getting enough sleep and feeling anxious have become common problems. Research in the USA shows that 40 million Americans have serious sleep issues. Some popular novels in Britain even have characters who cannot sleep or are set in sleep research labs. People are interested in sleep: how it works, why we need it, and the problems that come with not getting enough. A sleep researcher says, ""People need more sleep."" When people are busy, they often sleep less. They wake up early to avoid traffic.
Recently, a sleep researcher did an experiment. He let people sleep for up to 14 hours a night for a month. After three weeks, they found they needed about eight hours of sleep. This shows that they were catching up on sleep they missed.
In Europe, a university sleep research lab studies how tiredness affects people. They have looked at how tired sailors are, how airport noise affects sleep, and how tired drivers can be dangerous. They find volunteers by advertising in student newspapers. Volunteers are picked up by taxi, paid £5 an hour, and asked to change their sleeping habits.
Dr. Louise Reyner helps the volunteers feel comfortable. Some worry because they have electrodes on their heads, thinking the researchers can see their dreams. But the lab is more interested in how the body works. In a dark room, there is a driving simulator with a big screen. Volunteers come in the afternoon, when they usually feel sleepy, after not sleeping well. They drive while answering questions. The road ahead looks endless, and the sun is bright.
The young men say they will not fall asleep. Dr. Reyner has a video of one man trying hard to stay awake. At first, he sits up straight, but then he starts to blink more often and his head drops. Eventually, he falls asleep for a few seconds and wakes up suddenly. By the second or third time, the car goes off the road. Dr. Reyner says that drinking two cups of coffee can help someone stay awake for a while. She suggests energy drinks and caffeinated gum for people who work at night.
Scientists know that humans sleep in a daily cycle, like other mammals. When we sleep, we go through four stages, from light sleep to deep sleep. We usually dream during light sleep, and our brains stop our bodies from moving to keep us safe. Scientists think sleep helps repair our bodies and minds, but they are not completely sure. They do know that women sleep about half an hour longer than men, and older people need less sleep, but they don’t know why.
Some researchers say sleep helps us travel through time safely. People in the past had different sleep patterns. A history professor studied British life from 1500 to 1850 and found that people went to bed early, woke up after midnight, stayed awake for a while, and then went back to sleep. This time was used for thinking, remembering dreams, or even stealing. The poorest people benefited the most from this quiet time.
By the 17th century, with more artificial light, rich people started to sleep in a more efficient way. The industrial revolution later made everyone work longer hours in lighted buildings. However, in some non-western cultures, people still do not have strict bedtimes. They sleep for a few hours, wake up, and then go back to sleep. In some tribal societies, noises and the need to watch for danger make it hard to sleep continuously. It seems that people everywhere need more sleep."
CPE_60,C2,"
We are talking about big cowboy boots. I stood in my expensive designer cowboy boots on the rocks in the Arizona desert. I wore a full cowboy outfit, but I was not a cowboy. I looked into the morning sun at the Arizona mountains and realized I did not belong there. I flew in from Denver early in the morning, thinking I might look like a cowboy. But that thought went away when I saw a real cowboy at the Phoenix airport. He was wearing a dirty shirt and carrying a bag. When he saw my new cowboy boots, he raised an eyebrow and left without saying anything.
I thought there should be clothes for an ex-racing driver that would make me feel normal. I loved being a racing driver and driving fast cars. But I don’t do that anymore. I can’t even if I wanted to. I wondered what I should do now. A racing driver should have other jobs ready for when he stops racing. I thought I had some ideas, but they didn’t work out.
One idea was to be a commentator at races, but there were many former drivers wanting that job. Another idea was to sell classic cars, but that didn’t work either because nobody was buying them. So, I decided to stop trying before I lost everything. Being an ""ex"" at anything is hard. Who wants to hear about how I almost became the World Champion? Nobody wants to hear a story that ends with ""almost."" Even if I had been the champion, people would only listen for a short time before getting bored. 
I don’t want sympathy, and I don’t get any. I had a good career, made money, and saved some. But I miss the excitement of driving a powerful racing car. I miss going very fast and the thrill of racing. I also miss the attention from fans and reporters who cared about what I said. Being somewhat famous had its perks. Businessmen and politicians liked to say they knew me, and kids would ask for my autograph.
Now that I don’t race anymore, I have a lot of free time. Just last week, my phone rang twice, but I have so much empty time. I looked up at the blue sky. There were no buzzards flying above. Maybe Arizona doesn’t have buzzards. But I saw some small brown birds in a cactus nearby, and they seemed to be telling me to leave their nest alone. I never thought the desert had songbirds. I realized that a fake cowboy in fancy boots still has a lot to learn."
CPE_1,C2,"Vancouver**
In the last ten years, many people from around the world have moved to Vancouver, in western Canada. In the evenings, residents walk around the city, and if you join them, you will likely hear different languages. People come to Vancouver for its mild weather, beautiful location between the ocean and mountains, clean and safe environment, and good education and job opportunities. Some locals may complain about how quickly new buildings are being built, but it is clear that new residents and tourism have helped the city grow. Vancouver was once called 'Terminal City' because it was a gateway to other places. Although this name is not used as much now, Vancouver is still a gateway.
**Putting Pen to Paper**
Journalists like me are often not good at writing letters. Some say this is because we do not like to write for free, but I think it is more about how we try to make our writing very effective. In our work, we focus on getting the best results, so we lose the natural feeling of writing a letter. A true artist, who does not think too much about the effect of their words, does not have this problem. I believe that understanding the impact of words is a sign of a real artist. When Shakespeare wrote his famous lines, he probably did not think about how the sound of the words made them powerful.
**Supermarket Opening**
Opening a new supermarket used to be a big event in Britain. A soap star, a DJ, or a member of the royal family would usually come to cut the ribbon. Now, new supermarkets seem to open every day, so famous people are not needed anymore. Last week, people waiting to enter the new Superbuy store did not care who opened it, as long as they were at the front of the line. According to someone who knew an employee, the first five men to enter would get a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women would receive a bunch of flowers. This news spread quickly among the crowd, making those at the front feel proud and those who arrived late feel jealous."
CPE_53,C2,"Citizen Kane**
When the film *Citizen Kane* was released in 1941, there was a lot of excitement about it. However, it did not do well at the box office. The film became popular again later because of television. It is one of the most important films that has inspired many people to become filmmakers. This is surprising because it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles believed that the film was successful because he did not know the rules of filmmaking; he just made the film the way he wanted. He also had a great team, including cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and special-effects expert Linwood Dunn. When Welles and Mankiewicz decided to create a story about a newspaper owner who was similar to William Randolph Hearst, Welles knew he had a great opportunity to show his skills as both a director and an actor.
**Dermot and Carmel**
That morning, Dermot thought Carmel was acting a bit strange. He had mentioned twice that he might be late and that he might stop at the golf club on his way home. He wanted to talk to someone, and the golf club was a good place for that. Carmel had nodded her head as if she did not really hear him. ""Will you be okay? What are you going to do today?"" he asked. She smiled and said, ""It's funny you ask. I was just thinking that I have nothing to do today, so I will walk downtown and look at the shops. I feel like it would be a waste to just relax all day."" Dermot smiled back and said, ""You deserve to enjoy your day. And if I am late, I won’t need any food, so don’t worry about it."" ""That's fine,"" she replied.
**Title Race**
""Tea boy? Do you mind? I am a mobile lukewarm beverage resource facilitator."" 
Human nature can be very funny. A recent study showed that job titles can cause jealousy and problems at work. A survey by a well-known recruitment company found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees believe that job titles create divisions among coworkers. Most surprisingly, the survey revealed that 70% of office workers would give up a pay raise for a more ""motivational"" or ""professional"" job title. If our desire for better titles is so strong that it overcomes our need for money, we have a serious problem. In the early twenty-first century, no one wants to be called ""subordinate."" The job titles being discussed focus on skills (like specialist or coordinator), but they are really just fancy words."
CPE_55,C2,"**The Vienna Assignment**
I was in Vienna to take photographs. This was usually the reason I traveled. Photography was not just my job; it was a big part of my life. I loved how light fell on different surfaces and how one picture could capture a moment in time, a city, or a person. I always hoped to take the perfect photograph. As long as I had film in my camera, I could keep trying. I had a simple rule: finish one roll of film, load another, and keep looking for new pictures. 
Once, I took a photo of a smoke plume from a burning oil well that became very popular. It was a lucky moment, but they say you create your own luck, both good and bad. After that, I decided to work freelance, which I thought was a smart choice. However, life had other plans, and things didn’t go as well as I had hoped. The mid-nineties were not as successful as I expected, especially after my photo was on the cover of Time magazine. That’s why I found myself in Vienna instead of somewhere more exciting. But I was still taking photographs, and I was getting paid for it, which I thought was good.
The assignment came about by chance. I had taken photos in London for a picture book called *Four Cities in Four Seasons* that featured London, Paris, Rome, and Vienna. I had received a nice payment for my work in London during all four seasons. I had my own style, capturing the beauty of flowers in Hyde Park and the busy streets of Piccadilly. I knew that some of my best work would not be used because it was just a picture book, not something meant to change people’s views.
After I submitted my winter photos of London, I learned that the Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, had left his job in Vienna for reasons I didn’t need to know. Instead of hiring someone new, they offered me the job. The Austrian publishers liked my work, and I was available, while other photographers were not. I was happy to go because things at home were not good. A week in snowy Vienna sounded great to me.
They put me up at the Europa hotel in the old city. I had visited Vienna before with my wife, but it had been a busy and hot trip, and I hadn’t taken many photos. This time, being alone in cold January, I knew it would be different. As soon as I arrived and saw the beautiful light over the snowy roofs, I felt excited. I was ready to take great pictures.
On my first day, I didn’t take any photos. Instead, I rode the trams around the Ringstrasse, getting on and off to enjoy the city’s atmosphere. The weather was cold, like the grand buildings from the old empire. I hadn’t seen what Schussner had done in the other seasons, and I didn’t want to. This was going to be my Vienna, and I was ready to discover it.
A photograph captures a moment, but you have to wait for the right moment. So, I took my time and looked carefully. The next morning, I was out at dawn. The snow from the night before made Stephansplatz beautifully white and almost empty. I was unsure how to photograph the cathedral, which was very tall and wide. I realized I might have to focus on just part of it. In that weather, it could still be magical. 
Photography has always had a sense of magic. Even when you understand how it works, the mystery remains. Maybe that’s why what happened at Stephansplatz that morning didn’t surprise me in a strange way."
CPE_50,C2,"Kinetic Art**
Great news! The Hayward Gallery in London has changed into a wonderful place. This change is not because of a big, expensive show, but because of a unique look at a special type of art that many people have forgotten about. A new exhibition shows the history of kinetic art, which is art that involves movement, from the twentieth century. It shows that creating art that moves by itself or explores the idea of movement has been an important but often unnoticed part of art in the last 60 years. 
The exhibition includes a fantastic collection of paintings, drawings, documents, and films about kinetic art. Curator Guy Brett, who has studied this topic for many years, has put these works together without too much text. This allows visitors to enjoy the art and make their own discoveries without being distracted by explanations.
**David Hockney**
David Hockney's art attracts many people who might not usually care about art. Some like it because it shows real things and is easy to understand. Others enjoy the themes of relaxation and escape from daily life. Some people might even like Hockney because of his fun personality and clever words, which make him popular in the news. 
However, some critics think Hockney is not a great artist. They argue that he seems less important because he is so popular today. Hockney knows his own strengths and weaknesses and believes it is not fair to judge his work based on old ideas of greatness. He does not call himself a great artist and understands that only time will tell how important his art really is.
**Window-shopping - an Art Exhibition**
In recent years, I have seen many contemporary art exhibitions, some great and some not so good. What bothers me are shows that seem to push a specific idea, suggesting that all the artists share the same view. Sometimes this works, and we learn about new trends in art. But often, it feels forced or not genuine. 
As a curator, I wanted to create a show that was different. I worked with seven artists to take over a space in an empty warehouse. 'Window-shopping' was meant to be a collection of individual artworks that connected only because they were all art. For example, Sam Cole created knitted cats that chased each other on a toy train track. In contrast, Matthew Crawley filmed himself opening a video camera and breaking it, which created interesting images on a monitor. 
These artworks did not fit into a specific theme and would not usually be shown together, but I believe they complemented each other. I did not make big statements about contemporary art, but I think art is a personal activity where artists set their own rules.
**Art History**
People who love paintings sometimes hesitate to analyze them because they fear it will ruin their enjoyment. Some believe that art historians, who focus on theory instead of practice, ignore the joy of looking at art and the special act of creating it. This idea is similar to thinking that knowing how to cook a dish takes away from its taste. 
Understanding the importance of enjoying art does not mean we cannot learn more about it. In fact, knowing more can make the experience even better. Enjoyment is complex. How we feel about art is influenced by our senses and is also shaped by the society we live in. 
While it is important to appreciate our instinctive reactions to art, the idea that thinking about art takes away from enjoyment is an old belief. Art should be seen as something that can be both enjoyed and thought about."
CPE_25,C2,"Metals**  
People in the Stone Age may have become interested in metals because they wanted to decorate themselves. While sitting by a river and waiting for fish, one of our early ancestors might have found a shiny yellow stone and picked it up. This stone did not feel like regular stone, but it was beautiful. This could be how gold became important to early humans. Because gold is easy to shape, it quickly became a popular material. Copper may have also been found by chance, and when people realized how useful copper tools were, they began to look for copper ores and ways to extract the metal. This led to the development of metalworking, which helped improve the lives of our ancestors.
**St Ives**  
We were quiet as we carried our bags down the narrow, cobbled street that led to the town center. We bent down against the strong wind and tried to avoid the cold waves that crashed over the walkway. The streets were empty, and all the windows in the houses by the water were closed tightly against the storm. We had seen the weather get worse as we arrived in St Ives on a small train. As the dark clouds gathered, visiting Cornwall in the off-season without a car did not seem like a good idea anymore. I had convinced my friend to come with me by promising beautiful walks along the coast and cozy evenings by the fire.
**Computer Modelling**  
Studying the past is difficult because it is already gone. The people who lived in times of peace and those who faced wars and droughts are long gone. The reasons why they settled in certain places or formed families and communities are now forgotten. Archaeology gives us some clues, but we cannot test our ideas with experiments on past cultures. We cannot go back in time and see what happened. However, computer modeling allows us to recreate ancient landscapes and environments and fill them with virtual communities—digital people that have some of the needs and abilities of real humans. We can set rules for them and create social groups. Then we can change the weather or the population and see how these virtual cultures and their artificial people respond."
CPE_34,C2,"
**Vervet Monkeys**  
Cheney and Seyfarth studied vervet monkeys. One day, the dominant male monkey saw a strange male nearby in another group of trees. The stranger wanted to join their group. If he did, the current male might lose his position. To keep the stranger away, the dominant male made an alarm call that vervet monkeys use when they see a leopard. The stranger quickly ran back to the trees. This happened many times throughout the day. However, the dominant male made a mistake. After using the alarm call several times, he called out while walking across the open ground himself.
**What Cats Catch**  
In a small village in England called Felmersham, people collected what their cats caught. Over one year, seventy cats caught more than 1,000 animals. A professor in America calculated that this means cats in Britain could be killing 100 million birds and small mammals each year! However, this number is not realistic. Most cats live in towns and catch fewer animals than those in the village. The important question is whether these numbers are sustainable. The answer seems to be yes. In winter, many people feed birds, and gardens provide places for birds to nest. This helps keep the bird population higher than normal. The survey showed that cats are important predators, but they are not destroying Britain's bird population.
**Buffalo's Day**  
Buffaloes are very important to the marshmen, and they are treated with care. Every morning, the buffaloes leave their sleeping places, slowly moving towards the reed beds beyond the water. They often groan to each other about their tiredness. Finally, the leader steps forward and enters the water. Once in the water, the buffaloes seem to forget their purpose and relax. They move away from the house very slowly, and eventually, they are swimming, looking tired. They spend the day among the reeds, eating the green plants they can find.
**Picasso, Pablo**  
In 1940, Pablo Picasso painted several pictures of fish while he was in the fishing port of Royan. One painting shows a fishmonger’s table with a crab and some soles. Even though the fish are on the table, they look alive. The painting is not easy to understand because Picasso used a flat pattern with overlapping shapes. The light colors and soft brush strokes make it look calm, like an underwater scene. However, there is a sense of danger as the fish seem to be ready to fight the crab. The sharp shapes in the painting add to this feeling of tension."
CPE_12,C2,"Photography**
For the last 150 years, photography has been used to capture many parts of human life. In this short time, photography has improved in showing both big and small moments. It has given us images from faraway places, different parts of space, and the social issues of modern life. Photography is one of the most important ways to express what it means to be human.
However, the idea of recording events with images is much older. The first pictures were made about 35,000 years ago during the Upper Paleolithic period. We are not sure why early humans made cave paintings. They might have shown real hunting events, been used in rituals to help with hunting, served as religious symbols, or just been made to decorate their living spaces. Still, images have always been a part of human culture.
Throughout history, people have questioned how accurate images are and what place they have in society. The saying ""seeing is believing"" has given special importance to images. When photography was invented in the mid-1800s, it seemed to promise a true visual record of reality. The camera worked like the human eye and was thought to create images that looked very much like what we see. The chemical process used in photography allowed for the capture of natural scenes.
At the same time, photography was seen as a great achievement of culture, producing images that artists had worked hard to create. Because photography seemed so real, many believed that everyone could easily understand photographs. In 1933, photographer August Sander said that even the most isolated person could understand a photo of the sky, whether it showed the sun, moon, or stars.
However, as global communication grew in the late 20th century, we must ask how well photographs can cross cultural differences. Is photography limited by cultural rules like any other form of communication, such as language? Has our familiarity with photographs made us overlook the complex ways they show ""reality""?
Photography is often seen as a strong form of evidence, making it seem like a clear window into reality. It is common for someone to show a photograph and say, ""This is my grandson."" Since its invention in 1839, photography and how people view it have changed a lot. This change is partly because photography has moved from being a simple record-keeper to something that tells history. Photographs now often reveal more about the people and society that created them than about the subjects in the images.
I want to show that the camera is not just a silent recorder of events. Photography does not only reflect culture; it can also inspire social and political change. For example, it is hard to think about the cultural changes of the Italian Renaissance in the 15th century without recognizing how the development of perspective changed how people represented images. Similarly, photography has played a big role in creating the media culture we have today, while also showing the harsh realities of the world in our everyday lives."
CPE_26,C2,"**How to Write Poetry**
Telling people how to write poetry can be tricky. It is important to be creative, but making a mistake can lead to confusion. I do not want to act like I know everything, so I will say this: if you are just starting to write, the best advice is to read a lot, write a lot, and let your imagination flow in a way that feels right, as long as it is not complete chaos. Some people need a stable life to write poetry, while others can write to escape their problems. Some writers follow a schedule, while others wait for inspiration. All of these methods are valid, as long as they are not just following strict rules. Finding your own voice is important. Listen to your inner thoughts, nurture them, and let them grow. One day, your ideas will be strong enough to stand on their own.
**The Short Story**
In a short story, it is important not to have too many characters or long descriptions. Flashbacks should be brief and only used when necessary to explain something. A memory in the main character's mind can help move the story forward, but it should not slow down the action. Dialogue is very useful because it can show different sides of a situation quickly, without needing long explanations. Too many words can ruin a short story, but being brief does not mean it should be just a summary. The conflict and action in a short story should be as strong as in a novel, but every word must count in a smaller space.
**Screenplays**
Writing a screenplay for a film is similar to playing chess. Most chess players make mistakes as they play. We may not know everything, but we know enough to play. We can see a few moves ahead, and that is satisfying. As we learn more about chess, we realize that it is more about long-term strategy than short-term moves. We start to see the game as a whole, not just individual moves. We notice patterns in the game, which have names like openings, middle games, and end games. The more we play chess, the more we understand its complexities, just like in screenplay writing.
**Looking at Writing**
Humans naturally want to speak, as we see in young children. However, no child is born knowing how to bake, brew, or write. Charles Darwin said that language is a natural human instinct, but writing is not. Language exists in all societies, both now and in the past. Languages change, but they do not get better; modern English is not an improvement over Old English. All healthy children learn to speak without lessons. When children are together without a common language, they create their own. In contrast, writing systems have been created only a few times in history and started as simple codes that improved over time. Until recently, many children did not learn to read or write, and even today, some struggle. A group of children is unlikely to invent an alphabet, just as they would not invent a car engine. Children are naturally good at sounds, but learning to read and write is something that takes time and effort. We need to understand how writing works and how children learn, so we can help them connect the two."
CPE_8,C2,"""I have never started a novel with so much doubt. If I call it a novel, it is only because I do not know what else to call it. I have a small story to tell, and I do not end with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave my reader wondering. This book is about my memories of a man I met only a few times, and I do not know much about what happened to him in between. I could make up stories to fill in the gaps and make my writing clearer, but I do not want to do that. I just want to write what I know. To avoid embarrassing people who are still alive, I have given the characters in this story names I made up, and I have taken care to make sure no one can recognize them. The man I am writing about is not famous. He may never be famous. When his life ends, he might leave no more trace on earth than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the water. If my book is read, it will be read for its own interest. But maybe the way he lives and his special character will influence others, so that long after he is gone, people will realize he was a remarkable person. Then it will be clear who I am writing about, and those who want to know a little about his early life may find something useful in my book. I think my book, with its limits, will be a helpful source of information for my friend's biographers. I do not claim that the conversations I wrote down are exact. I never took notes of what was said, but I remember well what matters to me. Although I have put these conversations in my own words, I believe they represent what was said. I mentioned earlier that I have invented nothing, but I have taken the same freedom that historians take to create speeches for characters that I did not hear. I did this to make the scenes more lively and real, as they would not be as effective if I just told them plainly. I want to be read, and I think I am right to do what I can to make my book interesting. The smart reader will see where I have used this technique and can choose to ignore it. Another reason I started this work with worry is that the people I write about are from a different culture. It is hard to know people, and I do not think you can really know anyone except your own countrymen. People are not just themselves; they are also shaped by where they were born, the places they grew up, the games they played, the food they ate, the schools they went to, the sports they liked, and the poets they read. All these things make them who they are, and you cannot learn them just by hearing about them; you can only know them if you have lived them. You can only know if you are them. Because you cannot truly know people from another country except by watching them, it is hard to make them believable in a book. I have never tried to write about anyone but my own countrymen, and if I have done so in short stories, it is because you can treat characters more simply there. You give the reader general ideas and let them fill in the details. In this book, I do not claim that my characters see themselves as they really are; they are seen, like my main character, through my own eyes."""
CPE_4,C2,"**POETRY RECITALS**
At any time in history, the world of literature can seem confusing to those living in it. However, later generations can see clear patterns and important writers more easily. Right now, there are many different styles of poetry, and many ways to write, present, and teach it. There are also different opinions about what a poet's role in society should be.
In general, the current discussion in poetry is about the distrust between serious 'literary' poets, who write poems meant to be read on the page, and 'popular' poets, who prefer to perform their poems for an audience. This division is not strict. Over the last twenty years, public poetry readings have become more common in many forms. Small literary groups in towns hold readings in village halls or members' homes. Schools and colleges invite poets to read and talk to students. Arts festivals often include poetry readings by well-known poets.
These events have many effects, and it is unclear how they benefit the poets. For 'pop' poets, who write their work to be performed live, public readings are very helpful. Their poems are usually simple and can be understood quickly. However, when these poems are read on the page, their weaknesses in thought and creativity can be seen.
On the other hand, poets who are serious about their craft try to create deep and meaningful work. They want to express strong feelings and ideas in a small space and use various rhythms. These poets may not be appreciated by audiences who are hearing their work for the first time. The risk is that they might only read their easiest poems, which may not represent their best work.
Attending poetry readings cannot replace reading poetry from a book, but it can be enjoyable and helpful. Hearing good poets read their work, even if they are not great speakers, can show the audience how to understand the poems better. It is best if the audience has the text in front of them or knows the poems beforehand.
One main reason for popular poetry readings, sometimes mixed with music, is to help audiences enjoy poetry and see it as an art form for everyone, not just a select few."
CPE_30,C2,"**Oral History**  
Historians are increasingly using oral evidence, but this has some problems. It is not realistic to think that a person's story is a perfect reflection of the past. In an interview, both the interviewer and the informant influence each other. The historian chooses who to interview and what to ask about. Even if the historian only listens, their presence changes how the informant remembers and talks about the past. The final result is affected by the historian's social position and their understanding of history, which may influence the informant's answers. Historians must recognize their role in creating new evidence. The challenges continue even after the interview. The informant's memories are not always direct connections to the past. Their memories can be influenced by other sources, like the media, or by feelings of nostalgia or resentment about their childhood. The emotions and attitudes shared can make the testimony seem convincing, but they may come from later experiences rather than the time being discussed.
**Animal Science**  
There are two main ways to study animal science: the physiological approach and the whole animal approach. Physiologists focus on how the body works, including how nerves, muscles, and senses work together to create complex behaviors. Those who study the whole animal look at the behavior of animals in their natural state and the factors that influence it. Within this approach, there are psychologists and ethologists. Psychologists usually work in labs studying a few species, like rats and pigeons, while ethologists study animals in the wild and their natural behaviors. Although these two areas are different, they are starting to work together more. Physiologists often believe their methods are more important. However, understanding how nerve cells work does not replace the need to study behavior itself. Behavior has its own structure and must be studied in its own way. Trying to explain a bird's nest-building by only looking at nerve cells would be like trying to read a book with a microscope.
**The Social Sciences**  
Students studying social sciences for the first time face a challenge. They need to learn both the content of their new subject and the methods used to study it. This means they must understand not only the knowledge found in textbooks but also how that knowledge is gathered and organized. These two parts are closely connected. Since we all experience social life daily, we might think social sciences are just common sense. However, each social science goes beyond common sense. Each field focuses on a specific part of social life, uses different methods, and has its own concepts. These basic ideas form the foundation of the subject, allowing social scientists to understand more than everyday experiences and to differentiate between disciplines.
**Classical Architecture**  
In Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building structures. The Roman architect Vitruvius said that architecture includes Order, Arrangement, Proportion, Symmetry, Propriety, and Distribution. He also provided Greek terms for some of these ideas, likely based on earlier Greek writings that we no longer have. Utility and Function are not included in this definition, but Vitruvius does explain the best designs for different types of buildings later in his work. At the start, the focus is on the artistic side of architecture. The beginnings of classical architecture are complex. There was a long history of simple buildings, like huts, in Greece and Italy that did not meet Vitruvius' artistic standards. Although these early structures were not artistic, they contributed important elements that influenced later architectural designs. Despite how complex it may seem, a classical temple is essentially a simple, single-room hut."
CPE_7,C2,"The two sisters kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for a while. She would drive around the gardens and the railway, jumping over a small bridge with all four wheels in the air, which was Lily's only mistake. After that, they would pass the gasworks, which smelled bad. Chen was actually amused by what his wife was doing without him knowing. ""So you can really drive, Lily? Well done!"" he said. Mui thought men were strange. Her brother-in-law should have been upset, but he was excited and made plans with Lily for a trip. They decided to go on a Monday at the start of next month, which was the quietest day. They planned to leave early in the morning and come back by noon so they wouldn’t lose any customers. In the meantime, Lily would practice driving. Mui, wanting to support her sister, bought a road map and got a ten percent discount, which impressed Chen. However, Lily felt a bit insulted because she thought Mui didn’t trust her to find the way.
After an hour of driving, they were looking at the English Channel. Lily drove very well. Even Mui, who was in the back seat ready to give directions, had to agree. Lily even passed a couple of slow cars confidently, which made Chen clap his hands. After passing the gasworks and the lagoon with small boats, they drove smoothly along the empty seaside promenade. Lily parked in a small street near the sea that had many empty spaces. She wasn’t sure about the parking rules, so she decided to pay to avoid getting a ticket. 
Lily noticed her sister’s worried face in the mirror while driving. She thought it was better not to add to Mui's worries. Lily locked all the van doors carefully. ""Don’t worry,"" Chen joked. ""No one will want that old van."" The sisters were annoyed. Lily told her husband he was ungrateful, and Mui scolded him for being too quick to judge. Surprised, Chen took Man Kee, their son, to look at the sea. He held Man Kee close and thought about how he wanted to raise him. Chen wanted Man Kee to learn about numbers and grow up to own many restaurants, which was something Chen wished he had learned better.
As Chen looked at the sea, he felt a bit sad but also happy as he thought about Man Kee's future. He saw smoke on the horizon and then a ship shining in the sunlight. Chen put a coin in a telescope and tried to find the ship. At first, he couldn’t see it, but then he finally spotted it. It was a small, old, rusty ship. He lifted Man Kee to the telescope. ""Do you see the ship, Son?"" he asked gently. ""It’s a special ship for people like us. It may look small and old, but we know it will take us back home when we are done here. It will take you to your homeland, which you have never seen."" Chen kissed Man Kee's head. 
Lily and Mui were behind them. Lily put her arm around Chen's shoulders. ""The little old ship,"" Chen said. ""Let your mother see, Son."" Man Kee didn’t want to let go of the telescope, and when he finally did, the view was just a blurry circle of light. By the time Chen found another coin, the ship was gone over the horizon, and Lily could only see seagulls flying around."
CPE_43,C2,"**THE WELL**
I had read that if you go deep enough into a hole, you can see the stars on a clear day. I convinced you to help me with my idea. You watched with wide eyes as I pulled up the well bucket, steadied it on the wall, and then climbed in. I told you to let me down. I didn’t think about how heavy the bucket was or that you might not be strong enough to hold it. You held the handle, trying to help as I pushed the bucket off the side of the well. As soon as it was free, I fell down. You screamed and tried to stop the handle, but then you let it go. I fell into the well and hit my head. At that moment, I didn’t realize I had achieved part of my plan. I saw strange lights, like the stars I usually saw in cartoons when a character got hurt. At first, I was confused, then scared, then relieved, and finally angry at you for letting me fall. I was also worried about what Mother would say. 
You called down to ask if I was okay. I opened my mouth to shout, but then I heard panic in your voice, and I couldn’t speak. I lay still, just watching you through my half-closed eyes. You disappeared, calling for help. I waited a moment, then climbed back up and pulled myself over the edge, landing on the courtyard stones. I heard loud voices coming from the castle. I ran the other way, down to the passage leading to the moat bridge, and hid in the shadows. Mother and Father came with you and old Arthur; Mother was screaming and waving her hands. Father shouted for Arthur to pull on the winch handle. You stood back, looking pale and shocked. I was hidden in the shadows, feeling a strange excitement. 
Then I noticed the drops of dirty water I had left from the well to where I stood. I looked in horror at the dark spots on the dry stones. At my feet, the water had made a small pool. I looked back into the courtyard, where Father was shining a flashlight down into the well. The drops sparkled in the sunlight. I couldn’t believe no one had seen them. Mother was now screaming loudly, a sound I had never heard before. It shook me. What should I do? I had gotten back at you, but now things were more serious than I thought. What started as a fun prank was turning into something that would lead to punishment, probably for me. I regretted not thinking this through. 
Suddenly, I had an idea. I gathered my courage and left my hiding place, staggering out and blinking. I called out softly, then yelled louder when no one heard me. I stumbled a bit further and then fell dramatically on the stones. Sitting up, comforted by my crying mother, I said, “Phew” and “Oh dear,” and smiled bravely. I claimed that I had found a secret tunnel from the bottom of the well to the moat, and that I crawled and swam through it until I got out. I thought I was almost getting away with it until Father appeared in front of me. He made me repeat my story. I hesitated. His eyes narrowed. I said the secret passage had fallen in after me; it wouldn’t make sense to send someone down to look for it. I said the well was dangerous and that I had barely escaped with my life. 
When I looked into my father's eyes, it felt like looking into a dark tunnel with no light. It seemed like he was seeing me for the first time, and I realized how my lies would look to him as an adult. My words got stuck in my throat. “Don’t be ridiculous, boy,” he said, sounding more disappointed than I expected. He stood up and walked away. Arthur looked down at me, looking sad and worried. He seemed to understand that I was lying, and he felt sorry for me, not because I had a scary adventure, but because he worried about what kind of person I was becoming. His pity hurt me even more than my father’s words."
CPE_51,C2,"**REMOVAL DAY**
Susan, who is now a widow, is moving out of her family home because her children are grown up. She sees a van with the words 'Removers of Distinction' on it. The removal man, Fred, is carefully packing her belongings in boxes. He is big and strong, and his helpers are not as gentle. Susan is leaving a beautiful four-story house that looks over a small harbor. She remembers the years she spent there with her children, who have now grown up and left home. 
When they first bought the house, her son Robert, who was five at the time, asked, ""Mum, how do you get a house home?"" Now, Robert is helping her move, making sure she doesn’t forget about the piano. Francesca, her daughter, is also helping, and she is very particular about taking care of the piano, which is a Steinway.
Fred notices that Susan is not crying. He tells her that some people cry when they see their things being taken away. Susan can understand why. If she were alone, she would have told the movers about the piano before they started. But Robert insisted it was the movers' job to notice any problems. The piano is the last thing they will move, and it stands alone in the best room of the house.
Sitting on the bottom stair, Susan remembers the day they moved in. It feels like that day is happening in reverse. The piano was the first thing they brought in, but it got stuck on the stairs. The movers struggled for almost two hours to get it inside while little Robert watched, and Francesca cried, saying they couldn’t live without a piano. They had to find a way to get it in, and her late husband, Peter, solved the problem. They left the piano outside while they moved in the other furniture. The next day, a builder took out the first-floor window, and they used a crane to lift the piano inside. The children were so happy to see it.
However, it took a long time to afford to have the piano tuned after that. Peter had said, ""That's there forever."" But forever is a long time. The children are now too busy to visit often, and Susan finds it hard to move around the house. She thinks about the stairs and remembers that the banister rails were not put back perfectly. She wishes she had told the movers about it, but it is too late now.
Fred asks if she is okay. He tells her that the piano is the last thing to move. Susan feels nervous as she watches Robert and Francesca standing in the hallway. Fred casually asks if there are no tears. Susan feels like she might cry, but she is also overwhelmed by the memories of her things being moved. 
Just then, the piano appears at the top of the stairs, and Fred is guiding it down. He tells them to be careful. They bring it down smoothly and place it behind the removal van. Robert laughs first, and soon they are all laughing together, relieved that it is over. As they walk down the path for the last time, Susan realizes that the only tears she has are tears of laughter."
CPE_11,C2,"Online Literary Criticism for Everyone**
**Do-it-yourself literary criticism: Is it just harmless fun?**
From the beginning, one of the main ideas of the Internet was that it should be open to everyone. In theory, anyone could publish their thoughts or share music online. However, in the early years, some technical skills were needed. But there was one area that became available to many people: literary criticism. 
By visiting Amazon.com, the first popular online bookstore, anyone could try writing book reviews. Amazon allowed anyone to share their opinions about books and give them up to five stars. This seemed like a great idea. Each book had its own page, and when a reader wrote a new review, it appeared right away. This helped Amazon fill its pages with free reviews, and people looking to buy books could see what other readers thought, instead of just reading the publisher's description or professional critics' opinions. Other online bookstores also offered similar features, but Amazon was the biggest, with over 80% of the online market. This meant it had the most customers and the most reviews, but it also faced some problems.
Many reviews were submitted every day, and Amazon did not say how many. It was hard to check all of them. A team of editors looked at the reviews to make sure they followed the rules. For example, one-word reviews or personal attacks on authors were not allowed. Reviews that gave away the ending or mentioned other reviews were also not accepted. However, reviewers could remain anonymous, and bad reviews were only removed if Amazon's editors noticed them. This allowed for some mischief. For instance, authors could write positive reviews for their own books. One author, Lev Grossman, was upset by the bad reviews of his first novel, so he wrote some good reviews under a fake name to balance things out. His trick worked until he wrote an article about it, and then the fake reviews were taken down.
Authors could also comment on their own books by clicking a link that said, ""I am the Author, and I wish to comment on my book."" Most authors used this to share happy messages, hoping readers would buy and enjoy their books. Some even gave their email addresses for readers to contact them. However, Amazon did not check if these comments really came from the authors, except for famous writers. A lesser-known writer once pretended to be the famous author John Updike and wrote a comment saying he was a ""talented but over-hyped author."" This was quickly removed as it was found to be fake.
The real excitement came from readers, not writers. When James McElroy's book, *We've Got Spirit*, about a small-town cheerleading team, was published, it received good reviews from the press. But many people mentioned in the book felt hurt, and they used Amazon to express their anger. Many negative reviews were posted but disappeared a few days later. Despite this, Amazon thought it was good that so many people were writing and reading reviews.
Amazon wanted reviews to be a place to discuss books, not just a chat room. They paid special attention to bestselling books to make sure all reviews followed the rules. This meant that silly reviews were more likely to be found on pages for less popular books. For example, *The Story about Ping*, a classic children's book about a duck, inspired some funny reviews because ""ping"" is also a term used in technology. One long review compared the book's story to how the Internet works, saying it gave a ""good overview"" of basic networking ideas. However, most reviews were serious. 
Overall, the reviews on Amazon provided a good idea of whether a book was worth buying. The writer George Orwell once said that reviewing too many books made it hard to have real feelings about them. This is why making the review process open to everyone is a good thing."
CPE_14,C2,"Art in Modern Times**
In modern times, especially over the last two hundred years, we often think that every artist must go against the art of their time. Art is praised for being unique, new, and sometimes shocking. We feel good about admiring artists whose work was not appreciated in the past. However, when we look at art today, we often say that some artists have gone too far and that their work is not really art anymore. The media often shares this opinion, and many of us agree because we expect art to always be new and different. This makes us overlook the old themes and methods that are still present in today’s art. 
We expect artists to be different from us, with special talents that make them stand out. In the past, people would ask artists to create specific works of art for their everyday lives. Today, we leave artists to work on their own and sometimes get upset if they try to connect with us.
**Picture This**
I will describe a situation and then ask an important question. An artist picks a piece of text from an art book. The text talks about the many kinds of pictures and asks, ""What are they all about?"" It then says, ""There is no end to the different kinds of pictures."" This sounds simple, but stay with me. 
After choosing the text, the artist asks someone to prepare a canvas for him. He then asks a sign painter to write the text on the canvas in plain black letters, without making it fancy. The sign painter does this. My important question is: is the final product a painting?
**Underground Encounters**
At the Mercury Gallery in London until June 26, there is an unspoken rule for painters: once you find a successful style, you should stick to it. Collectors want artists to keep creating similar works, and if an artist tries something new, people often feel disappointed. I’m not sure why this happens. Gallery owners prefer safe choices, and maybe art buyers feel more comfortable with familiar styles. 
Some artists, like Picasso and Hockney, have successfully tried new things. Eric Rimmington is another artist who is now trying something different. His new show changes from the still lifes he is known for to paintings about the London Underground. Rimmington finds the railway fascinating. He started with drawings of Kings Cross Station in the 1980s and then decided to explore what happens underground. His exhibition, ""Underground Encounters,"" features 40 paintings and drawings that show the unique beauty of this hidden world.
**Extract from a Novel**
I have come to this island with a few books. I say ""escape"" because the villagers joke that only a sick person would choose such a remote place to live. I am here to heal myself. Besides an old woman who comes from the village to clean my house, I am alone. I feel neither happy nor sad; I am like a feather floating in memories. 
I talked about the uselessness of art but did not mention how it can comfort us. The comfort of my work as an artist is that in the quiet moments of painting or writing, I can change reality and show its true meaning. Our everyday actions often hide the deeper meaning of life. For artists, art allows us to deal with the pain and struggles of daily life, not to escape from them, but to fulfill our true potential through imagination. Otherwise, why should we hurt each other?"
CPE_63,C2,"**Family Business**
""Look here, it's no good!"" said my Dad. We were in the car on the way back to London. My father, with my brother Maurice with him, had just picked me up and my trunk from the fancy girls' school I attended. He had also just been to Parent's Day, where I received the Latin prize and the prize for the best end-of-school exams. He had a long talk with my headteacher, and now we were going home for the holidays.
""What isn't?"" I asked, though I had a feeling I knew what he was thinking because my father was unusually quiet. He usually talked a lot. ""You can't fool me. You'll do what you want now,"" he said. ""With all those certificates, I heard you will get a scholarship to Oxford.""
""So?"" I replied, trying to act tough. ""Mightn't that be useful?""
""I also heard,"" he continued, and I knew a serious talk was coming, ""that you want to be a barrister. A barrister of all things!"" My father knew a lot about barristers and the law.
""I just said that,"" I replied. ""I couldn't think of anything else to say!""
""And apparently,"" he went on, ""you have the right personality - you can understand a lot of information quickly, you are good at talking, and you enjoy performing.""
""I don't know about that,"" I said. ""All I know is what I see on television.""
""Be that as it may,"" he said, trying to stay calm, ""I feel like your heart is not in the family business. You will go to Oxford University, and after that, I can't see you wanting to join us.""
The problem was that, like many children in family businesses, I felt trapped by my family's expectations. I could see many job options for me, and I wanted to explore them. At the same time, I didn't want to upset my father. I wasn't as scared of him as Maurice was - I was the favorite - but I still found him intimidating.
""It's too soon to know,"" I said weakly.
""I tell you, you're not going to want to join us,"" said my father, who often turned out to be right about these things. ""It's a pity because you have the gifts - the brains, the nerves, the vision.""
""There's still Maurice,"" I said, feeling down. My father scoffed. We both knew Maurice hated the business.
""Anyway,"" I continued, ""you could always use me as a consultant."" My mother had died when I was young, and my father raised me and Maurice. Maurice was two years younger than me, and since he was motherless, I took care of him. It was not hard. I loved Maurice. Because the business was successful, we lived in luxury - a big house in London, nice schools, good clothes, parties, theaters, and operas. My father knew many people - politicians, actors, businessmen - and our house was always full of interesting conversations.
""I tell you what,"" my father said. ""You can help us during the holidays until you leave Oxford, and then if you decide to leave us, you can. It will give you some pocket money and help me a lot.""
""OK,"" I said, relieved to avoid making immediate choices and especially the sadness my father would feel if I disagreed with him. This was how he controlled us. So it happened. In my last term at school and during university vacations, I helped out, never more than twice a year, and always with the easier tasks. I became one of the smarter students, with a small house, a nice white car, designer clothes, and a black dress from Paris that I planned to wear for my final exams.
In my last term, my father came to see me and took me to a village for a meal and a chat. There were only a few weeks left. My tutor said I would get a First Class degree in Law, and I knew that if I focused and organized my thoughts, he might be right. I felt ready and confident. But then my father told me that he needed me to do one last important job for the family business, and he promised it would be worth my time.
""But Dad,"" I protested, ""I have my final exams coming up, and I need to focus on that. It's really important that I do well, and I don't want to think about anything else right now.""
I could tell that my father didn't understand the pressure I was under (or maybe he was jealous of my life away from him?), and he would see my refusal as a betrayal. As he explained the job, I saw more clearly than ever how focused and talented my father was. He had a special energy and control, and in his way, he was a genius. It made my own plans seem less important.
""All right,"" I said. ""I'll do it."""
CPE_56,C2,"
Simon Costello realized that buying the house in Pembroke Square was a mistake within a year of moving in with Lois. It was clear that they could not afford such an expensive home without being very careful with their money. At first, it seemed like a good idea. Simon had been winning many cases, and money was coming in regularly. Lois went back to her job at the advertising agency two months after having the twins and received a raise, bringing her salary to thirty-five thousand. Lois strongly wanted to move, and Simon did not argue much against her reasons: their flat was too small for a family, and they needed more space, a garden, and a separate room for an au pair. They could have found these things in a less expensive area of London, but Lois wanted more than just space. She felt that living in Mornington Mansions was not good enough for a rising barrister and a successful businesswoman. 
Lois decided that one of them should use public transport to save money, and it was clear that Simon would be the one to do this. His crowded tube ride became a time of frustration, where he thought about his problems. He remembered his grandfather's house in Hampstead, where he stayed as a boy, the smell of dinner, and how his grandmother took care of his grandfather after a long day at work. She was a supportive wife, always involved in legal causes and happy in her role. But that time was gone. Lois had made it clear before they married that her career was just as important as Simon's. This was a modern marriage, and they both needed their jobs to support their lifestyle. 
Now, their hard work could be ruined by Venetia, who seemed upset when she came to their office. Something had angered her, and Simon wished he had left his room earlier to avoid her. He remembered her angry words: ""I defended Brian Cartwright today. He told me that when you were his lawyer four years ago, you knew he bribed three jurors. You did nothing. Is that true?"" Simon quickly replied, ""He's lying. It isn't true."" But his denial sounded weak, even to him. He felt guilty and ashamed, remembering the fear of being punished by his headmaster. When he looked into Venetia's eyes, he saw her disbelief. 
He thought about what he should have said: ""Cartwright told me after the trial, but I didn't believe him. I still don't."" Instead, he had told a dangerous lie, and she knew it was a lie. He wondered why she was so angry and if she had the right to judge him. Was her own behavior always perfect? Did she have the right to ruin his career? He was not sure what she could do, but if people heard about this, it could end his career. 
**Questions:**
1. Why did Simon think buying the house was a mistake?
2. What job did Lois return to after having the twins?
3. What did Lois want that made her want to move from their flat?
4. How did Simon feel during his tube journey?
5. What did Venetia accuse Simon of regarding Brian Cartwright?
6. How did Simon respond to Venetia's accusations?
7. What did Simon wish he had said to Venetia instead of what he did say?
8. Why was Simon worried about Venetia's anger?"
CPE_36,C2,"'I chose this place to live because I thought I would be anonymous among people who did not care if the rented houses were old and falling apart, or if the gardens were messy and the furniture was broken. But I was wrong. People in the shops, who are living their real lives, soon start to recognize you. The beautiful roses from next door remind me that gardens were once loved. Usually, I stay inside to forget that summer is happening outside, but tonight, I am watching the swifts flying between the trees and roofs. I have cut back some plants to make space for a chair, and my arms are stinging from scratches. It is a small garden in London, where plants must grow tall or spread out to survive. 
""Been doing some clearing, I see,"" says my upstairs neighbor, Jaz, leaning out of her window. She is a writer, and I sometimes help her with her work as an English teacher. I have her latest manuscript with me now. ""How's the work going, Jaz?"" I ask. ""For goodness sake! In no other job do people ask you about your work so many times a day,"" she replies. Then she says, ""I have something to drink in the fridge. I'll bring it down."" I don’t want Jaz in the garden, and I realize it looks messy. The only way to the garden is through my flat, and Jaz is knocking on my door. 
""So, you're on holiday now, lucky you,"" she says, sitting in the chair while I drop a cushion onto what used to be a small lawn. ""Cheers,"" she says, thinking she is young. ""I should have gone into teaching - a writer doesn't have holidays. But you know what they say, those who can, do, and those who can't, teach."" And then there are those who can do neither. ""So, what are your plans for the holidays?"" All my worries about the end of the school year come back to me. Empty days. Hot pavements with sticky gum. The walk to the shops and back. The little park with its fountain, and loneliness sitting beside me on the bench. 
""Actually, I'm going to Stonebridge tomorrow. Can you feed the cats while I'm away?"" My heart races as I ask. ""Of course I will,"" Jaz says, knowing she will be around. ""Where will you stay? A nice bed and breakfast?"" ""No, I'll stay with my oldest friend, Ruby, at the Rising Sun. We've known each other since we were eight."" This isn’t true, but I often deal with fiction. ""Going back to your roots. What do you think of my work so far?"" My silence makes Jaz ask about her manuscript, The Cruelty of Red Vans, which I have not read much of. I like the title and tell her so. I can see how red vans could be cruel, always bringing gifts to other houses and returning her manuscripts in silly bags. 
Something makes me speak honestly for once. ""Let me give you a little tip,"" I say. ""What?"" she asks, surprised. ""Try writing about nice people for a change, people who want to be good: a little less self-centeredness, a bit more fiction..."" ""Teachers!"" Jaz replies, like a rebellious student. ""I keep a journal, where I write something good about each day."" My words sound a bit old-fashioned. ""Keep a journal! Nice people! Get a life, Ann."" Oh, I have a life. I have my work, and I go out sometimes and read on the tube. When we finally go inside, my calm kitchen gives me a moment of comfort, but suddenly I remember my old geography teacher, Miss Tarrantine, who was about my age now, winking at us and saying, ""I've had my moments."" We nearly died laughing.'"
CPE_6,C2,"**Heritage**
Heritage means the connection people and communities have with their past. We often feel connected to our personal heritage because we know about our grandparents and have heard stories about their lives. However, we also have a need to learn about our wider past to understand our future. Heritage helps us feel a sense of continuity, which gives us comfort about the past and helps us think about our future. Just like we inherit our genes, we also inherit a culture that has been passed down through generations. There may be parts of our national heritage that we do not like, but it is still a part of who we are, and it feels good to belong to something bigger. Heritage teaches us a lot and is important for our well-being. It influences our customs and material culture. In the past, we learned about our heritage through stories and legends from our ancestors. However, in modern society, many of these stories have been lost. Now, we can learn about our past through places and buildings. It is very important to protect and restore these links to honor our ancestors' identity.
**The Fens**
Some time ago, I started writing a novel called *Waterland*. I did not know then that the landscape of a place in England called the Fens would be very important in my story. After the book was published, people asked me why I, a Londoner with no personal connection to the Fens, chose to write about this area. The simple answer is that I found the Fens interesting because they seem flat and empty, which made them a good setting for my story. However, I learned that the Fens are not really flat or empty. They are very English but also strangely unique. It is surprising that there is a place in the middle of England that many people find foreign, especially since many other areas of Britain have become part of the national culture. The Fens are both empty and full, both farmed and wild, seemingly simple yet very mysterious. I have not visited places like Wisbech or Prickwillow, but as a fiction writer, I prefer to imagine rather than seek proof. This way of imagining the Fens is important because, as shown in Edward Storey's book, the Fens are not just a landscape but also a way of thinking.
**Museums**
Museums need to make their collections easy to access. In the past, this meant putting items in display cases with long labels that were hard to understand. Today, accessibility means more than that. Displays can be exciting and use creative techniques to attract visitors and create emotional responses. Museums should also reach out to the community. For example, some museums provide loan boxes of objects for teachers, and they have started to offer similar materials for elderly people with memory loss. Museums focus on real objects, not copies. They exist to help people connect with authentic items that have historical meaning. This is their strength and what makes them different from heritage centers, theme parks, books, and CDs. Museums that create engaging displays and outreach programs will find that their competition in ""virtual history"" can actually help them by increasing interest in real history.
**Architecture and Environment**
The desire to preserve things is not new, but changes in our towns happen quickly and affect many people. This can make some people very focused on preservation and encourage others to think more about the nature of towns today and their future. People who have lived through significant events, like world wars, may care more about preservation because stability is important to them. If there is a need for preservation, planners should consider it. Change is not a problem if we learn how to manage it. Changes in our towns reflect changes in society, such as population growth, welfare, and our needs."
CPE_33,C2,"Einstein**
If you stop anyone in the street and ask them to name a scientist, they will probably say Albert Einstein. His face is often used to sell products like computers and encyclopedias. Most people do not know much about what Einstein did, except that he created some complex theories called 'relativity'. These theories are famous for being hard to understand and for making strange predictions that do not match our everyday experiences. 
Einstein was part of a big change in scientific thinking, which started the modern science of the twentieth century. Physicists and mathematicians were trying to explain the universe better by studying how matter and natural forces relate to each other. Einstein made important contributions by looking closely at basic ideas: time, space, matter, and energy. Before him, scientists followed Isaac Newton's idea that stars and planets moved in a fixed space and time. Einstein changed this idea, saying that time and space are not fixed but are relative.
**Young Readers**
When we were children, Lydia and I did not trust any book that won a prize because we thought it would be boring. Our mother did not like our attitude, but our father would give us ten pence for each chapter we read to encourage us to read better books. He would also give us some special books as Christmas and birthday presents, marked with 'This Book is NOT Literature'. Although we thought most of his books were for boys, he did help us read some good short stories and, once, a famous collection of poems.
**Language**
Jacob Grimm wrote in 1851, ""The origin of human language is truly secret and wonderful."" This secret has led to many strange ideas. For example, Charles Caller said in 1928 that early humans might have made sounds like ""meuh"" when they felt danger. This sound is sad. The early human who walked in dangerous places made desperate noises, and some words today still remind us of those sounds, like ""malaria,"" which means ""fever,"" or the Latin word ""mors,"" which means ""death."" 
Many people avoided talking about how language started because they thought it was silly, but now, the origin and development of language are important areas of research. Language likely began in East Africa about 100,000 years ago. At first, speech was mainly used for friendly communication and was important in struggles for power. Sharing information was probably not the main purpose of language, which is different from what philosopher John Locke believed when he called language a 'great way' to share knowledge."
CPE_20,C2,"Writing Reviews**
Frank Kermode talks about how to write reviews from his own experience. Most reviews are written quickly and do not last long. They have deadlines and strict limits on how long they can be. Once published, they are usually only read for a short time – a day, a week, or maybe a month. Because of this, many people think that writing reviews is not very important. Some believe that writers only do it because they need money, while others think it is because they cannot spend all their time on a novel or a serious book.
However, writing reviews is a skilled job. It is different to write a short review of six or eight hundred words for a newspaper than to write a longer review of six or eight thousand words for an international journal. A review in a weekly magazine is usually about fifteen hundred words and has challenges from both short and long reviews. 
Reviewers must think about their audience. Some readers just want a quick summary, while others want a detailed analysis. Reviewers also need to know a lot about different topics and write in a way that is clear and enjoyable for smart readers. This means that most reviewers also write other things besides reviews.
The American writer John Updike, who does not think highly of criticism, still writes some reviews while he is writing his novels. He collects all his reviews, no matter how short, into books with modest titles. Some might think that less famous writers should accept that their reviews will not last long, but it is understandable if they want their work to be remembered, especially if they feel their best writing is in their reviews.
I feel this way about my own work. My main job has been in academics, and my serious books are mostly academic. In the English-speaking world, there is not a strong difference between reviewing and literary study, so it is common for the same people to do both. The time has passed when other academics criticized professors who wrote reviews for showing off or wasting time. Complaints from non-professors about professors taking their jobs are also less common now, partly because there are more reviews available, and partly because there is not much money in it.
I believe this situation is good for both readers and professors. Readers can trust that reviewers know what they are talking about, and it helps professors stay connected to the public. Professors sometimes use complicated language when talking to each other, but they need to communicate clearly with non-professors. Finally, it is clear that reviewing is a secondary job. You can only do it well if you are also doing something else well."
CPE_40,C2,"Ralph unlocked the door to his apartment. As he entered the dark, quiet hallway, he felt a brief sense of ownership that still surprised him after three years of living there. When he first bought the flat, he would come home excited and curious, wondering what had happened while he was away. The flat felt like a welcoming place, a space where he could focus without distractions. He thought he should worry about things like break-ins or leaks, but his flat always seemed to be waiting for him, looking either independent or neglected, depending on how tidy he had left it.
Over time, Ralph began to see the flat as a part of himself, a place where his thoughts and feelings spilled out. He grew frustrated that it couldn’t change. There were always a few letters by the door and the answering machine sometimes blinked with messages when he got home. He was thankful that his windows were intact and that nothing had been stolen, but he often wondered what the flat would look like if something bad happened.
From his small, dull office on the third floor, Ralph looked forward to his quiet evenings at home. After leaving the busy office and riding the bus home, he realized he didn’t want to be alone anymore, even though he often thought he did. At his desk, he longed for solitude and time to himself, but when he finally escaped, he felt empty. He suspected that his job, which he didn’t enjoy, was changing him and pulling him away from who he really was.
He would read or listen to music at night, but he started to wonder why he did these things. His thoughts became unclear, and he felt lost. He remembered a time when he felt more in control of his life. He had wanted to improve himself after university, but he found that he only wanted to get by. He applied for jobs he heard about from friends, following them as they moved forward in their careers, unable to see how he could find happiness in his work.
He went to one job interview, feeling grateful for the chance, but he didn’t think to question the job itself, which was a vague editorial position at a free local newspaper. After a pleasant conversation with Neil, his future boss, he didn’t consider how many more meetings he would have with him. Neil offered him the job right away, saying he was the only graduate who had applied, which Ralph took as a compliment at the time."
CPE_45,C2,"**Goat Racing**
I was about to see goat racing on Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. I was pushing my way through ice-cream vans, many people, food stalls, and loud music. Even though everyone was moving towards the racecourse, I tried to get through the crowds to find a good spot. An area was blocked off to create a course for the goats. It was not as fancy as other racecourses, but it was similar because people were standing on both sides of a stretch of ground where the goats would run. They were trying to keep a few special goats in order. This was not easy because goats are known to eat almost anything they find.
**Canoe Trip**
As the day ended, I started to worry about the night ahead. The canoe was too wet to sleep in, there was nowhere to stop, and we hadn’t seen any villages or huts since early morning. In the dim moonlight, we used our flashlight to see the cliffs, but the flashlight batteries were dying. We changed the batteries, but they didn’t work. We couldn’t find a place to camp. A few miles later, Lesley shouted that she saw a distant flickering light, and we felt hopeful. But the light was just the moonlight shining on the waves. Soon, we could hear the loud sound of fast-moving water, but we couldn’t see what was happening. Time seemed to stop as we continued on.
**How to be Presentation Perfect**
I am not good at making presentations, but as the managing director, I have to present more often to my colleagues and to important shareholders. How can I get better at presenting and feel more confident? You are not alone. Making a presentation requires different skills than running a company, but many leaders need to be good at it. If you want to convince your audience, you must believe in what you are saying. Show your belief with passion and enthusiasm during your presentation. This means you need to prepare well. Test your ideas beforehand. Ask your colleagues what difficult questions the audience might ask. You also need to create a positive atmosphere from the beginning. Start with something everyone can relate to and then gradually lead to the conclusion you want to reach."
CPE_64,C2,"
Some activities cannot be rushed. They take the time they need. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you are impatient with mayonnaise and add the oil too quickly, it will not turn out right. If you pull on a tangled fishing line in frustration, the knot will just get tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some things happen very quickly, while others take seconds, minutes, hours, days, or even years. Some tasks can be done faster, like solving crossword puzzles or doing math in your head. But other tasks cannot be rushed. If you try to hurry them, they may fail, like the mayonnaise or the fishing line.
Sometimes, saying ""Think fast; we need the results"" is not helpful. We learn, think, and understand in different ways, and these ways work at different speeds. There are three main speeds of thinking. The first is faster than thought. Some situations need a quick reaction. For example, when my motorbike skidded on a wet road, my body reacted quickly to keep me safe. This quick reaction is like our ""wits."" 
The second speed is thought itself. This is when we think carefully, weigh options, and solve problems. A mechanic figuring out why an engine won’t start, a scientist looking at an experiment, or a student working on an assignment are all using this kind of thinking. We often call this ""intellect."" People who are good at solving these problems are called ""bright"" or ""clever.""
The third speed is slower and more relaxed. In this mode, we think in a more playful or dreamy way. When we are daydreaming or just enjoying nature, we are in a different mental state than when we are planning something or writing a letter. This slower way of thinking is just as important as the faster ways. Taking time to think slowly is necessary, especially when life gets busy. 
Some everyday problems are better solved with a slow mind. Some mysteries can only be understood with a relaxed attitude. Recent studies show that slower thinking is good for understanding complex situations. Fast thinking works well for simple problems. For example, deciding where to go on holiday is usually straightforward. But when we are unsure about what to consider or when the issue is complicated, we need to use our slow thinking. 
If the problem is how to manage a difficult group at work or whether to change jobs, it might be better to sit and think rather than rush for answers. This type of thinking is linked to creativity and wisdom. Poets and philosophers have long understood the limits of fast thinking and have tried to develop slower ways of knowing. Recently, scientists have started to study these slower ways of thinking. They have found that the unconscious mind can do many interesting and important tasks if given enough time. It can learn patterns that our conscious mind might miss and understand complex situations better than quick thinking can."
CPE_29,C2,"Surviving in a Foreign Land**
I have been welcomed warmly. It is a friendly and well-equipped base camp in a very isolated place. At any time, there are about forty people here - scientists, students, weather experts, and satellite trackers - in a close community where everyone helps each other. My school French is just enough to communicate, but not to have fun conversations. I miss the small details in the language, and my phrasebook does not help me at breakfast. This is not a big problem for me, but at first, I felt unsure of myself. I was a bit scared of mealtimes. I would hesitate, worried about which table to choose, and I felt anxious when I spoke. I still smile awkwardly or feel nervous when people talk to me. I think this occasional sadness is not about missing company or communication, but because I have lost the confidence I used to have when I could speak easily.
**Elliot**
When I first met Elliot, I was just a young author like many others, and he did not pay attention to me. He remembered faces, though, and when I saw him, he would shake my hand politely but did not want to be friends. If I saw him at the opera with someone important, he would not notice me. But then I had a surprising success as a playwright, and I noticed that Elliot started to look at me differently. One day, he sent me a note asking me to lunch, and I thought he was testing me. After that, since my success brought me many new friends, I began to see him more often.
**Alfred Hitchcock**
The film director Alfred Hitchcock always said that he did not care about the story of his films or the acting, but he did care about the photography and the music. For Hitchcock, it was not a message that moved the audience, nor was it a great performance. He believed that people react to the film itself, no matter their background. So, if a film is made well, the audience in Japan should scream at the same moment as the audience in India. Hitchcock was always clear and logical in his thoughts. He was a man of reason and a talented craftsman who liked to hear the audience scream. He did not focus on guessing or deep ideas, and he did not explore his own characters in a complicated way. He focused on film, pure film, and the simple beauty of what a film can do to an audience."
CPE_57,C2,"Amateur Astronomy**
Many things have changed in astronomy in the last 50 years. Until about 30 years ago, there were not many charts and catalogues. Telescopes were limited, and there were few books about practical astronomy. Today, there are many types of telescopes and equipment available for everyone. Electronic calculators and computers have changed how we make almanacs and charts, and they help us analyze observations and publish results. This might be the best time for amateur astronomy. However, some things have also been lost. Now, you may have to travel 80 km to find a dark sky, unlike the skies in cities 50 years ago. Daytime skies are often filled with airplane trails that can last for hours and create clouds, making it hard to observe the sun and stars at night.
**Too Much Choice**
Today, people have too many choices. There are too many things to do and too many options. In our modern economy, wanting the newest product or service can feel like an addiction, and technology makes everything change faster. New products come out quickly, and before you know it, another one is already on the way. This can be overwhelming and tiring, making people feel disconnected from life. While having choices is important, too many choices can lead to stress, less time, and more confusion. Because of this, many people are looking for ""simplexity"" – the simple things that bring meaning to our complicated lives. But making life simpler is not easy when there are so many products and options available.
**McAndrews Hotel**
Every summer, my family and I spend two weeks at McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. This is a family tradition started by my grandmother, and it has become very important to us. Nothing can change this tradition. We are a special group of guests at McAndrews: old-fashioned and perhaps a bit snobbish. I do not like the bad manners of shop assistants today; I prefer the respect that used to exist. I know the names of many other guests because they have been coming here since they were children, just like me. When I see them in the hotel, we only exchange polite greetings, which I appreciate. This respect for privacy and dignity is hard to find in hotels these days."
CPE_9,C2,"**Text:**
**Othello**  
A great production of Shakespeare's play *Othello* has moved from Stratford to London. I want to correct an unfair review I wrote when the show first opened last spring. At that time, I said that Ray Fearon was too young to play Othello, and I criticized his acting. I still believe that the age difference between Othello and Desdemona is important, but I take back my comments about Mr. Fearon's wonderful performance. The whole cast is excellent. Some memorable scenes include the one where Cassio's games with other young officers become dangerous, and the moment when Iago starts to lose control. I challenge anyone not to cry during the scene where Emilia helps Desdemona get ready for bed. The pace and tension in the play are fantastic. Do not miss this production.
**Lake Vostok**  
In the middle of Antarctica, there is nothing alive. On the edges of the continent, there are many penguins, seals, and birds. But in the cold interior, life does not exist. However, there is a large hidden lake called Lake Vostok, which is under nearly 4 kilometers of ice, right below the coldest place on Earth. The water has been cut off from air and sunlight for up to 25 million years. Biologists are excited to explore its mysterious depths and find out what strange life forms might be there. Geologists and glaciologists are also interested. For two years, researchers around the world have been trying to find ways to uncover the secrets of the lake. If they succeed, we will see many discoveries about Lake Vostok in the next few years.
**Scientists**  
Last week, I heard something interesting on the radio. A group of scientists is discussing what motivates them to be scientists. The phrase ""because it's there"" comes to mind. We all know that it is the long-standing search for knowledge, the wish to understand everything from atoms to black holes. But these scientists want to know why we want to learn all of this and why science cannot explain our desire to know. I think it is more important to know if what we scientists are doing is right, rather than getting stuck in debates about the purpose of it all. I believe the key issue is not why we pursue science, but to understand that science is a tool, and we should decide how, where, when, and why to use it."

**Food**  
Food is very important and satisfying in our lives. Many people who love cooking buy cookbooks like this one. However, we often think that we should only cook for special occasions or when making complicated dishes. This is not true. You can make a delicious soup by simply putting some chopped carrots, a leek, celery, and herbs into water. This is much more satisfying than buying soup in a packet or a tin. Instead of buying a sweet chocolate mousse full of preservatives, you can make a tasty dessert in just five minutes that both adults and children will enjoy. Cooking is also a way to show care and love. Sharing food is important to us, which is why we celebrate special events like birthdays and anniversaries around a table. No one would want to have takeout for a wedding or anniversary party, and most people wouldn’t discuss business over canned soup.
**In the Elevator**  
This morning, Alistair tried to clean up his office, but there were still papers everywhere. Tax forms were sticking out of drawers and boxes, waiting for a day when he would organize them. He also had a lot of paperwork from owning an apartment building. Many books and journals were close to the new bookshelves. As the elevator took him to his floor, he knew Mallory would arrive on time for their meeting. She would knock on his office door exactly on the hour. She was very strict about time and cleanliness. He wondered how she would react to the mess. She might think someone had broken in. He could walk in after her and pretend to be shocked. Mrs. Wilson, his cleaning lady, had come while he was trying to clear some space on the floor. When he peeked out of his office as she was unlocking his apartment, he smiled at her, hoping she would help. But she looked at him with a hard expression and thought, “No way I’m going in there.” She went into his apartment, which was her responsibility. He knew Mrs. Wilson thought he was different from her, like someone from another world, far away from her life in Brooklyn.
**KAREN**  
Karen wanted to be different from her mother, so she created her own story. In her story, there were important moments, like when she was twelve years old and her brother accidentally hit her in the eye with a golf club. At first, she thought she would go blind. But the bone protected her, and the doctor later told her that her eye was fine. She only needed a few stitches. When she opened her eyes in the doctor’s office and saw her mother there, complaining about both miracles and small mercies, she felt that she was saved for a reason.
**Miss Fogerty**  
Miss Fogerty was walking quickly back to her work across the wet grass of the village green. She felt both excited and sad about what she had just seen. It is always thrilling to be the first to know something important, especially in a small community, and Miss Fogerty’s life was usually quiet. However, she was very sad about Dr. Bailey’s health. He had been her doctor for many years, and she remembered how he cared for her when she had laryngitis, which was the only health problem she had. Miss Fogerty thought his best quality was that he always made patients feel like there was enough time to talk and that he really wanted to listen to their worries. This quality made the doctor very loved in the village. He always gave his time, knowledge, and humor to others, and in return, he received great loyalty and affection from the people."
CPE_59,C2,"**Joanna's Lessons**
Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist. But why has she decided to write books for young children who are learning the piano? Even someone who cannot hear music well would be impressed by her performances. Watching her play the piano is exciting, as she plays many different styles of music, including classical, jazz, and blues. 
At a recent concert for kids, one small boy asked her, ""Can you play Match of the Day?"" This surprised many concert pianists, but Joanna found it funny. She realized that the boy thought she was not a real pianist until she played that song. Joanna is different from many famous pianists because she cares about how young children learn to play the piano. She has just published a beginner piano book for children called *Joanna MacGregor's Piano World*, even though she has a very busy schedule.
This summer, she is performing at many festivals and working with young composers and artists. She also runs her own recording label called Sound Circus. Joanna believes that the first lessons in music are very important. Many music teachers focus on talented children, but she thinks that most people enjoy music in a more everyday way.
Joanna has a lot of experience teaching beginners. From ages 18 to 25, before she became a concert pianist, she taught many children how to play the piano. She grew up in a home where her mother taught piano, and many children came to learn. Joanna wants to make music available to everyone, not just those with special talent. She believes that everyone should have the chance to learn the piano, just like learning to swim or speak a little French.
Some children learn quickly, while others take their time and may give up. This can happen at any stage. Some kids find the beginning too hard, while others feel pressure to be like the talented children they see on TV. Joanna worries that some parents use music to push their children to achieve, instead of letting them enjoy it. 
When asked if she thinks other piano books are not good enough, Joanna says she does not want to criticize them. She believes her colorful books are not the only ones that can make learning fun. To help young beginners, she includes stories in her books and CDs. She wants to make learning interesting from the very first lesson. 
Joanna believes that learning should be fun. Children should be allowed to play freely and explore the piano. As they progress, they need to learn to read music, which can be challenging. Joanna understands this because she relied on her ear when she was young. However, she thinks that practice is the most important part of learning.
Joanna knows that it can be hard to practice. She did not practice a lot until she went to the Royal Academy of Music, where she learned to play more difficult pieces. Now, she enjoys practicing and spends about eight hours a day on it, which she says is more important than performing. 
She understands that many people find practicing difficult. Joanna suggests that whether you practice for twenty minutes or five hours, it is important to have a goal. Other tips include playing through a piece, even if there are mistakes, and mixing difficult pieces with easier ones."
CPE_54,C2,"Writing by Hand and on Screen**
Dr. Johnson said that ""what is written without effort is usually read without pleasure."" This means that good writing takes hard work. When I look back at my handwritten school essays, I see that I made very few mistakes. Today, I would rewrite them many times. I think this is because writing by hand was hard. Writing slowly helped me think better. When it is easy to change things on a computer, we often do not pay enough attention. Many writers find that the time they spend fixing mistakes on a computer is about the same as the time they spent writing by hand. Also, emails, unlike handwritten letters, can feel less personal. Many love letters are now sent by email, which is better than just sending simple messages. At least these emails are written in some English and grammar. However, words on a screen can feel dull. Writers often do not understand the power of writing and can exaggerate their meaning. Words typed quickly can lack the care and personality of handwriting.
**The CD**
I put down my cup and looked at the CD. The case was not very nice, but the shiny disc inside looked interesting. ""Wonderful little things, aren't they?"" Mr. Warriston said when he came back into the room. I agreed and carefully handed the disc to him. ""It's amazing that they can fit seventy minutes of music on them,"" he said, turning on the music player. Lights turned on, and he pressed a button to open a small drawer. He put the disc inside and pressed the button again to close it. ""Some people say they sound cold, but I think they..."" ""Do you have to turn them over, like records?"" I asked. ""What? No,"" Mr. Warriston said, standing up. ""You only play one side."" ""Why?"" I asked. He looked surprised and then thought for a moment. ""You know,"" he said, ""I have no idea. I don't see why you couldn't make both sides playable and double the capacity..."" He looked at the machine. ""You could have two lasers, or just turn it over by hand... hmm."" He smiled at me. ""Yes, good point."" He nodded toward my wooden chair. ""Anyway, come on, let's get you sitting in the best place for the stereo effect, okay?"" I smiled, happy to have asked a technical question that Mr. Warriston could not answer.
**Books vs. Electronic Text**
When comparing books and electronic text, the author Malcolm Bradbury said that if matches had been invented after cigarette lighters, we would have been amazed at the improvement. Many people say that electronic text is a big change, like the invention of printing, and that it is almost complete. They forget that changes in how we think take a long time. For example, a book from 1979 said that by the 1980s, books would slowly disappear. So far, this has not happened. Reading long texts on a screen is often not enjoyable, so many people do not do it. Computers encourage people to read only parts of texts. Some people say that this new way of reading leads to new types of stories. But many books have never been read from start to finish, like religious texts and dictionaries. What is new is that computers do not encourage us to read everything carefully.
**The Office**
Charles walked into the office and saw a perfect world of order. The carpet was clean, and the dark wooden desk looked just like it did at the auction five weeks ago. Neat file holders were being put away. Twelve years of trade journals filled one wall. Kathleen struggled to close the filing cabinet and then turned to him. ""You have to use computers, Charles. This is just too much."" ""Hello, Kathleen. Oh, this is amazing,"" he said, admiring the room and its antique furniture. He was not thinking about computers or any machines in the room, not even a pencil sharpener. ""Simply amazing,"" he said, avoiding the topic of computers. Over the two years he had known her, they had talked about this many times. She could never understand why he did not want to use technology, even though he was good with computers and had published an important paper about them. She had inspired that paper. Through the keyboard, she could change any software into something new that could do amazing things."
CPE_32,C2,"""You don’t take sugar, do you?"" shouted his secretary. She was not really asking; she was stating a fact because she had been making Lancelot coffee for many months. She often forgot small details because he was not usually supposed to be there. But now, he was there all the time. He realized that staying away only caused more problems. He thought about how he had gone from being a respected advisor, meeting authors and playwrights for lunch, to being a stressed worker with no place to park when he arrived at the office.
""This came,"" she yelled, waving a manila folder before putting it in front of him. ""From that guy in Los Angeles. You said you wanted to see it."" A label on the folder read: ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert."" Below that, it said ""An Expanded Synopsis."" Lancelot did not want to see the word ""synopsis."" He wanted to see a label that said ""A First Draft."" He had already seen a synopsis of this book and did not want to see another one, even if it was revised. Ian Cuthbert had received a large advance for this book when Lancelot had bought the company. Ian was one of Lancelot's old friends, and he had made a mistake by asking him to write books. Ian was known for being unpredictable, and Lancelot felt that he was becoming even more difficult to deal with.
Lancelot skipped the introduction he had read many times and looked at the synopsis. He recognized almost every phrase. He closed the folder and pushed it aside. Clearly, at this rate, Ian's manuscript would never arrive. The synopsis lacked the brilliance that Ian was supposed to have, and it felt empty. Lancelot remembered stories about a famous author whose last book was published after his death, chapter by chapter, with payments made one at a time. But in that case, the payments were small amounts that had never been given. Ian's advance had been huge, which was against the usual rule that authors must deliver a manuscript before getting paid.
Lancelot, who had studied modern languages at Oxford, remembered when Ian Cuthbert was seen as a great talent in Cambridge. Ian's friends had planned to take over British theatre, and they succeeded quickly. But Ian seemed lazy compared to them. He wore his overcoat like a cape and talked about famous French writers as if he had met them. For some reason, Ian's creative talent remained hidden. While less talented people became successful, Ian stayed away from the spotlight. Even when he was a well-known literary figure, he was hard to work with. He was supposed to edit a magazine about the arts, but it never got published. His contract with a fashion magazine was renewed three times, but it only created stories about how much he was paid, which kept increasing to try to make him work more.
At meetings, Ian often criticized other people's ideas. Ten years later, he could hardly be counted on to show up for his own funeral. Lancelot was starting to think that ""A World History of the Short"" had been a mistake from the beginning."
CPE_65,C2,"England's Breakfast Revolution**
Health experts agree that a good breakfast is very important. However, breakfast is a relatively new meal in England. In medieval times, people rarely wrote about breakfast. There are some mentions of travelers eating a meal at dawn before long journeys and sick people having breakfast for health reasons, but most people did not eat breakfast unless they were kings or nobles.
In the sixteenth century, breakfast started to become common for everyone. Some writers say this happened because food became easier to get. However, they may not have thought about other important changes in society. For example, new job patterns meant that more people had to work set hours. Many of these jobs started very early in the morning. Because of this, eating a meal in the morning became necessary and was not just for rich people anymore."
CPE_61,C2,"**Photography**  
When a photographer takes a picture, they choose what to show based on their skills, personal views, and experiences, as well as social and cultural influences. In this book, we will explore how these factors affect the style, content, and meaning of a photograph, and how viewers understand and react to these images. For example, a casual reader of a newspaper usually understands the photographs printed in it. However, instead of just accepting the photograph as it is, we might ask if it truly shows what the scene looked like at that time. Or, does it show the photographer's opinion? Is the exact moment captured important, or should we see the photograph as a symbol of a situation in the world?
**More than a Game**  
For me, sport is more than just a game. The most successful athletes have strong self-belief. You need to focus completely if you want to succeed in sports. There is only one way to be the best, and you must put everything else aside. Sports can be tough, and no one will do the work for you. It’s a matter of survival. Sports have taught me discipline and determination, but they also show the importance of teamwork. My sport allows me to shine individually, but it is still a team game, and I must balance both. It is similar to life – you can succeed alone, but you should not forget about others around you. Sports have given me a lot, not just money. They have opened doors for me and shown me things around the world that many people will never see. However, you also have to give up a lot to enjoy these benefits.
**Tuning In**  
Some experiences stay in our memory so clearly that they become special moments we remember well. For me, one such moment happened one night in California many years ago. I was awake, listening to a beautiful mockingbird singing from a tree in my neighborhood. I don’t have trouble sleeping, but the bird's amazing song kept me awake. As I listened to its complex melodies, I felt like I was in a wonderful musical world. To understand the bird's patterns, I used my knowledge of jazz and Indian classical music. The bird made me feel like I was enjoying a stunning live performance. I reacted with joy as the bird sang different musical variations through my open window, until I finally fell asleep."
CPE_52,C2,"
People have always had strong feelings about birds. They love them, fear them, and even worship them. But what does this say about us? Paul Evans reports.
In a greenhouse, a little brown bird called a wren is bumping against the glass. Some people think this bird has a special message, while others see it as just a bird that is stuck. Both ideas could be true. Wrens have been part of British culture for a long time. In medieval times, people believed that the way wrens flew could tell them about their luck. Today, wrens are still seen in pictures and decorations in many British homes. Even if old beliefs about them are not as strong now, people still care about wrens. A place without wrens feels sad.
This connection to birds comes from a time when people relied more on nature for survival. They developed a way to understand the importance of other creatures. However, these beliefs can change over time. For example, the red kite bird was once seen as a valuable part of city life in London. But later, people thought of them as pests, and they almost disappeared from many areas. Now, red kites are seen as important birds again and are being protected and reintroduced to help them thrive.
Our connection with birds goes back to the beginning of human history. Early humans watched birds closely because they could warn them about danger, bad weather, and food. Birds also connected them to their dreams. When we think about why birds matter to us, we are also thinking about what it means to be human. Birds can fly, sing, and represent freedom. Our interest in birds reflects our own identity and our relationship with nature.
Some people might think our feelings for birds are old-fashioned and not important today. But these feelings are still part of us, and losing them would be hard. That is why, in recent years, birds have become important indicators of environmental change. In Britain, 30 bird species are now endangered. This is sad not only because we might lose these birds but also because it represents a loss of culture. Birds like the skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing symbolize love and magic. Many people feel sad about losing these birds, especially those mentioned in famous poems and stories.
However, the loss of other birds that are not part of literature or folklore is often ignored. Folklore is important because it includes stories and legends that connect us to the past. These stories have a stronger bond with people than scientific facts. They help us feel emotions that are often hidden in our busy lives. Whether we watch birds on TV or in our backyards, the joy we feel cannot be fully explained by science. Birds engage us in ways that are hard to understand, and the stories we tell about them help us make sense of our feelings. The wren in the greenhouse connects our present with a rich history, holding onto its song and moving into the future—a mystery that keeps us thinking."
CPE_28,C2,"Maps**
The purpose of a map is to show the relationships between different points and features on the earth's surface. These relationships are based on distance and direction. In the past, people often measured distance in time, like saying ""it takes so many hours to walk"" or ""a day's journey by river."" This way of measuring was more about how easy it was to travel through the land than about the actual distance. 
Direction is also important, but for most travelers, the main questions were ""Where do I go from here?"" and ""How far away is it?"" Because of this, written directions were often just as important as maps. Even today, some maps, like those for train systems, do not always show true directions. 
In the beginning, important landmarks along a route were marked by signs, which could be realistic or simple, and their size showed how important they were. The way maps were made varied depending on their purpose and location, so it is important to understand the specific style used when studying early maps.
The history of map-making, or cartography, is mostly about how the accuracy of distance and direction has improved over time. Other sciences have helped in this process. For example, instead of using shadows or stars to find direction, people started using the magnetic compass. They also created tools that allowed them to measure angles very accurately.
As people explored more of the world, they tried to create maps of what they knew. Astronomers found out that the earth is not a perfect sphere but is slightly flat at the poles, which helped improve maps of large areas. 
Over time, the needs of map users changed. Travelers and merchants were not the only ones using maps anymore. Soldiers, especially after the invention of artillery, needed accurate maps to understand the land better. This led to the creation of contour maps. Later, archaeologists, historians, and modern geographers also had their own specific needs for maps.
Today, cartographers create maps for many different purposes, including geological layers, climate, and land use. The growing recognition of the importance of maps in many sciences has led to a new era in cartography. 
It is important to note that the development of maps has not always been steady. There have been times of slow progress, mixed with periods of rapid change. Old ideas sometimes stayed alongside new ones. Cartographers have often had good ideas but had to wait for better tools to use them. Since it is easy to copy old maps, many map publishers have been slow to accept new ideas. 
Therefore, we should not blindly trust maps as proof of current knowledge and techniques. The many maps we have today are the result of a lot of human effort and thought. They are a valuable record for those studying history. This is what makes the study of historical cartography so interesting and important."

I met a young man named Andrew Lloyd Webber in his nice living room. It was much better than the messy rooms where his family spent time. Andrew had a huge collection of records, the first stereo record player I had ever seen, and even expensive wine glasses and furniture. He had a scholarship to study history at Magdalen College, Oxford, and had nine months before starting school. During this time, he wanted to become a famous composer like Richard Rodgers.
I also had big dreams. I wanted to be a pop star for reasons like money and fame. But my dreams were not as important to me as Andrew's were to him. When Andrew suggested that I try to be a famous lyricist like Oscar Hammerstein, I was happy to give it a try. He played me some of his music, and I could tell he was very talented.
We agreed to meet again and write something together. I was still more interested in pop music than in musical theatre, but I knew I had met someone special. I thought it would be exciting to work with him, even if we didn’t become famous right away. I was also thinking about how I might still end up as a lawyer, as my father expected.
The next day, back at my office where I was training to be a lawyer, I felt less sure about a future in show business. I still looked for ads for bands needing a singer and wrote some simple songs. I worried that I might stop enjoying pop music soon, as my father predicted.
But I wanted to see Andrew again. He was interesting and talked about food and architecture. He had been working on a musical about Dr. Thomas Barnardo, a man who started orphanages in the 19th century. I thought the story was good, but not very exciting. Andrew believed in his music, and I could see he had talent.
I started working on the lyrics for the musical with a lot of energy, especially for the funny songs. Andrew shared the plot and played me the music. I even skipped a day at the law office to write my first lyrics. That day, I didn’t know it, but I was starting a new career.

CPE_5,C2,"**Text:**
**Language**  
You and I are part of a species that can communicate with each other very well. Language is a big part of being human, and it is hard to imagine life without it. If you see two or more people together anywhere in the world, they will likely start talking. When people are alone, they often talk to themselves, their pets, or even their plants. I like to think of language as an 'instinct'. This means that people know how to talk, just like spiders know how to make webs. Spiders did not invent web-making, and it does not require special education or skills.
**Climate and Weather**  
Climate and weather, which are created by the air around us, greatly affect the lives of animals and plants. Climate can change how landscapes look. For example, warm and wet weather all year allows tropical jungles to grow, which are full of many different species. In contrast, cold and windy areas have fewer living things. The daily weather patterns that create the climate are caused by large air masses rising and mixing, as the atmosphere is always moving. Some of this movement is because the air is on a spinning Earth, and the thin air does not move at the same speed as the Earth. However, the sun is a more important cause of air movement.
**Coffee**  
As a barista, my job included serving drinks, but I was also responsible for making coffee. In Lygon Street, Melbourne, a restaurant's success can depend on its coffee. I spent several days learning how to make coffee, including how to clean and maintain the restaurant's espresso machine. I also learned how to make a good cappuccino. By the end of the first week, I realized that making a good cup of coffee was harder than it seemed, and I thought I might have to go back to cleaning ashtrays. Luckily, my boss was patient. He said, ""Making coffee is both an art and a science, and you need time to learn it."""
CPE_41,C2,"Art on TV**
Why does television often struggle with programs about visual arts? Painting and sculpture are great subjects for the camera because it can show the whole artwork and then zoom in to see the details. However, there are not many TV series that show the joy and complexity of looking at art. A good example of this is Robert Hughes's series called *American Visions*, which has eight parts. Hughes is a trusted critic with a strong personality, and he has almost eight hours to introduce British viewers to American art, which is often ignored in British galleries. I expected the series to focus on famous artworks, but instead, it looked at how American history and culture are shown in its art and buildings.
**Dealing in Metals**
For 20 years, I worked as an international metals dealer and became known as a speculator. The metals market is not as regulated as other markets. With some luck, a willingness to take risks, and a good understanding of the market, it is possible to make a lot of money. Taking risks is part of this industry. This adventurous culture fits well with a free-market global economy. However, the free-trade economists who believed that the market would keep the prices of scarce metals high have found the opposite is true. More minerals are being extracted, and the cost of raw materials is going down. When considering inflation, the prices of most metals are about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to investigate claims against a large company that benefits from these cheap raw materials.
**Extract from a Holiday Brochure**
Abaco and its nearby cays are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas, which stretch from Florida to Cuba. Each island has its own character and something special to offer. To get around the islands and cays of Abaco, you need a boat. If a boat is not included with your room, don’t worry. There are many ferries and water taxis available. You can also rent boats if you want to explore on your own. Sailing is the most popular way to travel here. Abaco is called 'The Sailing Capital of the World' for good reasons. The calm, protected waters are perfect for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The cays and their beaches stretch for 200 miles like a string of pearls. At night, the lights of the restaurants and cafes in Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay shine brightly."
CPE_69,C2,"Build Your Own Bamboo Bike at the UK’s First Workshop**
You can build your own bike at the Bamboo Bike Club in the UK. This workshop is run by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan. When you join a course, you get a custom bike frame designed by a computer and a fun weekend of bike-building.
It is Saturday morning in Hackney Wick, east London. The Bamboo Bike Club is the only place in Britain where you can learn to build bikes from bamboo. I went to see what was happening. There was a lot of energy and fun in the workshop. Bamboo is becoming popular for making bikes again. Companies like Calfee Design from California and Bamboo Bikes from Yorkshire have brought back this method, which started in 1894. However, many cyclists find bamboo bikes too expensive. A ready-made bamboo frame can cost around $2,995 or £1,868. 
James and Ian wanted to create a bamboo bike business that was affordable for regular cyclists. They spent years working in a shed in Brecon, Wales, to develop their idea. They realized they did not just want to sell bike frames; they wanted to help people enjoy making something special and sustainable. This led to the Bamboo Bike Club, which is more about community than business. James works on wind turbines, and Ian is a civil engineer, but they run the club in their free time. 
They offer monthly courses where you can build your own bike frame at a good price. On the first day, James and Ian teach you how to choose strong bamboo and how to make strong joints. You start by putting together the front triangle of the bike, then the seat and chain assembly. They use alloy tubes for parts that need extra strength, like the handlebars and wheel forks. 
For someone like me, who is not very good at DIY, this can be challenging. James and Ian help everyone by checking each cut and joint. They are friendly and encourage you to try again if you make a mistake. The bamboo is already checked for quality, so you can choose how your bike will look: plain bamboo, black, or mottled.
On Sunday, you spend time building the lugs, which are the parts that connect the frame. You wrap the joints with hemp bindings and glue them to make them strong. After adding a waterproof coating, your bike is ready for wheels, brakes, gears, and other personal touches. James and Ian say their bamboo bikes are just as strong as metal bikes. Ian has used his bike for over a year, and James has tested his bike off-road for three months without breaking it.
While bamboo bikes may not look as polished as metal ones, they are unique. James and Ian believe that the individuality of each bike is important. I think bamboo bikes are great for relaxed rides rather than racing. I chose a 'Classic English' frame for a smooth ride. 
I tried James's bike, and it felt light and smooth, thanks to bamboo's ability to absorb bumps. James says that the real joy of these bikes comes when you ride them. They are fun and easy to ride. The best part? The price is less than £500."

**Self-help Books**  
Diane Reverend was an editor at Random House in New York when she first saw a book by a new pop psychologist, Dr. John Gray. ""I knew it would be a bestseller,"" she says, and she was right. Dr. Gray is now very rich, and Diane Reverend has her own company. Dr. Gray's book helps people communicate better between men and women. It is very popular and is part of a big self-help industry that tries to help people improve their lives. This industry also creates many new needs and supports the publishing world in New York. In Britain, people are seeing that many self-help books are not very good, but many are published anyway. For every self-help book that is published, many others are not accepted because they are too similar or too specific. This is a good thing. Editors are always looking for the next big hit, and they care more about how well a book can sell than about the writing style. ""How marketable is the author? What's the 'hook'? Is it something everyone can relate to?"" Diane Reverend lists the important questions. She adds, ""If someone has a catchy title, that's a big part of the success. It means you can reach people.""
**Autobiographies**  
When someone writes an autobiography, there should be an understanding that they are telling the truth. However, this is often not fully followed. There are many reasons why a writer might not tell the whole truth. They might feel ashamed of certain actions or thoughts. They might think some things are not important enough to share. Sometimes, writers may choose to invent stories that express the truth better than just sticking to the facts. They might call their book an autobiography just to make readers believe it is true, even if it is mostly fiction. This can happen without any bad intentions.
**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**  
People who study detective stories say that this genre reflects the problems of society in the late 1800s and early 1900s. A detective story often symbolizes human desires like greed or lust, and solving the crime helps restore order in society. In Hammett's stories, society is shown to be corrupt. The detective and the criminal are two sides of the same person. They understand each other and have a strange connection. The detective is seen as too honest by criminals and too shady by the law. He is both a criminal and a competitor. Sometimes, the detective feels guilty about his role, and this can make him more eager to punish the criminal.
**Science Writing**  
Stephen Jay Gould is one of the best science writers today. I met him at the Grand Hotel while he was promoting his new book. Neither of us felt comfortable there. Gould said he could not write well in such a fancy place. He believes that knowing the culture is important for a writer. Science is its own world, and only scientists can explain it well. If you do not understand the science community, you will struggle to write about it. One of Gould's main ideas is: never write down to your readers. ""Do not make it too easy,"" he says. ""You can use simpler words, but do not change the main ideas. If readers feel you are talking down to them, they will not enjoy your writing."""
CPE_17,C2,"**Air-conditioning**  
At Cannons Gym, a popular place for City of London workers during lunch, it feels very cold inside. To handle the high summer temperatures, the gym has used a lot of air-conditioning. Sometimes, when it is quiet, the gym feels like it is in the Arctic. This shows how people often misuse air-conditioning today. It is now a common part of work and leisure, showing how humans can control the climate. However, many air-conditioned buildings could use other ways to stay cool. They could use natural light and fresh air, and have thicker walls that keep heat out during the day and let it go at night. These ideas may seem simple, but they can make a big difference and would reduce the need for air-conditioning.
**Sundials**  
It is interesting that as we start a new millennium, more people are interested in sundials. Sundials are tools that tell time by the position of the sun. A hundred years ago, they were very important for keeping time. As clocks and watches became better, sundials were mostly seen as garden decorations. Now, they are being taken seriously again. David Harber, who makes sundials, believes people like them because they connect us to the planets. He says there is a special moment when a sundial starts to work. They are calm and beautiful objects that remind us of our place in the universe.
**Paint Your Own China**  
My idea of china-painting came from a visit to an arts and crafts show long ago. There, serious-looking older women showed how to paint delicate flowers on a teacup with careful brushstrokes. It was fascinating to watch because each stroke created a perfect petal or leaf. Their hands were steady, and the paint never smudged. I thought these women must have practiced for many years or had a special talent. Because of this, I wondered what kind of people would join a china-painting class. Would beginners be good at it? However, the atmosphere in the class was friendly and fun. The students were there to enjoy themselves, and even the teacher did not want to paint flowers on teacups as quickly as I had remembered."
CPE_47,C2,"The Wrong Country**
Uncle chose a package holiday for Keith and Dawne at a good price. They had a flight from Gatwick Airport and twelve nights in Venice, in a hotel called Pensione Concordia. When they went to the travel agency to book the trip, the clerk told them that the other people in their group were a school group from the south coast, all learning Italian. But something went wrong. They ended up in a hotel called the Edelweiss, in Room 212, somewhere in Switzerland.
At Gatwick, they gave their tickets to a girl in a yellow-and-red uniform. She checked their tickets and said everything was fine. An hour later, they were surprised to hear older people on the plane speaking with accents from the North of England. Keith thought there might have been a cancellation or that the Italian class was on another plane. They ordered drinks, and then more drinks. 
When they landed, a stout woman with glasses told them to stay together. The brochure did not mention an overnight stop, but when the coach arrived at its destination, Keith realized that this was clearly an overnight stop. It was close to midnight, and they were tired, so they did not question their right to the beds they were offered. But the next morning, they were worried when they found out they were being offered the beds for their whole holiday. 
The receptionist smiled and said, ""We have the lake and the water birds. You can take a boat to Interlaken."" Keith calmly told him, ""There has been a mistake. We were supposed to be in Venice, at the Pensione Concordia."" The receptionist replied, ""I do not know that name. This is Switzerland."" 
Keith insisted, ""A coach is supposed to take us on. An official said so on the plane."" The receptionist said, ""Your group is booked for twelve nights in the Edelweiss Hotel. If you have changed your minds..."" Keith interrupted, ""We haven't changed our minds. There has been a mistake."" The receptionist shook his head, saying he did not know about any mistake.
Dawne added, ""The man who made the booking was bald, with glasses and a moustache."" She gave the name of the travel agency in London. A woman named Mrs. Franks, who was the stout woman from the plane, approached them. She smiled and said, ""I am married to the man with the bad leg."" Dawne asked, ""Are you in charge, Mrs. Franks? We are in the wrong hotel."" 
Keith explained, ""It seems we got into the wrong group. We reported to the Your-Kind-of-Holiday girl and left it to her."" Dawne added, ""We should have known when they weren't from Dover. We heard them talking about Darlington."" Keith wished she would let him talk. 
He said to Mrs. Franks, ""We noticed you at Gatwick. We knew you were in charge."" Mrs. Franks replied, ""I counted you, but you probably didn't see me. Let me explain. Your-Kind-of-Holiday sends clients to many places, with different holidays at different prices. There are villa holidays for young people and treks to Turkey and the Himalayas."" 
She continued, ""All tickets and labels look similar, yellow with two red bands. If you followed others with the yellow-and-red label, you might think you could end up anywhere!"" She laughed and added, ""But that couldn't happen."" 
Keith insisted, ""We are not supposed to be in Switzerland."" Mrs. Franks said, ""Let's see."" She then walked away, leaving them standing there. The receptionist was no longer at the desk, and they could hear typing. 
Dawne whispered, ""She seems kind."" But Keith was not listening. He thought about everything that had happened: giving the tickets, waiting, and then boarding the plane. An elderly man interrupted his thoughts, saying, ""Nice to have some young people here. My name is Nottage."" His wife said they had the best night's sleep they had in years because of the lakeside air. 
""That's nice,"" Dawne said. Keith walked out of the reception area, and Dawne followed him. Outside the hotel, they did not say that it was ironic they had ended up on a holiday with older people when they wanted to escape from them. Uncle had said so himself when they tried to convince him to join them."
CPE_48,C2,"'HE WAS A PEOPLE PERSON'**
American business leaders are looking to the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a good example of management. Eluned Price reports.
Most people in Britain know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and what he did. However, America has only recently discovered him. The Wall Street Journal called Shackleton ""an Antarctic explorer whose achievements went mostly unnoticed for most of the 20th century,"" which is not entirely true. Now, Americans are showing great interest in him. Many biographies and stories about his famous voyage on the Endurance are being published. The American Museum of Natural History is planning a big exhibition, and a film about Shackleton's life is being made.
Some American managers see Shackleton as a role model. They tell stories about his actions with great respect and find lessons in his leadership and communication skills. They even refer to each other as ""speaking Shackleton."" Shackleton, known for his determination and resourcefulness, has become a model for modern management consultants.
Jim MacGregor, a managing partner at Abernathy MacGregor Frank in New York, has looked up to Shackleton for many years. His firm focuses on communication during mergers, acquisitions, and corporate crises. For example, they deal with situations like ""the factory exploded"" or ""half the workers have to be let go."" While Shackleton did work in public relations for a steel company in Glasgow, it might be hard to see how his experiences in extreme conditions relate to modern business problems.
""Even if a company handles its crises well, it can still cause harm by communicating poorly,"" says MacGregor. ""Shackleton is a model for management because he was a strong leader and communicator. He had clear values and was at his best when he and his team had a lot to lose, like their lives.""
One of Shackleton's most interesting decisions was to turn back when he was only 97 miles from the South Pole. This decision showed his commitment to his men's safety. In a crisis, people want to know who is in charge. While many managers today avoid responsibility, Shackleton was willing to take charge.
His 1914 expedition became legendary. His ship, the Endurance, was trapped in ice for nine months and eventually sank. When the ship went down, Shackleton told his men, ""We should all reach safety if you do your best and trust me."" From the diaries kept during the journey, it is clear that Shackleton was always in control. 
""Shackleton thought everything through, planned for every situation, kept his men informed, and asked for their opinions,"" says MacGregor. ""He was flexible and ready to change plans when needed. We have developed effective principles based on Shackleton's story that clients can relate to without feeling criticized.""
Shackleton believed that an explorer needs optimism, physical strength, and patience. ""One of the hardest things to do in tough times is to wait, especially in America, where people want quick solutions,"" says MacGregor. ""If you invest in bonds and guess wrong about interest rates, you should hold on and wait to get your money back. Selling too soon would mean a big loss. Also, don’t be afraid to change your plans if they are not working. If a new product is not selling well, stop selling it.""
Shackleton led by example. On the way back from the Endurance, he saw Hurley, the expedition photographer, without gloves. He insisted that Hurley wear his gloves, saying he would throw them overboard if he didn’t. Someone else remembered Shackleton doing something similar with a biscuit when they were close to starving on a previous expedition: ""He said he would leave it in the snow. Millions of pounds could not buy that biscuit.""
As Caroline Alexander, author of *Endurance*, says: ""The public's interest in heroic actions is growing. Shackleton shows that there is little heroism today. He stands out as a true example of the ideals we long for now."""
CAE_15,C1,"'Finding Food in Madagascar'**
In the forests of Madagascar, there is a special animal called the aye-aye. This primate has a way of finding food that is similar to how a woodpecker does. Both the aye-aye and the woodpecker look for insects by digging into wood. The woodpecker uses its beak to make holes and its long tongue to get the insects. The aye-aye, however, uses its sharp front teeth to chew into the wood and its long third finger to reach inside and get the insects.
Scientists have studied the aye-aye's feeding habits for many years. Dr. Carl Erickson from Duke University has been watching two male aye-ayes named Nosferatu and Poe, a female named Samantha, and her baby, Annabelle. He wanted to see how they find insects hidden in the wood. 
Dr. Erickson first checked if the aye-ayes could find insects by looking for signs, like holes in the wood where insects might have entered. He gave them logs with small holes. Some holes had mealworms inside, while others were empty. The aye-ayes went straight to the logs with food, showing they did not need to see the holes to find the mealworms. 
Dr. Erickson thought the aye-ayes might be using their sense of smell or hearing to find the insects. However, tests showed they could find mealworms even when they could not smell them or when the mealworms were dead and silent. So, how did they find the food? 
Dr. Erickson found that the aye-ayes would chew into both empty spaces and those with mealworms. They seemed to sense the hollow spaces in the wood. When looking for food, an aye-aye taps the wood with its long finger and listens carefully. Dr. Erickson believes the aye-aye is using echo-location, which means it listens for sounds that bounce back to find hollow areas. It can also hear insects moving when they are disturbed.
Some scientists think that the aye-aye takes the place of woodpeckers in Madagascar, but there are also birds like the Sickle-billed and Nuthatch Vangas that look for insects in wood. So, the woodpecker role may not be empty. The aye-aye is unique because it acts like both a woodpecker and a bat that uses echo-location. It also behaves like a squirrel. Its front teeth keep growing, just like a squirrel's, and it has been seen in the wild chewing through nuts and using its long finger to get the nut meat inside."
CAE_19,C1,"'Ordinary People, Ordinary Lives'**
Most of us have pictures of our grandparents, but how many of us know what their lives were like when they were young? The few diaries we have are often not enough, and family stories are sometimes only half-remembered. What will our grandchildren know about us? We often plan to write things down, but we never seem to do it. We might leave videos instead of photographs, but videos are still just images. 
Hannah Renier has found a solution: she writes autobiographies for other people. She creates a book of at least 20,000 words, with pictures if needed. Her books are not about famous people, but about ordinary lives. The idea came to her when she spoke with her family and realized how much of the past was being forgotten. 
""When I started, I didn’t take it as seriously as I do now,"" she says. ""I met people who really wanted to share their interesting lives. They say they are doing it for their children or for future generations, but they enjoy it too."" The promise of privacy helps people feel free to share their true feelings. 
""I felt I could be honest,"" says a 62-year-old man who has made and lost money in his life. ""I was surprised by what I shared. There were painful things, like my divorce."" He wrote his story for his family, but he hasn’t let his children read it yet. ""There are things that might hurt them, and I want to wait until after I’m gone for them to read it."" 
He also noticed patterns from his childhood that caused him to repeat mistakes. Ms. Renier has seen this in others too. ""Many people are influenced by their parents,"" she says. ""The things they learned as children affect them for the rest of their lives. They often marry people their parents liked or choose partners to rebel against their parents."" 
""Many people still regret things from their past. Even after many years, they hold onto feelings about their parents. If they had problems when they were young, they still have them as adults. They try to impress parents who were never impressed, and some want to say, 'I can’t stand my mother.'"" 
Ms. Renier listens more than she asks questions. ""I’m not here to judge or be nosy. Sometimes people share something and then say, 'I’m not sure if that should be included.' I usually keep it in, but they can change it later. Most people want to be honest."" 
""This is not about showing off. It’s not about saying, 'Look at my interesting life.' Things are changing quickly, and we are forgetting our past. This work helps people connect with their roots. We need to remember our ancestors because families are not as close as they used to be. People want to feel a sense of lasting memory."" 
Each book includes up to 30 hours of recorded interviews, which Ms. Renier uses to write the life story, organizing the events and adding her interpretation. Modern technology helps her create everything except the binding with its gold lettering. You can choose the color of the cover and the title. 
The final books are well-organized and written nicely. They are not cheap, costing nearly £3,000, with extra copies at £25 each. Ms. Renier gets about 10 inquiries each week, but the price stops many people from buying. ""I thought it would be less expensive than it is,"" she says. ""But the people I’ve worked with are often from wealthy backgrounds, readers of magazines like Harpers & Queen, which is where I advertise. They are the kind of people who would have had their portraits painted for their families."""
CAE_24,C1,"**A. The University Museum of Classical Archaeology**  
The Museum of Classical Archaeology has one of the few collections of casts of Greek and Roman sculptures in the world, with over six hundred pieces. It is important to know that none of the sculptures are real. All the sculptures are exact copies made from the originals, mostly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Museum is in a specially built gallery with great natural light. The benefits of plaster casts are many: groups of sculptures that were originally displayed together but are now in different museums across Europe can be seen together as they were meant to be. You can see almost all the famous works of Greek and Roman sculpture in one afternoon.
**B. Cambridge Darkroom**  
Cambridge Darkroom is a place for photography that has community darkrooms and a gallery showing different photography exhibitions. We often run courses and workshops for people of all ages and skill levels, including a popular Beginner's Course, a shorter Induction Course, and Master Classes with guest photographers. We have a membership program that allows all members to use our darkrooms. We also help young photographers (aged 12 to 16) improve their skills with our Young Members program, led by our resident photographer. We sell photography books and magazines and have a full range of photographic materials.
**C. Sedgwick Museum of Geology**  
The Sedgwick Museum has a wonderful collection of fossil animals and plants, rocks, and minerals from all geological ages and parts of the world. It also has Britain's oldest complete geological collection, from Dr. John Woodward (1665-1728). This collection includes nearly 10,000 rare and interesting specimens stored in their original cabinets from the early 18th century. Adam Sedgwick was a Professor of Geology and took care of the Woodwardian collection. Throughout his life, he greatly increased the collections, creating a truly outstanding museum. The collection is organized by geological age so that the major changes in life on Earth can be seen over time. The new Whewell Gallery displays the beautiful minerals and gems of the collection. The displays have clear labels to explain what they are and how they are used today.
**D. The Cambridge University Collection of Air Photographs**  
There are over 400,000 air photographs in the collection, taken by university staff over the last 45 years. The University has its own aircraft based at Cambridge Airport and takes photographs all over Great Britain. The photographs are interesting as they show a detailed record of the landscape, showing both nature and human activity from prehistoric times to today. There is a small display in the entrance hall, and the helpful library staff can answer questions. The photographs cannot be borrowed, but copies can usually be bought. These are made to order and usually take about a month.
**E. Cambridge Medieval Brass Rubbing Centre**  
The Cambridge Brass Rubbing Centre is the second oldest and longest-running centre in the world, and it is one of the most unusual tourist attractions in the region. You can have hours of fun creating wall hangings by rubbing one of over a hundred different brass plates from the tombs of medieval knights and ladies. By making resin copies, called facsimiles, the centre has preserved the originals and made brass rubbing an enjoyable activity for everyone. The brass plates, which are another way to remember the tomb statues, spread from Germany across medieval Europe and Scandinavia. Many beautiful brasses were destroyed during various revolutions. Most of the remaining brasses are in Britain, and the widest range can be seen at the Cambridge Centre."
CAE_13,C1,"From Here to Fatherhood**
**A. The Theatre Director**  
I have had a strange personal life, but I have been lucky to spend 35 years with small children, and I have loved every moment. This morning, I enjoyed feeding the baby, which is what being a father means to me. I feel very lucky with my children. We all enjoy the same things: opera, theatre, books, and music. This brings us closer, especially now that they are mostly grown up and I feel more like a friend than a father. I do not believe in hitting children. I have slapped my children in anger before, but I do not think it is right. I may not have been the most attentive father, but I have always tried to be there for them. I am available if they need me, but I believe they should reach out to me. If I chase them to ask why they haven’t called, it makes them feel guilty. My parents did that to me, and I would never do that to my children.
**B. The Advertising Executive**  
I was young when my children were born, only about 25, and I found the responsibilities hard at times. It made me feel older quickly, but it also kept me young, which I appreciate. As they became teenagers, they showed me things I might have missed, like music and fashion. This has helped me in my job. I missed some important events when they were young, like their first concerts and sports days, and I feel sad about that. However, now I can take them on holidays to the south of France. They get along well with my friends and come to parties and work events without feeling nervous. I think it helps that my job is seen as interesting.
**C. The Politician**  
My first child was born just as I was starting my political career, and I had more children soon after. My wife and I promised to spend time with them, but as I became more involved in politics, it became harder to find time. I only accept weekend meetings and events where my kids can come with me. If I didn’t, they would feel left out. This way, they can see what I do when I am not with them, and they don’t feel like I am disappearing. I have noticed more politicians bringing their kids to work. Maybe we are all realizing how important it is to include our children in our lives.
**D. The Writer**  
My first marriage ended when my daughters, Kate and Bonnie, were young, so I had to think more about being a father. I worked hard to stay close to my children. My ex-wife and I even tried living next to each other for a while, so they could visit easily, but I think it confused them. Kate has said in interviews that I was always there for her, but I am not sure I was a good father. I was around a lot, but I think I treated my kids like adults too soon. Kate recently said that we were too relaxed as parents. I wish I had set more rules and structure. I still worry about my older daughters just as much as I do about my youngest. In that way, your children never really leave you.
**E. The TV Presenter**  
I was ready for kids. I was 30, had met my wife, and we had a nice home, so we thought, ""Why not have a child instead of just buying new furniture?"" Having my daughter Betty has helped me understand who I am. It feels special to have a child, but it also makes you just one of many parents. Sometimes I feel frustrated, but just one smile from her makes everything better. A baby's smile is the best way to feel happy."

CAE_46,C1,"'Science and Weightlessness'**
Journalist Tom Mumford joins students who are testing their ideas in weightlessness. The aircraft looked normal from the outside. The pilot told the 13 students from Europe and America that it was built in 1964 and was a Boeing KC-135 refueling tanker, based on the Boeing 707. But inside, it was very different. The inside was a long white tunnel with few windows and bright lights along the padded walls. Most of the seats were removed, except for a few at the back where the nervous students sat.
For 12 months, these students had competed to join this special flight offered by the European Space Agency. They had to suggest creative experiments to do in weightless conditions. The best ideas won a place on this unique flight, which felt like an amazing roller-coaster ride. For the next two hours, the Boeing would fly in a way that felt like a giant bird flying up and down. 
When the pilot cut the engines at 3,000 meters, the aircraft went higher because of its speed before falling back down. In the few seconds between going up and coming down, everything inside the aircraft became weightless. The students would feel like they were closer to the moon than to the Earth.
The flight took off smoothly, but the students quickly realized this was not a normal flight when the pilot made the plane climb steeply for about 20 seconds. The engines roared, and the students felt the blood rush from their heads. Then the engines stopped, and they experienced weightlessness almost immediately. For 20 seconds, they floated in silence, as if the floor had turned into a trampoline. They could not tell which way was up or down. 
After ten seconds of falling, the pilot pulled the plane out of its dive. The return of gravity was sudden, and some students landed hard. After the first curve, some students felt sick thinking about the 29 more to come. Thirty curves gave them ten minutes of ""space time"" for their experiments. The Dutch students studied their robotic cat, Leonardo, to see how cats always land on their feet. They released a device to test this, and one student managed to turn it over using a remote control. 
A German team from the University of Aachen studied how metal joints are affected by weightlessness, which is important for building future space stations. Another team from Utah State University worked on creating solar sails from thin liquid films that harden in sunlight. They believe that once they perfect this process, satellites could use solar sails like yachts use wind.
After two hours of flying between heaven and Earth, the students felt excited, not sick. One student said, ""It was an unforgettable experience. I wanted to be an astronaut before, but now I want to even more."""

**With the Trees, I Planted My Stake in New Zealand**  
**JONATHON PORRITT TALKS TO DANNY DANZIGER**
Jonathon Porritt is the author of *Seeing Green - The Politics of Ecology*. 
I had a strange time in my life when I didn’t have any summers. I went to New Zealand every summer, which is actually winter there. So, I had nine winters in a row, which was great because I like winter. My parents had the idea to buy a small piece of land for my brother, sister, and me to take care of. My mother said, “If you can plant trees on it, then you can have it.” The idea was that we would always have a connection to New Zealand, which is nice because my father grew up there. They found a piece of land about 20 miles north of Auckland in a place called Rangitoupuni. The land is not very good, but it is good for planting trees. 
I have always been interested in land. I spent a year in Australia working on sheep farms and doing different farming jobs, so the idea of planting trees sounded nice, and I was excited. I think my family became excited too as we went along. I started planting in 1968, and by the end of 1972, we had planted the whole 70 acres together. In New Zealand in 1968, it was a very rainy winter. It rained a lot, almost every day we were planting. I don’t think I have ever been so wet or cold for such a long time. 
Every morning was a challenge: getting ready for planting. I would come out of the Land Rover warm and dry, but then the rain would start, and my clothes were still damp from the day before. My boots were wet, and my hands struggled with slippery laces. “My mind starts to think about many strange ideas and reflections about life.” In that first year, I had a helper who was an experienced tree-planter, which was very helpful because I had never planted trees seriously before. 
You wear a planting bag around your neck and fill it with as many trees as you can. When the bag is full, it is heavy, and it only gets easier when it is lighter. The hardest part was getting the lines straight. You decide how far apart to plant the trees, then you line up three poles to guide you. Once you are in line, you plant all the way down the line, then turn around and come back. I enjoy hard work, and it made me fit. After a while, you can plant trees almost automatically. You get used to a rhythm and use the fewest movements to dig the hole. 
The rhythm is important. Many farming jobs require you to train your body to do the same movements, and then it becomes easy. You develop a regular process: taking the tree out of the bag, digging a hole, putting it in the ground, stamping it down, and moving on. Mentally, it is interesting. My mind starts to think about many ideas and reflections about life. A lot of my thoughts about nature and our place in it began during those days. 
I have been back to New Zealand four times since then and watched the trees grow, which is very satisfying because I planted them. I feel a connection to what happens to them. I always worry when I read news about strong winds or droughts in New Zealand. Such news makes me feel anxious. However, everything worked out well, and those trees are now 20 years old and healthy. 
I should add that I took a break from teaching and went back in 1984 for three months by myself. I wrote my first book there, *Seeing Green*. There is a simple cabin on the tree farm with just a bed, a table, and a chair. In the mornings, I would write; in the afternoons, I would prune the trees, and in the evenings, I would do research. My connection to that area is still very strong. It is the place I feel most connected to in terms of the bond between people and the earth."
CAE_10,C1,"'CARING FOR BADGER CUBS'**
""What now?"" was my first thought when one of my helpers brought a cardboard box to me. My husband Derek and I have run an open farm in Somerset for six years, and we are known for taking care of orphaned animals. But the noise from the box—a mix of a cackle and a bark—was strange to me. I looked inside and saw three small grey badger cubs, each about eight inches long. Their soft coats were like velvet, and their milky eyes looked up at me from their tiny black-and-white striped heads. I had never seen badger cubs before. Most badger cubs are born between mid-January and mid-March and live underground. If they lose their mother, they often die from hunger. These three cubs were found by builders who accidentally disturbed their home while working. Their mother was found dead, and the cubs were still trying to suckle from her. They looked healthy but were cold and whimpering. After removing the fleas, I took them into the farmhouse kitchen and placed them beside the stove to keep warm. There were two females, named Primrose and Bluebell, and a male named Willow. At first, I used a syringe to feed them, but I had to wipe them with a warm cloth first to make them feel like their mother was licking them. This helped them go to the bathroom. For the first few days, I fed them every four hours. Within a week, they learned to drink from a bottle and started to move around, although a bit unsteady. They were happy with each other and a heated pad as a substitute for their mother. 
Three weeks later, I noticed that Willow seemed tired, but he was still eating normally. This was a warning sign. I should have acted quickly, but I didn’t realize how serious it was. The next morning, I found him dead. The vet said he died from a lung infection. When feeding any animal with a bottle, it is important not to let them drink too fast, as it can cause problems. In Willow's case, this led to an infection that was hard to treat, especially for such a small cub. Feeling sad about my loss, I continued to care for the other two. Then, six days later, a local farmer came to see me. He had found another male cub, abandoned by its mother. He knew she would not return, and the cub was cold and hungry. This new cub, named Willow II, joined us. At six weeks old, he was about two weeks younger than the females. I soon found out that he was very difficult to feed. I had to keep moving the bottle and squeezing it to get him to drink. After ten minutes, he would finally latch on as if he hadn’t eaten all day. By the end of April, the females were eating creamed rice and anything else I offered. Willow II was happy to stop using the bottle but had trouble eating without making a mess. Eventually, I gave him a sausage, which he slowly learned to eat. After a week of sausages, he was ready for more food. At nearly five months old, they were all eating cereals for breakfast, meat and vegetables for lunch, and fruit, nuts, cheese, hard-boiled eggs, and sunflower seeds in the evening. Badgers usually eat 60 percent earthworms, plus beetles, baby rabbits, mice, and plants. My badgers were better off than others that year because the summer was very hot, making it hard to find earthworms.
By August, my badgers started to be active at night and would go for walks at dusk or late at night. We often walked through the cider orchard, where they would get excited and chase each other. I learned to avoid their playful nips, but Derek, who joined us less often, sometimes got caught and ended up with bruises. During these late-night walks, I saw other badgers in our field. They were likely looking for food because their own areas were disturbed. Badgers are very territorial and can be aggressive, so we put metal sheets over the gate to keep them out. The local press took pictures of me walking the badgers, and many people wanted to help us build a home for them on the farm. With advice from others, we designed a new home for the badgers. My son Daniel drew the plans, and we built a sett with tunnels, an enclosure, and a badger gate. It had three chambers, one larger than the others, with a glass side so people could see inside. As the sett was built, the badgers explored it before their walks. Eventually, they became more interested in the tunnels than in walking. The building costs were higher than we expected, but a local bus company helped fund it, and local businesses donated materials. Everyone wanted to see the badgers have a home. One evening, they finally moved in. After watching them for a while, we left them to settle. Half an hour later, I returned to check on them and saw three badgers curled up in their chambers, sound asleep. 
Now, my walks with them are not as regular, especially since they don’t wake up until midnight. We see Primrose only sometimes because she has joined a nearby sett, but Bluebell and Willow II still come to say hello before running off into the night. This is their territory now, a place they know well and a home they have happily accepted."
CAE_67,C1,"In Search of True North - and the Man Behind Halley's Comet**
Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, wants to follow Sir Edmund Halley's journey to study compass variations. Anjana Ahuja reports.
Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is famous for the comet named after him. However, one of his important achievements was to chart the 'variations of the compass' during his sea voyages on the warship Paramore. These variations, now called 'declination', show the angle between magnetic north and true geographical north. Without this information, sailors could not correct their compasses, making it hard to navigate the oceans.
Halley was one of only two men in England at that time who were paid to do scientific research. He set sail for the Cape Verde Islands to chart declination in the North and South Atlantic, but the trip was stopped because of problems with the crew. Halley then made a second voyage that took him to Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, Newfoundland, and back to England. From this journey, Halley published a chart in 1701 showing the variations of the compass in the Western and Southern Oceans. More advanced charts were used by sailors for over a century until changes in the Earth's magnetic field made them less accurate.
Dr. Clark wants to celebrate the 300th anniversary of Halley's trip by retracing the route of the Paramore. He needs to raise £70,000 before starting, and Sir Vivian Fuchs, who led the first expedition across Antarctica, is helping him.
Dr. Clark became interested in Halley while working at Halley Station in Antarctica, where he read about Halley's life. ""Halley had an amazing life,"" Dr. Clark says. ""He was a respected scientist and led expeditions. He was not just an astronomer; he also studied geophysics. While he was Astronomer Royal, he mapped the stars and worked on other projects.""
During this time, Halley created a diving bell and helped Sir Isaac Newton with his famous book, Principia Mathematica, which is important in physics. Dr. Clark believes that retracing Halley's voyage will give him the recognition he deserves. His planned expedition, called 'In the Wake of the Paramore', will also have scientific value. It will involve taking measurements that Halley made, but with better tools. These measurements are important because the Earth's magnetic field is always changing.
Dr. Clark explains, ""We usually measure the size of the magnetic field, but not its direction. To measure the direction, we need to know true north. On our expedition, we can use satellites to find that."" The British Geological Survey and the United States Navy will provide instruments for the trip. A Danish satellite will also be taking similar measurements around the world. Dr. Clark hopes his measurements will fill in any gaps in the satellite's coverage of the Atlantic Ocean, and having ground measurements will be helpful for comparison.
Halley's journey was significant because it was the first scientific expedition at sea, and he was the first civilian to be appointed as a naval captain for this purpose. Does Dr. Clark have the right experience to make his journey successful? He has spent two years in Antarctica and worked in the geomagnetic group at the British Geological Survey. He has also sailed the 13,000 kilometers from Rio de Janeiro to England. He plans to complete the expedition in four stages with four different crews.
Does he share Halley's passion? ""I am ready to give up my life for eight months to do this, so some might say I'm obsessed. But I wouldn't want to sail across the Atlantic again without a good reason. Halley and his interesting life have given me a real sense of purpose."""
CAE_27,C1,"'POWER DRESSING'**
Every summer, the peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show off their beautiful tail feathers to the hens. This behavior has puzzled scientists for a long time. Charles Darwin, a famous scientist, wondered how birds could have such extravagant features in a world where survival is tough. He believed that animals evolve through natural selection, meaning that the strongest and best-adapted individuals survive and reproduce. However, he thought that peacocks' tails were not useful for survival and suggested another idea called 'sexual selection.' This means that females choose males based on their beauty.
Darwin's friend, Alfred Russel Wallace, had a different view. He believed that if peahens liked the males with the most beautiful tails, there must be a good reason for it. He thought that the tail was not just for show but indicated something important about the male's ability to survive.
Now, 100 years later, scientists are still trying to find answers. At Whipsnade, there are 200 peacocks that live like wild birds but are used to people, making them easier to study. Marion Petrie and her team have two main questions: Do peahens really prefer the males with the most impressive tails? And do these males have other qualities that help them survive, or is it just about looks?
The researchers have observed the peacocks and found that hens seem to prefer males with more eye spots on their tails. These males attract more mates. However, it is still unclear if these attractive males are better in other ways. William Hamilton from Oxford University suggested that showy male birds might be healthier and have fewer parasites, and their beautiful feathers show this. But the researchers have not yet been able to check the health of the peacocks at Whipsnade.
This year, Dr. Petrie is studying the offspring of attractive and unattractive males to see if the children of the attractive males grow faster and are healthier. If they are, it would support Wallace's idea that females choose mates for practical reasons.
There is also an interesting theory from mathematician R A Fisher. He suggested that if a female chooses a male with a slightly better tail, their sons will inherit the long tail, and their daughters will prefer long tails. This could lead to a situation where males with the longest tails have the most mates, and the preference for long tails continues to grow. This idea could explain how peacocks developed their impressive tails and also support Darwin's idea that females might choose beauty for its own sake."
CAE_66,C1,"**THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS**
Tom Cunliffe believes that the best boat design should mix old and new ideas. He showed this with his own boat, 'The Westerman'. This week, the Summer Boat Show in London is full of beautiful yachts with new technology. Most of these boats come from a big change in boat design that happened 25 years ago. In contrast, my boat is quietly resting in a tidal creek on the south coast. It was designed last year, but if you see it, you might think it is 100 years old and that its owner is a romantic person. Maybe I am, but I’m not sure.
This boat uses the best parts of old boat design, but modern technology has made it easier to build. However, even though technology is important in boat design and building, it often keeps sailors away from the real challenges of life at sea. These challenges are often what they wanted to experience by going to sea. I am not saying that sailors should go back to suffering through every difficulty. I believe it is important for my boats to have a coal stove for warmth and comfortable places to sleep. But why go sailing if every sail works by itself? Dealing with sails that flap in the wind is part of being a sailor.
Why should we change our steering positions from a safe place at the back of the boat to a less safe spot in the middle? The sad truth is that this makes the cabin feel like a big ship, with a bed larger than the one at home. For me, a boat should be a boat, not a house on the water. When I bought my earlier boat, Hirta, to sail around Britain for a TV race, the previous owner said it had all the comforts but no luxury. During my time with Hirta, I learned how true this was. She had heavy sails, no running water, little electricity, no fridge, no central heating, no winches, and no electronics, especially for navigation. Yet, she was the easiest boat I have ever sailed.
However, classic boats like Hirta need a lot of care. When I hurt my back badly, I realized I could not keep sailing her. I looked for a younger boat but found nothing good, so I decided to build a new boat from scratch. The Westerman has never let me down. Although the designer, Nigel Irens, and his assistant, Ed Burnett, are skilled with computer design, Irens first drew this boat on a paper napkin and later used a computer. After creating a model, just like boat builders did in the past, we worked together to improve the design. The final version was perfect.
The completed boat has crossed the North Atlantic and won four out of her first six races. She looks timeless, moves beautifully in the sea, and her interior, made from reclaimed pitch pine, feels peaceful. This might be because she was designed only as a sailing boat, without thinking about any furniture. This is the best way to design a boat. In her calmness, she shows that you don’t need to follow trends to be happy, and that sometimes it is wise to learn from history. Made from wood treated with a special glue, she does not let water in. So, she has all the advantages of a fiberglass boat but looks, feels, and sails like a real boat."

**A. HENLOW GRANGE**  
I was happy to go to Henlow Grange for six days because I was tired and needed to relax. My room in the big 18th-century house was very comfortable, and I felt calm right away. On the first day, I did nothing and slept a lot. From the second day, I started attending body conditioning classes like yoga and stretching. The instructors are very well trained. I was surprised at how flexible I felt as the week went on. They offer many treatments, including aromatherapy, seaweed baths, manicures, and pedicures. The facial treatment lasts an hour and makes you feel refreshed. The staff in the treatment rooms were very friendly and professional. The atmosphere was full of energy and enthusiasm. Henlow is planning to renovate this year, adding a half-size Olympic swimming pool and a Light Diet Room. You can also ride bicycles around the grounds. If you want to relax, you can read a magazine or take a peaceful walk in the garden. During my stay, I felt happier and had a better appetite. I left feeling great and full of energy, which lasted a long time. I will definitely visit again. This is a perfect getaway for busy women. Save Room 5 for me!

**B. SHRUBLAND HALL**  
The calm and relaxing atmosphere of this stately home was clear as soon as I walked up the big staircase into the reception area. The Hall has a beautifully decorated library, a lovely conservatory, and plenty of space, so you can be alone if you want. When you arrive, everyone gets a medical check-up, which includes an examination and checking weight and blood pressure. We were all called patients, which felt strange since I am healthy. However, I was impressed that a shoulder problem found during the check-up was quickly shared with the fitness instructor, and we worked on it in group workshops and individual sessions. Each patient follows a specific diet. I lost weight without starving, but I was still hungry enough to get a bad headache on the second day. My daily menu included grapefruit and honey for breakfast, salads for lunch, and a mix of fruit, yogurt, and hot broth for dinner. If you are not on a light diet, you can eat in the main dining hall, where the food is tasty and well-presented. You have a massage or water therapy every other day. All extra treatments are reasonably priced.

**C. CAREYS MANOR**  
Careys is not a health farm and does not pretend to be one. It is a lovely old manor with cozy log fires and a spacious lounge. If you are counting calories, you might want to skip the gourmet food. The French chef makes rich sauces and delicious desserts. Luckily, the hotel has a gym and a soft-water pool, so I could exercise after enjoying the food. (You can choose a 'health-conscious' diet if you want to lose weight.) There is a spa bath, steam room, sauna, and treatment rooms. A big attraction is the sports injury clinic. I got advice on an old shoulder injury. The physiotherapist suggested good posture, exercises, and massage. Careys is comfortable and luxurious, relaxed and calm. If you want to explore, there is beautiful countryside around.

Cliveden is a grand country home and a five-star hotel that treats guests like royalty. It offers health and beauty treatments, a gym, saunas, a swimming pool, tennis, horse riding, and more. There are beautiful woodland walks and gardens on the 376-acre estate. Waldo's is a famous restaurant with amazing dishes. It took me a long time to read the dinner menu because there were so many choices. The meal was fantastic, especially the sticky-toffee pudding with banana ice cream. I went to bed very happy! The next morning, I spent a few hours in the gym to burn off some calories before my next meal. In the Pavilion, I enjoyed a facial with gentle heat and essential oils, followed by an aromatherapy massage. I thought about all the other reports my fellow journalists would write about fitness and beauty treatments. Cliveden has everything if you want to use them before enjoying a meal at Waldo's.

**E. SPRINGS HYDRO**  
The best and worst thing about Springs Hydro is the carrot cake. It is the best because it is the most delicious I have ever tasted. It is the worst because it has 360 calories, which is a lot if you want to lose weight. You have been warned! The second best thing is the wonderful aromatherapy massage. I chose a relaxing oil blend and fell asleep twice during the massage. I had my best night’s sleep in years. The place is modern and well-organized, with great facilities and luxurious bedrooms. There are many therapists and beauty rooms, so it is easy to book appointments. They offer a variety of treatments, from manicures and pedicures to deep-cleansing facials and body treatments. The guests are a mix of people, from football teams to mothers and daughters, friends, and singles. Ideally, I would take a break here about once a month.

CAE_22,C1,"**NATURAL TALENTS**
In the seven million years since humans separated from chimpanzees, we have not changed much. Genetically, we are still more than 98% similar to chimps. This means that the differences between humans and animals are very recent. Our ability to create art and other things we think are unique to humans comes from just a small part of our genes. This is a big responsibility for a few genes.
Recent studies of animal behavior show that many traits once thought to be unique to humans are now seen as differences in degree. For example, both humans and wild chimpanzees use tools. Chimpanzees use sticks to eat and as weapons, while sea otters use rocks to open clams. Monkeys also have a simple form of language, with different sounds for 'leopard', 'eagle', and 'snake'. This means that besides art, there are not many clear differences between humans and animals.
If human art comes from a special genetic ability, it is strange that our ancestors did not create art for almost 7 million years after separating from chimps. The earliest forms of art may have been wood carvings or body painting, but we cannot know for sure because these materials do not last. The first clear evidence of human art appears around 35,000 years ago with cave paintings, statues, necklaces, and musical instruments.
If we believe that our recent burst of creativity makes us different, we need to think about how our art is different from animal art. Three main differences are often mentioned: human art is not useful, it is made for enjoyment, and it is learned rather than instinctive.
First, as Oscar Wilde said, ""All art is quite useless."" This means that human art does not help us survive or pass on our genes, unlike many animal behaviors. Some human art does communicate ideas to other people, but this is not the same as passing on genes. In contrast, birdsong helps defend territory or attract a mate, which does help them pass on their genes. So, by this idea, human art does seem different.
The second claim is that only human art is made for enjoyment. We cannot ask birds if they enjoy their songs, but they mostly sing during the breeding season, so they may not be singing just for fun. Again, this suggests that human art is unique.
The third claim is that human art is learned, not instinctive. Each human group has its own art styles that are learned. For example, songs in Tokyo are different from those in Paris. People can learn each other's songs. In contrast, some birds are born knowing how to sing their species' songs, even if they have never heard them before.
Human art changes quickly. For example, Roman writers described geese honking 2,000 years ago, and they still do today. But human art styles change so fast that even a casual museum visitor can tell a twentieth-century painting from an older one, like the Mona Lisa. Art experts can often tell when a painting was made and who made it, but they might confuse two chimpanzee artists named Congo and Betsy. Congo made up to 33 paintings in one day and got upset when his pencil was taken away. In 1957, there was an art show in London for their paintings, and many of them sold, which is something many human artists cannot achieve.
These paintings by chimpanzees blur the lines between human art and animal behavior. Like human art, the chimpanzee paintings were not made for practical reasons; they were created for the satisfaction of the painter. You might argue that human art is different because most human artists want to communicate something. However, the chimpanzees did not care about sharing their art with others, as they often discarded their paintings. This point may not be as strong, since some famous human art was also created for personal satisfaction."
CAE_39,C1,"An Amazing Adventure**
The Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last unexplored places on Earth. It is also one of the most dangerous. Charles Blackmore crossed it and lived to tell his story. There are very few big adventures left and very few heroes. Children's stories used to have brave explorers with sunburnt skin and eyes focused on faraway places. Today, you do not find such people in stories or in real life. Or so I thought until I met Charles Blackmore.
Blackmore's big adventure was leading a group across the Taklamakan Desert. Its name means ""once entered, you never come out,"" but local people call it the Desert of Death. He remembered the dangers and excitement of that amazing journey while at home with his family. The team he led included four Britons (one was the medical officer), an American photographer, four Chinese experts, 30 camels, and six camel handlers. It turned out that the camel handlers had never worked with camels before; they were long-distance truck drivers. This misunderstanding could have been very dangerous and could have ruined the expedition.
This mixed group set out to cross 1,200 kilometers of the world's toughest desert, and Charles Blackmore wrote a fascinating account of their journey. At that time, he was about to leave the Army after 14 happy years. He started the expedition for fun, to fill a gap in his life, and to learn more about himself. ""I always thought I would spend my whole life in the Army. I was offered a promotion, but suddenly I wanted to see who I really was outside of that. It was a big risk. My wife, Tina, was very worried that I wouldn't come back because nobody had ever done that route before; we went into it without knowing what would happen. In the end, it took 59 days to cross from west to east, and the desert was very good to us.""
Anyone reading his amazing story will wonder why he used the word ""good."" The team faced many hardships: sickness, extreme temperatures, severe thirst, and losing part of their water supply. ""But,"" Blackmore explains, ""when we were at our limits and the camels had gone without water for seven days, we found some. We did not experience the desert's famous sandstorms. And we never faced the freezing cold that could have stopped us. That does not mean we did not have challenges. The fine sand got into everything, especially our blisters and wounds. The high dunes were hard to climb for us and for the heavy camels, which often rolled over onto us.""
""What pushed me on more than anything else was the need to survive. We had no backup plan. Our budget and time did not allow for one. No aircraft ever flew over us. Once we got into the sandhills, we were completely on our own. I knew I had the mental strength for the trip, but I was very scared about my physical ability. I remember the first day -- we sat at the edge of the desert, and it was so hot that it was hard to breathe. I thought, 'We have to do it now!' At that moment, I was very scared.""
If it was like that at the beginning, how did they feel at the end? ""When you've walked for 1,000 kilometers, you are not going to give up. You've gone through so much; you have so much behind you. We were very thin but also very strong despite our exhaustion. My body was fit, and my legs were like machines. I could walk over anything.""
In the middle of the book, Blackmore describes lying in the desert, looking up at a full moon, and thinking of his family. How aware was he of how hard it must have been for them? ""Inside me, there is someone trying to find peace. When I have doubts about myself now, I think back to the image of the desert and remember that we managed to do that together. I feel prouder of that expedition than of anything else I've done. Yet, when I think of my life, I think of my family and the happiness we share. Compared to that, the desert does not measure up.""
Has Charles Blackmore found peace? ""I long for the challenge and the open spaces. We were lifted by our sense of purpose. Now, I find it hard to be part of the sameness of modern life."""

Life was getting too busy for Susan Harr, so she decided to unplug her gadgets and enjoy doing things by hand. Many people love technology because it gives us useful devices that make life easier and give us more free time. However, Susan feels that we have become too dependent on technology. 
After a bad experience with her broken word processor, which cost her a lot of money to fix, she started to think that gadgets are often not worth it. She began to let go of some household technology as it broke down. This made her question what ""free time"" really means. Does it just mean we have more time to buy and use more gadgets? 
When her broken machine started making strange noises, she left it outside, where it now sits quietly. She enjoys sewing by hand instead of using a noisy machine. She likes that she can take her sewing with her wherever she goes. 
There are some gadgets she still finds useful, like her washing machine, but she has also found joy in living without others. For example, she returned her rented color TV and went back to a small black-and-white one. This change helped her family spend more time walking their dog, reading, talking, and enjoying other hobbies. 
Susan used to think she needed her sewing machine, but now it is just a table for plants. She has started sewing by hand and finds it relaxing. She can listen to the radio or talk to family while she sews. If the task is simple, she can even watch TV at the same time, which makes her feel less guilty about watching. 
Sewing by hand is not boring; it is satisfying and calming. She enjoys seeing her work become neater and feels that things get done quickly. Life feels slower and more enjoyable when she works with her hands. 
Susan has also started to enjoy washing dishes by hand, which allows her to daydream. Now, she looks around her house and wonders if she really needs things like a freezer, microwave, or electric lawnmower. She thinks they could save a lot of money by living without some of these gadgets. 
**Questions:**
1. Why did Susan Harr decide to unplug her gadgets?
2. What bad experience did Susan have with her word processor?
3. How did returning to a black-and-white TV change Susan's family's activities?
4. What does Susan enjoy about sewing by hand?
5. What does Susan think about the need for gadgets in her home?"

Charles Hurst is a cabinet-maker who makes beautiful furniture. Joanna Watt meets him. When I arrive at his workshop in East London, he greets me quickly with a handshake and says, ""Well, fire away then!"" He seems busy, and his workshop is full of unfinished furniture and pieces of wood in many colors. Hurst has been making furniture for ten years and has a good reputation. He always has many orders, even though he does not advertise himself. People know that if they want a good cupboard, table, or bookcase, Hurst is the right person to contact.
Finding a furniture-maker is not hard, but finding one who makes high-quality furniture is more difficult. Hurst says, ""There are few real cabinet-makers now. Many people call themselves furniture-makers."" He is often disappointed by the quality of modern furniture. He does not like cheap, mass-produced items and craftsmen who make low-quality pieces. Hurst's desire for perfection is a big part of his success, along with his talent. He is confident in his skills and says, ""I have a huge natural ability. I have always been good at making things."" 
Hurst learned his craft by asking questions and practicing. Most of his work comes from private clients. Some clients come back to him many times, which he finds very satisfying. However, he admits that not all client relationships are easy. He finds it frustrating when clients do not know what they want. He prefers clients who are clear about their needs.
Although Hurst is proud of his work, he also respects other craftsmen. He says, ""There are people far better than me."" He criticizes those who take too long to make one piece of furniture and does not like degree shows where students try to make their work look fashionable. He believes furniture should be practical and useful.
Hurst is confident but not pretentious. As I leave, he reminds me, ""After all, I am only making furniture."""
CAE_49,C1,"Three Theories About Sleep**
People spend about one-third of their lives sleeping. This shows that sleep is very important. However, scientists do not fully agree on why we need to sleep. There are three main theories.
The first theory says that sleep is important for our bodies. It claims that we sleep to keep our bodies healthy. While we sleep, our bodies work to fix any damage from the day and to help us feel better.
The second theory focuses on learning. It suggests that sleep helps us process the information we learn during the day. This means that without sleep, we might not be able to learn well.
The third theory is about energy. It says that we need to sleep to recharge our energy, so we are ready for the next day."
CAE_31,C1,"**ECCENTRICS**
An eccentric is someone whose behavior is unusual. They do not follow the accepted rules of their society. This raises the question, ""What is normal?"" Most of us have our own quirks and strange habits. It could be a love for entering newspaper contests, collecting beer mats, or writing letters to the editor about many topics. Eccentricity shows our individuality.
Inside us, there is often a struggle between two forces. One is called individualism, which is the desire to be unique, and the other is conformity, which is the desire to fit in. For many people, the need to be accepted and liked is stronger than the need to stand out and be different.
People with unusual hobbies or strong opinions often come together. They form clubs, hold meetings, and organize events to share their interests or problems. The key word here is 'common.' They look for others who understand what their friends and family might see as strange.
Most of us feel a tension between wanting to fit in and wanting to be ourselves. Even when we follow the crowd, we may not like being told that we are doing so. We want to show our individuality, like when a man at a bar says, ""I say what I think,"" or when a new person insists, ""You must take me as I am.""
Anyone can choose to be more individualistic at any time. Many people succeed in their careers by doing this. For example, Bob Dylan, the American singer, said, ""When you feel strongly about what you are doing, pursue it without giving up. You will surprise many people."" However, showing individuality is not the same as being eccentric, especially at first. 
When a pop singer wears strange clothes to get attention, or a socialite makes shocking comments to be noticed, that is not eccentricity. But if they continue these behaviors until they become part of who they are, then they might be considered eccentric. The most important part of eccentricity is that it is natural. Eccentrics do not try to be odd; they simply are.
True eccentrics do not care much about what others think. They act based on who they are. This makes them different from enthusiasts, pranksters, clever criminals, show-offs, and recluses. These people are aware of the world around them. They often act to impress others or to escape from society. In contrast, eccentrics go about their lives without worrying about what others think."
CAE_58,C1,"**Natural Books**
We asked four well-known naturalists to share the wildlife book that has influenced them the most.
**A. Geoffrey Lean**  
It was easy for me to choose the author. As an environmental journalist, I have met some important people in this field. One of them is Barbara Ward, a small and gentle woman. She is very important in environmental issues in Europe after the war. She combined her experiences from different environmental movements into her own strong ideas. When I was a young journalist, she helped me understand these issues better. Choosing the book was harder. It could have been *Only One Earth* or *Progress for a Small Planet*. But I believe Barbara's most important book is *The Home of Man*. It talks about the rapid growth of cities and the big themes she cared about. It is a powerful call for what we now call ""sustainable human development."" I have read many books since, but none are as good as this one.
**B. Linda Bennett**  
When I read *Signals for Survival* by Niko Tinbergen, I can hear the calls of herring gulls and remember the smell of the guano in the sun. This book wonderfully explains the interesting world of animal communication with words and pictures. After reading it, if you watch a gull colony, you will see how their chaotic activity is actually a well-organized social structure. You can identify which birds are partners and recognize families later in the season. Niko Tinbergen was a great behaviorist who wanted to share his findings with everyone. His work with talented wildlife artist Eric Ennion made this book special and interesting for anyone who loves wildlife. Ennion's paintings show how one gull can be aggressive while another is calm, showing the skill of a true naturalist.
**C. Lee Durrell**  
The book that has influenced me the most is *My Family and Other Animals* by Gerald Durrell. This book not only led me to a wonderful husband and a career in conservation, but it also deepened my love for the natural world. I was studying animal sounds in Madagascar when I first read it. After two years of challenges, this book made me feel hopeful again. It beautifully connects animals, people, joy, and nature, showing a world worth saving. Some people think humans are the worst because of the harm we have done to other species. But I remember Gerald as a boy in the book, seeing all living things as a family that is connected, no matter if they are good or bad. This is an important idea for everyone to understand.
**D. Bruce Pearson**  
I found *The Shell Bird Book* by James Fisher in my school library soon after it was published in 1966. I was immediately attracted to it, especially the 48 colorful bird paintings by Eric Ennion. These images caught my attention. I already had other bird books and had spent holidays learning to identify birds. They inspired me to start sketching what I saw. But *The Shell Bird Book* offered much more. It had beautiful paintings, chapters on bird migration, the history of birds in Britain, and even a chapter on birds in music, literature, and art. This wide range of information and exciting images encouraged me to appreciate birds and nature in a broader way. The book showed me that my emotional and creative responses to nature are just as important as scientific ones. Since art was my stronger subject, I began to see new opportunities for myself."
CAE_37,C1,"DO REVIEWS SELL BOOKS?**
We asked five British publishers about how book reviews affect sales. Here is what they said.
**Publisher A**  
Reviews are very important for publishers. They are the first thing we look at in newspapers. A study showed that many people said they bought a book because of reviews, more than because of ads or recommendations from friends. Authors feel differently about reviews. Both authors and publishers are upset when there are no reviews, but publishers are usually okay with bad reviews. They think that any review can help sales because readers want to see for themselves. Publishers like reviews that match their own opinions about a book since they are often the first to read it.
**Publisher B**  
Publishers and newspapers both care about book reviews, but they have different needs. Newspapers want to entertain their readers, while publishers want their books to be reviewed, especially in a good way. Book reviews today are better and more varied than they were 40 years ago. However, many paperback books still do not get enough attention. Publishers should not complain too much because they need reviews to help readers discover books and authors. A good review from a trusted source can really boost sales, especially if there are several good reviews.
**Publisher C**  
Reviews are very important for publishing. Without them, we would struggle to promote our books. Most of our books are not by famous authors, and we do not advertise much, so we rely on reviews from literary editors. Good reviews are often more valuable than ads because readers trust them. Publishers say they care more about the size of the review than its content. Good reviews can help a book and an author succeed, but they need support from other sources like recommendations from readers and good marketing.
**Publisher D**  
I wish I understood the relationship between publishing and reviewing in Britain! In the United States, a single review can make or break a book. Here, bookshops often do not pay much attention to reviews. Sometimes it takes many years of good reviews for people to notice a good writer. However, some poorly reviewed books still sell very well. It is unpredictable, but non-fiction books allow reviewers to share their knowledge about the topic instead of just focusing on the book.
**Publisher E**  
All publishers and writers hope for great reviews. But do they really help sell books? I once published a biography that received excellent reviews, but it did not sell well because people thought they could just read the reviews instead of buying the book. Does the name of the reviewer matter? Thirty years ago, if certain reviewers liked a book, people paid attention. Now, sometimes it is the unexpected reviewer or the creativity of the review that encourages people to buy the book."
CAE_2,C1,"**WEATHERVANE MAKER**
Making weathervanes is an old skill that goes back to ancient Egypt. Today, this craft is still alive in the workshop of Graham Smith. He is one of the few people in the country who makes hand-cut weathervanes. Graham creates unique designs based on what his customers want. ""This way, I can make a special item just for them,"" he says. Many of his customers are women who want to buy gifts for their husbands. They look for a special gift that shows the man's job or hobbies.
Graham's work is very different from the traditional cockerel design, which is the most common type of weathervane. The first weathervane he made was not a cockerel, but a witch on a broomstick. His friends liked the surprise gift he made for his wife and asked him to make weathervanes for them too. ""I realized that there are endless possibilities for designs,"" he says. Graham decided to focus on making weathervanes. He had trained as a precision engineer and worked in that field for 15 years. Then, he and his wife, Liz, decided to change their roles. She went to work as an architectural assistant, and he stayed home to take care of the children and grow his business. This was five years ago, and he is happy with his new path. ""My old job was not creative, but this work is exciting and artistic,"" he says. ""I really enjoy designing.""
Graham has now created over 100 original designs. He pays close attention to detail and always gets the customer's approval for the design before he starts cutting it by hand. He also keeps many traditional designs available because they are still popular. ""People like handmade items,"" Graham says. ""They want something a little different.""
Graham does not plan to expand his business because he wants to keep it as a rural craft. ""I have found my place in the market. People love unique items, and I feel satisfied when I see a simple shape turn into something almost lifelike,"" he says. ""For centuries, weathervanes have helped people understand the weather by showing changes in wind direction."" He adds, ""Now, with more people moving to the countryside, they want to add a special touch to their homes. This has helped crafts like mine.""
Graham is now busier than ever, sending flat-packed weathervanes to customers around the world. Buyers from America and Denmark are especially interested. ""The price depends on how detailed the design is,"" he explains. His latest request was for a curly-coated dog. No matter the occasion, Graham can create a special gift."
CAE_68,C1,"'Beginner Takes All'**
Before it was published, *The Horse Whisperer* was the most talked-about book of the year. It is the first novel by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans, and it has made him a lot of money. Here, he shares his inspiration and success.
At the start of the year, Nicholas Evans was having a tough time. A film project he had been working on, called *Life and Limb*, fell apart suddenly. He was worried because it had been two years since he had earned any money, and he was in debt to his bank. A smart person in his situation would have found a job, maybe returning to television. But instead, he made a surprising choice. He bought a ticket to America and went there for three months to research his first novel.
Even though he was acting on impulse, he had an idea for the story for a while. He had met a farrier (a person who shoes horses) while visiting a friend in Dartmoor. The farrier told him about a gentle horse that suddenly became aggressive. The owners were desperate until they heard about a gypsy who could calm the horse just by talking to it. These special people were called ""horse whisperers."" This story inspired Evans.
He started to research horse whisperers to write a screenplay, as he was a filmmaker. But after the failure of *Life and Limb*, he decided to write the story as a book. During the spring, he traveled across the US, visiting ranches and learning about horses and the people who work with them. He later said, ""It was a strange time. I was watching people, but I felt alone and worried about my life. I had tried for ten years to succeed as a filmmaker, and now I was in debt and unsure how to support my family.""
By the end of August, he had returned home and written the first half of the book. He was still worried about money and needed to know if he should continue. He showed the book to a friend who was a literary agent. The agent read it and said it was ""fine."" When asked, he thought Evans might get $30,000 as an advance for the book. Evans needed more money to pay off his debts. He had spent seven months on *The Horse Whisperer* and still had at least two months of work left.
In October, he sent the first two hundred pages of the novel and a 12-page summary to seven UK publishers just before the Frankfurt Book Fair. Soon, his agent called to say he had turned down the first offer of $75,000. Evans was shocked and asked, ""What?"" The agent replied, ""It's okay, I feel something good is happening.""
What happened next was amazing. Within a week, the novel was sold to Transworld Publications in the UK for £550,000 and to Delacorte in the US for $3.15 million, both record amounts for a first novel. Evans said, ""We couldn't believe it; we were in shock. We never sent the manuscript to New York, and we still don’t know how it got there."" They also did not send it to Hollywood, but soon major film studios were interested in it. 
Evans's UK agent worked with an agent in the US, and when they said they could get $3 million for the film rights, they laughed in disbelief. They all agreed to this amount, and that night, four famous filmmakers called Evans to ask for the chance to pay $3 million for his unfinished novel.
Evans shared this story while we drank coffee on his porch overlooking his garden. He mentioned that he had turned down an offer to write the screenplay for *The Horse Whisperer*. He said, ""It has been like a fairy tale. I don’t want to ruin it. Writing at that level is very hard, and I don’t want to become just an employee of these people who have paid me so much money. I would hate to write a draft and then have them say, 'Thanks, Nick, but we will hire someone else now.'""
He wanted to stay involved but from a distance. The success of his novel led to new support for *Life and Limb*, but he was not sure if he wanted to make it anymore. He said, ""I think it would be foolish not to write another novel."""
CAE_23,C1,"'Young Masters'**
Bobby Fischer is trying to return to chess, but age is against him. Chess is now more of a young man's game. After being away from chess for 20 years, Fischer is back and playing against his old rival, Boris Spassky. Fischer won the first game, which was impressive, but he is not the same player he was in 1972. He is now 49 years old, out of practice, and not in good shape. Spassky is even older.
Chess has changed a lot in the last 20 years. Fischer helped make chess popular, and now there is a professional chess circuit. Winning is the main goal for modern players. In international chess, a player’s nerves and stamina are just as important as their intelligence. The pressure in chess has always been high. Players use a chess clock to make sure they finish their moves in time. If they don’t, they lose the game. Now, games can last longer, and many are played without breaks. This has made it harder for older players.
In the last 30 years, every new world champion has been younger than the last. Of the ten best players in the world, eight are under 30. The way chess is played has also changed. Many players prepare off the board, using computers to study their opponents. A small computer can store one million chess games and help players find weaknesses in their rivals. In recent matches, players have had teams of helpers working to find mistakes in each other’s games. The beginning of a chess game is now studied very carefully, and being well-prepared can decide the game.
Today, there are more great players than ever before. Many grandmasters compete for small prizes around the world. Success in chess requires both physical and mental effort. A single game can last up to eight hours, and players must stay focused. A moment of distraction can lead to losing. The chess clock adds to the stress, and the end of the game can be very intense. Players often have only seconds to make their moves, and they must act quickly. This creates a situation where nerves and determination are crucial to winning.
At the highest level of chess, losing is very painful. Winning brings great joy and a chance to recover from the stress. However, one win is not enough to win a tournament. Chess tournaments usually last 9-11 days, with games every day. World championship matches can be even tougher. For example, a match between Anatoli Karpov and Gary Kasparov in 1984 had to stop after several months because both players were exhausted. Karpov lost a lot of weight during that time.
Can Bobby Fischer overcome these challenges? He once said, ""All I want to do is play chess."" This makes his long absence from the game surprising. But it also made him a legend. If he has returned for the money, he is in a good position, as both he and Spassky will earn millions from their match. However, if Fischer believes he can prove he is still the best player, the outcome could be very disappointing for him."
CAE_60,C1,"Fame and Fortune**
Imogen Edwards-Jones talks to some new British talents, from poets to pop stars, who are becoming famous.
A. Nick Grosso is in his early 30s and has written three well-received plays. He is now turning his first play, Peaches, into a movie script. ""It's low budget, but we don't know how low,"" he says. ""It won't be over £30 million, but it could be as low as £30."" Nick is very talented, but the surprising thing is that before writing Peaches, he had never been to a play or read one. ""When I wrote the play, I never thought it would be performed,"" he says. ""It's set in a car. I probably wouldn't do that now because I know it would be hard to manage. I knew nothing back then."" He left school at 16 but returned a year later. After finishing A-levels, he joined the Young People's Theatre. ""I realized I wanted to write for actors. I wanted my writing to be heard, not just read, because of the rhythm and rhyme,"" he explains. ""Suddenly, I was with people who thought like me. It was the first time I enjoyed being in school. It was very inspiring.""
B. Comedian Simon Pegg, 28, has come a long way since studying drama at Bristol University. He is now writing a TV comedy series and has just finished a tough tour with comedy star Steve Coogan. He has always worked hard. Even in Bristol, he was practicing his comedy in clubs. ""University was very theoretical,"" Simon remembers. ""It made me realize I didn't want to be a serious actor; I was always more interested in comedy. People think comedy is the hardest job, but it really isn't. If you have courage and good material, it's great to make people laugh."" He has performed with the comedy group Funny Business, but his work with Steve Coogan has been the most successful. ""He saw my show, and since I was a big fan of his, he probably noticed I was copying him,"" Simon admits.
C. Ciaran McMenamin, 24, became known when he danced on TV as the lead in the series The Young Person's Guide To Becoming A Rock Star. The response was very positive, and his career has taken off quickly. ""It's been a great opportunity for me,"" he says with a smile. ""Now I can choose what I want to do, which is what I've always wanted."" This is a comfortable position for him, especially since he just graduated. Looking back at his early career, it's clear he was always meant to succeed. Encouraged by his mother, he went from leading roles in school to the Ulster Youth Theatre, where he stayed for four years. ""I was using acting to avoid homework,"" Ciaran laughs. ""But then I decided I wanted to take it seriously because I had a talent and passion for it."" Now he is waiting for the praise to come, but when asked about fame, he becomes thoughtful. ""When you're 18, you think you'll love the photos and interviews, but you soon realize that's not why you act. It's about getting respect for doing good work.""
D. Neil Taylor, 25, is the lead singer of the pop band Matrix, which has just signed a deal for three albums with Domino Records. Neil and his bandmate Rick Brown are expected to be very successful when their single, Chimera, is released soon. ""The record company has a different idea of good sales than I do,"" he says. ""They want a big hit, but for me, if two people buy it, I'll be happy."" Unlike many new pop stars, Neil has worked hard for his success. He left school at 16 and has been trying to enter the music business ever since. ""It's funny how things happen,"" he says. ""I had been performing at student gigs for eight years and was starting to feel tired. I was about to give up when I met Rick Brown, who had connections at Domino, and we formed Matrix. It couldn't have come at a better time. There were times I felt very down, and I was in some terrible bands. But hopefully, it will all be worth it.""
E. Poet and author Stephen Richards is 27 years old and has won many awards and honors. He is well known in the poetry world, where he has been touring and giving readings several times a week for the past six years. His first novel, Hidden, will be published in March. ""It's a story about obsessive love. It was a strong idea that I couldn't write as a poem."" Stephen loved creative writing in school but lost interest in education later. ""I decided not to go to university, but I became bored stuffing envelopes at a theater and realized I should go."" After university, he published his first work, a children's book, in 1992. ""I don't think my parents expected me to be a writer; they thought I would just be a reader because that's all I did as a child."" With his poetry getting great reviews, moving to novels is a brave step. ""My poetry has a structure, and there is less chance of making big mistakes,"" he explains. ""A novel can be any length, so there are more words that could be bad. My main goal is not to just write a lot without caring about the quality."""

A. Isabel is a 31-year-old art student who thinks she looks good in jeans, but she rarely wears them. She is worried that her knees might ruin her chances of finding the right man. Despite this, she remains hopeful, which helps her and others in the story. The author writes in a lively style, using chapter titles like ""Our Hero Feels Inspired,"" similar to an early silent film.
B. This story is about a local radio station in America that almost fails. It is told from the perspective of a smart, shy child named Francis With. Francis works for WLT (With Lettuce and Tomato) Radio, which was started by Roy and Ray Soderbjerg to promote their sandwich shop. The station plays a mix of singers, preachers, and announcers. The author uses humor and simple writing to take readers back to the 1940s and 1950s, a time of old stores and classic cars.
C. In this story, it is normal for a second husband to talk to his wife's first husband. When professor Richard Vaisey falls in love with a Russian poetess, he shares his feelings with her ex-husband. The poetess writes bad poetry and wants Richard's help for her brother, who is in prison. The author skillfully tells the story with humor and insight into relationships, making it an enjoyable and clever read.
D. In 1960s London, two sets of best friends—two women and two men—are connected for 25 years. At the beginning of the novel, James Hudson, a wealthy American, is starting a newspaper with his friend Richard Blake as the editor. The launch is important, but so is the fact that a woman they both loved, and one of them married, was killed years ago. The story includes murder, ambition, love, and jealousy, and the writing is strong. This book allows readers to really get to know the characters.
E. This story, written by a great American author, is about Ian Bedloe, who feels guilty about something he did. To make up for it, he becomes a father figure to his brother's three orphaned children. At 40, he is slowly becoming an unusual bachelor. The story explores many emotions and shows the special bond Ian forms with the youngest child, Daphne. It is a warm and lovely book that balances sadness and humor."
CAE_53,C1,"**Volunteer Tourism**
Four writers discuss international volunteer work. 
A. It is difficult to say that volunteer work really helps development a lot. While volunteer tourists can help build homes or schools, they usually pay a large fee to do this work. This money could be given directly to a local community, which could pay for more labor than one volunteer can provide. This is especially true for gap year volunteers, who often do not have much technical skill or professional experience. Many studies question whether gap year volunteering is mainly about helping others or if young people want to gain experience that will help their careers. However, these projects can help develop people who will act ethically and help those in need in the future.
B. Volunteering can lead to better international understanding, improved conflict resolution skills, and more participation in global issues through civic organizations. It can also help create international social networks among regular people. In this way, the benefits can be greater for both volunteers and the communities they help. However, if volunteering is mostly done by wealthy people, it may help them gain a global perspective and improve their careers, but it will not help those who do not have access to these opportunities.
C. At its worst, international volunteering can be seen as a form of charity that benefits wealthy Westerners more than the communities they aim to help. At its best, it can provide benefits to both volunteers and the organizations they work with, while allowing for the sharing of skills and experiences in developing communities. Most importantly, volunteering can raise awareness about the unequal power relations and deep-rooted causes of poverty and injustice.
D. Volunteer tourism fits well with the idea of helping others. These small efforts to ""make a difference"" can seem positive, especially when people are frustrated with big governments and businesses. However, this approach can ignore the need for democratic government and reduce development to individual acts of charity, which may not truly change the situations of poor communities. While volunteering can be a good act, when it is promoted as sustainable development, it can show a misunderstanding of the real issues of global inequality and poverty faced by many in developing countries."
CAE_55,C1,"Sound the Alarm**
Stuart Harris reports
Many of us listen to the radio in the morning, and we often need something to help us get out of bed. This is why we have clock radios. But how do you choose a good one? A group of us, including myself, inventor Tom Granger, and broadcaster Paul Bridges, tested five clock radios that are available now.
One model has a 'dual alarm function'. This means you can set two different wake-up times, one for work days and one for weekends. However, it does not let you snooze and then wake up later, as I first thought. Since this model costs about the same as another one we tested, having a cassette player is a good deal. You can listen to your favorite tapes to fall asleep and wake up to a quiet morning. We all agreed that the radio quality was excellent, but the size was a problem. It is as big as a rugby ball. Paul Bridges said, ""Any clock radio I buy must leave enough space on my bedside table for my keys, wallet, glasses, and phone. I always book a wake-up call just in case the alarm doesn’t work.""
This model was voted the best-looking and overall winner. Paul Bridges said he was ""in love with it,"" even though the clock he tested kept getting stuck at 16:00. I liked the digital display with its nice grey numbers on a soft green background. The snooze button is wide, so you can tap it easily with your eyes closed. However, the buttons felt nice to touch, which made me play with them too much. The clock has a backup battery, so you don’t have to reset it if the power goes out. We all liked this feature. But we found it hard to set up, even though learning to use it made us feel cool.
Tom Granger thought this model, which has a built-in lamp, was ""very cheap"" in quality. He had to read the instructions twice to get it to work because the clock kept changing from 12:00 to 02:00. The lamp was hard to adjust, and you couldn’t read by it because it only shines on the clock, which is already lit. Paul Bridges found the lamp funny but agreed that the radio was difficult to tune. The buzzer sounded like an alarm on a submarine, which made me want to throw it across the room. Interestingly, this model is the third most popular on the market. It is aimed at young people, with its bright colors and fun design. Tom Granger said, ""I would choose this one because it stands out more than the others."" 
The traditional controls made it the only model we could set up without reading the instructions. Unfortunately, the alarm can be off by 20 minutes; the manual says, ""the alarm may sound about 10 minutes earlier or later than the set time."" Paul Bridges laughed at this idea and said this model was ""very annoying"" and ""completely useless.""
The simplest and cheapest model we tested was liked by Tom Granger because it was ""very standard and took up little space."" It has old-fashioned dial tuning, which he found easier to use. ""With modern push-button tuning, you’re never sure if you pressed the buttons in the right order,"" he said. However, he agreed that manufacturers had to improve radio quality because of button-tuning. I thought the tuning was not very good, as did Paul Bridges, but we agreed that the radio quality was fine. The buzzer on this model worked well; it got me out of bed in just two beeps!"
CAE_50,C1,"Hedgehogs**
A hedgehog is a small animal with sharp spines on its body. Hedgehogs live in many parts of the world, but they are not found in America or Australia. All hedgehogs can roll into a tight ball when they are in danger, so their spines point outwards. This helps protect them, but how well it works depends on how many spines they have. Some hedgehogs that live in the desert have fewer spines because they need to be lighter. These hedgehogs are more likely to run away from danger instead of rolling up. 
Hedgehogs are mostly active at night and sleep during the day, often hiding under bushes or in holes in the ground. Although all hedgehogs can hibernate, not all of them do. In good conditions, some hedgehogs stay awake all year."
CAE_25,C1,"Great Sportswomen on a Winning Streak**
It is hard to be good at any sport, even for men, but women often have to work even harder. Training and competitions take a lot of time, so they have to make sacrifices. Despite this, they are overcoming challenges and breaking records. Here, we talk to some amazing British sportswomen who are reaching their goals.
A. **Jill, 27, Skier**  
""It's a great feeling to fly through the air and land safely, but it can be scary. Sometimes I don’t feel well or it’s windy, and I can’t see well, but I keep going. It’s hard to have a life outside skiing because we train for ten months each year. I give up a lot of my social life and friends, but it was my choice. There are six men and three women on the British team. We all compete on the same courses and get treated the same - it’s a young sport.""
B. **Caroline, 22, Cyclist**  
""Two years ago, I borrowed a bike to join a charity race. I won because I cycled faster than everyone else, which was amazing since I had never cycled before! I earn good money as a professional cyclist, and there are many opportunities for sponsorship. However, I worry that people might think I am successful because of my looks, not because I am a good cyclist. So, I focus on cycling and train for at least four hours every day, plus some stretching, swimming, and running. My boyfriend is also a cyclist, so he understands how much time it takes.""
C. **Annabel, 26, Rower**  
""Rowing is hard for girls because very few schools offer it. Most girls start when they are 19 or 20, which makes it harder to succeed internationally. Also, coaches often change, so the women’s team lacks stability. But I enjoy it and love being fit, plus there is a good social life.""
D. **Ffyona, 24, Long-Distance Walker**  
""When I was 13, I dreamed of walking around the world, not knowing how big it was! I felt trapped in Britain and didn’t like anyone controlling me. Now, I am more careful. Each walk has been different. Walking across Australia was the hardest experience for me. I walked 50 miles a day with little sleep and many blisters on my feet. But I set a record! I had to because my sponsorship money would run out after 95 days. Some men think women are more likely to fail, so they see sponsoring us as a risk.""
E. **Lisa, 26, Saloon Car Racer**  
""Some men have big egos when driving. When I do well, they often ignore me. Being a woman has its challenges. When I reach a corner, some men think, 'I have to beat her,' so I have had many tough moments! You need to be competitive and strong. It is hard to earn money, and what I do make goes back into racing. Women have been racing since the 1920s and have often been seen as unusual. It’s great that more women are starting to race every year. I love saloon car racing because I always aim for a perfect lap.""
F. **Alison, 28, Triathlete**  
""I wake up at 5:30 three mornings a week to swim. I need Tuesday and Thursday mornings to catch up on sleep. In the evenings, I cycle or run. Yes, I sometimes fall asleep at my desk! There is a lot of pressure before a race, and when I compete, I really push myself. I often ask myself why I do this. The answer is: a) I am happier when I stay fit, b) I would be lazy if I didn’t push myself, and c) racing is very social. Men and women usually compete together, but when events are covered in the news, 90% of the articles focus on the men’s events, and only 10% mention the women’s events. The prize money is not as good for women either. But now we have formed an International Triathlon Women’s Commission to help improve this."""
CAE_34,C1,"
The day I met Picasso
Richard Cork remembers how, as a 78-year-old student, he met one of the most famous artists of the century. Even from a distance, he could see Picasso eating lunch at an outdoor restaurant in Cannes. I was an 18-year-old student, traveling around Europe and Morocco in an old van. I had run out of money and found a job painting boats by the water. But I spent a lot of time drawing and was lucky to have my sketchbook with me when I saw the famous artist.
Picasso was known to be a private person who usually stayed away from others to work. So, I was very surprised to see him sitting at a table with his wife, Jacqueline, and three friends. Without my friend's encouragement, I would never have had the courage to go over and ask for his signature. I was nervous when I introduced myself and offered my sketchbook, but he kindly agreed. He wrote his name at the top of the page and then added some lively lines below. Picasso's art often showed things from real life, so the lines might have represented a cloud, the sea, or the shape of Cannes harbor.
I thanked him and started a shy conversation. Since Picasso's English was not very good and my French was not great either, an American woman at the table helped us communicate. She kept calling him ""the Maestro,"" which made it hard for me to speak. But I told Picasso that I loved art and admired his work. After a while, I went back to my boat and proudly showed my friend what I had. But my friend noticed that Picasso was still having lunch. ""Is that all?"" he asked, looking at the signature. ""Why don’t you go back and talk to him more? You won’t get another chance like this!""
With my sketchbook under my arm, I returned to Picasso's table. I thought it was better not to ask if I could draw his portrait, as he might say no. So, I just stood by the table, put my pad against a screen, took out a crayon, and started to draw. When Picasso saw me, he smiled and made it hard for me to draw. He acted out funny faces, rolling his eyes and sticking out his tongue. It was like he was playing a game. I wanted to give up, but his playful spirit made me want to keep going. 
Finally, Picasso relaxed and let me study him without moving. I noticed how strong and alert he looked, wearing a blue-and-white striped shirt. He looked much younger than his age, with bright, dark eyes that were very intense. His eyes were captivating, and I tried to capture their strength in my drawing. Even though he was surrounded by friends, he seemed to be in his own world, quietly focused on his own thoughts.
When the American lady told me that Picasso wanted to see my drawing, I felt shy and said it wasn’t good enough. But Picasso insisted, and when I showed him my sketch, he nodded in approval. Then, to my surprise, he said it was his turn to draw. I quickly gave him my crayon, and he made a few quick strokes on the paper. In seconds, he drew a bearded face that looked very different from my careful drawing. He had moved one of my eyes onto my nose and captured my smile with just one lively line. I looked like a character from one of his playful artworks.
I thanked Picasso and asked if he would sign my drawing. The American lady explained that he said I already had his signature. So, he was not going to give me another one! Still, I feel very lucky to have met Picasso and to have received his attention. It meant a lot to me. 
**Questions:**
1. How old was Richard Cork when he met Picasso?
2. Where did Richard see Picasso?
3. What job did Richard have before meeting Picasso?
4. Who helped Richard and Picasso communicate?
5. What did Picasso do when Richard started to draw him?
6. How did Richard feel about meeting Picasso?"
CAE_12,C1,"Shopping Tricks**
Have you ever gone into a store and bought more than you planned? Here are some tricks that shops use to make you spend more money.
A. **Freshness First**  
Supermarkets know that people like fresh food. They often put fruits and vegetables at the entrance of the store. Some even have bakeries that fill the air with the smell of fresh bread. The colors in the store, like green, can also make you think of fresh food. However, most of what supermarkets sell, like frozen foods and cleaning products, is not fresh.
B. **Smart Displays**  
Where products are placed in the store is very important for sales. Supermarkets use computers to find out which areas shoppers visit the most. They put high-profit items in these areas. Products at eye level are more likely to be bought. Special offers in 'dump bins' attract bargain hunters. Sometimes, they place related items together, like ice cream next to dessert toppings.
C. **Hiding Essentials**  
Supermarkets often place basic items like bread and sugar far from the entrance. This way, shoppers pass by more tempting, expensive items on their way. Stores may also put popular products far from the entrance, hoping that loyal customers will look for them and see other items along the way.
D. **Less is More**  
Chain stores have changed how they display their products. For example, the Next chain shows fewer items on the shelves, making them seem special. Even though their clothes are mass-produced, their store design helps them sell better.
E. **Total Costs Matter**  
Shoppers care more about the total cost of their shopping than the price of each item. Supermarkets mix cheap and expensive items to attract customers. They sometimes sell basic items at a loss to bring people in, which is called 'loss leaders.' They also get discounts from manufacturers by buying in large amounts.
F. **Price Tags**  
In chain stores, shoppers usually buy fewer items and pay more attention to prices. For example, pricing a blouse at £14.99 instead of £15 can make a difference. This pricing strategy can also help reduce theft by making staff ring up sales for small change.
G. **Lighting Matters**  
Both supermarkets and chain stores think carefully about lighting. Chain stores try to use natural light so customers can see the true colors of clothes. Supermarkets use special lighting to make fresh foods look more appealing.
H. **Guiding Shoppers**  
Many chain stores use different carpet patterns to guide shoppers. One pattern shows the paths through the store, while another marks sales areas. Some stores, like Marks and Spencer, use nicer carpets in sales areas to encourage shoppers to explore.
I. **In-Store Promotions**  
When you enter a supermarket, you often see big pictures of delicious food, which can make you hungry. In the U.S., some supermarkets are testing 'video trolleys' that show ads for products while you shop. These trolleys aim to attract impulse buyers and can increase sales by about 30%."
CAE_26,C1,"Sea, Ice & Rock**
Chris Bonnington (58) is famous for climbing Mount Everest in 1985. He has also created new climbing routes in Britain and the Alps and has written many books, such as *Quest for Adventure* and *Everest the Hard Way*. Robin Knox-Johnston (53) started his career at sea in the Merchant Navy. In 1968-1969, he was the first person to sail around the world alone in his yacht, Sunhaili. He set a record for crossing the Atlantic Ocean, taking just 10 days to sail from New York to the Lizard in England. 
Chris and Robin worked together to sail and climb in Greenland, and they wrote about their journey in their new book, *Sea, Ice and Rock*. In 1979, while working on *Quest for Adventure*, I called Robin to ask for an interview. He invited me to join him for a sail. I could teach him some climbing techniques, and he could teach me how to sail. It was my first time on a yacht. We sailed for a while and then stopped. Robin's wife and daughter stayed on the boat while we paddled to shore to practice climbing. The route was difficult, but I was impressed by how steady Robin was in tough conditions. 
When we reached a big drop, I asked Robin if he had ever climbed before. He hadn’t, so I showed him how to do it. After I finished, Robin politely asked if he could go down the way he used ropes on his boat. He was used to using his arms, but I wanted him to use his legs. I was not very happy about it, but he safely lowered himself down. During that trip to Skye, Robin and I became good friends. His idea to combine our skills for a trip to Greenland was a natural next step after our time in Skye. 
Robin impressed me as a leader. Normally, the captain makes all the decisions, but Robin asked everyone for their opinions first. Most of the time, people were too afraid to give advice, but it felt good to be part of the decision-making. To be honest, I found sailing difficult and boring. The moments of crisis were easy to handle because they made me excited. The hard part was spending many days in the middle of the sea. I prefer being on land and am not very handy. Robin, on the other hand, is a natural sailor and enjoyed fixing the engine or the toilet. I felt that Robin didn’t really need me, which made me feel a bit useless at times. 
The crew was also very close together: six people on a 32-foot yacht that was meant for four. When we reached Greenland and it was my turn to lead the expedition, I found it hard to be responsible for Robin’s safety. There were many times when if Robin had fallen, he could have pulled me down with him. I had to be careful about that. I also underestimated how hard climbing Cathedral, Greenland's highest mountain, would be. Robin is not a natural climber, which made his efforts even more impressive. 
The first time we tried to reach the top, we were climbing for 24 hours. On the way down, we were so tired that we almost fell asleep on steep slopes, 1,500 feet above the ground. Robin worked very hard, but he trusted me completely. He just followed my lead. When it became too difficult and I knew we had to turn back, he accepted it. I also knew that Robin was worried about the boat: whether it would get through the ice and if it was okay. Still, he wanted to try climbing the mountain again. 
The only time we had a problem was on the yacht on the way home. We were taking turns to keep watch. I was supposed to wake up at 4 am for my shift, but Robin decided not to wake me. He thought he could handle it alone. The night before, I had almost fallen asleep. I felt that he didn’t trust me, which made me feel insecure, and I told him. Robin quickly reassured me that I was wrong to think that. 
While we enjoyed the trip to Skye, we didn’t really get to know each other until the end of the Greenland expedition. I found that beneath his tough exterior, Robin was a kind and sensitive person."
CAE_8,C1,"**A History of the Apple**
Apples have been part of human life for a very long time, in many different colors, shapes, and sizes. However, in the late twentieth century, we risk losing this important part of our history.
**Prehistoric Times (8,000 BC)**  
People have been eating apples since ancient times. In neolithic Britain, they would spit out apple seeds. About 10,000 years ago, they left apple remains near lakes in Switzerland and Italy. In Switzerland and near the Caucasus mountains, ancient people even stored dried apple halves for winter. These apples were wild crab apples, small and not like the apples we eat today.
**Norman Knowledge (1000 AD)**  
The French learned how to grow fruit from the Romans, and this knowledge was brought to Britain. The Romans introduced some apple varieties, but many did not grow well in Britain. British monks continued to experiment and create new apple types, which are the ancestors of many Western apples today.
**Medieval Favorites (1200)**  
In the thirteenth century, several apple types became popular in Britain. The Old English Pearmain, known for its pear-like shape, was the main dessert apple until the eighteenth century. The Costard was a cooking apple sold in Oxford markets from 1296 until the late seventeenth century. However, the country faced problems like droughts and the Black Death, which led to fewer apples being produced and more being imported. In the sixteenth century, King Henry VIII sent his fruit expert, Richard Harris, to France to learn about apple growing. Harris returned with many new apple types, including the famous Pippins, and started the first modern orchard in Kent.
**Settler Treasure (1750)**  
By the seventeenth century, apples were very popular in Britain. The first settlers who went to Canada, Australia, the US, South Africa, and New Zealand took apples and seeds with them. Captain Bligh took apples to Australia, and the Pilgrim Fathers brought them to America. In North America, John Chapman, known as 'Johnny Appleseed', planted apple trees across several states. He was seen as a kind man and became part of many stories.
**Modern Delicious (1850)**  
Around this time, a Quaker farmer named Jesse Hiatt found a new apple tree growing from a dead tree's roots in Iowa. He named this apple 'Hawkey'. When he showed it at a fruit show, a judge tasted it and said it was 'Delicious'. In 1895, this apple was sold as 'Delicious' and became very popular worldwide.
**Granny Smith (1850)**  
Another famous apple, the Granny Smith, was found in Australia by Maria Anne Smith. She was the daughter of convicts and worked as a midwife. In 1868, she discovered a small tree growing among discarded fruit. She moved it, and soon she was harvesting green apples that became famous worldwide. She said, ""It's just like God to make something useful out of what we think is rubbish,"" referring to both the apple and her own background.
**Uniformity Issues (1950)**  
Today, apples are grown all over the world, but most come from just a few varieties chosen for their appearance and how well they travel, not for their taste. This lack of variety is a problem, as it reduces the different types of apples available. While some gardeners in the UK have kept old apple types alive, many apples in the US have been lost. However, people are starting to want more variety. We cannot rely only on amateur gardeners to save apple diversity; we must work to protect and value the natural variety of apples for everyone’s benefit."

Richard Nerurkar is a long-distance runner from Britain, known for running 10,000 meters. He visits a training camp in Kenya, which is located ten miles south of the equator. A beautiful mountain path starts from a quiet road in Nairobi and leads to Mount Kenya, the highest peak in the country. This place, called Nanyuk, has been Richard's base for training in the winter for three years. However, he had never trained with Kenyan runners before. 
On his fourth trip to Kenya, Richard decided to change this. He ran in his first race in Kenya and stayed at the national team training camp, where the best Kenyan runners prepare for the World Cross-Country Team Championships. He was invited by the national team coach after finishing fifth in the World Championship 10,000 meters race, behind three Kenyans and a Moroccan. This was a great opportunity for him.
Training at high altitude helps runners produce more red blood cells, which improves their ability to carry oxygen. This is one reason why many Kenyan runners are successful. Richard's first race in Africa was also special because it was the first international cross-country race held on the continent. He finished behind 41 runners, most of whom were Kenyan, but he felt he did well.
Richard believes that Kenyan runners' success is not only because of the high altitude. They have a simple approach to running. Their running style looks easy, their diet is simple, and they enjoy competing. But how do they train? Richard found out during his stay at the training camp.
The camp is at St Mark's College, 6,200 feet up Mount Kenya, surrounded by beautiful fields and plants. The living conditions are basic; the athletes share rooms with college students. Their daily routine includes three workouts: a morning run, interval training in the middle of the day, and a steady run in the late afternoon. They start their day at six in the morning. The coach tells them to run easily because they have a tough day ahead. They run about 40 kilometers each day, except on Sundays when they only run 20 kilometers.
Life at the camp is simple. They wash their faces and brush their teeth before breakfast, which includes tea, bread, and boiled eggs. Lunch and dinner are similar, with ugali (a maize dish), stew, cabbage or spinach, and tea. After running, they drive to a stream to bathe.
By the end of his stay, Richard understood more about why Kenyan runners are successful. Their success is not just because of their genes, upbringing, or altitude. He thought that the simple life in the mountains, hard training, and their passion for running might be the real reasons for Kenya's success in distance running."
CAE_7,C1,"The Challenges of Mass Marketing**
Almost everyone knows that advertising is struggling. This problem is not just because of the recession; advertising started to decline in 1989, before the recession really affected the economy. The issues with advertising are more serious and are happening all over the world. The sad truth is that advertising has not kept up with changes in the economy. Advertisers often think about large groups of people and mass media, but as brands and media have increased, target markets have become smaller and more specific. Even big brand campaigns should focus on smaller audiences, but they usually do not.
Think about your own shopping habits. When you go to a supermarket, you might buy 30, 40, or even 50 items. Most of these items are not from advertised brands, and you may buy several of the same brand. In total, you probably only buy a few advertised brands from the thousands available in the store. Over a year, you are unlikely to buy more than a few hundred different brands. For things like cars, you might only buy one every three years, and you do not buy many clothes either, most of which are not from advertised brands. In total, you probably do not buy more than 400 different brands in a year, compared to the 32,500 brands that are advertised.
If we look at the 9,500 brands that are listed and analyzed by Media Register, the average person only buys about 400 of them, which is about 4 percent. This means that a lot of advertising is not effective. When you watch TV, count how many commercials are for brands you buy or might buy. Most people find that only about 6 percent of the ads are relevant to them, meaning that 94 percent of the ads are likely wasted.
You might think you are different and that you do not respond to advertising, but most people feel the same way. The truth is that most people do not buy the brands they see advertised. There is always some waste in advertising because not everyone who sees an ad will buy the product. However, advertising can still be effective. Many ads have shown that they work. Advertisers need to reach a lot of people to find the few who will respond, as they cannot know in advance who will be interested.
Even the best-targeted advertising does not get a 100 percent response. This is different from face-to-face selling, where a salesperson might succeed with every customer they talk to. If advertisers knew exactly who would respond, they would not need to use mass media at all. Any advertiser who can gain one million new customers is doing well. For popular products, gaining a million extra customers would be a great success. Therefore, any advertising campaign that can reach even 2 percent of the population is considered very successful. To improve advertising, the messages need to be more focused on specific audiences than ever before."

**Solar Survivor: Charles Clover Visits a Green Home**
Charles Clover explores one of the most environmentally-friendly homes in Britain. This house is in Southwell, Nottinghamshire, which has some interesting surprises. The first surprise is Southwell Minster, a little-known ancient cathedral. It is famous for the 'green' men figures carved by medieval craftsmen in its thirteenth-century chapter house. The second surprise is the 'autonomous house,' built by Robert and Brenda Vale. 
The Vales use rainwater for washing and drinking, recycle their sewage into compost for the garden, and heat their home using waste heat from their electrical appliances and their own body heat, along with that of their three teenage children and two cats, Edison and Faraday. The house looks traditional, with a clay tile roof, and is located 300 yards from the Minster. It was designed to match the orange brick of the town's old buildings and was approved by planners, even though it is in a conservation area.
When you ring the solar-powered doorbell, you hear no sound. The house is very well-insulated, with special windows that keep noise out. Inside, it is very quiet. On a sunny summer day, the windows are closed, and the conservatory warms the air before it goes into the house. Robert opens clever ventilation shafts and windows to create air movement because the house is designed to keep out drafts. Even the cats have their own small air-locked door.
The Vales, who teach architecture at Nottingham University, cared about the environment long before it became popular. They wrote a book about green architecture in the 1970s called *The Autonomous House*. They first designed a building that produced no carbon dioxide, and then they decided to not use mains water. They created composting toilets, put rainwater tanks in the cellar, and used copper gutters to keep the drinking water clean. They filter the water before using it. Water from washing goes into the garden, and they do not have a dishwasher because they believe it is wrong to use strong detergents.
Robert says, ""We wanted people to see that it is possible to design a house that is much better for the environment, without living in the dark."" The only medieval part of the house is its design: the hall, which includes the fireplace and staircase, goes all the way up to the roof. The Vales do not pay water bills, and last winter, the house used only nine units of electricity a day, costing about 70p. This is much less than what other four-bedroom houses use for heating.
Soon, they will install solar panels in the garden, which will help the house generate more electricity. The house will still use mains electricity for cooking and appliances, but it will produce extra electricity, enough to charge an electric car one day. The only heating is a small wood-burning stove in the hall, which they only use in very cold weather. 
When I visited in February, Robert was reading and said it was too warm to light the fire. The temperature on the first floor was 18°C, which is lower than what is usually expected, but he said it felt comfortable because there were no drafts and everything was at the same temperature. He mentioned that a woman from the early 1900s felt comfortable at 12.5°C because of her warm clothing. He suggested that people living in old houses should go back to how people lived back then, but this idea might be hard to accept.
The secret of the house is that it is simple and easy to maintain. Most materials were bought from a local store and installed by local workers, making it cheap to build. It cost the same as low-cost rental housing. Not surprisingly, big building companies do not want this idea to become popular."
CAE_51,C1,"'The Camera Never Lies
Arthur Conan Doyle, the writer of the Sherlock Holmes stories, thought he was a rational man and even a scientist. In 1920, he saw photographs of fairies taken in a garden and believed they were real proof that these tiny creatures existed. He published the photos with an article, accepting fairies as magical beings. 
However, in 1939, the two women who took the photos confessed that they were fake. They had cut out pictures of fairies from a book and placed them among flowers. The photos looked beautiful, but the simple trick showed that a basic idea about photography is not true: that the camera cannot lie. 
In fact, the camera can lie, and it always has. Today, we use computer software to change our digital images, and it is a myth that photography ever had a time when it was completely honest. From the beginning, when cameras started to capture reality, that reality was being changed.'"
CAE_11,C1,"Blacksmiths**
Throughout history, iron has captured the human imagination, and the people who work with it have often been seen as more than just skilled workers. Before the Industrial Revolution, blacksmiths were respected like doctors and astrologers because they made weapons, armor, and farming tools. They were also celebrated as artists. In the 18th century, blacksmiths created beautiful ironwork for St Paul's Cathedral. The elegant metalwork in French and Belgian Art Nouveau buildings was also made by talented blacksmiths. However, by the late 1960s, the number of blacksmiths in Britain had greatly decreased because heavy industry no longer needed them, and modern architects rarely used beautiful wrought-iron designs.
In the last 10 years, there has been a revival of interest in blacksmithing, thanks to a growing appreciation for decorative architecture and a more creative approach to interior design. Still, much of the work looks similar, with manufacturers of gates and balconies often calling their products ""classical"" or ""Victorian-style."" You can find trendy design stores filled with rusty candlesticks and other similar items. Fortunately, there are new opportunities for blacksmiths, and a series of events in the coming weeks aims to promote their craft. The first event is an exhibition of forged ironwork by members of the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA), which opened last week at the Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey. Alan Dawson, the secretary of BABA, says, ""We could be at the start of a new Iron Age, because both the public and blacksmiths are seeing things differently.""
Power tools have made it easier for blacksmiths to work with metal, allowing them to bend, split, twist, and weld it more easily. ""In short,"" says Dawson, ""these artists now have a material that lets them express themselves."" About 250 pieces have been created for the show, including bookends and a spiral staircase. Prices start at £90 and can go much higher. Most of the money will go to the individual makers, but a part of every sale will be kept by the Association to promote good ironwork, according to Dawson. He has made an eight-foot gate and a lamp with a glass shade. ""My style comes from letting steel bend and flow into shape when it's hot. It's like drawing with metal in space,"" he explains.
Many artists are fascinated by iron. Unlike most metals, which are soft when cold, iron and steel are tougher and more challenging to work with. Susan May, a jeweler, says, ""It's magical because it's very soft when hot, but when it cools, it becomes hard and unmovable."" Ann Catrin Evans creates mild steel door knockers and handles that remind people of the dark castles in horror films. One of her designs looks like a ball and chain, and another looks like a Celtic cross. ""I love that steel is cold and hard,"" she says. ""It feels like it will last forever."" No other metal can give people as much visual pleasure or a greater sense of security. It is likely that iron will continue to be used for decoration for many years to come, as long as we don’t have to see any more rusty candlesticks!"
CAE_14,C1,"'THE DAY I GAVE UP SMOKING'**
I thought everyone would be happy when I stopped smoking, but one of my coworkers was very angry. ""What do you mean?"" she shouted. ""If it was that easy, why didn't you stop years ago?"" I found it hard to explain how I went from being a heavy smoker to not smoking at all in just a few hours. It was strange for me too. 
I stopped smoking two months and three weeks ago. I did not plan to stop, and I did not really want to. I felt pressure from people who are against smoking, and I still feel that way. I also had good health and did not feel sick. I thought I was healthier than some of my friends who tried to live healthier lives. 
On that ordinary Thursday afternoon, I went to a session called The Easy Way to Stop Smoking to write an article about people trying to quit. I said, ""I won’t try to stop because I am here to write, not to quit. It wouldn’t be fair to expect your method to work on me."" I really enjoyed smoking; it made me happy. 
During the session, we were allowed to smoke as much as we wanted, and the room was so full of smoke that we had to open the windows. I noticed that when I was told to smoke, I didn’t want to, and neither did the others. I think the messages about stopping smoking started to make sense to me. Just as smoking had become a challenge, the idea of stopping began to feel good. I started to feel strong about the possibility of not being a smoker. 
It was easier than I thought. The cravings for nicotine, which felt like hunger, went away after a minute or two and lasted only four or five days. I thought working without cigarettes would be hard, but it was not a problem at all. I was surprised that doing things at home on weekend mornings was the hardest part, and it still is. I realized that smoking helped me deal with boredom; having a cigarette was something to do. 
Yes, I do miss smoking, but not too much. Every new experience as a non-smoker is something I have to get used to, like eating out, waiting for a plane, checking into a hotel, or during a break at the theater. These are all moments when I would have smoked before."
CAE_63,C1,"Dorothy Hodgkin: A Remarkable Scientist**
Dorothy Hodgkin is the only British woman scientist to win a Nobel Prize, but many people in Britain do not know her name. For the past four years, I have been asking friends if they know about her. If they respond with excitement, I know they are aware of her achievements. 
Dorothy Hodgkin won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1964 for her work on the structure of important substances like penicillin and vitamin B12. She was a brilliant scientist who made significant contributions to science, but she is not as famous as other Nobel Prize winners in literature. 
Hodgkin's life was interesting and reflected important changes in the 20th century, such as the growth of women's education and the global nature of science. When I started my research on her life, I wanted to read biographies of other scientists. I looked for a biography of Linus Pauling, a famous chemist and friend of Hodgkin, but I found none in the bookstore. This surprised me because Pauling was a very important scientist and also won Nobel Prizes.
Many people think that the lives of scientists are not interesting. Peter Medawar, another Nobel Prize winner, once said that scientists' lives are often dull. This belief makes it hard for scientists to be seen as interesting people. Some scientists avoid talking about their personal lives because they do not want to seem like they are promoting themselves. This can make young people less interested in science.
However, things are changing. More scientists are appearing in public in different ways. For example, Professor Richard Dawkins has been on TV giving out prizes, and geneticist Steve Jones has advertised cars. These activities help people see scientists as real individuals, not just researchers.
The way scientific biographies are written is also changing. In the past, these books were often boring and focused only on work. But now, books like Richard Feynman's ""Surely You're Joking, Mr Feynman?"" show scientists as people with interesting lives. Famous scientists like Isaac Newton and Marie Curie are now shown with their flaws, making them more relatable.
Dorothy Hodgkin was dedicated to her work but also had a family. She had three children and a husband who was often away for work. Her personal life is not the main focus of her scientific achievements, but it shows how she balanced her career and family.
Understanding science can be challenging, but it is not harder than reading Shakespeare or learning a new language. It just requires effort. It is unfortunate that many educated people do not recognize the important contributions of scientists like Dorothy Hodgkin, even though they would know famous writers or artists. 
In conclusion, Dorothy Hodgkin's life and work are important and deserve to be known by everyone."
CAE_56,C1,"'Margaret and Her Water Finding Skills'**
Margaret Wilkins is known for having a special ability. She can use a forked hazel stick to find water underground. Many farmers need her help because their wells have dried up. Margaret and her husband run a well-drilling business. They use machines like drilling rigs and air-compressed hammers, but to find water, she only needs her hazel stick. They have a success rate of over 90 percent.
This ability to find water is called dowsing. There are many ideas about how it works, from physical reasons like magnetism to spiritual beliefs. One idea is that everything on Earth vibrates, and water vibrates more than other things. Some dowsers say they can feel or even smell water. 
In recent years, Margaret has been very busy because of droughts. Many of her customers are farmers with dry wells. She says, ""We usually see customers only once because wells last a long time."" Other customers have holiday homes where it is too expensive to run water pipes. Some are building golf courses.
Margaret looks for water between 50 and 70 meters deep. She explains, ""You can't drill where there is a risk of waste getting into the water. The water we find is in strong rock, and if we bring it up correctly, it should be clean. But in Cornwall, there are many minerals, so we have to be careful about iron."" 
Electricity is also needed to run the pump, and it is expensive to bring power over long distances. So, it is best if the well is close to existing power sources. 
To start finding water, Margaret uses a map and a pendulum. She holds the pendulum still over the map, and it swings when she is over a water area. After that, she walks over the fields with her hazel stick. When she is above water, she feels a strange sensation. She uses the stick to find the exact spot to drill. 
When she holds the stick, it moves up if water is below. It is very important to drill exactly where the stick points. If they disagree on where to drill, she and her husband will keep looking until they agree.
Margaret is not alone in her work. Many people are interested in this unusual skill. She calls it an ""intuitive perception of the environment."" This is the best way to explain how she finds water so well. If she did not have this special ability, how could her family continue their well-drilling business year after year?"

**We changed lives for a day!** Have you ever thought about living someone else's life for a day? It might be fun to try something different! We did this for four people - read about their experiences.
**A. Amanda's story**  
I had never been to a place like this before. It was dark and noisy, with many people and a great atmosphere. It was very different from my hometown, and I wasn't sure I could handle it! Being a mother is a busy job, but this was even harder! I had just fifteen minutes to learn how to carry a tray of drinks with one hand. The other waitresses made it look easy, but when I was getting better, the drinks slipped off the tray and fell on the floor, spilling everywhere. I felt so embarrassed, but the other waitresses laughed. Everyone makes mistakes at first! By opening time at 11:30 am, there was already a line outside, and I felt really nervous. I worried about remembering all the orders, but luckily, everything was done by machines. After a couple of hours, my feet hurt, and I couldn’t get used to the loud music. Every time a customer spoke to me, I had to say ""Pardon?"", which was embarrassing! By the end of my shift at 5 pm, I was very tired and wanted to soak my feet in hot water. I couldn’t believe it when one of the waitresses said it had been a ""quiet"" day! I never knew waitressing could be so tiring. I always thought it was an easy job, but you need to be friendly and calm, especially when there are many customers! I am quite shy, and I don’t think I could handle a busy Saturday night. I wasn’t happy with the pay either. I must have been a bad waitress because even the rich customers didn’t tip me! I was very glad to go back to my children. Taking care of them seems easy after waitressing!
**B. Cindy's story**  
I was a bit nervous about being a ""mum"" for a day, but I was also excited. I had heard the girls were cheeky, but I thought I could manage. As Amanda left for the restaurant, I had to get the two girls dressed and fed. After dropping off Sophie at school and Katie at nursery, I thought I would have three hours of peace. I was wrong! A note from Amanda reminded me that I still had to make the beds, clean the house, and do the laundry. At 1 pm, I picked up Katie, rushed through the supermarket, and then took her home for lunch. But when I brought Sophie home from school, the real trouble started. They turned the couch into a trampoline and played a game that involved screaming loudly! I thought they would get tired, but I was wrong again. I thought I had a lot of energy, but they outlasted me! After a lot of convincing, I got them to bed by about 8 pm, but then the fun began! How many glasses of water can a child drink? I knew they just wanted to come downstairs to watch TV, but it was exhausting to spend all evening negotiating with them. I never realized how tiring it could be to take care of two small children. You don’t have a moment to think about yourself, and the responsibility is overwhelming. Still, I really enjoyed the day.
**C. Rosemary's story**  
On the farm, I wake up at 5:30 am, so sleeping in until 7 was a treat! But I took a long time to decide how to dress. I couldn’t show up in my farm clothes! At assembly, I looked at about 400 students and hoped I wouldn’t stand out. Then it was time for a math class. The children worked in small groups, using cards that were easy or hard - very different from my school days! I helped with a nature project, identifying and feeding snails. By lunchtime, I was tired and looking forward to a break, but teachers only have about five minutes to eat. There is so much to do before classes start again. I went to a staff meeting about reports and ended up helping with sports trials. After lunch, there was a silent reading lesson (which was nice!) and then a French lesson. The children wanted to practice their French with me, which showed how rusty I was! Finally, we went to the gym for Physical Education. I was exhausted, but the children had so much energy. The hardest part was speaking in front of the class, even for just two minutes. Teachers may have more holidays, but I think I will stick to farming!
**D. Hilary's story**  
I arrived at White House Farm at 8:30 am, only to find out that Rosemary had been up for three hours! Rosemary's farm has 100 Jersey cows, 15 calves, and about 800 sheep! She also makes ice cream, yogurt, and cream, which are sold in shops and restaurants. I spent most of the morning in the ice cream shop, filling milk containers, making ice cream, and putting on labels. It was hard not to eat the treats! At lunchtime, I checked the sheep. I drove to one of the fields and helped a sheep that had fallen over. If sheep are left for more than 12 hours after falling, they could die, so they need to be checked every day. It must be very hard in winter! After feeding the calves, I started milking. It took two and a half hours, and Rosemary does this twice a day, every day! I found it a lonely day. I missed the children a lot - animals don’t talk back! The worst part of the job is that you can’t take time off. The cows need to be milked twice a day, so it’s hard to plan any time away. Rosemary will only get about three days off this year. Farming seems nice, but the reality is very different. The income is not steady, and I wouldn’t want to depend on the weather."

A trumpet isn't just for Christmas. It is interesting how many musicians, even famous ones, come from families without music. Hakan Hardenberger, the only son of parents who do not play music, grew up in a small town in southern Sweden. At the age of 30, he has become a unique trumpet player in the world. His recordings introduce new music, including concertos by old composers and new pieces.
When you meet him, he looks young and friendly, just like the sound of the trumpet. Recently, he played the Hummel Trumpet Concerto in one of London’s best concert halls. A television program was made about his work and life, filmed in London and Sweden. Hakan was born near Malmo, and his music career started with a Christmas gift when he was eight years old. His father, who did not play music but liked Louis Armstrong, decided to give him a real trumpet instead of a toy. The gift was a success, and Hakan never stopped playing.
His mother found the second trumpet player in the Malmo Symphony Orchestra and asked him to give Hakan lessons. Bo Nilsson, the teacher, saw Hakan's natural talent right away. Hakan is grateful to have had such a passionate teacher. Bo was very dedicated to the trumpet and always looked for new mouthpieces.
Hakan explains that the trumpet is a simple instrument, and it is impossible to make a perfect one. There will always be some imperfections. He believes it is important to understand these imperfections and work with them. From the beginning, Hakan had a special sound that people could recognize. Unlike John Wallace, another famous trumpet player who started in brass bands and orchestras, Hakan always saw himself as a solo artist. He admired the French trumpeter Maurice Andre and bought all his records. His parents supported his dream of becoming a trumpet player.
When Hakan was 15, it was time to decide where he would study. America was too far away, so at 16, he went to Paris to study with Pierre Thibaud. Thibaud told him that playing in an orchestra was not as exciting as being a soloist. Hakan knew he played better than many of his peers, but it was only after his first competition at 17 that he realized he had a special ability to connect with the audience. Thibaud suggested he enter the competition for experience. Hakan learned the pieces for the first round and made it to the second round. He was lucky to know most of the pieces for that round too. In the final round, he faced a difficult concerto that made him nervous. He did not win first prize, but he enjoyed performing and realized that people were listening to him.
Hakan’s honest view of his work might seem arrogant, but that is not true. He does not want to analyze his ability to connect with people because he believes it might ruin it. He thinks the power of music is that it can always touch people’s hearts.
**Questions:**
1. Where did Hakan Hardenberger grow up?
2. What special gift did Hakan receive for Christmas when he was eight?
3. Who was Hakan's first trumpet teacher?
4. What did Hakan think about playing in an orchestra?
5. How did Hakan feel after his first competition?"

**ANNE'S DAY**  
""I wake up at 6:30 am, go to the gym at 7 am, and get to work by 8 am. I start surgeries at 8:30 am. I do surgeries all day on Mondays and Wednesdays, and sometimes on Friday afternoons. Most brain surgeries take about three hours, but some can take all day. Sometimes, I work for ten hours without eating or taking a break. Deciding when to do surgery can be stressful. I don’t feel stressed while I’m operating, but I sometimes worry about what I will do the next day. Brain surgery is usually a last option for patients, but when it works, it feels amazing. From 10 am to 1 pm, I see patients to explain their surgeries. I enjoy this and find it easy to talk to them. If they get upset, I try to comfort them, but I have to be quick because of time pressure. I leave work between 6 pm and 8 pm. Some nights and weekends, I am on call, and I always carry my pager. When I’m on holiday, I worry about my patients for the first few days, and I often dream about operating. I find it hard to relax.""

""I wake up at 7:45 am, leave home by 8:20 am, take the train to work, and arrive at 9:15 am. On Mondays at 10:30 am, we have a meeting to discuss our work and any problems. I work in a team with three senior designers, a partner, and a junior designer. My job is mostly about production, with some design work. I get a brief from the client about what they want. I spend three to four weeks designing and developing the project. After that, I present my ideas to the client. If they agree, we work on budgets and I start hiring photographers and illustrators. I also work with printers to make sure everything is done on time. I spend a lot of time managing people and need to communicate well. When their work comes in, I put everything together and send it to the printers. It can be very stressful to manage several projects at once. Deadlines are always close, and my day is never the same. I have lunch at 1 pm for an hour, and we often go to the pub. If the client likes my designs, it feels great, but it’s disappointing if they don’t. I usually get home by 7:30 pm, but sometimes it’s much later. I find it hard to relax after a busy day.""

**LINDA'S DAY**  
""I wake up around 7 am most days, but two or three times a week, I wake up between 4:30 am and 5 am to meet long-haul flights. At 10:30 or 11 am, I might go for a bike ride or swim. Since chauffeuring is a sitting job, I have to watch my diet and exercise. I usually have a big breakfast and snacks during the day. People often ask me for restaurant or shop recommendations, so I need to know the area well. Many jobs are pre-booked, so I can check the routes beforehand. Not all passengers are polite; some can be rude. But most are nice, and I have a good relationship with my regular clients. Sometimes I hear conversations in the car and have to focus on driving.

We spend about an hour and a half at each house. Around 11 am, we get hungry and go to a local café for breakfast. In summer, I may work until 10 pm; in winter, until 4:30 pm. I have my office at home, so when I get back, I check messages and return calls. If someone wants a new garden, I usually meet them in the evening around 7 pm or 8 pm. We like to use old materials to make gardens look historic. Sometimes clients have very specific ideas, which can be challenging. But it’s very satisfying to see a garden we created bloom.

The workers have set meal times, so when they eat, I can check things on site. Since we check their work, we need to have a good relationship. I see the main engineer once a day, but if something important happens, I act right away. I usually leave the site around 6 pm and I am on call all the time."""
CAE_40,C1,"**Careers: Six People Talk About Their Typical Working Day**
**A. Credit Card Executive**  
I wake up at 6 am and get to the office by 7:30 am. I manage programs for our credit card users. My job includes starting and managing the Membership Rewards scheme in Europe. I keep in touch with current card users, find new ones, and build relationships with partner companies. I spend the first 45 minutes organizing my day and then I check my emails. I work with our marketing team and advertising agencies to create strategies for our membership program. I have many meetings during the day, but I also keep my door open for anyone who has questions. I travel to different European markets once or twice a week to discuss any issues. When I am in London, I usually leave work between 6:30 pm and 7:00 pm.
**B. Record Company Executive**  
I arrive at work by 10:00 am and check the mail, which includes about ten to twenty demo tapes, letters from producers, concert information, and invoices. The phone starts ringing around 10:30 am with calls from producers and publishers. I have meetings throughout the day to discuss projects for artists, which may involve the press and marketing. When I listen to demo tapes, I know that these are very important to the artists, so I try to give helpful feedback. Once I sign a band, we start working on their first album, choosing songs and a producer. I also manage budgets and spending. I usually leave work by 7:00 pm, and most evenings I go to concerts, sometimes seeing up to five new groups in one night. I often don’t get home until 1:00 am, when I listen to music to relax.
**C. Sales Director**  
I wake up at 8:00 am and drive to work, arriving by 9:30 am. I check the mail and my schedule to see if we have any clients visiting that day. I enjoy showing people around the showroom and selling furniture. We sell antiques that cost between £1,000 and £6,000, and we buy from auctions and private clients. Many items need restoration, so I work with our restorer and other specialists. I read the Antiques Trade Gazette while drinking coffee to stay updated on the business. I do the accounts once a month and tax returns every three months. I go home at 5:30 pm, and it usually takes me about an hour to relax.
**D. Air Traffic Controller**  
I work on a set schedule. When I have an early shift, I leave home at 6:00 am. I start my shift at 7:00 am, taking over one of the control positions in the tower. I work for about an hour and a half at one station, then take a break and switch to another station. My team controls aircraft movements, handling about 1,000 movements a day in winter and even more in summer. Night shifts are quieter, and I often read about new air traffic rules during my breaks. This job can be stressful, and I find it hard to relax after a shift. I hope to become a watch manager and then a general manager of the airport one day.
**E. Shop Manager**  
If I have an early shift, I leave home by 8:00 am. The first thing I do is start the electronic point-of-sale system. I make sure someone is watching the cash register and coordinate lunch breaks for the staff. I spend the morning helping customers find and order books. I enjoy serving customers, but it can be frustrating when they come in with reviews and expect me to quickly gather many books for them. From 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm, publishers’ representatives visit, and I discuss new titles for the shop. I need to decide how many copies of a new title we should order. My early shift ends at 5:45 pm. On two days a week, I work a late shift, where I close the computer system, lock up, and go home.
**F. Financial Analyst**  
I listen to the news at 7:00 am, then get up and take a taxi to work, arriving by 8:45 am. I contact freelance reporters to find out what is happening in my area. I assess financial risks for companies working abroad, trying to warn clients about possible problems. I provide three services: an online news preview, a security forecast, and a travel information security guide. From 9:15 am to 9:30 am, I meet with editors to discuss the stories I will follow. My first news preview must be online by 10:00 am, and my second by 11:00 am, so I need to work quickly. I travel to Africa about three times a year to report on events. I usually leave work around 6:00 pm, and it can be hard to relax in the evenings; I often stay awake until 1:00 am."
CAE_45,C1,"Career Power: Take Control at Work**
A. **What makes a good leader?**  
A leader is someone who inspires others and helps bring about change. They guide people and show them the way forward. Being a good leader is not about being tall or having a high IQ. Pat Dixon, who wrote the book *Making the Difference: Women and Men in the Workplace*, says that leadership is about ""making things happen through people who are as enthusiastic and interested as you are."" Enthusiasm is very important. A good leader should be able to speak clearly and confidently. Dixon says, ""It's having the confidence to say 'I believe' instead of 'I think.'""
B. John van Maurik, who runs a Leadership in Management course, says, ""Most people have more potential for leadership than they know."" To become a leader, you need to recognize your hidden talents, develop them, and use them. In a way, we are all born leaders; we just need the right environment to grow. While it is easy to see leadership in famous people like Emmeline Pankhurst, Mahatma Gandhi, or Richard Branson, it can be harder to see it in our own jobs. However, leadership is now seen as very important for good management.
C. Think about the best and worst boss you have had. They might have been good at setting goals and meeting deadlines. But how did they achieve these goals? The best leader motivated you and supported you. The worst leader made you feel unimportant and kept information from you. When things went wrong, they blamed you. The first boss led well; the second one managed poorly.
D. Leaders and managers are different. Managers like to work within set rules. Leaders create new opportunities. Micheal Shea, who wrote *Leadership Rules*, says, ""A good manager can keep a company running smoothly, but a good leader can change a discouraged organization, whether it is a company, a sports team, or a country.""
E. Whether you are the boss or a middle manager, you can improve your leadership skills. Here are some lessons to learn:  
- Leadership works best when you choose to do it. Find out what you are passionate about. When you feel inspired to lead, use that energy to take action.  
- Start seeing yourself as a leader. Your ability to lead is an important part of who you are.  
- Working together is good, but sometimes strong leadership is needed. Try different styles. If you usually negotiate, try taking the lead. See how this changes the results.  
- Set goals and try to achieve them. Look at your job and find areas where being a leader can help you do better and advance in your career.
F. Leadership does not just happen. It develops when you take the lead, take risks, and learn from mistakes. Learn to delegate tasks, motivate others, organize, and give feedback.  
- Don’t think that your way of leading will always please your colleagues. It might even push them away. Keep improving your communication skills. You don’t have to be liked, but your ideas and achievements should be respected.  
- Be visible and approachable to important people. Remember, you don’t have to lead all the time. Know when your input is essential and how you can help others become leaders."
CAE_64,C1,"Films on Video**
**Film critic Nick James reviews some recent movies.**
**A. Abyss**  
Before Titanic, director James Cameron made a tense Cold War thriller about oil workers and navy experts trying to rescue a nuclear submarine deep underwater. The friendly jokes and brave actions of foreman Bud and his team remind us of tough heroes in movies by Howard Hawks. The special effects and set design are very impressive, but the dialogue and characters are not as strong. The story feels like a simple B-movie.
**B. The Thin Red Line**  
This video version of the James Jones novel about the battle for Guadalcanal, directed by Andrew Marton, is interesting compared to Terrence Malick's new film. Malick's film is poetic and mystical, while Marton's is a more traditional war movie, but it stays closer to the book. He focuses on one soldier and his tough relationship with his sergeant. Malick's film is richer and more complex, but Marton's version has some good moments. The flashback where the soldier dreams of his wife is done in a way that might be better than Malick's softer images.
**C. On Guard**  
This fun swashbuckler is based on Paul Feval's 1875 novel. It is better than most musketeer stories. Fabrice Luchini plays a great villain, a sneaky politician causing trouble. Vincent Perez is a lively hero, even if he doesn't last long. Daniel Auteuil is a bit too serious for this type of film, but he has his moments as a swordsman. The filmmakers use costume drama clichés with so much humor that it doesn't matter.
**D. Character**  
This serious story is set in Rotterdam at the turn of the century. The detailed production and costumes make the film look like a museum piece. Jan Decleir plays the harsh bailiff Dreverhaven, who is cruel to his tenants. His difficult relationship with his son is the main part of the story, but the filmmakers focus too much on the details and not enough on the dark story.
**E. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly**  
This re-released video shows off director Leone's skills. The sound editing is excellent; every step, creaking floorboard, and barking dog is clear. The story is very harsh, and when it slows down, Morricone's great music brings excitement. Morally, there is not much difference between the good (Clint Eastwood), the bad (Lee van Cleef), and the ugly (Ell Wallach), as they all act badly in the post-Civil War West.
**F. The Longest Day**  
The publicity says ""Forty-eight International stars"" for this three-hour war epic by Darryl Zanuck. With four directors and 23,000 extras, it feels too big. The early scenes, where the soldiers wait for news about the invasion, are slow for both the audience and the soldiers. Logistically, it is impressive, but it needs to be seen on a big screen. Watching it on video is not as good."

**BOOK A** Steve Martin's *Compelling Evidence* is very interesting. The main character is a lawyer who is trying to start a new job after leaving a big law firm. He ends up defending his boss's wife when she is accused of killing her husband. The trial scenes are exciting, and the ending has a surprising twist. This is a great first book in a popular genre.
**BOOK B** *Curtains for the Cardinal* starts with a lot of action. The main character, Sigismondo, is a problem solver for rich people in the Italian Renaissance. He gets involved in politics, church secrets, and serious crimes, but we believe he will find out who is guilty. The story is complicated and a bit long, but it is still very enjoyable.
**BOOK C** *File Under: Deceased* introduces a new detective, Leah Hunter, who is a tax inspector. She is in a good position to investigate when a strange man dies in front of her. Even though she faces challenges and disapproval from a local detective, Leah is strong and capable.
**BOOK D** *Double Deuce* by Robert B. Parker features Spenser, a smart private investigator. He helps his friend Hawk get rid of drug dealers in a poor area of Boston. The dialogue is quick and clever, and while there are not many deaths, there is more thinking than usual. It is always high-quality entertainment from Parker.
**BOOK E** *False Prophet* by Faye Kellermann has her usual detectives, Pete Decker and Marge Dunn, looking into a robbery at the home of a famous actress's daughter. The author's easy writing style and focus on unusual human behavior make this an entertaining mystery.
**BOOK F** Diane Henry and Nicholas Horrock write together. *Blood Red, Snow White* features another lawyer and a female client, but the action happens outside the courtroom. The lawyer becomes a victim as the story unfolds. It has all the classic elements of romance, money, and violence, making it a gripping suspense novel.
**BOOK G** *Dead for a Ducat* by Simon Shaw shows actor Philip Fletcher as a target. A funny group of characters comes together to film a story about Robin Hood, but Philip feels this is not the right direction for his career. Simon Shaw usually entertains, but this time the story is not as strong as his other works.
**BOOK H** *Fall Down Easy* is Lawrence Gough's best book in a while. Canadian police are searching for a clever bank robber who targets female bank tellers. The story builds tension slowly and shows the smart, troubled robber, making it much better than an average detective novel."

I might be too old for this, but here I go! At 34, Tim Pozzi has left a good job to go backpacking. He thinks about why he and others his age are making this choice. This summer, I quit my job and decided to rent out my flat to travel in South East Asia for a year. You might think I'm lucky, but I'm 34 years old and I'm nervous. I have traveled before. After university, I spent two years backpacking in North and South America, and I wanted to do it again someday. But then I fell in love, started a career, bought a flat, and got used to earning a salary. I realized I was giving up my own happiness for my salary. When I handed in my resignation, it felt like I was taking control of my life again. I have no ties now. Many of my friends are married with children, and while they wouldn’t want to change places with me, they envy my freedom. I’m not in a relationship, and I don’t have big career goals. I feel I should make the most of my freedom, at least for my friends! 
Why am I so nervous? First, I need to make all the arrangements. How can I let someone else live in my home? How do I organize the renting? And I also need to decide where to go. I tend to procrastinate and I am already behind my schedule. I thought, “I might as well enjoy the summer in England,” and then, “Why not wait for the start of the football season?” Letting go of emotional ties makes it harder. I’m putting it off because I wonder if I can still handle backpacking. Will I be able to adjust to a simpler way of life? Will I feel out of place among younger backpackers? Maybe not. I’ve noticed that more Britons in their late twenties and thirties want to leave their current lives and travel abroad. Jennifer Cox from Lonely Planet says that more people are realizing they can have adventures: “People who always say ‘I wish I had that opportunity’ are now understanding they can have it anytime. They just need to be brave, organized, and confident.”
For Danny, a 30-year-old accountant, and his girlfriend Tammy, a 28-year-old teacher, this trip is a chance to enjoy life before settling down. They bought a round-the-world ticket for a year. Danny says, “I’m willing to give up job security for this trip. There’s always a worry that I won’t move up in my career when I come back, but I think it’s a risk worth taking. When I left the office, I threw my calculator into the river as a sign of defiance!” For Matt, who just left the Army, traveling for a year was a time of change. “In the military, there’s a set way of doing things. I needed to change that to live well as a civilian.” 
There are many reasons for people my age to travel. Angela Baron from the Institute of Personnel Development says, “Today, we have a more flexible workforce. Many people work on short-term contracts, so if your contract ends, you have nothing to lose.” Some big companies even have policies for career breaks. “If you’ve spent a lot of time and money training someone, it’s good to know they will come back instead of going to a competitor.” Dan Hiscocks, managing director of Travellerseye, says more thirty-somethings are thinking about their lives. “If you’re not happy with your job – and many people aren’t – it’s not just about sticking with it. Now people know there are opportunities and that a job isn’t forever. Travel gives a chance to think about your life.”
Is wanting to travel just a sign that my generation can’t accept adulthood? Jennifer Cox doesn’t think so. “It shows a better educated, more stable society. We care less about just paying bills and more about living a balanced life. We are asking ourselves, ‘Is this what I want?’” Ben, a 32-year-old picture researcher going to Central America for a year, doesn’t think he’s running away. “It’s more about running towards something. I want to grab the things I want for myself.” But he does feel nervous. “I’ll miss my comfortable routine – going to the office every day, saying ‘hi’ to everyone, and having coffee.” I share Ben’s worries about leaving a stable life and I’m not sure I would be going on this journey if I hadn’t found my boss so difficult. Jennifer Cox points out, “This is common. There’s often a reason, like a breakup or losing a job, that pushes people to travel.” 
It may have taken a push to get me moving, but I’m now looking forward to the next 12 months with excitement. No matter what happens, I will feel good about taking control of my life. I believe many of us older backpackers feel the same way."
CAE_42,C1,"'Plugging in the Home'**
Georgina McGuiness took a long break from journalism and felt out of touch with new technology. In this text, she shares how she changed her home into a good place to work.
The Christmas before last, I turned 37 and realized that I needed to restart my career in journalism. I felt like my skills were old-fashioned, stuck in the 1980s when typewriters were common. I saw that many job ads wanted experience in desktop publishing, which I did not have. I thought it would be easier to host a seminar on nuclear physics than to use a computer for layout. I was not good with technology; even calculators confused me, and I didn’t know how to use the timer on the video.
I knew I had to act quickly. I thought leaving home before my children would be hard, but then I entered a competition in a local newspaper. To my surprise, my family won a computer package. We received a laptop for my husband and a personal computer for the family. We jumped into this new world of the Internet and started chatting with people from around the world. The children stopped watching TV, and I set up a small office in the kitchen with a phone, a fax machine, a CD-ROM, and a modem to connect to the Internet. I had everything I needed to work from home while still taking the kids to school.
My children were already good with computers from school, but I was nervous. I thought I would lose my work if I pressed the wrong button. I was wrong. I learned the basic skills I needed, and it was easier than I thought. With practice, I learned more each day. I started freelancing for a magazine, writing about two articles a month, and I felt proud to have the best of both worlds.
How has the computer helped me? In school, my desk was always messy, and I often lost important papers. The computer helped me become more organized, especially with office tasks. I could keep track of money with spreadsheets and save time with ready-made invoices and letterheads. As a journalist, being online allowed me to research stories, ask for information, and discuss working from home with people worldwide.
However, there are some downsides to working from home. You can feel lonely without face-to-face contact. There are also distractions, like household chores, and sometimes my children argue over who gets to use the computer. Still, many people are buying computers not just for learning and fun but also for work. In my neighborhood, more people are starting home businesses to avoid commuting to the city.
What do home workers look like as we move into the future? A report called PC Usage in UK Homes gives this profile: they are around 38 years old and well-educated; 93% own a personal computer, and 32% have a CD-ROM. Taking this into account, I feel I am doing well. One day, I might even email a column to a newspaper in Melbourne or publish my own magazine from home. It seems that the possibilities are endless."
CAE_59,C1,"**The Tartan Museum**
The Tartan Museum is located in Edinburgh, Scotland. Its modern buildings look very different from the historic city around it. Sally Varlow visited the museum just before it opened to see what it was like inside.
You cannot miss the new Museum of Scotland. It stands on the corner of Chambers Street in Edinburgh, with a big yellow tower and unique buildings that look like cheese wedges. Last winter, people had mixed feelings about the building. Some called it a ""masterpiece"" or ""stunning,"" while others were not so sure.
Now that the inside is almost ready, the exhibitions are also getting attention. The museum tells the story of Scotland through many interesting objects. There is a timeline to help visitors understand the displays, but it does not limit how the items are shown. The museum features important treasures, like Mary Queen of Scots' jewels and silver from Holyrood chapel, without being too proud of them.
Dr. David Clarke, who is in charge of the exhibitions, believes that visiting the museum should be enjoyable for everyone, not just experts. He wants to show the truth about the past, so there are no fake scenes or models. Visitors will see what experts know about the objects.
However, it is still unclear if the stories of these objects can be told well enough with just explanation panels and multimedia displays. The museum has about 30 computers to help with this. Just before the opening, it is hard to tell how effective these will be.
When you enter the museum, you notice the different spaces. The galleries connect to each other, with pale walls that look like stone and deep display cases. Natural light comes through special windows and roof lights, creating a pleasant atmosphere to enjoy the exhibits.
Thanks to a group of children aged 9 to 12 from all over Scotland, the museum has a Discovery Centre. They wanted to have fun experiences with the displays. Although they did not get to ride through the exhibits, they created a hands-on area for children in what was supposed to be a temporary exhibition space.
The Twentieth Century gallery on the top floor is the only temporary exhibition. It will change every three years and features items chosen by Scottish people that have influenced life in Scotland during the twentieth century. Suggestions included an electric guitar, televisions, thermos flasks, and favorite toys. While this idea is fun, it may not address more serious topics.
Dr. Clarke believes that objects can show the past better than anything else. The modern architecture of the museum looks great from the inside and the top, but whether it fits well in its location is still a question."
CAE_54,C1,"The Future of Newspapers**
The end of print newspapers may take some time. ""Transition"" is a nice word that means moving from one place to another. Change can scare some people and challenge others. But transition means moving slowly and surely from the present to the future. However, the change for newspapers to go online is uncertain and uncomfortable. It may not even be a real process.
Many people believe that this change will happen eventually. It is well-known that print newspaper sales are falling while visits to their websites are increasing. For example, the print sales of The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian have dropped by 8% to 10% each year, but their websites are getting more visitors.
However, there are some things that do not fit this picture. If print sales have fallen so little, maybe the problem mostly affects newspapers. A recent survey by the World Association of Newspapers showed that global newspaper circulation actually rose by 1.1% last year, reaching 512 million copies a day. While sales in the West have dropped, Asia has made up for it. News and current affairs magazines, which you might think are struggling, actually saw a 5.4% increase.
The same is true for books. E-readers like Kindle are very popular, with sales increasing a lot this year. But when booksellers looked at the value of physical books sold in the last six months, they found it was only down by 0.4%. This shows that people are buying both e-books and physical books.
The idea that young people are not reading newspapers is exaggerated. The latest National Readership Survey shows that nearly 5 million people aged 15 to 35 still read the main national newspapers. Different countries in Europe have different trends. In Britain, there has been a 10.8% drop in recent years, but in Germany, the decline is only 7%, and in France, it is just 3.1%.
These different trends suggest that the situation is more complicated than some people think. In the past, media analysts in America believed that online advertising would help newspapers succeed. But now, digital advertising on newspaper websites is actually going down. Many US newspapers have started charging for online access. The best way to attract paying readers seems to be to offer both a print copy and digital access together. This means that print newspapers are still important for selling online subscriptions. 
However, maintaining both a website and a print edition is difficult and expensive for newspaper companies. Print newspapers still have a strong presence, but it is harder to get noticed online."
CAE_32,C1,"Photographing People**
People are the most interesting subjects to photograph. A picture with a person in it is usually more engaging than the same picture without anyone. However, photographing people can be challenging. Besides technical skills, photographers must pay attention to actions, gestures, and expressions. Sometimes, just having a camera can change how people act.
**A. Grouping People**  
When taking group photos, avoid straight lines. Ask people to stand at different angles and distances. If possible, have some people sit or kneel in front so you can see all their faces.
**B. Posing for Pictures**  
People often feel stiff in front of a camera. Help them relax by suggesting comfortable positions, like folding their hands or putting them in their pockets.
**C. The Right Approach**  
Do not pretend you are not taking a picture when it is obvious you are. This can make people feel tense. Most people will agree to have their picture taken, even if they are a bit shy at first. They may need some direction to look their best.
**D. Eye Contact**  
A picture looks better if the subject is looking at the camera. Ask them to look into the lens, but they don’t have to smile. They might not be able to do this for long, so remind them just before you take the picture. You can also say something funny to get a natural reaction.
**E. Candid Concentration**  
Instead of looking directly at the camera, the subject can focus on something else in the picture. This can make the photo feel more natural, as if you are observing them without them noticing.
**F. Expressions and Gestures**  
Expressions and gestures tell us a lot about a person in a photo. A laughing child can make viewers smile, while a sad face can create sympathy. Look for common expressions like smiles, frowns, or gestures like thumbs-up.
**G. Situation Interest**  
While close-up shots of a person can be powerful, the background can add more interest. Make sure the background does not distract from the subject. A wide-angle lens can help make the subject stand out.
**H. Interaction**  
Photos of people interacting, like talking or laughing together, can be very appealing. Look for moments of connection, like eye contact or a friendly touch.
**I. People and Places**  
Many photos of people are taken on trips. To show both the people and the place, use a wide-angle lens and step back to include the background. Make sure the people are close enough to be the main focus without hiding the background.
**J. To Pose or Not to Pose?**  
Decide why you want to take the picture. If it’s to remember someone you met on holiday, a clear posed picture is good. However, family photos can be more fun if they capture real moments instead of stiff poses. Candid shots often bring back memories better than posed ones."
CAE_65,C1,"Under Sarah's Spell**
Sarah Janson is a trompe-l'oeil artist. This means her paintings create an illusion that looks real. In this interview with Joanna Watt, we learn more about her.
Not many artists do not sign their work unless someone asks them to. Sarah Janson is one of these artists. She does not care about being seen as a great artist. She believes, ""It's not the artist who is important, but the work."" Sarah is very humble and almost wants you to think her paintings create themselves. This makes for an interesting magazine interview. ""I just don't like to talk about myself,"" she says. When asked if she minds being photographed, she covers her face in surprise.
After 30 minutes, Sarah feels more comfortable. The interview becomes fun and interesting. She has been a trompe-l'oeil artist for sixteen years. Before that, she spent two years drawing at art school, got a degree in graphic illustration, and worked at a publishing house. However, she was not happy with illustration. She started working with a decorator named Jim Smart, who asked her to create one trompe-l'oeil painting. After that, she knew this was her path. ""Suddenly my interest got focused,"" she says. She left to work on her own, not knowing exactly what would happen but feeling it was the right choice.
Sarah's skills in observing details helped her become a good trompe-l'oeil artist. ""People often ask me where they can learn trompe-l'oeil. But no one can teach you. Trompe-l'oeil is about observation,"" she explains. She believes she is still learning. ""If you think you have mastered something, you might as well give up."" She is honest about her weaknesses, saying, ""I can't paint bread; it always looks like grey concrete."" She also admits she struggles with math. When she had a big project for a ceiling at Lulworth Castle, she got confused with the measurements. ""I thought, 'You're not Michelangelo. Who do you think you are?'"" 
Sarah often talks about herself in the third person. ""When I finished that ceiling, I thought, 'Well, I didn't do it, she did.'"" Her trompe-l'oeil paintings are very special. They are much better than many others that have become popular recently. She has many important projects for companies and private clients. Much of her work is inspired by buildings. For example, she created a trompe-l'oeil dining room based on a Venetian palace and a painting in a flat that looks like two more rooms.
However, there is a risk with trompe-l'oeil art. Once people understand the trick, they may lose interest. Sarah knows this well. ""Trompe-l'oeil has to do two things. First, it must draw you in; it has to trick you. Second, it must hold your attention and engage your imagination. That is the most important part."" 
Sarah believes trompe-l'oeil art should also be personal for the client. ""I love working with clients; that is where the ideas come from,"" she says. ""Without a good relationship, creating a trompe-l'oeil becomes difficult."" Some clients have clear ideas, while others do not. She listens carefully to understand their imagination. Many clients become friends because Sarah spends a lot of time with them while working.
Sarah appreciates her clients. ""I am very grateful for the brave ones who let me work on their walls,"" she says. They are happy with her work, which is why she is always busy, even though she does not like to boast about her talent. ""I really don't like to talk about myself,"" she repeats. ""Like my work, I am very reserved. I don't want it to be loud. You get tired of things that are loud."" 
This may be true, but you could never get tired of Sarah or her work. It deserves to be better known, and I am willing to share her story."
CAE_61,C1,"**Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success**
Daniel Goleman looks at the 'people skills' that are important for success in our jobs.
A. The rules for work are changing. We are now judged not only by how smart we are or by our training, but also by how well we manage ourselves and interact with others. This new way of judging is used to decide who gets hired and who does not, and who gets promoted. These new rules help to show who is likely to be a top performer and who may not do as well. They also measure the qualities that are important for getting jobs in the future. These rules are different from what we learned in school. Doing well in exams is not as important anymore. The new measure assumes that we all have enough intelligence and skills to do our jobs. It focuses on social skills and personal qualities, like initiative, empathy, adaptability, and persuasiveness. These 'people skills' are now called emotional intelligence.
B. In a time when job security is low, personal qualities are becoming more important at work. For many years, people have talked about these qualities using different names, like 'character', 'personality', or 'soft skills'. Now, we have a clearer understanding of these skills, which we call 'emotional intelligence'. This means being able to understand and manage our own feelings and the feelings of others, and using these feelings to guide our thoughts and actions. In the workplace, emotional intelligence includes self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and good social skills. Some people think it just means 'being nice', but sometimes it means being honest and confronting someone with difficult truths. Emotional intelligence does not mean expressing all feelings freely; it means managing feelings so they are shown in the right way, helping people work together towards their goals.
C. More businesses are realizing that encouraging emotional intelligence is important for good management. The more complicated the job, the more emotional intelligence matters. If someone lacks these skills, it can affect their ability to use their technical knowledge. There are examples of people who have succeeded despite having low emotional intelligence, but as work becomes more complex and requires teamwork, companies that work well together have an advantage. In today’s workplace, where teamwork and customer service are important, emotional intelligence is essential for success in every job around the world.
D. While a person's IQ does not change much, emotional intelligence can grow as we go through life and learn from our experiences. Studies show that most people become better at managing their emotions, motivating themselves, and understanding others over time. This growth in emotional intelligence is often called maturity. We can learn emotional intelligence and add these skills to our abilities for success. This is especially important now when job stability is uncertain. Emotional intelligence is not a magic solution for companies that are not competitive, and it does not guarantee success. However, if we ignore the human side of work, nothing else will work as well as it could."
CAE_52,C1,"'Should the media make money from content they do not own? Digital cameras and camera phones have made it easier to capture important news events, but social media has changed how people take and share photos. Now, some journalists use social media to find images of fast-moving events. However, some reporters have shared user-generated content (UGC) without asking for permission. There are rules that say images on social media can be used without permission in special cases or when there is strong public interest, but people still debate if this is right. Research shows that about one in ten people would take photos or videos of a news event, which means UGC is important for the future of the media. To keep a good relationship with the public, the media must make sure that people are rewarded for their work and that they always ask for permission.'"

**Ancient Chinese Medicine in the West**
Acupuncture is a practice that is over two thousand years old. It comes from traditional Chinese medicine, which also includes herbal medicine, massage, diet, and exercise. Acupuncture is used to treat many health problems, but it is most known in the West for helping with pain. Some doctors, midwives, and physiotherapists use it regularly to relieve pain.
**A. What is it about?**
Traditional Chinese medicine believes that health is when the energy of the mind, body, and spirit are in balance. This energy is called Qi (pronounced ""chee"") and flows through the body along pathways called meridians. There are twelve main meridians, each connected to an organ, and many smaller meridians that carry Qi to every cell. If the flow of Qi is blocked or weak, a person may feel weak or become ill. During a visit to an acupuncturist, they will check where the Qi is unbalanced by feeling your pulse, looking at your tongue, and assessing your overall health. They will ask about your medical history, current health, and your eating and sleeping habits. An acupuncturist uses very thin needles that are inserted into the skin. They may also use warmth from burning herbs or apply pressure to points on the meridians to help the flow of Qi.
**B. Over three hundred points**
The points used in acupuncture are connected to the meridians and may not be near the area that hurts. People often feel a mild ache or tingling when the needle is gently moved. This can be done by hand or with a machine. Acupuncturists say this feeling means the needle has reached the Qi in a meridian. There are over three hundred points on the main meridians, with many more that are used less often.
**C. Science explains how it works**
Even though not all doctors believe in traditional Chinese medicine, many accept that acupuncture can help with pain relief. They have found scientific reasons for how it might work. For example:
- It is thought that stimulating certain nerves can block pain signals from reaching the brain.
- Some scientists believe that acupuncture points can release natural pain-relieving chemicals in the body called endorphins.
**D. What types of pain can be treated?**
Many people with long-term pain try acupuncture when other treatments do not work. Common pains treated with acupuncture include back pain, sports injuries, arthritis, headaches, and pain after surgery. Acupuncturists also claim to treat menstrual pain, facial nerve pain, and pain in terminally ill patients.
**E. Modern use of an ancient treatment**
Although acupuncture has been used in China for over 2,000 years, using it instead of anesthesia during surgery started in the 1950s. This helped some doctors outside China believe that acupuncture is more than just a mental trick. In China today, acupuncture is used in many types of surgeries, from tonsil removals to heart surgery. Needles can be used alone, with electrical stimulation, or with medicine. It is said that pain is greatly reduced, but this can be different for each person. Many people might not like the idea of being awake during surgery, but acupuncturists say that acupuncture does not have the side effects of regular anesthesia, like feeling sick, and recovery is faster.
**F. Effectiveness of acupuncture**
Like many alternative therapies, it is hard to run clinical trials for acupuncture. However, studies show that 50 to 80 percent of people find acupuncture helpful for chronic pain. Acupuncturists often say they have a similar success rate. They know it does not work for everyone and that people respond differently. Traditional acupuncturists say that for long-term pain, it usually takes six to seven visits to feel real relief, but some improvement can be felt after just two or three visits.
**G. A different approach to pain**
Western and Chinese medicine see pain differently. An acupuncturist looks at the whole person, not just the specific pain. They spend time diagnosing the problem and looking for weaknesses in the Qi. They also consider outside factors that may cause pain, like weather conditions. They ask questions about how the pain feels, whether it is sharp or dull, and other details. These factors help them decide how to treat the pain with acupuncture. Most regular doctors do not consider these things.
**H. Traditional or not?**
Some medical professionals have training in traditional acupuncture, while others, including many general practitioners, focus on scientific explanations. However, many traditional acupuncturists believe that using traditional Chinese medicine is necessary for deep healing, which is hard to measure in studies. It is important to choose a qualified acupuncturist, who should refer you to a medical doctor if needed."

P.D. James is a famous crime writer. Her full name is Phyllis Dorothy James. She seems calm and confident, but she is actually quite shy. She says that Adam Dalgliesh, the detective in her books, is like her, or how she would be if she were a man. Dalgliesh likes to solve crimes alone, just like P.D. James prefers to write alone. She needs privacy to write and can do it anywhere as long as she is alone.
P.D. James does not agree that she is the best-known crime writer in Britain, even though many people read her 12 detective novels. She admires her friend Ruth Rendell and enjoys her books, especially those written under the name Barbara Vine. She also likes books by women writers like Iris Murdoch and Anita Brookner, but she also reads male authors like Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh, who she thinks were great writers.
P.D. James became successful later in life. She was 42 when her first crime novel, Cover Her Face, was published. She was born in Oxford and grew up in Cambridge. She met her husband there, who was a student. She chose Cambridge as the setting for one of her books, An Unsuitable Job For A Woman.
Her life has not always been easy. Her husband, Connor Bantry White, returned from World War II very sick. She had to work long hours to support him and their two daughters, Clare and Jane. Even though she had many ideas for stories, she did not have time to write. Her husband’s parents helped take care of the children during this tough time.
While working full-time for the National Health Service, she used her strong organizational skills. She managed five psychiatric clinics and then worked for 11 years at the Home Office, first in the Police Department and then in the Criminal Law section. While working in forensic science, she got used to seeing dead bodies, but she was not interested in death itself. Instead, she liked the challenge of writing a crime novel. 
P.D. James always enjoyed reading detective stories and wanted to be a writer. She did not want to write about her own life experiences. Writing detective stories was a good way for her to learn how to write serious novels. She believes that writing about crime helps to bring order to chaos. Solving a crime shows that life is important, even if the person is not likable. She thinks that nobody really likes violence.

**The Pen is Mightier than the Psychoanalyst**
The study of handwriting to understand a person's character is becoming more popular. In some countries, if you apply for a job, you will likely be asked to provide a sample of your handwriting. This handwriting can help decide if you are suitable for the job. Handwriting analysis, also known as graphology, is considered a real science in many places. Researchers believe it can help show certain health problems, like heart disease and cancer, and can reveal emotional issues.
More companies are using handwriting analysis for job interviews. Many large companies now hire graphologists to look at the handwriting of job candidates. However, many doctors and psychiatrists are not sure about the value of graphology. Patricia Marne, a professional graphologist for over 20 years, thinks they should take it more seriously. She believes handwriting can show psychological traits and some medical conditions. She says, ""Handwriting can indicate social class and intelligence. It can also help decide if a person should focus on arts or sciences and if they are honest or deceitful.""
According to Ms. Marne, graphology can help identify possible criminal behavior. She says, ""Criminals often have disturbed handwriting, which can be poorly shaped. Many criminals come from difficult backgrounds and have emotional problems. This can show in childish handwriting and in writing letters multiple times."" 
Ms. Marne claims she can tell if people are honest or manipulative. She says young male offenders often have tall letters, which means they may live in a fantasy world. Graphologists can also see if someone is under a lot of stress or has violent tendencies. Handwriting can even help predict if someone might attempt suicide. 
She explains that heart and lung problems can sometimes be seen in handwriting. ""You cannot make a diagnosis from just one sample unless the writing is clearly shaky. But if the handwriting changes over time or if the signature changes, it could mean something serious is happening,"" she says. A big emotional upset can also change a person's signature for a short time.
Ms. Marne believes handwriting can show other psychological traits. For example, people whose letters connect in a thread-like way may be clever but deceitful. Those who write mostly in capital letters may be hiding their true selves. Light pressure in writing shows sensitivity, while unique handwriting shows confidence and creativity. Disconnected writing often means a person is a loner. Very small signatures can indicate low self-esteem, while circles over the letter ""i"" show a need for attention. Heavy crossing of the letter ""t"" can mean a person is intolerant.
Ms. Marne says it takes six years of study and experience to analyze handwriting correctly, along with empathy and intuition. She believes more research is needed to make graphology a proper science. She thinks this will happen soon. ""It is actually more accurate than psychoanalysis because you can learn a lot about a person’s history and emotional problems without asking them questions,"" she says.
However, despite these interesting ideas, there is little strong evidence to support them. Some psychiatrists are very critical. They argue that handwriting is just a result of education and the way writing is taught, and it does not have any other meaning."

Is your office working well? Fresh air and good chairs are important for a happy and healthy workplace, according to a new survey. We visited four different offices to see how healthy and happy they were. Our expert panel included a building health consultant, an ergonomist (who studies working conditions), and an occupational psychologist. Here are their opinions.
**Office A: Advertising Agency**  
*Building Health Consultant:* This office is very simple; it has no central heating or mechanical ventilation, and the windows open directly to the street. It is surprising that this space works, but the small team seems happy. They adjust to the seasons by opening doors and using electric heaters, just like at home. This may be the reason: the team of seven has created a comfortable working environment without too many rules.  
*Ergonomist:* The furniture is mismatched and creates bad sitting positions. The chairs are old, not adjustable, and some are broken. However, the staff have a varied work schedule, which helps reduce tiredness and boredom.  
*Occupational Psychologist:* The staff enjoy the variety of work and the office size. It is small enough to know what others are doing but big enough to work alone. The office is attractive and fun, showing both efficiency and creativity.
**Office B: News Service**  
*Building Health Consultant:* This office may not be very exciting, but it is comfortable and the staff do not dislike it. The air quality and maintenance are good, helped by a No Smoking policy.  
*Ergonomist:* The company has hired an ergonomist, so the chairs are good, and the lighting and computer equipment are also nice. The space is okay, but the layout could be better. The environment feels impersonal with plain grey walls.  
*Occupational Psychologist:* The walls are mostly bare except for planners and a poster about maternity rights. Most staff have worked there for at least five years, and relationships are good. The office could improve by arranging desks to make sharing information easier.
**Office C: Bank**  
*Building Health Consultant:* This office gets mixed reactions from the staff. It feels like being in a glass box, with many similar offices around. The air is not stale, even with smokers nearby.  
*Ergonomist:* The office is very standard and not inspiring. The desks are okay, but not all chairs are suitable for computer work. The computer screens are often on low desks, which is not good for modern equipment.  
*Occupational Psychologist:* Staff support each other and have good technology. There are many awards on display. The wood paneling and brown carpet make the office feel a bit dull, but it is busy with activity.
**Office D: Newspaper**  
*Building Health Consultant:* There is not much good to say about this office. The air conditioning is poor, causing big temperature changes. The space is messy, and most people do not have enough desk space. It is very dusty, and the roof collects dust that falls on people below.  
*Ergonomist:* The furniture looks more like it belongs in a workshop than an office. Many chairs are not good for people using computers, especially those shorter than 1.75 m. Most chairs are old and do not adjust well.  
*Occupational Psychologist:* The office has old brown chairs, dirty carpets, and a lot of dust. There is a lot of room for improvement. The place needs cleaning, and individual achievements should be recognized. The air conditioning needs to be fixed, especially with many smokers around. When we visited, there were few conversations, and everyone seemed stressed and focused on deadlines. The company should encourage teamwork."
CAE_38,C1,"**Chewing Gum Culture**
Chewing gum is popular and people in America chew 12 million sticks of it every day. This ancient habit has become a big business. Each stick of chewing gum has fewer than ten calories, but it is considered food and must meet the rules of the American Food and Drug Administration.
Today, most gum is made from synthetic materials, with added ingredients that help keep the flavor and improve the texture. However, this was not always true. The ancient Greeks chewed a gum-like substance from the bark of the mastic tree, which grows mainly in Greece and Turkey. Women in Greece liked mastic gum to clean their teeth and freshen their breath. American colonists learned from the Native Americans in New England and chewed the resin from spruce trees. In the early 1800s, pieces of spruce for chewing were sold in the eastern United States, making it the first commercial chewing gum in the country.
Modern chewing gum started in the late 1860s with the discovery of chicle, a milky substance from the sapodilla tree found in Central America. Gum made from chicle was smoother and more enjoyable to chew, leading to the growth of a whole industry. However, attempts to grow sapodilla trees for chicle have not been successful. As the chewing gum market grew, synthetic alternatives were created.
Today, the few remaining chicle gatherers, called chicleros, have a hard and dangerous job. They travel for miles to collect sapodilla in very humid conditions. They face many dangers, including poisonous snakes and insects. One of the worst is the chicle fly, which lays its eggs in the gatherers' ears and noses. Despite these risks, experienced chicleros climb trees quickly to collect the sap, which they carry back to a camp. There, they boil the sap until it becomes sticky and forms bricks.
Life at the camp is difficult, with a boring diet mostly made of maize and local alcohol made from sugar cane. Even though this work is tough, chicleros worry about their jobs. Not long ago, the United States imported 7,000 tonnes of chicle each year from Central America. Last year, only 200 tonnes were collected in the whole Yucatan peninsula of Mexico.
As chewing gum sales have increased, manufacturers have turned to synthetic materials to lower costs and meet demand. At the same time, gum producers are finding clever ways to market their products. They claim that gum helps you relax, gives you energy, and reduces stress. During both world wars, soldiers were often given gum. The biggest claim is that chewing gum helps reduce tooth decay. Plaque acid forms when we eat, but our saliva helps neutralize this acid and provides minerals like calcium and fluoride. Gum manufacturers say that chewing for 20 minutes can increase saliva flow.
Research is ongoing to create new textures and flavors. Glycerine and other vegetable oils are now used to make the gum base. Most new flavors are artificial, but some still use natural ingredients. Additionally, 137 square kilometers of land in America is used to grow mint for the two most popular chewing gums in the world."

C. **MAURITIUS - PARADIS HOTEL**  
On the south-west of Mauritius, the Paradis Hotel is located on a quiet peninsula. The road to the hotel goes along the coast, passing empty beaches where only fishermen are present. The hotel is large and offers many free water sports, but you can easily find peace on its nine kilometers of private beach. If you swim a little way out into the Indian Ocean, you can hardly see the hotel because of the palm trees. In the evening, when everyone has left, you can enjoy the quiet and beautiful sunset.
D. **ST LUCIA - LADERA HOTEL**  
The Ladera Hotel in St Lucia has a stunning view. It is quiet and located high up at 1,000 feet. The open rooms look out between the twin peaks of the Pitons to the Caribbean Sea. The hotel has a colonial style, with wooden furniture and four-poster beds covered with netting.

Sue Brown is a hotel inspector. Christopher Middleton watched her during an inspection. One minute into the inspection, things are already going wrong for the Globe Hotel, but the staff do not know it yet. The receptionist is busy talking on the phone and does not notice Sue and Christopher. Sue whispers, ""She hasn't even acknowledged us. Very poor."" This is a common mistake that Sue has seen many times in her 11 years as an inspector. She expects better from a hotel with three red stars, which means it is one of the top 130 hotels out of 4,000 in the guide she works for.
Before they even enter, Sue feels something is off. The entrance is through a door with no staff, just a buzzer, and a long, empty hallway. ""This is not what I expected,"" she says. Things get worse when the receptionist says, ""We have no record of your booking."" There are 15 rooms in the hotel, but only three are occupied. The room they are offered is not good. It feels stuffy, and there is a big hole in the wall behind the wardrobe.
When Sue started her job, people called her ""The Woman in Black,"" even though she never wore black and did not think she was tough. The next morning, after paying her bill, she tells the hotel manager, Robin Greaves, who looks scared when he sees her. He quickly apologizes for a bad smell in the lounge, saying there is a blocked drain. Sue suggests that he should guide guests to another lounge instead of the one with the smell. Greaves takes notes and seems worried. He has only been at the hotel for five months and is unsure if Sue's feedback will help.
Not everything is bad. Sue praises Emma, the assistant manager, and Trudy, the young waitress, who shared interesting information about the hotel’s 400-year history. The dinner was also good enough to keep the hotel’s two-rosette food rating. Greaves asks, ""What do we need to do to get three rosettes?"" Sue replies, ""Don’t serve a pudding that collapses."" Greaves looks disappointed.
Sue's job is to tell the hotel what is wrong, even if it is hard to say. She remembers a time when a woman complained that Sue got her son fired because he served her apple pie with his fingers. Sometimes, she receives angry letters from hotel owners. ""You get used to it, but it still hurts,"" she says. Sue must give a full report to the hotel after her visit because they pay for her advice.
The good news for Greaves is that Sue will not recommend taking away the Globe's red stars. The bad news is that another inspector will come back in two months to check if the problems have been fixed. ""Good,"" Greaves says, but he does not sound very happy.

Doug Scott, a mountaineer, shares his experiences of climbing the highest mountains on each continent, known as the Seven Summits. He started this journey later in life and will tell his story in the order he climbed them.
**A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)**  
Doug and his climbing partner, Dougal Haston, were in a snow cave below the summit. Dougal started talking about sleeping bags, which Doug found strange since it was just the two of them. He thought it was because of the lack of oxygen. Doug began talking to his own feet because they were getting cold. He remembered other climbers who lost fingers and toes to frostbite. They were not just worried about surviving but also about how well they could survive. Over the next two days, Doug thought about their time on the summit ridge. He felt confident climbing with Dougal and knew they would succeed. He focused on finding a better rhythm to reach the summit.
**B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)**  
This mountain is known to be very dangerous. In April 1976, Doug and Dougal arrived at the Kahiltna Glacier and spent four days carrying equipment and food to the base. After the first day of climbing, they realized how big their task was. They followed a route from 1967 but decided to take a new route to the summit. They climbed with all their gear on their backs, which was a new way to climb this mountain. After three days, Doug's sleeping bag was wet. They spent a night on a windy ridge and both felt tired. Because the air pressure was low, it felt like they were much higher than they actually were. Finally, they reached the summit and celebrated.
**C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m)**  
In September 1976, Doug and his friend Paul Braithwaite flew to Nairobi to climb Mt. Kenya. However, they got a free ride to Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest mountain. On their way, they got lost in the thick jungle and ran out of water. On the second day, they found arrows painted on trees and some trash that led them to a rock pool. They were happy to find trash because it meant they were on the right path. They tried to climb a steep wall but had to turn back due to falling rocks and ice. Instead, they took the Umbwe route to reach the summit.
**D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)**  
In January 1992, Doug and his wife, Sharu, arrived at Punta del Inca. They met a guide named Phil who was taking a group up a different route. After waiting for bad weather to pass, they left base camp. The Polish Glacier was icy and dangerous, so they chose to go towards the standard route where many people were climbing. The wind was strong as they walked to the summit, and they camped outside a refuge that night. At base camp, they met a group planning to climb the Seven Summits. They encouraged Doug to join them, and he began to think seriously about this goal.
**E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)**  
Doug learned that climbing Vinson Massif could be done by guiding enough people to pay for the trip. In November 1992, his team left Britain and traveled to the South Pole. During this time, the sun stays above the horizon all day and night. When the wind stopped, it was very quiet. On December 7, they set off for the summit. Despite strong winds and very low temperatures, they all reached the top in eight hours. However, they could only see a few meters because of a storm.
**F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)**  
In the summer of 1994, Doug's team gathered in St Petersburg. When they arrived at Terskol, they had to pay a fee for bringing foreigners into the valley. After a few days of getting used to the altitude, they took a cable car up to 3,900m and then walked to a refuge at 4,200m. Two days later, they faced strong winds as they climbed. They thought they reached the summit but found there was still a long ridge to go. They returned to the refuge and the next day went down the volcano.
**G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)**  
On their trip to Carstensz, Doug and his team wanted to create a new climbing route and spend time with the local Dani people. They were warned about possible dangers from bandits but decided to continue. On May 12, they started climbing. The weather got better, and two team members went ahead while Doug and Sham moved slower because Sham was filming. They reached the summit by 11 am, and Doug received a standing ovation for completing his seventh summit. Mission accomplished!"

The Merrion Hotel is a new five-star hotel in Dublin. It was created by changing four large old houses and took almost two years to complete. The hotel has the latest technology to help both staff and guests.
General Manager Peter MacCann wants his staff to know the guests' names. For more details about what guests like, he uses the hotel’s computer system. This system helps the hotel give special service to returning guests. Although it cost £250,000 to set up, MacCann believes it will save money in the long run. He is happy with how well it works and the services it provides. For example, if a guest asks for certain music CDs during their first stay, those CDs will be ready for them when they come back.
Many hotel guests often complain about room temperature. The Merrion Hotel has a high-tech system that allows guests to change the temperature in their rooms. They can adjust it by three degrees around the normal temperature of 18°C. The front desk can also change the temperature anywhere between 14°C and 25°C.
Business guests will find the technology in their rooms very useful. MacCann thinks that about 65% of the hotel’s business will come from this group. To meet their needs, the hotel has put a business center in each room. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that can also copy and print, and a video-conferencing system.
Technology changes quickly, so the hotel has prepared for future improvements. They have added extra cables for new technology. The televisions are rented, so they can be replaced with newer models when needed. DVD recorders can also be updated.
Even with all this modern technology, MacCann wants guests to feel comfortable. The hotel has 145 large and well-furnished bedrooms that are welcoming. There is also a swimming pool, a gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a beautiful garden.
The food at the hotel is very important. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, who has two Michelin stars, has moved his restaurant to the Merrion. This change has many benefits for both him and the hotel. He has designed a new kitchen and improved parking. The hotel can now offer a great place to eat without financial risks. With good technology and a skilled staff, the Merrion Hotel is likely to be very successful."

Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. The large garden around her house gives her many ideas for her art. It is full of her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wildly and spread all over the garden. The two long flower borders along the path in the garden have a beautiful mix of colors and shapes. This is partly because the previous owners were good gardeners and left plants that Susan liked. She also kept the gardener, Danny. ""In fact, it was really his garden,"" she says. ""We got along very well. At first, he would say, 'Oh, it's not worth it' for some of the things I wanted to add, but when I said I wanted to paint them, he understood what I meant.""
Susan likes to focus on painting individual plants instead of the whole garden. Sometimes, she paints a group of plants, but usually, she picks one flower and takes it to her studio. ""I don't set everything up at once,"" she explains. ""I take one flower out and paint it, which might take a few days. Then I bring in another one and build up the painting that way. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.""
Her busiest time is spring and early summer when the tulips bloom, followed by the poppies. ""They all come out together, and you're so busy,"" she says. But she also finds beauty in how flowers change as they decay. For example, with tulips, ""you bring them in and put them in water, then leave them for a day, and they change shape. They open up and look amazing. At first, you think they are boring, but they change all the time.""
Susan has always loved plants. ""I studied botany in school and used to collect wildflowers from the countryside,"" she says. ""I wasn't really interested in gardening then; I thought garden flowers looked fake, like silk or plastic. To me, only wildflowers were real. I was fascinated by how they could grow in difficult places, like cracks in rocks or on cliffs.""
Today, her garden has many plants from faraway places, but they seem to fit in well. She has a relaxed attitude towards her garden, like a caring aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don’t cause too much trouble. With two upcoming exhibitions to prepare for and plenty of subjects to paint, she has found it hard to work in the garden lately. She now hires an extra gardener, but she knows that to stay connected with her art, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""

Many trees in the Brackham area fell during the strong storms in March. The town lost two big lime trees from the old market square. The loss of these trees changed the look of the town center, which upset some of the local people. Normally, Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, the head of the local police, would have been one of those upset. But during the storm, when the wind knocked down the walnut tree in his garden, he was too sick to notice. Pelham, a large and healthy man, was seriously ill for the first time in his life with bronchitis. When he first felt pain in his head and tightness in his chest, his wife, Molly, tried to get him to see a doctor. He thought the police needed him too much, so he ignored her and kept working. This made him forget things and made him short-tempered. It was only when his colleague, Sergeant Lloyd, took him to the doctor that he finally agreed to go. By then, he was too weak to argue. Soon, she took him to the pharmacy to get his antibiotics and then home to his wife, who sent him straight to bed.
On Thursday morning, when Molly told him that the walnut tree had fallen during the night, Pelham could not believe it. On Thursday evening, he weakly asked if the house was damaged. He was relieved to hear it was not and pulled the sheets over his head. It was not until Saturday, when the antibiotics worked, and he got up, that he realized the loss of the walnut tree had changed the living room forever. The Pelhams' big house had a large garden. It was expensive, but Pelham was happy with his choice. The garden had given them privacy. Now, the storm had changed how he saw things. Before, the living room had a beautiful walnut tree outside. This tree did not make the room dark because there was also a window on the other wall. The tree created nice patterns of light and shadow that hid the old furniture from their previous house. Without the tree, the room was too bright, showing the worn furniture in all its bad condition. The view from the window was not nice either. The tall house next door, which was hidden by the tree, was now visible, with its ugly purple bricks and pipes. It had many upstairs windows that seemed to watch the Pelhams all the time.
“Doesn’t it look terrible?” Pelham said weakly to his wife. But Molly, standing in the doorway, sounded more happy than upset. “That’s what I’ve been telling you since we moved here. We need to buy a new sofa, no matter the cost.”"
FCE_16,B2,"Living in the Valley**
We had been living in our valley for sixteen months when we first noticed the dangers in the hills around us that could threaten our survival. It was the year when the storms came early, even before November ended. Until then, we felt safe in our valley below the hills. Soon, snow began to fall. Within a day, it was about 15 centimeters deep. It almost completely blocked our lane and made the path by the stream slippery and dangerous. But in the hills, the snow was much deeper and stayed for longer. Up there, the wind blew strongly. In our valley, we felt only sudden gusts of wind; the trees swayed, but their branches stayed strong. Still, we knew we had reasons to worry. The snow and wind were annoying, but they did not really scare us. It was the river, the Ryburn, which usually flowed gently, that worried us the most. It reminded us of what could happen if the water from the hills was not controlled by the dams built many years ago.
Soon, the snow started to melt. Day after day, we watched dark clouds gather over the hills to the west. These grey clouds spread over the valleys, warning us of what was coming. We had seen enough of the sky; now we began to watch the river, which was getting fuller and wilder every day. The snow was washed away as more rain fell from the clouds, but the reservoir in the hills was filling up and getting close to overflowing. Then it happened - for the first time in years, the reservoir overflowed. It was like a small Niagara Falls, as the water rushed over the dam and into the stream below. The river looked wild as the water poured down towards its lower parts. Just a couple of meters from our cottage, the stream was furious beneath the bridge. It was much deeper than we had ever seen it so close to our home, crashing against its banks. For three days, we hoped it would stay below its edge. Luckily, our hopes were answered as the dam held and the water began to go down.
In the past, before the dam was built, the river had flooded nearby villages many times. Now, the dam controls the river's flow, and usually everything is fine. The large amount of water from the hills, from snow and heavy rain, stays behind the dam with only a little overflow sometimes. Because of this protection, we can enjoy the big clouds over the valley and feel excited by the river's power. Thanks to the dam, we can feel that our home in the valley is still safe."

Film critic Mark Adams looks back at his ten years of work as a film critic for a newspaper called The Front Page. Writing articles about films for The Front Page was my first real job. Before that, I had done some reviews - books for other newspapers, films for a magazine, and anything I was asked to do for the radio. That is how I met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, who also wrote for radio and television. He hired me, but Tom was not mainly a journalist, or he would have been more careful in choosing his staff. 
At first, he wanted a team of critics to cover art forms that didn’t need special knowledge: books, TV, theatre, film, and radio. We would have a weekly lunch to choose what to write about from the artistic material Tom wanted us to cover, and there would also be guests to make it friendly. It felt like a dream at that time: a new newspaper, and I was part of the team. It seemed unlikely that a new paper could succeed in a busy market. I even thought a millionaire wanted to help me personally and was pretending to hire me because I lacked self-confidence. The first time I saw someone reading the newspaper on the London Underground and turning to a page with my review, I didn’t know where to look.
Tom's idea for a team of critics for the arts did not work out. It was a good idea, but we didn’t meet as planned, so everything was done by phone. It turned out that the public preferred to have a reviewer focus on one subject area, so I chose film. Without Tom's help, we would not have the current setup, where I write a longer weekly piece, usually about one film. I like this way of working. I wouldn’t have enjoyed the usual film critic's job, which means watching every new film. That routine would make me tired quickly. I would soon be sitting in my seat on a Monday morning, thinking, ""What terrible film do I have to watch now?"" - a thought that many critics have around the world.
The time I have allows me to expand my ideas or, in a boring week, to create something interesting from nothing. But what is my role in the public eye? I think people choose films based on the stars, the advertising, or the director. Some people are loyal to certain types of films, while others avoid them. It is rare for someone who dislikes westerns to buy a ticket for one after reading a review, or for a romantic film lover to skip a love story because of a review. So if a film review is not really a guide for consumers, what is it? I don’t feel I have to be ""right"" about a movie. I also don’t think there should be a set number of ""great"" and ""bad"" films each year. All I need to do is present an argument. I’m not a judge, and I don’t want to be one."

Why would a schoolgirl want to swim 1500 meters, cycle 40 kilometers, and then run 10 kilometers? Because ""it's fun."" 
Melanie Sears is a teenager who loves endurance sports. She is looking for a training partner for triathlons, preferably a girl. The partner should enjoy long-distance running (15 kilometers regularly), swimming (especially in cold water), and cycling (100 kilometers is a plus). It is important to be able to do all three sports without resting.
Triathlons are becoming very popular in the Olympics. Many people are amazed (and sometimes shocked) to see athletes swim 1500 meters, cycle 40 kilometers, and then run 10 kilometers without stopping. But why do these athletes push their bodies so hard? 
Melanie, who is 17 and does well in school, has not yet learned the usual phrases about personal satisfaction and mental challenges that many athletes say. She explains, ""You swim 1500 meters, then run out of the water and jump on your bike, still wet. Of course, then you freeze. After the 40-kilometer bike ride, you have to run 10 kilometers, which is hard when you're tired. But it's great fun, and it's all worth it in the end.""
Melanie started her first triathlon when she was 14. ""I won the junior section, but I was the only junior there. It felt so easy that I waved at my teammates as I went around."" Feeling confident, she entered the National Championships. Although she had the second fastest swim and the fastest run, she did not do well overall. ""I was following a man, and suddenly we reached the sea. We realized we had gone the wrong way. I ended up cycling 20 kilometers too far. I cried all the way through the run."" But she did not give up and is determined to keep trying. ""Sometimes I wish I could stop because then the pain would be over, but I am afraid that if I stop just once, I would want to stop again.""
Steve Trew, the sport's director of coaching, admires her determination. ""I tested her fitness,"" he says, ""and she worked so hard on the running machine that it finally threw her off into a wall. She gave it everything, but while most people stop when they can't go further, she just kept going.""
This year, Melanie was the top junior in the European Triathlon Championships, finishing 13th. ""I was almost as good as the top three in swimming and running, but much slower at cycling. That's why I'm working very hard on it."" She is trying to convince her parents to buy a £2,000 bike (with a £1,000 discount) for her trip to New Zealand for the World Championships. 
However, her tough training has made her a bit of a loner. ""I don't have a social life,"" she says. ""I'm not a party person. After two hours of hard swimming on Friday nights, I just want to sleep. But I call and write to the other girls on the team."" What do they talk about? Boys? Clothes? ""No, we talk about our times in the races.""
Where will all this focus lead her? Melanie has tried other events, like the triathlon ""sprint,"" where you only swim 750 meters, cycle 20 kilometers, and run 5 kilometers. She wants to enter even tougher events than the triathlon. ""The big problem is, I have no one my age to train with,"" she says."
FCE_70,B2,"The Collectors**
Amanda Roy writes about collecting and why many people enjoy this hobby. I have always loved collecting, and one in three adults shares this interest. Collecting is a world of passion and excitement. However, if you want to collect something, remember this: only collect items you truly love. 
Since ancient times, people have wanted to collect things. Long ago, early humans collected pebbles and wore them as necklaces. They liked the shapes and colors of the pebbles, which were their first attempts to gather objects for personal reasons. Over the years, not much has changed. Children still collect stones and seashells just for their beauty.
I have been collecting all my life. I have collected many things, from flowers like tulips to pottery and paintings. My first collection was stones I found in my parents' garden. When I was six, I went to a school in a remote part of England, a cold place surrounded by hills. When my parents visited, they took me to a local museum filled with objects collected by people in the past. I was fascinated by these items. 
Surprisingly, I am not alone in my interest in collecting. One in three adults enjoys this hobby. People collect for many reasons, and some say it is the only part of their lives where they feel in control. For me, it is just something I enjoy.
One famous collector was the Duc de Berry in France. He had a ""room of wonders"" filled with natural and man-made curiosities, like cups made from coconut shells and pieces of Oriental china. Another collector, Catherine the Great of Russia, owned more than 4,000 paintings. But you don’t have to be rich to start a collection. I have collected many different items, like tulip bulbs and china cups, with great determination. 
I remember when I convinced another tulip collector to sell me a special tulip. I planted it and took care of it, but one year it disappeared—stolen by another collector. I also collected 350 American rag dolls, searching all over the USA for different designs. Sadly, this collection was destroyed when my house caught fire. The next morning, I stood in my front hall and saw the remains of my furniture and my collection. I was very sad about both.
I have always been interested in how collections change hands. A silver spoon that belonged to a king or a poet gives value to items traded in markets. As small objects become popular among collectors, their prices go up. For example, toys from the 1950s are now valuable, especially if you kept the original boxes. (Unfortunately, I threw away both the boxes and the toys!)"
FCE_3,B2,"My Line of Work**
Four people talk about their jobs.
**Lisa - Exhibition Programmes Organiser, Science Museum**  
I organize temporary exhibitions. This means I plan and design the exhibition and promote it. I read about the exhibition topic and talk to important people to find out the main themes and goals. I decide what objects and pictures to display. I also plan interactive displays, workshops, and theatre to help the public understand the exhibition. I work with engineers and electricians to make sure the exhibition is safe for visitors. Before the exhibition opens, I help create brochures and leaflets to inform people about it.
**Janet - Teacher of London Taxi Drivers**  
When I arrive at 7:30 a.m., I first check the accounts. Then, I see what new maps and documents we need for the taxi-driver test. By midday, about 50 students are in school, learning how to make the journeys. They find the best routes, using one-way streets and making the right turns. I help when there are disagreements, like whether a right turn is allowed at a certain junction. When they are close to the test, I give them a simple route, but I tell them they must take a different route because the road is closed. The next student has to find another route, and I give them a reason why they can’t go that way. This is to make them think.
**Sarah - Marine Conservationist**  
I live by the coast and work from home. I answer phone calls, create educational materials, and set up training courses. Sometimes, I go to our main office, but I usually work on the coast. I work with schools and study centers and run courses for coastal managers and decision-makers about the sea. I take them out to sea in a boat to help them understand the life below the water. This often changes their views because it is very different from making decisions on a computer. I am lucky because conservation is my hobby, so I enjoy my job. However, I work for a charity, so I always need to find more money, which makes it hard to do everything I want.
**Chris - Map and Atlas Publisher**  
My job is quite varied. I make sure our publishing program meets market needs and that we have about 300 books in stock. We have high standards for information and content. We receive many letters from readers about issues like international boundaries, and I must respond carefully. I discuss future projects and current sales with co-publishers. I work with a great team, which makes the job enjoyable. The downside is that there is too much administration, which leaves less time for more interesting tasks like product development and design."

Every June, we went to Ireland. Since the four of us started going on holidays together, we spent the first two weeks of the month at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. It is a big house by the sea, not far from the village of Ardbeag. The English couple who own the house, the Malseeds, have made some changes to it, but they did it carefully. Strafe found Glencorn for us. He saw an advertisement when the Malseeds were still advertising. ""How about this?"" he said one evening and read the details. The summer before, we had gone to a hotel recommended by friends, but it was not good because the food was terrible. The four of us have been playing cards together for a long time: Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia, and me. They call me Milly, but my real name is Dorothy Milson. Dekko got his nickname at school; Dekko Deacon sounds nice, I guess. He and Strafe were in school together, which is why we call Strafe by his last name like the teachers did. We are all about the same age and live close to the town where the Malseeds lived before moving from England to Ireland. We always think it is a funny coincidence.
""How very nice,"" Mrs. Malseed said, smiling to welcome us again this year. She seems to know when guests are arriving because she is usually waiting in the large hall that smells of flowers. ""Arthur, take the luggage up,"" she told the old porter. ""Rose, Tulip, Lily, and Geranium,"" she said, naming the rooms we would stay in. Mrs. Malseed painted flowers on the doors instead of using numbers. In winter, when not many people come to Glencorn Lodge, she takes care of little details like that; her husband takes care of repairs and decoration. ""Well, well, well,"" Mr. Malseed said as he came into the hall from the kitchen. ""A hundred thousand welcomes,"" he greeted us in the Irish way. He was smiling, and his dark brown eyes sparkled, making us feel special, not just another group of guests. Everyone smiled, and I could feel that our holiday had truly begun. Nothing had changed at Glencorn; everything was good. Kitty from the dining room came out to greet us. ""You look younger every year, all four of you,"" she said, making everyone laugh again. 
Arthur led the way to our rooms, carrying as much luggage as he could and coming back for the rest. After dinner, we played cards for a while but not for too long because we were still tired from the journey. In the lounge, there was a man alone and a French couple. There were other people at dinner because Glencorn Lodge is always full in June. From our table by the window, we could see some guests walking on the lawns and others going down the cliff path to the beach. In the morning, we would do the same: walk along the sand to Ardbeag and have coffee at the hotel there, returning in time for lunch. In the afternoon, we would drive somewhere. I knew this because over the years, we had developed this routine. Since we first came here, we had all fallen in love with the beautiful landscape."

A chalet girl's work is never done, says Sarah Sutherland-Pilch. This is her second year as a chalet girl. Sarah, 24 years old, is from West Sussex, England. She works in Val d'Isere, France, cooking and cleaning for visitors who come to ski and stay in wooden houses called chalets. Sarah studied French and History of Art at Oxford Brookes University.
Sarah does not see being a chalet girl as a long-term job. She enjoys it and thinks it is a good way to meet interesting people. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to the chalet, which can host up to 18 guests each week. She has her own breakfast before making breakfast for the guests. They have a big breakfast with porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants.
After breakfast, around 9:30 a.m., Sarah cleans up and either prepares afternoon tea for the guests or cleans the rooms, which she says is the worst part of her job. By 11 a.m., she is ready to ski. On good days, she can ski until 4:30 p.m. 
After skiing, Sarah returns to the chalet to prepare dinner. Dinner is served at 8 p.m., and coffee is usually ready by 10 p.m. After dinner, she cleans the kitchen. She prefers to start the next day with a clean kitchen. Sometimes she talks with the guests, but other times they want to be alone. 
Sarah meets her friends in the chalet where she lives, and they go out around 11 p.m. They usually start at a place called Bananas, then go to G Jay's, and maybe end the night at Dick's T-Bar. However, she does not stay out too late on Saturday because Sunday is her busiest day.
On Sunday, she starts work early. Breakfast for guests leaving has to be ready by 7 a.m. After the guests leave, Sarah cleans quickly. If she has not done the shopping for the week on Saturday, she does it now. Around 3 p.m., after cleaning, she prepares tea for the new guests who arrive around 4:30 p.m. Sometimes the new guests are confused and have many questions.
Between tea and dinner, Sarah helps guests who need ski boots or skis and then gets a ride back to the chalet. Soon, it is time for dinner again, and sometimes she has a drink afterward, but if she is too tired, she goes to bed early."

Miss Rita Cohen was a small girl with pale skin. She looked much younger than Seymour's daughter, Marie, but she said she was six years older. One day, she came to Seymour's factory wearing overalls and big shoes. Her curly hair framed her pretty face. Seymour found it hard to believe that she was studying at the University of Pennsylvania and doing research on the leather industry in New Jersey for her Master's degree.
A few times a year, someone would contact Seymour to ask if they could visit his factory. Sometimes, he would help students by answering their questions over the phone or giving them a short tour if they seemed serious. Rita was very small, almost like the children from Marie's third-grade class, who had visited the factory years ago to see how gloves were made. Seymour remembered how Marie loved to watch the workers shape and press the gloves using hot brass hands. She called them the ""pancake hands"" because they looked flat and strange.
Rita asked, ""How many pieces come in a shipment?"" Seymour replied, ""Between twenty and twenty-five thousand."" She took notes and asked, ""Do they come directly to your shipping department?"" He liked that she was interested in all the details. ""They go to the tannery first. The tannery is a contractor. We buy the material, and they prepare it for us. My grandfather, father, and I all worked in the tannery here in town. Have you ever been inside a tannery?"" 
""Not yet,"" Rita said. 
""Well, you should visit a tannery if you want to write about leather. I can help you set that up. They are old places. The technology has improved, but it is still similar to what it was hundreds of years ago. It’s hard work. Tanning is one of the oldest industries. They found 6,000-year-old tools for tanning in Turkey. The first clothes were just animal skins that were tanned by smoking them. It’s an interesting subject. My father knows a lot about leather. If you talk to him about gloves, he could talk for two days. Glovemen really love their work. 
""Have you ever seen anything being made, Miss Cohen?"" 
""I can't say I have."" 
""Never seen anything made?"" 
""I saw my mother make a cake when I was a child."" 
Seymour laughed. She made him smile. She was innocent and eager to learn. His daughter was much taller than Rita, but Rita reminded him of Marie. She had the same bright intelligence that filled their home when Marie came back from school, full of what she had learned. 
""I have an idea. We will show you the whole process. Come on! We are going to make you a pair of gloves, and you will watch them being made from start to finish. What size do you wear?"""

**Is it a tough job?** Chris Arnot asks four people with dream jobs if they are as great as they seem.
**A. Raquel Graham**  
Raquel Graham calls from a taxi on her way to the airport. She cannot meet us tomorrow because her boss wants her in Los Angeles instead. As a personal assistant to a pop star, she has to travel around the world quickly. Raquel loves her job and gets along well with her boss. However, she has one small problem - she does not like flying. ""On a nine-hour flight to California, I usually take sleeping pills to help me relax,"" she says. Her worst experience was flying on Concorde. ""It felt so closed in with those tiny windows."" When she is not traveling, she works in offices in Manchester and London. She has to do some boring paperwork, like organizing schedules, attending meetings with lawyers and accountants, planning trips, and making more travel arrangements. She did not apply for this job. A chance meeting with a pop group manager led to her getting work behind the scenes, and she took a secretarial course in the evenings. Five years later, she was in the right place when her boss needed a personal assistant.
**B. David Brown**  
David Brown has worked as an accountant and a golf caddy, which means he carries a golfer's bags. He prefers being a caddy because golf is his passion. However, there are some downsides. He earns a small flat fee plus a percentage of the winnings. The average earnings are between £25,000 and £35,000, but much of that goes to travel and hotels. He was 31 when he first caddied for golfer Greg Norman. ""You are not just carrying bags. You give advice, use your knowledge, and try to understand the course,"" he explains. Recently, his accounting skills were recognized by European Tour Productions, and they made him a statistical data administrator. He collects and analyzes statistics from the caddies, which are important for TV commentators, golf magazines, and the golfers.
**C. Martin Fern**  
Martin Fern is the editor of the 'Food and Drink' pages of a daily newspaper. One of his easier tasks is to try food at the best restaurants. What does he think about restaurants that charge high prices? ""For those who can pay, it's their choice,"" he says. ""I would rather spend £120 on a meal I will remember than buy a microwave."" His cooking talent led to a friend offering him a food column in a Saturday Review. At that time, he was the creative director of an advertising agency, and it was a good extra income. He was 42 when another newspaper offered him a full-time job. ""It meant a 50% cut in my guaranteed income,"" he says. ""But it was a chance to turn my passion into a job."" He still cooks at home and tries to stay healthy by cycling a couple of miles to the nearest tube station.
**D. Dick Prince**  
""I started writing children's stories about 20 years ago,"" says Dick Prince, one of Britain's most popular children's writers. ""Before that, I loved words and enjoyed using them, but I mostly wrote poems. Then I had an idea for a story. I had been a farmer and knew about chickens being killed by a fox. So, I wrote a story called The Fox Busters, which became my first published children's book."" Where do his ideas come from? ""It's not easy; I have to work hard on them,"" he says. ""I usually do this in the mornings. I don't wake up at dawn, I'm afraid. After lunch, I spend a couple of hours typing what I wrote in the morning. I use an old portable typewriter instead of a laptop. I get between 50 and 100 letters a week, and that is the part of being a writer that I enjoy the most. I try to answer them all, but now I have some help with that."""
FCE_66,B2,"'In the lumberyard by the lake, trees from the woods were turned into boards for building. There was an old brick building that was two floors high, and outside, there were big piles of soft sawdust. These golden piles of dust covered the yard down to the blue lake. That afternoon, feeling bored, all the boys followed Michael up the ladder to the roof of the old building. They sat with their legs hanging over the edge, looking out at the lake. Suddenly, Michael said, ""I dare you to jump down,"" and without thinking, he jumped off the roof and landed in the sawdust, rolling around and laughing. ""I dare you all!"" he shouted. ""You're all cowards,"" he said, trying to get them to jump too. 
Still laughing, he watched them hesitate on the roof, looking scared. One by one, they jumped down and got up smiling with relief. In the hot afternoon sun, they lay on the sawdust pile telling jokes until one of the boys said, ""Come on up on the roof again and jump down."" They were not very excited, but they went up to the roof again and started jumping off in a determined way until only Michael was left. The others were down below, smiling and calling, ""Come on, Mike. What's wrong with you?"" 
Michael wanted to jump down and join them, but he stayed on the edge of the roof, nervously licking his lips and grinning. He wondered why it did not seem like a long drop the first time. For a while, they thought he was just joking, but then they saw him clenching his fists. He was trying to count to ten and then jump. When that did not work, he tried to take a deep breath and close his eyes. Soon, the boys began to laugh at him; they were tired of waiting, and it was almost dinnertime. ""Come on, you're a coward! Do you think we're going to sit here all night?"" they shouted. When he did not move, they started to walk away, still shouting. 
""Who started this? What's wrong with you all?"" he called. But he stayed on the edge of the roof, looking sadly at the ground. He was alone for nearly an hour while the sun slowly set over the lake. His clothes were wet from nervous sweat. Finally, he closed his eyes, jumped off the roof, and fell heavily into the sawdust, lying there for a long time. The yard was quiet; the workers had gone home. As he lay there, he wondered why he could not jump before. Then he got up slowly and walked home, feeling very ashamed and wanting to avoid everyone. He was so late for dinner that his stepmother said coldly, ""You should be able to get home in time for dinner. If you won't come home, you might as well stay in tonight."" She was a strong woman with fair skin and a little grey in her hair, always patient. She spoke with a serious tone, but Michael, with his dark face looking sad, hardly heard her. He was still thinking about the boys laughing at him on the sawdust pile.'"
FCE_44,B2,"**Careers Advice**
Are you unhappy in your job and not sure how to change it? Kitty Doherty offers some helpful advice. Many people who want to change their job go to a careers adviser. First, you will write a short history of yourself and then take some tests called 'psychometrics'. After the tests, you will receive a summary of the results and suggestions for different careers, along with any retraining you might need.
I decided to try Career Analysts, one of the biggest organizations that give career advice. Taking the careers test felt like being back in school during science exams. I was with about ten other people, and we had to answer questions quickly. I reminded myself that it was not about passing or failing. It was hard to see how the psychometric tests would show an accurate picture of me. The tests included finding mistakes in lists of names and numbers and matching similar shapes.
After the tests, I talked with an adviser. He used my test results and our conversation to create a report with his observations and recommendations. I agreed with most of what he said, but I was a bit upset to learn that I did poorly in the scientific and practical tests. I am glad I never became a nurse! However, it was good to hear that I had made the right choices regarding journalism.
Changing your career does not always mean making a big change. Last March, after working as a marketing manager for five years, 25-year-old Donna Laney lost her job. Her friends suggested she visit Career Analysts for help. ""Losing my job was a great chance for me to think about my career,"" says Donna. ""I wanted to look at my skills and interests."" Some of the results surprised her. ""I didn’t know I had a talent for design. But I had to think about the cost of retraining in design compared to my financial situation,"" she explains. Other ideas included taking a year off to work in the Far East. ""I decided to use my existing skills and find a job that suited me better than insurance. Now, I work as a Public Relations officer. I believe I would have reached this point without Career Analysts, but they helped me understand what I really wanted to do. I have sent several friends there, and they are all happy with the service.""
Some people feel they would not have made important decisions without help. A visit to Career Counselling Services helped 26-year-old Juliet Greene make life-changing choices. ""After working at a big bank for six years, I found my job boring and wanted a new challenge. I had no idea what I wanted to do, so I went to Career Counselling Services with an open mind. I took the tests, which showed I was interested in sciences,"" she says. ""I had four sessions with an adviser. The third session was recorded, which was helpful because you forget many things you say. After the fourth meeting, I listened to the test results and decided I wanted to study geology. I plan to start a degree in it later this year. I think the advice from Career Counselling Services was worth the money. I am much happier now.""
However, career advice does not work for everyone. Amanda Margetts, a 24-year-old sales representative, says, ""I reached a point in my career where I didn’t know what to do next. I thought a careers adviser might suggest something new. Although I received many ideas, I rejected them because they either meant a big pay cut or a lot of retraining. I didn’t learn anything new about myself,"" she says. ""You have to share a lot of personal information with the adviser, and I felt that if I had told a friend the same things, they would have given me similar advice."""
FCE_22,B2,"Fun at the Dentist's**
If you visit W. Lloyd Jerome's dental office in the center of Glasgow, you will see bright paintings on the walls and a stylish blue couch where patients sit while he checks their teeth. Jerome says, ""Fifty percent of people only go to the dentist when they are in pain instead of for regular check-ups. This is because they are scared."" To help with this, he has tried to make a place where people feel safe. That is why he decided not to wear a white coat, which many people connect with pain. He believes that dental treatment should happen in a relaxing, interesting, and enjoyable atmosphere.
This idea is surprising for many people who think of dental visits as painful or very formal. Jerome says, ""If people are relaxed, entertained, and treated well, they will forget their bad experiences."" One of his new ways to help people relax is by using virtual-reality headsets. ""We were the first dental office in Britain to use them, and they are very popular. The headsets are used during the first check-up, where the patient sits comfortably on the blue couch and watches a film about underwater wildlife while I check their teeth. Then the headset shows a special camera that gives the patient a view of their mouth.""
Most patients seem to enjoy this part of their visit. Another important thing is that the office smells more like a perfume shop than a dentist's office. Today, it smells like orange. Jerome explains, ""When people walk in, I want them to feel with all their senses that it is not like going to the dentist. Smell is very important. The usual dentist smell can make people feel nervous."" I found the nice smell in the office very pleasant.
Even though he is known as Glasgow's most stylish dentist, Jerome takes his work very seriously. The relaxation methods are important, but the quality of the treatment is the most important thing. For example, Jerome uses a special tool that sprays warm water on the teeth to clean them instead of scraping. It feels a bit strange at first, but if people are relaxed, it is not painful at all.
Five years ago, Jerome went to the United States to learn about dental techniques. ""One thing I learned is that when you make it easier for the patient, it is easier for you too,"" he explains. He believes that his patient-focused approach is the beginning of a change towards less formality in British dentistry.
At that moment, a patient arrives. Jerome quickly goes to him, offers a cup of tea (herbal or regular), asks what video he would like to watch, and gently leads him to the chair. The patient seems to enjoy this special treatment, and it is easy to see why. The office feels more like a beautiful salon than a regular dental practice."

Chocolate, which comes from South America, is now a big business around the world. In the UK, people spend over £230 million on chocolate at Easter. This is about eight percent of all chocolate sales for the year. People eat even more chocolate at Christmas. 
The large production of chocolate started in the last century, but the cacao plant was first grown by the Aztec, Toltec, and Mayan civilizations in Central America over three thousand years ago. The cacao tree is a tropical plant found in Africa, South and Central America, the West Indies, and South-East Asia. The fruit of this tree is the size of a melon and has 20-40 seeds. When dried, these seeds become cacao beans, which are used to make chocolate. In English-speaking countries, they are often called cocoa beans, which is a spelling mistake from the 17th century.
The Aztecs used cocoa beans as money and made a drink called xocoatl, which means ""bitter water"" in their language. They flavored this drink with spices for special occasions. The Spanish liked the drink better with cinnamon and sugar, but it took another hundred years for the recipe to reach the rest of Europe. 
In the late 17th century, chocolate houses opened in European cities where people could drink chocolate. Until the last century, the drink was made from solid chocolate blocks that had to be melted in hot water. In 1826, CJ van Houten from the Netherlands invented chocolate powder by removing most of the cocoa butter from the beans. The chocolate bar we know today started in 1847 when a company in Bristol, Fry and Sons, mixed cocoa butter with chocolate liquor and sugar to make a solid block. A Swiss company later added milk to create milk chocolate.
At the beginning of the 20th century, French companies dominated the British chocolate market. In 1879, the English company Cadbury named their factory Bournville, hoping to attract some French style. Then, in 1905, Cadbury introduced the Dairy Milk bar, which was first called Dairymaid. Smart advertising linked it to the healthy milk from the English countryside, making it popular against French brands.
Today, people in Britain eat about four chocolate bars each week. This has made chocolate companies look for new ways to attract customers. One new idea is to turn chocolate bars into ice cream, soft drinks, or desserts to appeal to chocolate lovers who want something different. 
However, cacao farmers are still struggling because cocoa bean prices fell in the late 1980s. Many small farmers went out of business. So, next time you enjoy a chocolate bar, think about the farmers who grow cacao."
FCE_18,B2,"**THE SHELL ARTIST**
At 83 years old, Peter Cooke is a master of his art. He still wants to try new things, like making paper and working with feathers. For now, he focuses on what he loves: creating beautiful objects from shells. 
As he shows me his work in his apartment, he asks, ""Am I boring you?"" There is a fine line between being boring and being passionate, but Cooke is definitely passionate. His charm and the beauty of his creations make it easy to listen to him. 
He points to some shell-covered decorations above his fireplace. ""I won’t mind if people don’t buy them because I love them. I never planned to sell my work. About five years ago, some friends told me I should have an exhibition so more people could see my art. They helped me talk to a gallery owner."" This led to an exhibition in London, where 70% of his pieces were sold. His second exhibition opened yesterday. 
The prices for his work are high—around £2,000 for some decorations. Cooke says he has nothing to do with the prices and is open about them. He believes that no one else makes art like his, and the gallery owner told him, ""One day you will stop, and everyone will want your pieces because there won’t be any more."" 
Cooke wishes he had started this work earlier in life because he thinks he could have made even more amazing things. Although he still has many ideas, he feels he is more limited now than when he began. However, his work is very different from the common shell items found in seaside shops. 
""I have a miniature mind,"" he says, which has led him to create boxes covered in thousands of tiny shells, small pictures made from shells, and baskets of very realistic flowers. He has developed his own method and uses materials he finds. For example, he uses cardboard from laundered shirts for flower bases, a special glue from a sail-maker, and washing-up liquid to clean the shells. 
""I have an idea of what I want to do, and it just happens,"" he says about his working process. The details, colors, and balance in his work look very careful and not random at all. 
Cooke searches for beautiful, tiny shells not just on his local beaches in Norfolk, but also in places like France, Thailand, Mexico, South Africa, and the Philippines. He lies on the sand to find shells to take home. He only collects dead shells and defends himself against people who accuse him of harming the beaches. ""When I collect shells, I see many people stepping on them much faster than I can collect them. The sea breaks up the shells that are left. I would never take shells with living creatures in them, but once they are empty, why shouldn’t I collect them?"" 
His argument is strong, especially considering the beauty of his work often exceeds the beauty of the shells themselves."
FCE_62,B2,"**The Schoolgirl Model**
Kira Langer is a 15-year-old girl who is a model. When she is not traveling to exciting places or appearing on magazine covers, she is studying for her school exams. Jane Laidlaw learns more about her.
The receptionist at Kira's modeling agency told me, ""I'm afraid Kira will be a little late."" I thought, ""Oh, that's fine."" I had read some bad things about models, like they can be difficult or vain, and I worried that Kira would be late. I wondered how late she would be. Would she come at all? What if she chose to go to the hairdresser instead of meeting me? If she was late, she might be in a bad mood and not want to talk.
But when Kira, the winner of the Looks magazine supermodel competition, arrived, she was smiling and relaxed, and she was with her mother. Kira was not wearing fancy clothes; she had on a simple black dress and trainers. She seemed very friendly and was not selfish at all. Kira explained that all models under 16 must bring an adult with them to work. Her mother looked proud of her daughter.
Kira seemed a bit confused by her sudden fame, which was unexpected. It was her older sister who encouraged her to enter the modeling competition. Kira said, ""She saw the competition and told me to join. I said no, but she sent some photos anyway."" When Kira found out she was a finalist, she was at school. Being chosen for the final gave her the confidence to continue, and she did very well. She won easily, and the Select model agency in London offered her work right away.
Now, Kira has to manage her two different lives. Her friends and teachers are proud of her, but some people at school are not nice about her success. They say she thinks too highly of herself. Kira finds this hard to handle because she is not a selfish person. She said, ""They think that because I am a model now, I can't be the same. But the only thing that has changed is that I am more confident. I can stand up for myself more.""
Being a busy model affects her social life. The Select agency can call her at any time to offer her a job for the next day. Kira said, ""If my friends are going out, I can't promise to join them because I don’t know what I will be doing. I can’t make plans, and sometimes they get canceled, but my friends understand. They don’t say, 'You never have time for us anymore.'""
Kira has the looks, talent, and support to have a great career ahead of her, and not many people can say that before finishing their school exams. As I was about to end the interview with this girl who seems to have it all, I asked her what she would like to do if she didn’t have her beauty. She thought for a moment and replied, ""I would like to do what you are doing."""

Father and son start Gold Rush
Terence and Chris Madden have traveled from the cold north of Canada to the hot land of Africa looking for gold. The father and son team—one is an explorer and the other is a mineral expert—think their mine on a Welsh mountain could have up to 10,000 ounces of gold. After ten years of digging in the Welsh hills, they believe they are very close to finding a gold vein worth five million dollars. 
""As we dig, we are finding a lot of gold; now we just need to dig a few more meters to where it is concentrated,"" said Terence, 68, from Liverpool. The pair have dedicated their lives to finding gold. Their search began when Terence read about gold worth millions buried in the 'Dolgellau gold belt,' an area near the town of Dolgellau in Wales. While reading old mining journals and newspapers at the Welsh National Library in Aberystwyth, they chose the best area of land to study.
Since they first cleared the land and found pieces of gold in the rocks, they have spent the last ten years getting permission to work from the landowners, taking soil samples, and removing old cars and trash. They have dug out 150 tonnes of greenstone rock to create a tunnel and a 10-meter shaft. Now, they are running out of money. They have spent their savings on this dream and need to convince someone to invest £50,000 to dig a little deeper to find the gold.
Chris Madden says, ""Right now, it looks doubtful, but we have a few people we can contact."" As news spread through the valleys about their dig, more people became interested in gold. Dolgellau depends on tourists, and local residents are hopeful. ""It would bring more people here if they are right,"" said Peter Woolven, manager of the Royal Ship Hotel, ""but if they find gold, I hope millions of people do not come and dig up the hillside.""
The Welsh gold industry has declined a lot since its peak in the late 1880s when thousands of people worked in many mines across the countryside. One of the last remaining mines, Clogau-St David's, which made wedding rings for the Queen and the Princess of Wales, closed a month ago. Now, however, individual gold diggers are coming back. George Hall, another prospector, plans to dig a tunnel deep into the hill on the other side of the ridge from the Maddens. ""Searching for gold is very emotional,"" said Hall, 70. ""It's adventurous and exciting, the thrill of finding hidden treasure. Maybe I will be lucky this time."""
FCE_31,B2,"IN HOT WATER**
Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends a lot of time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She teaches and does research in marine geochemistry, which means she studies the chemical processes in the sea. Rachel is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she is not teaching, she gets into a small steel vehicle for underwater exploration and dives three kilometers down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes. 
Inside the vehicle, space is very limited. Rachel says, ""I can reach out and touch the two pilots."" They cannot stand up or move around, and they must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last for 16 hours: three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours to collect rock and water samples, and three hours to return to the surface. If there is a problem and they need to get to the top quickly, they can hit a panic button. This releases a small escape vessel that goes quickly to the surface. Rachel says, ""No one has tested it yet, but I don't think it would be a very pleasant journey.""
Rachel remembers her first time in the vehicle. It was on a ship, and she got in with an instructor. He explained the emergency procedures, including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack. They were testing how she would react in such a small space. Now, Rachel has made six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian crew. They went to a place that was a five-day sail west of the Canary Islands in the Atlantic. There, on the ocean floor, is a large area of underwater volcanoes that blow out black smoke. The Russian team was dropping off scientific equipment to study a project that would create a hole 150 meters through a volcano.
When Rachel is not at sea, she works in her office at the Oceanography Centre in Southampton. She says, ""Two-thirds of my salary comes from teaching, which I love, but I do it so I can continue my research on the 'black smokers.'"" This is another name for underwater volcanoes, where water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke. This water comes out at a rate of one meter per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees.
Rachel recalls a frightening moment when she first dived with an American team. They were towing equipment on a 50-meter rope when suddenly there was an explosion. There was a huge bang as the shock waves hit their vehicle, and she thought, ""I'm going to die."" They waited in silence, and when nothing happened, they felt incredible relief—they were still alive!
Rachel finds it exciting to dive to the deepest part of the ocean. Every time she looks out of the porthole and sees the chimneys, she feels a sense of wonder. She thinks, ""Here I am at the bottom of the sea, and no one else on this planet has ever seen them."" Rachel studied the black smokers for three years for her PhD, and when she finally saw them for real, it was an amazing feeling."
FCE_58,B2,"""I was dirty, smelly, hungry, and a little sunburned. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. My body was tired, and my mind was confused by foreign train schedules, money, and languages. 'Never again,' I said as I stepped onto home ground. I said the same thing the next year and the year after that. All I had to do was buy one train ticket, and because I was under twenty-five, I could travel anywhere in Europe for a whole month. 
Sleeping in a train corridor is very different from sleeping in a regular bed. The movement of the train rocks you to sleep. Carrying all your things in a backpack makes you travel simply and can lead to wasting things, like burning socks that smell bad and throwing away books after reading them. However, this way of thinking is part of the Inter-Rail spirit, where common sense can be forgotten along with old books and socks. All you need is one of those tickets in your hand. 
A ticket that lets young people travel through many countries in one day is special. On my first trip, my friends and I didn’t know how much we could do with this ticket. We thought it was just a cheap way to get to our campsite in southern France. But the idea of traveling non-stop was too exciting. There was always one more country to visit, just a little further away. And it didn’t cost us anything extra. 
We were not completely uninterested in culture, but this was our first holiday without parents, like many other Inter-Rail travelers. We planned our own schedule and focused on the sights we could see easily. This was a chance to avoid guided tours and do something different. I was proud that in many places, all I wanted to see was the view from the train station. We were just trying to enjoy ourselves, like most other Inter-Railers who shared the train corridors, food, water, money, and music with us. 
The excitement of travel comes from arriving in a place that was just a name before. It feels like the city didn’t exist until the train arrives, and you see it with your own tired eyes for the first time. Only by seeing Europe, watching the changing landscapes, and noticing different lifestyles can you really understand the continent. Everyone knows what is there, but it means nothing until you see it yourself. This is why other people's holiday photos can be boring. While the train trip may not let you discover new things in the world, it is a valuable personal experience. Europe is big, and Inter-Rail gives people a great chance to see this, even if it didn’t happen for us right away."""
FCE_37,B2,"'There is nothing more disappointing than arriving at an airport in another country and finding out that your luggage has been left behind. At best, you will have to wear the clothes you have on for hours or days until the airline brings your luggage to you. At worst, you may be in a different climate, far from home, and have to wear clothes that are not suitable. Although airlines do not often say how many bags they lose, it is a fact that regular travelers will eventually be separated from their luggage. Even the best airlines make mistakes sometimes, and it is impossible for any airline to guarantee that your checked luggage will travel on the same flight, especially when you have to change planes. 
The system works like this: Airlines ask passengers to check in early, which means arriving at the airport a certain time before the flight. This is to give enough time for the luggage to go through the airport and be loaded onto the plane. Minimum connecting times (MCTs) are the shortest time needed to change from one flight to another. These times are also longer to help with luggage transfers. Usually, the system works well. But extra security checks and air traffic problems can cause flights to be delayed. All of this can lead to problems with the luggage system. There is also the chance of human error, like if the label on your bag gets torn off. These issues can be worse at large airports, called 'hubs', because many bags are processed there. 
For example, last year, London’s Heathrow airport had more than 41 million passengers, with nine million changing planes. British Airways alone had two million transfer passengers at Heathrow, most of whom had to walk one mile between Terminal 1 (for Domestic and European flights) and Terminal 4 (for long-distance flights). Even efficient airports like Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Singapore, and Zurich can have bad days. The risk of losing luggage when changing planes is higher at some airports. The United States also has issues; Miami airport is known for losing luggage when transatlantic passengers connect to flights in Latin America. 
To avoid losing your luggage, choose direct flights whenever you can and check in early. If you must change planes, try to fly with the same airline. Allow more time for connections by taking an earlier flight to the transfer airport, and make sure to label your luggage inside and outside with your home and holiday addresses. Don’t forget to include your flight numbers. If your luggage still goes missing, contact the airline staff in the baggage area and fill out a property irregularity report (PIR) before leaving the airport.'"
FCE_2,B2,"The Kingfisher**
Wildlife photographer Charlie James is an expert on the kingfisher, a beautiful blue-green bird that lives near streams and rivers and eats fish. Old trees hang over the stream, providing some shade to the shallow water. The main colors in this scene are soft greens, browns, and different shades of yellow from the sunlight. The sound of the water is gentle, like a breeze. The kingfisher moves quickly and smoothly, like a flash of light. It is gone in a moment, but its image stays in your mind, powerful for such a small bird.
Charlie James fell in love with kingfishers when he was young. He feels a strong connection to this little bird, but he cannot explain why. The kingfisher is part of many legends. In Greek mythology, the kingfisher is a moon goddess who became a bird. Another story says that the kingfisher flew so high that its upper body became blue like the sky, while its lower body was burned by the sun. There is some truth in this story. Kingfishers do not have blue pigment in their feathers. Instead, the way their feathers are structured scatters light and reflects blue. This is why a kingfisher can look bright blue or rich emerald green, depending on the angle of the light.
It is no surprise that many wildlife photographers love kingfishers. The beautiful colors and the fact that kingfishers are shy but can be watched from a distance make them very interesting. Charlie James's first hideout was an old blanket he put over his head while he waited near a kingfisher's favorite spot. The bird came back within minutes and sat just one meter away. However, it took him four more years to take his first good picture. During this time, the European kingfisher became a big part of his life. He spent as much time as he could by a stream where kingfishers lived. Unfortunately, school took away some of his time with the birds, and he missed classes, calling himself an ""academic failure."" But people started to notice his interest in the kingfisher, which is the most common kingfisher in the world and the only one that breeds in Europe. 
At 16, he was hired as an advisor for a nature magazine. He then worked as an assistant to the editor and eventually became a freelance wildlife film cameraman. Now, he wants to make the perfect kingfisher film. ""No speech, just beautiful images that say it all,"" he says. ""I like to photograph parts of kingfisher wings..."" His voice trails off as he thinks about the colors of the bird he has spent more than half his life observing, which still fascinates him. His photographs express some of his feelings, but Charlie knows that there is much more to his relationship with the kingfisher than his work can show."
FCE_68,B2,"Conducting an Orchestra**
Giving directions to an orchestra is not easy. Anne Inglis talks to five new conductors about their work.
**A. ANNE MANSON**  
Anne Manson, 30, asked if she could watch conductor Claudio Abbado's practice sessions in Vienna. She ended up filling in for an absent assistant. Later, she was asked to help with another opera the next season. ""I had to lead the first rehearsal for Abbado. No, I wasn't nervous. I have always felt good about standing in front of an orchestra."" Manson, who is from America, works with a well-known opera company in London that focuses on modern music. She is also becoming known in other European countries, thanks to support from the British Arts Council. Since that first time, she has helped Abbado on several more projects.
**B. ANDREW CONSTANTINE**  
The hardest part of being a conductor is finding the right opportunities, says Andrew Constantine, 31. He won a big competition in 1991 after trying twice before. Looking back, he is thankful for the timing: ""If it had happened earlier, I would have been forgotten."" The competition gave him many chances to perform and a time as an assistant to a famous conductor. However, Constantine finds it hard to shake off the ""competition"" label: ""If in three years my name is still linked to the competition, I will be worried,"" he says. ""But orchestras like the English Chamber Orchestra, who hired me after the competition, are now inviting me back. If this doesn't happen, my career will slowly fall apart.""
**C. WASFI KANI**  
Wasfi Kani, who started Pimlico Opera, enjoys the long practice time needed for any opera production. ""The music deserves four weeks of attention,"" says Kani, who began conducting seriously in her late twenties. After university, she worked in London until Pimlico Opera became fully professional two years ago. Starting lessons with Sian Edwards was a key moment for her. ""I saw her conduct and realized she was the same size as me. I had always been taught by much bigger people, which makes a big difference."" She likes the complex nature of opera: ""There are many arguments, and you have to think about the singers' personalities.""
**D. ROGER VIGNOLES**  
""Conducting surprised me, but it is very interesting,"" says Roger Vignoles, 48. It is not such a strange career move for him. He started as a musician in an opera house and worked with good conductors. Last year, he was asked to direct Handel's Agrippina from the piano at a festival, something he had never done before. ""It was easier than I thought. I knew the music well and what I wanted it to sound like. I tried my best to get the performance I wanted. Luckily, people respect my skills as a musician. I am learning from every experience I have had, both in musical style and in performing. Now, I will do whatever people ask me to find out what I enjoy.""
**E. WAYNE MARSHALL**  
In 1986, conductor Simon Rattle noticed a young assistant conductor during one of his productions and told his agent about Wayne Marshall. Now 32, Marshall soon found himself conducting a musical in London at short notice, which was a tough start. He even had to deal with some relaxed professional musicians reading newspapers during the show: ""I was strict with them. I always gave a clear beat and did my best. Many orchestral musicians I have seen do not seem to need advice from a conductor. But I am never afraid to say what I want. If people see you are worried, it gets worse. I have never studied conducting formally, and no book teaches you how to conduct, but people have been kind to me. I am determined and know what I like."""
FCE_23,B2,"**Variations on a Theme**
If you are thinking about taking children to a theme park, there are many to choose from in Britain. We asked five families to try out some of the best parks.
**Fun Island - The Burns Family**  
Last year, we visited a big theme park in the US and thought Fun Island would be boring in comparison. However, we were surprised. The park is good for younger children, so our three-year-old felt included. The kids loved the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. There is a special dodgems ride for very young kids, which was a big hit. For older children, there are scarier rides, like Splash Out, where you jump into a pool! After five hours, Steve and I were ready to leave, but the children wanted to stay because they were having so much fun. Our only complaint is that the park could have a better atmosphere, and the scenery was not very nice. But the staff were very helpful, and we found it clean, well-organized, and safe.
**Wonderland - The McMillan Family**  
None of us had been to a theme park before, so we didn’t know what to expect. We thought Oscar might be too young, but he loved it. He enjoyed the Mountain Train and especially liked Little Land, which has small models of famous buildings. The older children liked the ferris wheel and driving toy cars on a real road. We spent six hours there and were happy that there were places to relax. The park is beautifully designed, and the staff were friendly and helpful. There is something for everyone, including adults.
**Adventure World - The Jeffree Family**  
After seven hours, we felt there was still a lot to see. The children loved the Big Top Circus, which had a great trapeze act. We went on the Terror Line, and although the girls were scared and kept their eyes shut, they said they enjoyed it. Their favorite ride was Running River, where you think you will get wet, but you don’t. For younger children, Toy Land is a lot of fun. The children looked at the new ride, Fear Factor, but we were relieved when they found out they were too small to go on it! The park is so well designed that even waiting in line for rides is not too boring. It is very clean, and the staff are wonderful. On one ride, I couldn’t sit with both girls, so a staff member offered to go with one of them.
**The Great Park - The Langridge Family**  
We arrived at one o'clock and were disappointed that the park was only open until 5 p.m. This is a great theme park for younger children because the rides are not too scary. I am a bit of a coward, but I still had fun. We all loved Exotic Travels, a boat ride that starts slowly and then becomes very exciting. We waited for half an hour for Lightning River, and then it was over quickly! I wouldn’t go on the Big Leap, but if you are brave, it looked fun. If the children had been a little older, they might have found it a bit boring, but they were the right age and loved it.
**Fantasy World - The Break-all Family**  
According to the park's advertising, there is ""No Limit to the Fun,"" and we felt that was true. Europe's tallest roller-coaster, the Rocket, is very impressive, and Ben thought it was the scariest ride, while Jennie said the Hanger, where you hang upside-down 30 meters above the ground, was even scarier! There are about a dozen main rides, which the older children went on several times. Sarah was too small for some rides but enjoyed the Long Slide. We found the staff's attitudes were mixed. Some were great with younger children, but the welcome was not always friendly. You need a full day to enjoy Fantasy World. We wouldn’t have dared tell the kids we were going home early."
FCE_60,B2,"**Running a Business in the Countryside**
Five women share their experiences of starting a business in the countryside.
A. ""My customers are friends,"" says CHRISTINE HOGAN, who runs a computer design business that makes over £200,000 a year and has four full-time employees. ""My husband and I moved from London to the countryside when our children were small. I wanted a job I could do at home. I had worked with computers before I got married, so my husband suggested I start a computer design business. It needed a lot of money, and things were hard at first. But I was careful and told the bank manager if I might spend too much. Working from home saves money, and I can work in the evening if I want. It has stayed a small business. We hardly ever deliver work; people from the area usually come to pick it up.""
B. ""I enjoy being independent,"" says MAGGY SASANOW, who designs greeting cards from home. ""I studied art at university and wanted to work in a museum. But when I got married, we moved to the countryside, where there were no jobs like that. So, I decided to start my own business and now I make 50 different greeting cards that I sell to museums. I work in a big room upstairs. The downside of working from home is that there is always something to do, like mowing the lawn. I get all my customers by word of mouth; I don’t advertise. People send work from London because I am cheaper than other artists. Working alone means I don’t share ideas with others, but there are more good things than bad.""
C. ""It has been hard at times,"" says DELIA TURNER, who makes curtains. ""I started my business eight years ago. At that time, this type of business was growing, and in two years my income went from £24,000 to £80,000. I used to have six full-time curtain-makers. But I had to let them go because the economy got worse, which was hard because it is not easy to find other jobs here. Now, I am back to making curtains at home with my husband’s help and using women who work from their homes. I have to be ready to lower my prices when needed and look for new opportunities.""
D. TESSA STRICKLAND runs her children's book publishing business from her farmhouse. ""I moved to the countryside three years ago for two reasons. First, it was cheaper than London, and second, I love the countryside. I like being able to work when I want. Eighty percent of my income comes from deals with Australia, the Far East, and North America, so I have to take calls at strange hours. The downside is that I need to be disciplined to close the office door. I publish children's books from different cultures, working with authors and artists. I had all my professional experience in London, so I felt very alone at first.""
E. MEG RIVERS runs a cake delivery business and a shop that makes £250,000 a year and employs six people, some part-time. ""I started ten years ago at home. I am very interested in health, so I began making fruit cakes with good quality flour and eggs. Then I got requests from friends and family, and soon I was sending cakes all over the country. Seven years ago, I rented a small building where everything is made. We have a baker, an assistant, and a professional cake decorator. I don’t bake anymore; I manage the business side. My biggest problem has been the financial side, which has been hard because we didn’t have a lot of money to start."""
FCE_1,B2,"Meet the Amazing Watkins Family**
The Watkins family is very talented in music. The sons are composers and musicians who have won awards, while their dad makes musical instruments. 
John and Hetty Watkins are schoolteachers from South Wales. When they needed to buy a cello for their ten-year-old son, Paul, they found it was very expensive. John thought, ""Maybe I can make one."" He discovered the Welsh School of Instrument Making nearby and took evening classes for about three years. 
After trying to make violins and violas, John made his first cello. Paul, now 28, says, ""It turned out really well. He made me another one later, and I used it until a few months ago."" John has now retired from teaching and makes about twelve violins each year. He was very happy to sell one to the famous American musician Jaime Laredo.
Paul and his younger brother, Huw, started playing music when they were young. Paul remembers, ""I began playing the piano as soon as I could reach the keys."" He later wanted to play the cello. His parents wanted him to play the violin because their dad played the viola in a group. Paul tried the violin for six weeks but did not like it. He was inspired by the cellist in his dad's group and started taking lessons.
Huw, now 22, says, ""My parents were supportive and relaxed. I wanted to follow in Paul's footsteps, not feel pressured."" Huw is now becoming a pianist and composer.
Paul has done very well with the cello his dad made. He won the string final of the BBC Young Musician of the Year competition. At just 20 years old, he became the principal cellist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra, using his father's cello until last year. Now, he plays a Francesco Rugeri cello, which is on loan from the Royal Academy of Music. 
Paul says, ""Dad hasn't said anything about my new cello, but he played both and admitted mine is quite nice!"" He believes his father's cello will get better with age, just like his Rugeri, which is already 304 years old.
Soon, Paul will perform on television with the Rugeri cello in Elgar's Cello Concerto. He says, ""The history of the piece doesn’t change how I play it. I will always do it my way."" However, Paul cannot watch himself on TV because he is performing at the Cheltenham Festival that same night. Huw's String Quartet will also have its London premiere at the Wigmore Hall that evening. John and Hetty will have to be very organized to keep up with all their sons' music events in the coming weeks."
FCE_53,B2,"**Looking after the Countryside: The National Trust**
The National Trust is an organization that aims to protect the British countryside. Gill Page visits the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and talks to Gareth Roberts, a warden who works for the Trust to care for the beautiful areas it owns.
Gareth believes that a National Trust Warden needs common sense. ""You also need to be good at dealing with people,"" he says, ""because you are always working with farmers, visitors, conservationists, and building companies."" Gareth grew up on the Lleyn Peninsula and worked on his parents' farm until he got married. About 80 people wanted the job of National Trust Warden for the Lleyn Peninsula. In the end, Gareth got the job because of his local knowledge and farming experience, even though he did not have formal training.
""I find it helpful that I still farm with my parents,"" he explains. ""I can talk to farmers as equals and understand their problems. They can't trick me!"" His farming background also helps him with the physical work of the job, like putting up fences, planting trees, and building walls. Since he started working with the Trust, Gareth has learned more about nature conservation. ""When I was young,"" he remembers, ""I used to pick flowers, collect butterfly larvae, and find old birds' nests. I recently thought about where I would find those flowers and nests now. I see that farming has changed the countryside. It's not the farmers' fault; they were just following what the government told them.""
Gareth says that when he began his job, farmers and conservationists did not get along. Both sides wanted things done their way. Now they are talking and understanding each other better. ""We are at a point where we can bring them together,"" Gareth says.
Conservation is a big part of Gareth's work, along with allowing the public to visit the Trust's land, planting trees, and meeting the Trust's tenant farmers. ""My job is to make sure tasks are completed with as little trouble and cost as possible. What I enjoy most is seeing projects finished, even though I spend about half my time on reports and paperwork.""
Gareth loves his job and enjoys every moment, especially talking to the public. However, he admits, ""I dislike the attitude of some people. They come into the area, demand everything, and then leave as if they have a right to do so. Being nice to those people can be frustrating!"" But as Gareth says, it all comes down to common sense. If you have plenty of that and like the idea of working outdoors, you might consider applying to be a warden like Gareth. Just don't expect a job to be available on the Lleyn Peninsula for a long time!"
FCE_55,B2,"**The Netball Captain**
In our series about women in sports, Suzie Ellis met England's netball captain, Kendra Slowinski. Kendra is the captain of the England netball team. When I met her, she had a busy day, teaching at a local school and then training in a supermarket car park. I asked her, ""Don't you get strange looks?"" She replied, ""I focus on my movements and my feet, so I don’t notice much else. I might see cars slow down a little, but that’s it.""
Kendra said, ""My whole life is about being my best for the Championships."" She is following a strict schedule to be as fit as possible. This is her fourth World Championships, and it will be the biggest one yet, with 27 countries participating. ""We will have home support, which is very special,"" she said. ""It’s important to improve the reputation of netball in this country. Playing at home means there will be more pressure. The crowd will have expectations and support us more. People want us to start the tournament with a good game.""
Their first game is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. Kendra mentioned, ""We have always beaten them, but they will be exciting to play against. They have a lot of talent."" The England team is currently ranked fourth in the world. However, Kendra knows the Championships will be tough. ""You have to push yourself to play every day. There is no rest between games like in a series. You can still win a series if you lose the first game, but the Championships are different. You only have one chance, and you must be ready.""
In the fifteen years she has played at a high level, the sport has become harder and faster. Players are more aggressive on the court. Kendra said, ""You don’t train hard to lose. But after the final whistle, we become friends again.""
Netball is also using more science for fitness testing. Kendra said, ""It is important that we think and train like world-class players. As captain, I need to have a strong mindset and lead by example. I see my role as supporting and encouraging my team.""
Kendra explained, ""From the start of my netball career, I have planned everything carefully. I decided a while ago that this competition would be my last as a player."" She will likely coach young players in the future, but for now, she is focused on her last big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she might have a tear in her eye."
FCE_50,B2,"**SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS**
How can parents help a child who has great musical talent? It can be hard to know the best way to support their gift. Some parents may not see their child's needs until the child becomes frustrated and acts out. While most schools can help children who are good at academic subjects, musically talented children need special support that may not be available in regular schools, especially if music is not seen as important.
Children who are musically gifted, and those whose talents are encouraged by their parents or teachers, may benefit from attending a specialist music school. There are five music schools in Britain, and they have been created recently. These schools provide a caring environment for gifted children aged seven to eighteen to develop their musical skills with the help of professional musicians.
At specialist music schools, children spend about one third to one half of their day on music activities. This includes individual lessons (up to three hours a week for their first and second instruments), playing in orchestras, chamber groups, voice training, conducting, and music theory. They also practice in well-equipped private rooms, sometimes with a teacher. The rest of their time is spent on a limited academic program that focuses on important subjects like English, math, basic sciences, and languages. Students can also study more subjects if they want.
All five British specialist music schools are independent, meaning they are not funded by the government. Classes are small, with a high number of teachers compared to students. Most children at these schools live there full-time, which means they eat and sleep at school. This allows them to spend their formative years with others who share their interests.
What are the downsides? One major issue is the cost; fees can be high (between £12,000 and £17,000 a year for boarders). However, each school tries to help parents of talented children with scholarships and financial aid. Also, not all parents want to send their children to boarding school, especially at a young age. Many directors of specialist schools have concerns about admitting children as young as seven into such a strict environment. They emphasize that their main goal is to help children become well-rounded individuals.
It is clear that separating musically gifted children from a young age can cause stress. Some early signs of musical talent may fade during the teenage years, and the pressure to succeed can lead to feelings of failure. However, all specialist schools closely monitor each student's progress and provide help when needed.
Most former students of music schools feel they gained a lot from the high-quality music teaching, but many worry about the limited academic program, which often comes second to music. Many musically talented young people are also very intelligent and can handle academic challenges. They may feel frustrated if their academic needs are not met.
For these reasons, it might be better to wait until a child is older and can make their own choices before considering a specialist music education. Children who are also academically gifted can do well in a regular school with a good music program or by combining a normal school schedule with music training at junior departments of music colleges. These colleges offer Saturday morning lessons with excellent teachers, as well as orchestral and chamber music experiences. However, this option may not be possible for families living far from London or other major cities."
FCE_25,B2,"An Eye for Detail**
Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. The large garden around her house gives her many ideas for her art. It is full of her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wildly and spread all over the garden. The two long flower borders along the path in the garden have a beautiful mix of colors and shapes. This is partly because the previous owners were good gardeners and left plants that Susan liked. She also kept the gardener, Danny. ""In fact, it was really his garden,"" she says. ""We got along very well. At first, he would say, 'Oh, it's not worth it' for some of the things I wanted to add, but when I said I wanted to paint them, he understood what I meant.""
Susan likes to focus on painting individual plants instead of the whole garden. Sometimes, she paints a group of plants, but usually, she picks one flower and takes it to her studio. ""I don't set everything up at once,"" she explains. ""I take one flower out and paint it, which might take a few days. Then I bring in another one and build up the painting that way. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.""
Her busiest time is spring and early summer when the tulips bloom, followed by the poppies. ""They all come out together, and you're so busy,"" she says. But she also finds beauty in how flowers change as they decay. For example, with tulips, ""you bring them in and put them in water, then leave them for a day, and they change shape. They open up and look amazing. At first, you think they are boring, but they change all the time.""
Susan has always loved plants. ""I studied botany in school and used to collect wildflowers from the countryside,"" she says. ""I wasn't really interested in gardening then; I didn't like garden flowers because they looked like fake ones sold in some shops. To me, the only real flowers were wild ones. I was fascinated by how they could grow in difficult places, like cracks in rocks or on cliffs.""
Today, her garden has many plants from faraway places, but they seem to fit in well. She has a relaxed attitude towards her garden, like a caring aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don't cause too much trouble. With two upcoming exhibitions to prepare for and plenty of subjects to paint right outside her door, it has been hard for her to find time to work in the garden. She now hires an extra gardener, but she knows that to stay connected with her art, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""
FCE_34,B2,"Keeping Holiday-Makers Happy**
Sarah Sutherland-Pilch is a chalet girl who works hard to keep holiday-makers happy. She tells Veronica Lee about her job. This is Sarah's second year as a chalet girl. She is 24 years old and comes from West Sussex, England. Sarah works for a company in Val d'Isère, France. She cooks and cleans for visitors who come to ski and stay in wooden houses called chalets.
Sarah graduated from Oxford Brookes University last summer, where she studied French and History of Art. She thinks being a chalet girl is not a long-term career, but a fun way to spend a year or two before starting a different job. ""It's a good way to meet people,"" she says. ""I meet successful people every week.""
Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to the chalet, which can sleep up to 18 guests each week. She has her own breakfast before making breakfast for the guests. ""They get a full breakfast - porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants."" After breakfast, around 9:30 a.m., Sarah cleans up and either makes afternoon tea for the guests or cleans the rooms, which she says is ""the worst part of the job."" By about 11 a.m., she is ready to ski. ""On a good day, we can ski until 4:30 p.m.""
Sarah returns to the chalet to prepare dinner. She takes a shower before cooking but does not sleep because she says, ""It's bad if you do."" Dinner is served at 8 p.m., and coffee is usually ready by 10 p.m. After dinner, Sarah cleans the kitchen. ""There's nothing worse than coming into a messy kitchen the next morning."" Sometimes she talks with the guests, but other times they prefer to be alone. ""Good guests can make a week great - breakfast this morning was fun - but some weeks are not as good.""
Sarah meets her friends in the chalet where she lives, and they go out around 11 p.m. ""We usually start at Bananas, then go to G Jay's and maybe Dick's T-Bar at the end of the night,"" she says. But Sarah does not stay out too late on Saturday night because Sunday is her busiest day. ""It's a hard day,"" she says, ""when you don’t want to cook breakfast feeling tired.""
On Sunday, work starts earlier than usual. Breakfast for guests must be ready by 7 a.m. After the guests leave, Sarah cleans quickly. ""We clean everything - clear the breakfast, strip the beds, and get ready for the new guests."" If she has not done the shopping on Saturday, she does it now. Around 3 p.m., after cleaning, Sarah prepares tea for the new guests. ""They arrive around 4:30 p.m. Sometimes they are confused and have many questions. I think the mountain air affects them.""
Between tea and dinner, Sarah helps guests who need boots or skis and then gets a lift back to the chalet. Soon, it is time for dinner again, and sometimes she chats with friends, but not always. ""Sometimes I'm so tired I just go to bed early,"" she says."

Mandie Currie is a zoo-keeper. She spent a day at the magazine Marie Claire. ""Choosing what to wear was hard because I usually wear a uniform at the zoo. First, I went to a photo studio, then to press previews, all before lunch. The zoo is a calm place, but here I was rushing around when I could be quietly cuddling an animal. Some people on the fashion team seemed stressed, but my job is not very stressful. At a fashion shoot in the afternoon, I laughed because I usually clean cages or handle rats. I find it interesting to see how magazines work, but I really enjoy my job at the zoo, so I will stay there.""
Alice Cutler is a fashion assistant at Marie Claire. She spent a day at London Zoo. ""I arrived at the zoo in my leather boots and dark blue trousers. The zoo gave me a green polo shirt to wear, which was good because I got very dirty. While I stroked an elephant, I thought Mandie was probably packing clothes. By five o'clock, I smelled bad, but I had a great day. When I retire from fashion, I could see myself working with elephants, maybe in Africa.""
Karen Hodson is a nurse at Hammersmith Hospital. She worked with the television gardening program Ground Force. ""I was very excited to meet the team, and Alan Titchmarsh, the presenter, was really nice. I liked being outside because I sometimes don’t see daylight at work. Even though it was hard work, it was fun. I thought I was strong, but I felt weak compared to the team. I didn’t expect gardening to be so hard or need so much planning. I am more enthusiastic than effective, so I don’t plan to quit my nursing job.""
Charlie Dimmock is a landscape gardener on Ground Force. He worked a shift at Hammersmith Hospital. ""I made beds and handed out medicine. I thought I would faint during some tasks, but I surprised myself and felt fine. The friendship among the nurses is great, and it felt very different from my usual male work environment. I think my job is not as important as nursing. My day at the hospital was not easy, but it made me feel satisfied.""
Lucy Harvey is a personal trainer. She spent a day with Ryanair as cabin crew. ""I changed into the uniform, and when I put it on, I felt different—people looked at me. Before the flight, our supervisor talked about safety and what to do if someone has a heart attack, which I knew from my training. When the passengers boarded the flight to Paris, I handed out magazines. Everyone stared at me, and I felt nervous. On the return flight, we had 80 schoolchildren who wouldn’t sit still. I wished I was back in the gym with one sensible adult.""
Sonia McDermott is an air hostess with Ryanair. She spent a day as a personal trainer in a gym. ""I was worried about this swap because I don’t exercise. I was surprised by how much attention you give to one person. In my job, I meet 130 passengers four times a day. At lunch, I saw that some trainers didn’t eat very healthily, but they all drink a lot of water. I wouldn’t change my job for this, but it has inspired me to join a gym and try to be healthier."""

**A. Andrea Thompson - Newsreader**  
I fell in love with the south of France a long time ago and try to visit as often as I can. There is a local train from Cannes that goes along the coast and crosses the border into Italy. It takes you past some beautiful sea views. It doesn’t matter what the weather is like or what time of year it is; the journey is always magical. Out of the other window, you can see some of the best gardens and homes in France. It feels like you are looking into the lives of the rich and famous. The other passengers are always lively because there is a mix of tourists and locals, all enjoying the amazing journey.
**Raj Patel - Explorer**  
I have had many great train journeys, but my favorite is the Nile Valley Express, which travels across the desert in northern Sudan. When I was young in South Africa, I missed a family train trip from Cape Town to the Kruger National Park because I was considered too young and troublesome. I was sent to stay with my aunt instead. When I moved to England as a teenager, I still hadn’t traveled by train. London Waterloo was the first real train station I ever saw, and its big glass roof amazed me.
**Betty Cooper - Novelist**  
I am very grateful to one train in particular: the Blue Train, which took my husband and me on our honeymoon across France to catch a boat to Egypt. On the train, my husband gave me a pink dress, which I thought was wonderful. Someone said that pink is good for the brain, and I have worn it ever since. What I remember most about the journey is how lovely it was to travel through France and then by boat up the Nile. It was the perfect way to relax after all the wedding plans.
**Martin Brown - Journalist**  
We were working on articles about a trip around the world and had to cross a desert in Africa. There was no road, so we took the train known as the Desert Express. The schedule was not reliable; we were just told to be ready on a certain day. We heard that the driver would often wait for days if he knew people were still coming. When the train arrived, many people rushed to get on, and some even traveled on the roof for free. During the night, the train passed through some of the most beautiful landscapes I have ever seen. It felt like a dream, like traveling on the moon.
**Arisu Mezuki - Actress**  
I think most people have favorite memories of trains from when they were children, but that is not true for me. I grew up in Singapore and Cyprus, where I saw very few trains and didn’t travel on them. It wasn’t until I was a teenager that trains became important in my life. I made a film that featured a railway in Yorkshire. Most of the filming was done on an old part of the line that volunteers had taken care of. That’s where my love for steam trains started. When we weren’t filming, we took every chance to ride the train, and when I went back last year, it felt like time had stopped. Everything was still the same, even the gas lights on the station platform!"
FCE_8,B2,"'Want to Get Published?**
If you want to publish your story, our expert Margaret Stubbs has some advice for you. Many readers of this magazine ask, ""I have written a story/book. Where should I send it?"" One of the first things they need to do is research publishers and improve their writing skills. Turning your writing into something that can be sold requires knowledge about the publishing world. 
No matter what you write, you need to understand the markets you want to reach. The best way to do this is by reading as much as you can. Visit your local library and check out local bookstores and newsagents. Reading widely will help you understand what types of writing publishers are accepting right now. 
This knowledge needs to be updated because new publications come out all the time. Editors change jobs, and magazines change their focus. Publishers are always looking for new writers, so you need to give them what they want. 
At first, you might not know what you want to write. For example, if you think you want to write short love stories, the first step is to find out which magazines publish love stories. This market is quite small these days, so get as many recent copies of those magazines as you can. Learn about the types of stories they buy and who their readers are. These readers expect different things, and the editor wants to meet their needs. 
Writers often ask me, ""This has been rejected three times - am I wasting my time? Do I have a chance?"" As a former teacher, I never want to discourage anyone. However, it is likely that the work is not ready for publication. Many new writers are too eager to send their work out before they are ready. If you have only written one story or article, it is very unlikely to be published. This almost never happens. 
When you read about someone’s success, you often find that they have been in publishing or journalism for years before they became successful. When you finally send out your work for the first time, keep writing while you wait for a reply. Write ten more stories, or even twenty. Each one will be better than the last, and you will start to see yourself as a writer. This will help you become more confident and fluent. 
Don’t throw any of your stories away; instead, try to improve them. I also suggest not showing your work to others, especially in the beginning. Remember, every successful writer has faced many rejections before they succeeded. 
Do everything you can to improve your writing career. Look for a creative writing course near you. If you can’t find one, consider joining a local writers' group. This will help you gain ideas and confidence by meeting other writers. Think of yourself as a writer and practice writing every day if you can.'"
FCE_4,B2,"No Title**
On the last day of a bad year, I was leaning against a pillar in the Baltimore train station, waiting for the 10:10 train to Philadelphia. There were more people waiting than I expected. The station did not feel as nice as it usually did. Older couples with matching bags filled the benches, and many college students had left their bags on the floor. A grey-haired man was walking around, talking to different strangers. He looked well-off: he had tanned skin, a nice sweater, and a soft beige coat. He approached a woman sitting alone and asked her a question. Then he came over to a girl near me. She had long blond hair, and I thought I would like to talk to her too. The man asked, ""Are you going to Philadelphia?"" 
""Well, I'm going north,"" she replied. ""But I'm going to New York."" 
""Thanks, anyway,"" he said, and moved to the next bench. Now I was really paying attention. He asked an old lady, ""Are you going to Philadelphia?"" When she said she was going to Wilmington, he just walked on to a couple with matching bags. I stood up from my pillar and moved closer, pretending to look at the platform. I was going to Philadelphia. He could have asked me. I understood why he didn’t; he probably thought I looked unreliable. He glanced at me quickly and then went to the other end of the waiting area. He looked very stressed now. 
""Please!"" he said to a woman reading a book. ""Tell me you're going to Philadelphia!"" She looked up from her book. She was about thirty-five years old, older than me. She looked like a school teacher. 
""Philadelphia?"" she said. ""Yes, I am."" 
""Could I ask you a favor?"" I stood a few feet away and looked at my wrist, even though I didn’t have a watch. I could tell she was becoming cautious. The man must have noticed too because he said, ""Nothing too difficult, I promise!"" They were announcing my train now. People started moving toward Gate E, older couples pulling their wheeled bags behind them. 
Then I heard the man talking. ""My daughter is flying out this afternoon for a study year abroad, leaving from Philadelphia. I put her on a train this morning, stopped for groceries, and came home to find my wife upset. She hardly said 'hello' to me. My daughter forgot her passport. She called from the station in Philadelphia and didn’t know what to do."" 
The woman nodded sympathetically. I would have stayed quiet and waited to see where this was going. 
""So I told her to stay put. I said I would get someone to bring her passport."" 
I thought this was a strange story. Why didn’t he go himself if it was such an emergency? 
""Why don’t you go yourself?"" the woman asked. 
""I can’t leave my wife alone for that long. She’s in a wheelchair."" 
I thought this was a weak excuse. It seemed like too much bad luck for one family. I looked at them. The man was holding a packet, not a plain envelope, but a padded envelope the size of a small book. Aha! Padded! So you couldn’t feel what was inside! From where I stood, it looked stapled shut too. Be careful, lady, I thought silently."
FCE_30,B2,"'Gary and Me'**
John Moore, the owner of a restaurant, talks about his relationship with his son Gary, who is a famous TV chef. He believes everyone gets a chance in life. Gary had his chance with cooking, and John had his chance to run a restaurant. When John heard about a restaurant for sale, he quickly went to see it. The place was in bad condition, but it was perfect for his plans. 
Running the restaurant reminded John of his childhood. He remembers being sad when his mother went to work in a factory and left him alone. Because of this, he wanted to have time for family. His wife took care of their children and managed the accounts while John ran the restaurant. They lived above the restaurant and always made time to eat together as a family. This helped their children, Gary and Joe, become confident. From a young age, they would talk to the regular customers, which gave them a good start in life.
Gary was a lively child. When he was about seven, he jumped into a corner bath like it was a swimming pool and hurt himself. As he grew older, he had to earn pocket money. He started with small jobs and by age ten, he was working in the kitchen every weekend, which gave him plenty of money at school. He was disciplined and often woke up before his father. In a family business, everyone helps out, and John liked seeing Gary work.
Gary was not very good at school, but he was great in the kitchen. By age 15, he was as skilled as the adult chefs and sometimes even managed the kitchen. He could cook over a hundred meals, and John knew Gary would work in catering because he had talent. When Gary needed work experience for school, John sent him to a friend’s restaurant.
Recently, Gary started playing the drums and formed his own band. John wonders what will happen to Gary’s cooking if his music career takes off. He advised Gary to focus on one thing at a time to be successful. John told him, “If you want to achieve something, you need to do it by age 30. After that, it’s harder.” 
At 17, Gary went to catering college. On his first day, while other students were just starting, Gary quickly chopped vegetables and sliced meats. He finished his work in an hour and even helped others. Everyone is amazed at how successful Gary’s TV cooking show has become. John is very proud of him. He always tells Gary that if you want something, you must work hard for it because nothing is given for free. Gary has seen his chance and taken it.
As children grow up, parents hope they listen to their advice. John thinks that if Gary remembers even a little of what he has said, it is a good thing. He sees that Gary listens sometimes by the things he says and does."
FCE_7,B2,"Finding a Flat in Dublin**
Finding a good flat in Dublin that you can afford is very hard. The best way to find one is through personal contacts. If you know someone who knows someone who is leaving, that can help. But if, like Jo, you just arrived in Dublin, you don’t have any contacts. You have to stay in a hostel and look for a flat. For Jo, Dublin felt very new and unknown. She didn’t think about why she was going there. Everyone at her school thought she would leave her small town. They wanted to escape and see more of life. Some of her classmates went to towns like Ennis or Limerick, where family members helped them settle in. But Jo was going to Dublin alone.
Jo’s mother thought it would be good for her to stay in the hostel forever. It was run by nuns, so her mother believed she would be safe. Her father hoped the hostel was warm because they are often cold. Jo’s sisters, who worked as waitresses, thought she was crazy for staying in a hostel for a whole week. But Jo didn’t know they were still talking about her while she answered an ad for a flat in Ringsend. The ad said, ""Own room, own television, share kitchen, bathroom."" It was very close to her job at the post office and seemed too good to be true. Jo hoped it would be nice and that the people would like her, and that it wouldn’t be too expensive.
There wasn’t a line for this flat because it was more about needing a third girl than just renting a flat. The mention of ""own television"" made Jo wonder if it was too fancy for her, but the house looked normal. It was a simple red-brick house with a basement. The flat was upstairs. As Jo climbed the stairs, a cheerful girl with a college scarf came down. ""Desperate place,"" she said to Jo. ""They’re both awful. Common as dirt.""
""Oh,"" said Jo and continued up. ""Hello,"" said the girl with ""Nessa"" on her T-shirt. ""Did you see that stuck-up girl leaving? I can’t stand her kind."" 
""What did she do?"" Jo asked. 
""She didn’t do anything. She just looked around and giggled, saying, 'Is this all there is? Oh dear, oh dear,' in a posh voice. We wouldn’t want her here, would we, Pauline?"" 
Pauline, who had bright, colorful clothes, looked very different. Jo was surprised to meet a punk. She had seen them on the street but never talked to one before. 
""I’m Jo, I work at the post office and I called about the flat,"" Jo said. 
Nessa said they were about to have tea. She got three mugs: one with ""Nessa,"" one with ""Pauline,"" and one with ""Other."" ""We’ll put your name on a mug if you come to stay,"" she said kindly."
FCE_43,B2,"Behind the Dolphin's Smile**
People love dolphins. We enjoy watching them in seaside areas, movies, and TV shows. However, according to the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society, dolphins are in trouble. Mark Simmonds talks about the decline of dolphin species.
Dolphins are special to us. They are very intelligent, sensitive to human feelings, and they make us dream of freedom in the ocean. Our love for dolphins has been supported by TV shows. First, there was Flipper, and now there is Darwin from Seaquest. But these happy images hide the real problems dolphins face in polluted and overfished seas.
The number of North Sea harbour porpoises (a type of dolphin) has dropped by up to 89,000. You might think that such popular animals would be protected by law and cared for in special marine areas. Unfortunately, this is not true, and the lack of protection could lead to a major wildlife disaster.
There are forty different types of dolphins in the world. In northern Europe, the most common dolphins are the striped dolphin, the common dolphin, the bottlenose dolphin, and the smaller harbour porpoise. The striped and common dolphins usually live far out in the open sea and are seen in small groups. We know very little about them. 
Bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises used to be seen near European coasts. Bottlenose dolphins are very social and were often found along the Channel coast and in rivers in Britain, like the Thames. Now, they can only be found in a few places, like the Moray Firth in Scotland and Cardigan Bay in Wales. The few that are left show signs of stress.
It is hard to know exactly why dolphin numbers are decreasing. Overfishing is reducing fish populations and harming local fishing industries, which also affects dolphins and porpoises. Porpoises need to find food quickly, and if fish are removed from one area, they may not survive long enough to find food elsewhere. They can also get caught in fishermen's nets, which they cannot see. 
In modern fishing, large nets are often left in the water or pulled quickly through the sea. Recently, many dead dolphins have washed up on the beaches of France and Cornwall. Marks and cuts on their bodies show that they died because they were caught in these nets.
Pollution in the sea can also harm dolphins. For example, pesticides can build up in their bodies. Female dolphins produce milk that can contain these poisons, which can harm their young. There has been at least one case of a young dolphin dying from its mother’s milk.
Another serious threat to dolphins is noise pollution caused by humans. Dolphins live in groups and use sound to understand their environment. In the sea, noise travels much better than in the air, which may disturb dolphins in ways we do not fully understand."
FCE_51,B2,"**GETTING FIT**
Exercise is very important for your mind, body, and spirit. It is one of the best ways to feel balanced, especially when life feels chaotic. You might be tired of reading about fitness, but there are many good reasons to exercise, and very few reasons not to.
Exercise helps improve your muscle tone and can change your body shape quickly. It makes your muscles stronger and helps you stand and sit better. It can also prevent muscle imbalances that might cause injuries. Exercise can quickly improve areas like your thighs, stomach, and upper arms. It is good for your heart, lungs, and blood circulation.
You may have heard these reasons many times, but here’s something new: exercise can help reduce feelings of depression and tiredness, and it can help you sleep better. It also helps manage stress and can relieve some health problems. 
If you are not convinced yet, just think about it: exercise is good for you. There are many types of exercise you can try, such as aerobics, jogging, or using weights. However, be careful not to train too hard or lift too much weight, as this can cause injuries. If you are unsure about what is best for you, talk to your doctor.
Good posture is also very important. No amount of exercise will help your body shape if you do not have good posture. Good posture makes you look and feel better. If you tend to slouch, imagine that a balloon is pulling the top of your head up. This can help you lift your chest and breathe better, while also making your body look slimmer.
Stretching your muscles is important too. It helps you move easily and keeps your posture correct. Stretching can prevent injuries from overuse. If you stretch four or five times a week, you will have a more flexible and fit body. 
Your exercise routine should include a warm-up, stretching, an energetic workout, and a cool-down period."
FCE_11,B2,"**IN THEIR NATURAL HABITAT**
What makes film-makers Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman stay away from home for many months? They are looking for the perfect shot. In the jungles and plains of East Africa, it is not easy to find producer Amanda Barrett and cameraman Owen Newman. Right now, they are in the Ngorongoro Crater, which has had six months of almost continuous rain. This has caused many problems. Newman said they had to buy an expensive piece of equipment so that if one of their vehicles gets stuck in the mud, Amanda can pull him back to safety. Their teamwork has created some of the best wildlife films on TV, like their popular film about leopards. While this film was being shown, they were already back in the field, this time following the shy jackal.
Traveling film-makers have been moving around the world to film exotic wildlife since television began. I spoke to Newman during one of his rare meetings with other people at a safari lodge. He said, ""We do have occasional arguments, but we get over them quickly."" Neither of them sees themselves as the leader. They get along well because they both understand the animals in a similar way. 
""When we are on the move, we have to set up our tents each night. But this time we have a more fixed camp. We set out at 5 a.m. each morning, so we make tea the night before and keep it warm in a flask."" Their daily meals are pre-packed and heated by whoever is available. ""We can be out for up to eight weeks at a time, so cooking can be a bit stressful,"" says Newman. It can be a tough life, but being in remote areas allows them to get close to the animals. Newman remembers filming a family of lions, where one lioness would often go off alone. When she returned, she would greet all the other lions and even came to greet their car.
Newman first worked with Barrett in 1988 on a film called ""The Great Rift."" Two years later, they began working together to film Arctic foxes. Since then, they have learned to spend four months in one location to gather enough material for each half-hour film. Before they can start filming, they must submit a script for approval. ""Amanda and I had a good working relationship from the start,"" says Newman. ""We shared the same ideas and vision. We want to create a film that shows the true spirit of the place and the animals, and that touches people's hearts. I believe if you can make people feel something, that is better than just making them think."""
FCE_14,B2,"**The Netball Captain**
In our series about women in sports, Suzie Ellis met England's netball captain, Kendra Slawinski. Kendra is the captain of the England netball team. When I met her, she had a busy day, teaching at a local school and then training in a supermarket car park. I was surprised to hear about her training place. I asked her, ""Don't you get strange looks?"" She replied, ""I focus on my movements and my feet, so I don’t notice much else. I might see cars slow down a little, but that’s all.""
Kendra said, ""My whole life is about being my best for the Championships."" She follows a strict schedule to be as fit as possible. This is her fourth World Championships, and it will be the biggest one yet, with 27 countries taking part. ""We will have home support, which is very special,"" she said. ""It is important to improve the reputation of netball in this country. Playing at home means there will be more pressure. The crowd will have expectations and support us more. People want us to start the tournament with a good game.""
Their first game is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. Kendra believes they have always won against them, but it will still be exciting to play because they are a strong team. The England team is currently ranked fourth in the world. However, Kendra knows the World Championships will be tough. ""You have to push yourself to play every day. There is no rest between games like in a series. You can still win a series if you lose the first game, but the Championships are different. You only have one chance, and you must be ready.""
In the fifteen years Kendra has played at a high level, the sport has become harder and faster. Players are more aggressive on the court. ""You don’t train hard to lose,"" Kendra says. ""But after the game, we are all friends.""
Netball is also using more science for fitness testing. ""It is important that we think and train like world-class players,"" Kendra explains. As captain, she believes it is important to have a strong mindset and lead by example. ""I see my role as supporting and encouraging the team.""
Kendra says, ""From the start of my netball career, I have planned carefully."" She decided that this competition would be her last as a player. She will likely coach young players in the future, but right now, she is focused on her final big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she might have tears in her eyes. Her loyal supporters will be with her every step of the way."
FCE_63,B2,"In Hot Water**
Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends a lot of time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She teaches and researches marine geochemistry, which means she studies the chemicals in the sea. Rachel is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she is not teaching, she goes into a small steel vehicle, about the size of a car, and dives three kilometers down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes.
""Inside,"" she says, ""the space is so small that I can touch the two pilots. They are used to these conditions, which means we can't stand up or move around, and we must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last for 16 hours: three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours to collect rock and water samples, and three hours to come back up to the surface.""
""If something goes wrong and we need to get to the top quickly, we can hit a panic button. The outside drops away, and a small escape vessel is released. It goes quickly to the surface, like a ping-pong ball in a bath. No one has tested it yet, but I don't think it would be a pleasant trip.""
""I didn't know how I would feel the first time I got into the vehicle. It was on a ship, and I got in with an instructor. He explained the emergency procedures, including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack! They were testing how I would react in such a small space."" 
Now Rachel has made six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian crew. ""We went to a place that was a five-day sail west of the Canary Islands in the Atlantic. Here, on the ocean floor, there is a large area of underwater volcanoes, with their chimneys blowing out black smoke. This is where the Atlantic Ocean comes alive. The Russian team was dropping off scientific equipment to study a project that would make a hole 150 meters through a volcano.""
When she is not at sea, Rachel is in her office at the Oceanography Centre in Southampton. ""Two-thirds of my salary comes from teaching, which I love, but I do it so I can continue my research on the 'black smokers.' This is another name for underwater volcanoes, where water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke. This flows out at a rate of one meter per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees.""
""The only time I was scared was when I first went down with the Americans. We were towing equipment on a 50-meter rope when suddenly there was an explosion. There was a huge bang as the shock waves hit our vehicle, and I thought, 'I'm going to die.' We looked at each other in silence, waiting. When nothing happened, we couldn't believe it. The relief was incredible - we were still alive!""
""Diving to the deepest part of the ocean is such an adventure. Every time I look out of the porthole and see those chimneys, I feel amazed. Here I am at the bottom of the sea, and no one else on this planet has ever seen them before. I studied the black smokers for three years for my Ph.D. When I got down there and saw them for real, it was an amazing feeling."""
FCE_56,B2,"**Interview Tips**
First impressions are very important. Studies show that people form opinions about us within the first few minutes of meeting. They notice how we dress, our eye contact, our body movements, and how fast or slow we talk, as well as our voice and the words we use.
Mary Pearce studied to be a teacher. She worked hard to earn her degree and felt very confident when she graduated. She applied for a job at a nearby primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher. On the day of the interview, she saw a small hole in her jacket. She thought about changing, but she knew it would make her late, and she believed it was important to be on time. Unfortunately, Mary did not get the job. A friend who teaches at the school told her that the Head Teacher said, ""If someone doesn't take the time to look their best at an interview, what kind of teacher will they be?""
Simon Grant, a hotel manager, says, ""People who look like they care about themselves are more likely to care about their jobs. Many think that what is inside is what matters, but in an interview, you should try to show your best side."" However, many people do not understand how important a professional image is.
For example, Janet Goodwood worked for ten years as an administrative assistant in a big accounting firm. When the office manager retired, she applied for the job but did not even get an interview. She thought it was a mistake and asked the Director of Personnel what happened. He told her she did not fit the image of an office manager and suggested she improve her wardrobe before applying again. Janet was shocked because she believed she did a good job and that her clothes should not matter.
Movement and gestures also affect how an interviewer sees a candidate. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian found that only 7% of our message about feelings comes from the words we use, 38% comes from our voice, and 55% comes from our facial expressions. If our facial expressions and words send different messages, the listener will pay more attention to the non-verbal message. So, make sure your words match your body language. Mixed messages can confuse the interviewer.
It is also important not to seem too desperate for the job or too eager to please. When Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, applied for a promotion, her interview went very well, and she was offered the job right away. She was very happy but showed too much excitement. The boss realized she would not turn down the offer, so he gave her a lower salary than she wanted. Sheila believes she could have gotten more if she had controlled her excitement.
Finally, what we say and how we say it can help us succeed in an interview. David Artesio, a manager of an employment agency, suggests learning about the company before the interview. For example, the annual report can tell you about the company’s work. Mentioning something that interests you during the interview can show your interest in the company.
Business consultant Marian Woodall suggests having a few questions ready and avoiding long, confusing sentences. She says, ""Poor communicators talk in long paragraphs. Successful communicators use short sentences and clear points."""

**The Farmer**  
Matt Froggatt used to work as an insurance agent in London, but now he runs a sheep farm. ""After 14 years in the business, I found that working in the City was no longer fun. I had planned to stay for another five or ten years, but then I lost my job unexpectedly. I didn’t get a great pay-off, but it was enough to start the farm. My big break came when I met the head chef of a local hotel with one of the best restaurants in the country. By supplying them, my reputation grew, and now I also sell meat online. I’m happy to be out of the office, but it’s surprising how little has changed: I still work 80 to 90 hours a week and sell a product.""
**The Painter**  
Ron Able White was a manager in advertising, but now he makes a living as an artist. ""I started painting as a hobby, but I found it much more exciting than my job. It made sense to take redundancy and become an artist. The career counselor I spoke to was very helpful. I think I was the first person to tell him, 'I don’t want to go back to my old job.' He was surprised because most people in their mid-forties need to find work quickly for money. My wife and I married young, and our children no longer need our support. It was a big change for us. We moved to the north of England, where we didn’t know anyone. We left our friends, but we have been lucky; many of them visit us now.""
**The Hat Maker**  
Katherine Goodison worked as a lawyer for five years before starting her own hat-making business in her London flat. ""Being a lawyer was fun and I earned a lot of money, but the hours were long. I didn’t want to become a senior partner and work even more hours, so I left. Many people said I would get bored, but that has never happened. The key is to have deadlines. In fashion, there are always collections and new designs to work on, so I have to keep a strict schedule. I feel happier now and less stressed. However, I miss socializing with colleagues. What I love about this job is that I am fully responsible for my work. If I do a bad job, I am the one to blame. When you work for a company, you care, but when your name is on the product, you care even more.""
**The Masseur**  
Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16 years before becoming a masseur at the Life Centre in London. ""I worked in financial markets from the age of 22, making deals. I liked the excitement, but I never found the work satisfying. I almost lost my job in 1989, but I left and traveled for a year instead. During that year, I thought about what I wanted to do. I was interested in health, so I visited some of the best gyms and talked to the owners about how they started. I knew I needed qualifications to change careers, so I took courses in massage. Then I got a part-time job at the Life Centre. I have no regrets. I used to feel out of control, but now I have peace of mind and control over my life. That is the best part."""
FCE_6,B2,"'Dedicated to Their Sports'**
Four young sports stars talk about their lives.
**A Darius (Runner)**  
I have always loved sports. I played many sports, but I was best at football and athletics. When I was 14, I tried out for a professional football club, but I chose to focus on athletics instead. My biggest moment was when I competed for my country in the youth team and won a medal. Unfortunately, it did not get much media attention, which was disappointing. I hoped to get some sponsorship because training is expensive. I train at home all winter and then go to Florida for three weeks before the season starts. It is fun because there are great facilities for athletics and the nightlife is good too. However, I have to be very disciplined. If friends invite me out the night before training, I have to say no. I wish I didn’t have to, but dedication is important in this sport. My main goal is to reach the next Olympics - that would be amazing.
**B Gabriel (Surfer)**  
The surfing community is small, so I meet the same people at competitions. Professional surfers are serious, and the best waves are often at dawn, so I have to avoid late-night parties. I don’t mind this too much, but I love sleeping in, and I usually have to give that up too. However, it is worth it because without this dedication, I might not have won the National Championships last year. After any win, I make sure to celebrate with a big night out, and if I win money, I go somewhere nice. The sacrifices are worth it because winning that championship allowed me to present a surfing series on TV. I guess I am a bit of a celebrity now.
**C Dieter (Yacht Racer)**  
When I am on a boat with my friends, we have a lot of fun. We are traditional and always celebrate our wins in style. Some people say we act a bit childishly when we celebrate, but we do not look for media attention. Sometimes, reporters seem more interested in our celebrations than in our race results. I am away for eight months a year, so it is nice to come back and spend time with my friends who do different things. You cannot live and breathe the sport all the time; it is not healthy. I am known in the sailing world, but I am rarely recognized in the street. I would not like to be a celebrity. I do get nice letters from fans asking for signed pictures, and I reply to every one, even if it takes time.
**D Tomas (Tennis Player)**  
It is always exciting to walk onto the court and feel the crowd's support. At my last tournament, it got a bit crazy with many people around. I enjoy being recognized by fans when I am out shopping, but it has its downsides. My last girlfriend did not like it when I got too much attention from female fans. Tennis players travel a lot, and that is why we broke up. It was hard, but you have to make sacrifices in any sport; you need to be serious and professional. It does not bother me too much. I am happy to focus on my game now and will catch up on other things in life after I retire, which comes early in this sport."
FCE_33,B2,"Young Shoppers**
Shopping in a supermarket with children can be very difficult for parents. One mother says, ""They want everything they see. If it’s not the latest sugary cereal, it’s a Disney video or a comic. Usually, they want all three. I can’t afford all this, and if I give in to their requests, I feel guilty about buying unhealthy food. I hate saying no all the time, and I get stressed before we even leave home. I try to avoid taking them shopping, but then I worry that they are missing out on learning how to make their own choices. I feel stuck.""
Research shows that children ask for something to buy every two minutes when they go shopping. More than £150 million a year is spent on advertising aimed at children, mostly on television. This amount is likely to grow, and supermarkets are where this advertising is most effective. Children often do not understand why their parents say no to certain things, especially when they see attractive ads for sugary products. 
Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, ""Most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, but these ideas are not always correct. It is good for parents and children to talk about food. If children only hear about products from TV ads, they get a one-sided view. Parents feel frustrated because they have to compete with advertising and often disappoint their children.""
The Independent Television Commission, which controls TV ads, does not allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy things. But, as Dibb explains, ""The goal of advertising is to convince people to buy products. Even if they can’t say, 'Tell your mom to buy this,' that is still the effect.""
Shopping with children can be stressful for parents because they have to decide which requests to accept and which to refuse. One mother says she is patient when talking about food with her children, but she still feels bad about how she handles their requests: ""My son pays attention to ads but is critical of them. We talk a lot about different products and look at labels together. I’ve talked so much that he thinks all ads are bad. Now, we have very little conflict in the supermarket because the children don’t ask for things I don’t want to buy.""
Parents also admit they are not always consistent in their responses to their children’s requests. Mike, a father of a seven-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter, says, ""We refuse to buy sweets for him because they are bad for him, but we buy double cream and chocolate for ourselves. It’s nice to buy good things, and it’s normal for children to want to share that. But I still get annoyed by their requests. It depends on how I feel. If I’m in a good mood, I’m more likely to say yes. It’s hard to be consistent.""
Supermarkets could help reduce the conflict between parents and children by removing sweets from checkout areas or providing supervised play areas. Even if parents spend less money without their children, the idea of shopping without their kids’ demands might attract more customers."
FCE_20,B2,"Five-Star Luxury and Modern Technology**
The Merrion Hotel is a new five-star hotel in Dublin. It was created by changing four large old houses into a hotel. This process took almost two years and included a lot of research to understand what customers want. The hotel has the latest technology to help both staff and guests.
General Manager Peter MacCann wants his staff to know the guests' names. For more details about what guests like, he uses the hotel’s computer system. This system helps the hotel give special service to returning guests. Although it cost £250,000 to set up, MacCann believes it will save money in the long run. He appreciates how well it works and the services it provides. For example, if a guest asks for certain music CDs during their first stay, those CDs will be ready for them when they come back. This is possible because of the guest-history feature that allows staff to record guest preferences.
Many hotel guests often complain about room temperature. The Merrion has a high-tech system that lets guests control the temperature in their rooms. They can change it by three degrees around the normal temperature of 18°C. If they want, the front desk can adjust the temperature anywhere between 14°C and 25°C.
Business travelers are very important to the hotel, and MacCann estimates that about 65% of their business will come from this group. To meet their needs, the hotel has put a business center in each room. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that also works as a photocopier and printer, and a video-conferencing system.
Technology changes quickly, so the hotel has prepared for future improvements. They have installed extra cables for new technology. The televisions are rented, so they can be replaced with newer models when needed. DVD recorders can also be updated.
Even with all this modern technology, MacCann wants guests to feel comfortable, not overwhelmed. The hotel has 145 large and well-furnished bedrooms that are cozy and inviting. There is also a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a lovely garden.
The food at the hotel is very important. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, who has two Michelin stars, moved his restaurant to the Merrion. This change has many benefits for both him and the hotel. He has designed a new kitchen and improved parking. The hotel can now offer a great place to eat without financial risks. With good technology and a skilled staff, the Merrion Hotel is likely to be very successful."
FCE_40,B2,"Where I Get My Energy**
Emma Marsden asked six women how they find energy in their lives.
A. **Jeanette Kupfermann, Journalist and Author:** ""I get my energy from excitement. I need to do things that challenge me. When I learn something new, I feel very energized. I also love rhythm; right now, I am learning flamenco dancing. Dance is amazing and gives me energy. If I am bored, I feel tired and think life is not worth it. Doing something useful, even in a small way, gives me energy.""
B. **Linda Kelsey, Magazine Editor:** ""I have a lot of work, but I enjoy it all. I love my job, so it doesn’t feel like hard work. If you like what you do, you don’t feel sad, even if you are tired. I need enough sleep, and when I get it, I feel great. If I only sleep six hours, I feel a bit weak. I know exercise gives me energy, but sometimes it’s hard to find the energy to do it! I go to a yoga class once a week and try to exercise at home. After I exercise, I feel much better. I often feel low in the afternoon, so I think it’s good to eat something then.""
C. **Annie Nightingale, Disc Jockey:** ""I don’t eat very healthily for energy; I think it comes from being enthusiastic and positive. I don’t like negative people. I believe we should enjoy our lives and have fun. It’s important to achieve things and set goals. I love my job, and the last two years have been very exciting. I work with many lively young people, which energizes me. I enjoy taking photos, even if I’m not the best at it. I also write words for fun songs, which helps me relax when I travel a lot.""
D. **Floella Benjamin, Author and Children's TV Presenter:** ""My energy comes from doing things I enjoy. I believe in what I do, both at work and at home with my family. Being positive helps a lot. I love working with kids because they are full of energy. Energy is like a natural feeling that comes from talking to others. Just smile at someone and see how good it feels when they smile back. It’s much better than feeling sad. I try to eat healthily and don’t smoke or drink, but I don’t have a strict exercise plan. I get my energy from playing with kids.""
E. **Deborah Moggach, Author and Playwright:** ""What I love most is creating a garden from a wasteland. I once turned a concrete area into a beautiful garden. It was better than any workout. Knowing that someone wants to read my writing gives me energy too. I enjoy sneaking into a farmer's land or a forest. If someone catches me, I say, 'Oh, what a lovely place! I didn’t know it was private.' I like this because it feels playful.""
F. **Katherine Monblot, Therapist:** ""I believe you should care about what you do in life. I like to take risks and get bored easily, which keeps me motivated. Doing things you don’t want to do can make you tired. I used to be part of many committees, but I didn’t like how they took my time. You only have a certain amount of energy, so use it for what matters most to you."""
FCE_45,B2,"**ICE SKATING**
Ice skating has been around for thousands of years. Archaeologists have found skates made from animal bones. These bone skates were used until iron skates were made in Scandinavia around 200 AD. For the rich people in Scandinavia, skating was an important skill. In the early 1900s, skating was seen as stylish, but in the 1924 Winter Olympics, 11-year-old Sonja Henie showed a more athletic way of skating, which made it very popular.
Today, skating combines art and athletics. It is both beautiful and physically challenging. For beginners, balance and control are very important, and you can only go faster as you get better. The way you position your body is key to maintaining balance. Your legs should be slightly bent, and your knees should be relaxed to keep your weight centered. In this position, your body leans a little forward.
Relaxation is very important in skating. To start, your heels should almost touch, and your feet should point outwards. When you push forward with one foot, make a small movement with the other foot. It’s not too hard! If you can keep this up for a while, you can slowly make your movements longer as you gain experience.
Learning how to fall is one of the first skills a skater should learn. Even professional skaters fall sometimes. To fall safely, you should stay relaxed. This helps reduce the impact when you hit the ice. To get up, use your hands to kneel, and then stand up.
Once you can move confidently on the ice, you can try different styles like figure skating, freestyle, distance skating, speed skating, and skating in pairs. The best way to start is to learn figure skating and then basic freestyle. Most ice rinks have good teachers who can help you learn the basic moves, and soon you will be able to do turns, jumps, and spins in freestyle.
If you watch good skaters, you will see how relaxed they are and how easily they move. To achieve this, you should practice a regular exercise program. It can be dangerous to skate with a stiff body, so warm-up exercises are important. These should include exercises for your legs, back, and shoulders, especially for your ankles and knees. After skating, do the same exercises to avoid stiffness.
Skating helps improve balance, coordination, relaxation, and movement. It also helps your heart and lungs and makes your body stronger. When combined with swimming or jogging, it is a great way to stay healthy and fit."

If there is one thing that can make you cry, it is seeing a talented child winning a medal. Julia Gregson asked three young stars and their mothers to share some of the joys and challenges of their lives.
A. **Annika Reeder, 15**  
Annika won a gold medal for gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games. She wants to be a physiotherapist and compete in the next Olympics. ""The training is very hard right now. I don’t have time to watch TV, go out with friends, or do much besides gymnastics and school. I try to take it one day at a time. When I feel very tired, my coach sometimes gives me a day off, but usually, I just keep going. You can’t take too many days off because it makes your body stiff.""
B. **Annika's Mother**  
""From a young age, Annika showed great talent. I have seen some parents push their children, but it doesn’t work. To perform at Annika's level takes a lot of time and energy, and you have to want to do it yourself. People often say that we, as parents, have given up a lot, but they don’t see what the sport has given us. We love it and what it has done for Annika. Before gymnastics, she was a shy girl who hid behind me, but now she has met people from all over the world and gained confidence.""
C. **Sarah Stokes, 12**  
Sarah started show-jumping at age 10 and has won the British National Championship. ""It’s great that my parents like show-jumping because they train me and take me everywhere in the horse box. The shows can last from one to five days. I never get tired of it; I love show-jumping events because they are exciting and fun. Even if my parents weren’t there, I would still do it because I am very determined. My goal this year is to qualify for the British young riders (under-18) team. My big dream is to win a gold medal at the Olympics.""
D. **Sarah's Mother**  
""From the moment Sarah sat on a horse at age 1, I knew she had found her passion. When she was 5, she would wake up early to exercise her pony. To qualify for big shows, we have to travel all over England. To save money, we sleep in the living area of our horse box. Sarah is very organized. She is always happy on a horse and knows what she is doing. Watching your child succeed at something they love is amazing.""
E. **Jane McShane, 10**  
Jane is the Under-14 Chess Champion in Britain. ""Tournaments are really friendly. I know everyone, and it’s fun. When I play, I don’t concentrate as much as I should. I just look around and don’t think too much. I’m not worried about being proud; I don’t talk about my success at school because I don’t like to feel embarrassed.""
F. **Jane's Mother**  
""Jane played her first game when she was 5. My father said, 'Let’s see if she likes it.' He tried to teach me when I was young, but I was bored. Jane loved it from the start. By the end of that day, she had memorized all the moves, and by age 6, she was beating adults. When she wins, I am happy, but if she wanted to stop playing tomorrow, I would support her. I don’t want to hold her back because she is so talented. If she has this gift, I want her to reach her full potential."""

It's true - we are all getting taller. Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher that he wanted to join the navy after school. The teacher asked, ""What do you want to be? The flagpole on a ship?"" This was funny because Chris was already almost two meters tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is the tallest man in Britain. 
Every ten years, the average height of people in Europe increases by one centimeter. More tall people are being born, but this does not mean we are becoming a super race. Instead, we are going back to how we were as cavemen. We are losing the effects of many years of poor diet. Professor Chris Stringer, a palaeontologist, says, ""We are starting to reach our true potential. We are becoming like Cro-Magnons, the people who lived 40,000 years ago.""
For most of human history, our ancestors ate a variety of foods. Women gathered herbs, fruits, and berries, while men hunted animals. One study found that they ate 85 different wild plants. But about 9,000 years ago, farming started, which changed everything. Farmers took over many green areas, and now just three plants - wheat, rice, and maize - provide more than half of the calories people eat today. This poor diet has harmed human health. 
In Ohio, scientists found that when they started to grow corn, healthy hunter-gatherers became sickly farmers. Tooth decay and diseases increased. Corn, which was thought to be good, turned out to be a health problem. However, farming spread because one piece of land could feed ten times more people than hunting could. 
Most people who rely on farming are still not well-nourished. Only in Europe, the US, and Japan are diets starting to reflect the variety of our ancestors' diets again. Now, the average man in the US is 179 cm tall, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. This is a good trend, but it has its own problems. 
Even though people are getting taller, standard bed lengths have stayed at 190 cm since 1860. Legroom in planes and trains seems to have gotten smaller, and clothing companies have to change their products often. The question is: how tall can we get? 
According to Robert Fogel from a university, we could reach a height of 193 cm this century. But scientists say that while individuals may be getting taller because of better nutrition, as a species, we are actually getting smaller. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, humans were a bit rounder and taller to keep warm. Now that the climate is warmer, we seem to be getting thinner and shorter, even when we eat well. As the planet continues to warm, we may get even shorter. In other words, global warming could stop human growth."
FCE_57,B2,"Studio Audiences**
What is it like to be in the audience when a television show is being made? Cosmo Landesman found out. Studio audiences are a common part of television, but many people do not understand them. When we watch game shows, we often wonder, ""Who are these people?""
Some people think that studio audiences are not very important. I have heard that even people who work in television do not think highly of them. Some say they treat studio audiences ""like cattle."" I used to think that studio audiences were made up of silly people who wanted a moment of fame. However, there is no typical studio audience. They come from different backgrounds, jobs, and income levels. Television shows try to attract different types of people for different programs.
Many people who watch television at home do not understand why anyone would want to be in a studio audience. Why would someone apply for tickets, travel far, and sit for hours in a studio just to watch what they can see at home? One reason is that people hope to be on television for a moment. I did not believe this until I spoke to Angela. When I asked her why she came, she said, ""It was a chance to appear on television."" 
Another reason is that people are curious to see how a show is made. But the most common reason I heard was, ""A friend gave me a ticket."" Most of us have never been in a studio audience, but we think we know what it is like. You sit close to strangers while someone holds up signs that say APPLAUD or LAUGH, and you clap or laugh when told. This is true for some shows, but not all. As one studio manager said, ""We always assume a show will be good enough not to need these signs.""
Is there a real difference between being in a studio and watching at home? For Claire, being in a studio is ""more exciting,"" while Charlotte liked being part of live television. ""Last year I saw my favorite comedian. When you watch him at home, you miss a lot."" What I missed was seeing the live actors. From my seat, I could only see the back of someone’s head. The opening scenes were so far away that I ended up watching the show on a studio monitor.
Going to a studio may not be the best way to watch television, but that is not what matters. For most of the audience, it was just fun and a free night of entertainment."
FCE_9,B2,"Favourite Places**
**Bruce**  
I don’t like wild landscapes. I prefer places with people. When I travel, I enjoy lovely villages with old temples, not empty deserts. When I was eight, I went to school in England. On Saturdays, I would ride my bike to the village of Lastingham in its beautiful valley. Cycling helped me relax from school. I loved exploring the hills, valleys, and old villages. Coming from Scotland, I found the landscape both familiar and different, and I still visit there today. I used to write about my adventures in my diary. This was my first try at travel writing, which later became my career.
**Sophia**  
There is a small train that goes from Hythe to Dungeness, run by volunteers. I always travel first class because it doesn’t cost much more than the regular ticket. The scenery is not amazing. The train goes across Romney Marsh with its sheep and next to a canal. But there is one part of the journey I always look forward to - when the train goes through back gardens. For a few moments, we see people doing everyday things, like making tea or folding a chair. I see myself in their eyes, a woman in a small train carriage, looking into their homes. I like the simple landscape of fields, sheep, and a distant grey sea. It makes me look more closely for something special.
**Matthew**  
The Hartland Peninsula is a quiet and beautiful coast. The beaches are hard to reach and have many rocks, so there are not many people here. A few brave surfers come, but most visitors enjoy the beauty of the sea. This coast, facing the Atlantic, is known for shipwrecks. There are walking paths along the coast that you can combine with trips into beautiful valleys full of oak trees, ferns, and wildflowers. We stay in a simple self-catering place with a family in the village of Southole.
**Annette**  
My favorite place in England is the Trough of Bowland, a wide-open moorland that is perfect for hiking. There are not many people living there or visiting. It is a quiet and remote area, and I like the feeling of space. I found this place by chance when I was a student, and I visit every year, either alone, with my boyfriend, or now with my son. It has not changed much since my first visit. Having a child makes these visits more special. I feel sad that he is growing up in a city.
**James**  
I bought Glenthorne, my favorite house in Britain. I wanted peace and to reconnect with my English roots. I grew up in what is now Sri Lanka, but at twelve, I went to school in Devon, in the west of England. I used to ride my bike around the moors and village streets. There was a story about a place we would never cycle past: if you went down the driveway, you would never return. That place was Glenthorne. It is my dream place. It is a magical, quiet, romantic house. You can only hear the sea, wind, and birds."
FCE_42,B2,"**HAPPY HUNTING GROUND**
We are 'animal people' who love all kinds of creatures. One afternoon, my daughter called me at work to tell me she had found a wonderful pine snake. ""Can we keep him?"" she asked excitedly. I said, ""Yes, but only for one night."" We had a special tank ready for animals like this, so we could admire it and look it up in our natural history book.
I got home late and quickly put a pot on to boil when I heard my sons screaming, ""Oh, Mother! Help! Do something!"" I rushed to their bedroom. The problem was with Domino the cat and Bianca the white mouse, which I had received as a Mother's Day gift. Domino was running around with the mouse in his mouth, trying to find a way out. I jumped into the chaos and tripped over something, falling to the floor. 
As I thought about how to stop Domino, I noticed the snake. It had escaped and was slithering off the table and onto the floor. I crouched down as the snake moved closer, while the kids and the cat were jumping around in a loud mess. The dog was barking, and the pot in the kitchen boiled over. I quickly turned off the gas and returned to the chaos with new energy. 
This time, I caught Domino by the tail and pulled the small, wet, and surprisingly unharmed mouse from his mouth. The same mouse was caught by Domino three more times in its life but eventually died of old age. Feeling encouraged, I looked at the snake, but it didn’t seem to have any weak points. 
In the end, I sat on the floor like a snake-charmer, rocking back and forth, but without a flute. Slowly, the snake relaxed and rested its head on its body, but its eyes still looked suspicious. I carefully placed my hands under the snake and stood up, walking to the end of the garden. I pointed the snake towards a tree, hoping it would live happily there.
When I finally let go of the snake's head, expecting it to bite me, it instead slid over my shoulders like a colorful shawl, making itself comfortable. We stood together in the fading light: four young children, Mum, and the snake. My eldest son, DJ, broke the silence with a funny comment: ""You know what it is, Mum? You're nice and warm, and the shed isn't."" 
I had the children gather at the snake's tail and gently encourage it to move on. Slowly, it did. Without looking back, the snake climbed up the wall and disappeared over the roof. As the last bit of its tail vanished, my three-year-old son Clay sighed and said what we were all thinking: ""Boy, that was one big snake!"""
FCE_59,B2,"'Write to Me!**
In our fast world of phones and computers, writing letters is at risk of disappearing. However, I believe that receiving a letter is special and cannot be replaced by other ways of communicating. There is excitement when a letter arrives, joy in seeing who it is from, and happiness in reading what it says.
I have been writing letters for as long as I can remember. It probably started with the little notes I wrote to my mother. She always made sure I wrote my own thank-you letters for Christmas and birthday gifts. It didn’t matter if they were short or messy, as long as they were letters.
When I left home at 18 to study medicine in London, I wrote to my parents every week, and they wrote back to me. Sometimes my father wrote long, funny letters, which I loved. Most of the letters from home talked about everyday life with my parents and their friends. We also made phone calls, but I remember the letters the most.
I also received letters from my boyfriends. Many of them had to work or study far away, so we kept in touch by writing. Writing letters actually helped our relationships because I could express my feelings better in writing than by speaking.
I enjoy letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. Short notes are nice, but it’s even better to get a lot of news! I love receiving letters from different places, like Mangala in Sri Lanka, a friend from training over 20 years ago, and penfriends in Australia and Vancouver. There is also a lady from France who writes to me. We started talking in a restaurant while on holiday, and I asked for her address. If she hadn’t replied, we would have missed out on a great friendship. Now, we write to each other regularly, and I can practice my French with her.
This summer, my family and I visited my American penfriend in Texas. We had been writing to each other for 29 years but had never met. Everyone was surprised that our friendship lasted so long, and the local newspaper even wrote about it!
I am happy that my children are continuing this tradition. Like my mother, I make sure they write their own thank-you letters. My daughter writes me little letters, just like I did for my mother. She and my son have their own penfriends in Texas, set up by my penfriend.
I encourage everyone not to let letter writing become a lost art.'"

**Careless Tourists Damage Ancient Rock Art**
Many ancient pictures carved into the rocks at one of France's important tourist sites are being slowly destroyed. Scientists are worried that the 36,000 drawings on rocks in Mont Bego in the French Alps are being damaged so quickly that they may not last for future generations. The mountain is believed to have been a place for prayer and worship, and it has drawings that are 4,000 years old. These include pictures of cows, fields, and different gods and goddesses. However, as more people visit the site, the pictures are being ruined by careless graffiti.
Jean Clottes, the chairman of the International Committee on Rock Art, says, ""People think that because the pictures have been there for so long, they will always be there. But if the damage continues at this rate, there will be nothing left in 50 years."" He has seen tourists stepping on the drawings, which wears away the rock and makes the artwork less clear. Some visitors even take pieces of the rock home as souvenirs. ""When people cannot take a good photograph, they rub the drawings to make them look clearer,"" he said. ""The drawings are already polished by the weather, and if the sun is shining and visitors cannot see them well, they rub and scrape them to make them look fresher.""
Other researchers have seen people arrive with long sticks to scratch their own drawings or names into the rocks. Experts disagree on the best way to protect the drawings. Henry de Lumley, the director of the Museum of Natural History in Paris, believes the only way to save the site is to make the whole mountain a ""no-go"" area, allowing the public to visit only on guided tours. He says that if this does not happen, the site will be completely destroyed, and important research will be lost.
Clottes disagrees. He thinks that Henry de Lumley's plan is too extreme and will upset local people. ""The site was declared a historic monument by the Ministry of Culture, and we must do everything we can to save what is there,"" he said. David Lavergne, a regional architect, also wants to keep the site open. ""Henry de Lumley's idea isn't ideal,"" he said. ""Our department believes the best solution is to let people see the site, but it is hard to stop visitors from causing damage because the area is so large. I would prefer that everyone could visit, but the main problem is money. We do not have enough funds to hire enough guards. We may need to think about charging a fee. There seems to be no chance of government funding.""
In Nice, Annie Echassoux, who also studied the site, is worried that as the mountain becomes easier to reach—tourists can now avoid a long walk by hiring vehicles—the damage will increase quickly. She believes the only solution is to block off the area and provide guides. ""You can't say the plan can't happen because there is no money,"" she said. ""That is not good enough. Money must be provided because the Ministry of Culture has classified this area as a historic site. If we do not take action, we will be responsible for losing the drawings for the next generation."""
FCE_32,B2,"Young Shoppers**
Shopping in a supermarket with children can be very difficult for parents. One mother says, ""They want everything they see. If it's not the latest sugary cereal, it's a Disney video or a comic. Usually, they want all three. I can't afford all this, and if I give in to their requests, I feel guilty about buying unhealthy food. I hate saying no all the time, and I get stressed before we even leave home. I try to avoid taking them shopping, but then I worry that they are missing out on learning how to make choices. I feel stuck.""
Research shows that children ask for something to buy every two minutes when they go shopping. More than £150 million a year is spent on advertising aimed at children, mostly on television. This amount is likely to grow, and supermarkets are where this advertising is most effective. Children often do not understand why their parents say no to certain things, especially when they see attractive ads for sugary products. 
Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, ""Most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, but these ideas are not always correct. It is good for parents and children to talk about food. If children only hear about products from TV ads, they get a one-sided view. Parents feel frustrated because they have to compete with advertising and often disappoint their children.""
The Independent Television Commission, which controls TV ads, does not allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy things. But, as Dibb points out, ""The goal of advertising is to convince people to buy products. Even if they cannot say, 'Tell your mom to buy this,' that is still the effect.""
Shopping with children can be stressful for parents because they have to decide which requests to accept and which to refuse. One mother says she is patient when talking about food with her children, but she still feels unhappy about how she handles their requests: ""My son pays attention to ads but is critical of them. We talk a lot about different products and look at labels together. I have talked so much that he thinks all ads are bad. Now, we have very little conflict in the supermarket because the children don’t ask for things I don’t want to buy.""
Parents also admit they are sometimes inconsistent in their responses to their children's requests. Mike, a father of a seven-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter, says, ""We refuse to buy sweets for him because they are bad for him, but we buy double cream and chocolate for ourselves. It is nice to buy good things, and it is normal for children to want to share that. But I still get annoyed by their requests. It depends on how I feel. If I am in a good mood, I am more likely to say yes. It is hard to be consistent.""
Supermarkets could help reduce the conflict between parents and children by removing sweets from checkout areas or providing supervised play areas. Even if parents spend less money because their children are not with them, the idea of shopping without their children's demands could attract more customers."
FCE_65,B2,"Climbing Walls**
Climbers used to go to the mountains to climb. Now, you can find climbing walls both indoors and outdoors. The crowd watches closely. High above them on a climbing wall, hanging upside down by two fingers, is the French climber Francois Lombard. He is competing in the World Cup Climbing Championships at the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham. This arena is better known for the TV show Gladiators, but both events have one thing in common - The Wall.
The reason for these events is new technology that is developing quickly. Before the mid-1960s, climbers practiced on cliffs where there were good climbing spots. In winter, they had to deal with the cold, go for walks, or climb on snow and ice in Scotland. As the sport grew, it became important for climbers to stay fit. Since they could not use cliffs for much of the year, they started to climb on brick edges or stone buildings. This helped them keep their fingers strong and avoid getting bored.
Soon, many sports centers began to build climbing walls using special bricks. One of the first climbing walls was made by Don Robinson, a physical education teacher, in the mid-1960s at Leeds University. He created a wall with natural rock set in concrete. Many climbing walls like this were built in sports halls in the 1970s, but they had some problems. These walls could only be straight up and down, while real cliffs have different shapes like overhangs and slanted rocks. Once the walls were built, they could not be changed, and climbers would get tired of the same routes.
In 1985, a Frenchman named Francois Savigny created a new material that could be shaped like the rocks on cliffs. These shapes could be attached to any wall and removed when climbers wanted something new. French companies also started to make climbing panels on steel frames. Concrete was too heavy for making overhanging walls without a lot of work, but steel frames could be built anywhere. This system allowed climbers to have many different holds to choose from."
FCE_61,B2,"'So You Want to Be an Actor'**
If you tell someone that you want to be an actor, they will probably say it is a risky choice. Acting is indeed a risky career. There are many actors, but not enough jobs for all of them. When you decide to become an actor, some people you thought were your friends might think you are making a mistake, while others may support you. Everyone will give you different advice. It is a personal choice, and you are responsible for your own decisions and dreams. 
There are no easy ways to become an actor. There are no tests to pass, and even after training, there is no guarantee you will get a job. Success depends on luck and talent. However, there is always a need for new actors, and acting can bring excitement, glamour, and sometimes good money.
Many people ask what talent is. I think talent is a mix of natural skill and imagination, which is hard to measure. It also involves courage and belief in what you are doing. 
Why do people want to act? It can be hard to explain. In theater, the important moment is the connection between the actor and the audience. This connection is what motivates actors to perform. If you ask successful actors how they achieved their success, they might not have a clear answer. They know some things about their skills and techniques, but they also understand that their success can change quickly. 
Disappointment is a big challenge for actors. Last month, you might have been without work, doing other jobs. Then, you might get a chance to audition for a role. But even if you want the job very much, you might not get it. Because of this, actors often avoid talking about their chances of getting a role. They find ways to cope with the stress of competition and the fear of rejection. No one likes to be rejected. 
From the moment you start auditioning, you are saying you are ready and hopefully talented enough for the job. In many ways, it is up to you. If you do not care enough about your acting, others may not care about you either."

In Europe, the US, and Japan, diets are starting to reflect the variety of our ancestors' diets again. As a result, the average man in the US is now 179 cm tall, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. This is a good trend, but it has its own problems. 
Even though people are getting taller, standard bed lengths have stayed at 190 cm since 1860. Legroom in planes and trains seems to have gotten smaller, and clothing companies have to change their products often. The question is: how tall can we get? 
According to Robert Fogel from the University, we could reach a height of 193 cm this century. However, scientists say that while individuals may be growing taller because of better nutrition, as a species, we are actually getting smaller. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, humans were slightly rounder and taller to keep warm. Now that the climate is warmer, we seem to be getting thinner and shorter, even when we eat well. As the planet continues to warm, we may get even shorter. In other words, global warming could stop human growth."
FCE_35,B2,"**A NEW LIFE**
**The Farmer**  
Matt Froggatt used to work as an insurance agent in London, but now he runs a sheep farm. ""After 14 years in the business, I found that working in the City was no longer fun. I had planned to stay for another five or ten years, but then I lost my job unexpectedly. I didn’t get a great pay-off, but it was enough to start the farm. My big break came when I met the head chef of a local hotel with one of the best restaurants in the country. By supplying them, my reputation grew, and now I also sell meat online. I’m happy to be out of the office, but it’s surprising how little has changed: I still work 80 to 90 hours a week and sell a product.""
**The Painter**  
Ron Able White was a manager in advertising, but now he makes a living as an artist. ""I started painting as a hobby, but I found it much more exciting than my job. It made sense to take redundancy and become an artist. The career counselor I spoke to was very helpful. I think I was the first person to tell him, 'I don’t want to go back to my old job.' He was surprised because most people in their mid-forties need to find work quickly for money. My wife and I married young, and our children are grown, so we didn’t need to worry about that. We moved to the north of England, where we didn’t know anyone. It was hard to leave our friends, but we have been lucky; many of them visit us now.""
**The Hat Maker**  
Katherine Goodison worked as a lawyer for five years before starting her own hat-making business in her London flat. ""Being a lawyer was fun and I earned a lot of money, but the hours were very long. I realized I didn’t want to become a senior partner and work even more hours, so I left. Many people said I would get bored, but that has never happened. The key is to have deadlines. In fashion, there are always collections and new designs to work on, so I have to keep a strict schedule. I feel happier now and less stressed. However, I miss the social interaction with colleagues. What I love about this job is that I am fully responsible for my work. If I do a bad job, I am the one to blame. When you work for a company, you care, but when your name is on the product, you care even more.""
**The Masseur**  
Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16 years before becoming a masseur at the Life Centre in London. ""I worked in financial markets from the age of 22, making deals. I liked the excitement, but I never found the work satisfying. I almost lost my job in 1989, but I left and traveled for a year instead. During that year, I thought about what I wanted to do. I was interested in health, so I visited some of the best gyms and talked to the owners about how they started. I knew I needed qualifications to change careers, so I took various massage courses. Then I got a part-time job at the Life Centre. I have no regrets. I used to feel out of control, but now I have peace of mind and control over my life. That is the best part."""
FCE_5,B2,"A Winning Game**
Two brothers are discovering that their childhood game is great for business. Dave and Norm Lagasse, two bearded brothers in their forties, are sitting in their simple home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA, and remembering their childhood. In front of them is a wooden board with round plastic pieces. They are playing the old game of pichenotte, which they say is special. Their grandfather, Lucien Rajotte, a grocer from Quebec, Canada, brought the game to the USA and taught it to his family. Soon, every weekend and holiday, the family played the game and, as Dave says, ""had the best time ever."" Eventually, the family moved to New Mexico, but they did not forget Grandpa's pichenotte board, which he made from old wooden crates. They continued to play regularly. When visitors came, they were often curious because the game was unknown in the southern USA.
Three years ago, Dave set up the old pichenotte board and saw how cracked and worn it was. He decided to make a new one, which turned out to be beautiful. A relative saw it and wanted one, then a friend wanted another. Curious about the interest, one night the brothers took one of Dave's new boards to a sports bar in Santa Fe. ""People started to watch,"" says Dave, ""and said, 'No way I'm playing that silly game.' Then they'd sit down, and soon you couldn't get them up from the table!"" When people asked about the game's origins, Dave did some research. He found that the roots were probably in India, where a similar game called 'carroms' exists. This game was adapted into 'squails,' played in British pubs, and British people brought it to Canada. Pichenotte is the French-Canadian version that developed in Quebec.
Pichenotte can be played by two to four people and is a game of skill. Each player gets 12 pieces or 'pucks.' These are flicked across a wheel-like board using one finger. Flicking a puck into a small hole is worth 20 points. There are three rings around the hole worth 15, 10, and 5 points, and eight small posts are obstacles. The game usually lasts about two minutes. When they saw how popular the game was at the Santa Fe bar, the Lagasses made more boards and took them to markets and craft fairs. Crowds gathered, money changed hands, and the game's popularity grew. Soon, championships began, and a trophy called the 'Lord Pichenotte Cup' was created. As word spread, the boards sold quickly, and the brothers decided to start the pichenotte business full-time. They set up a workshop in their garage and began making boards. They have produced more than 450 boards so far. Made of birchwood and mahogany, each board weighs 12kg and is 1cm thick. Norm explains, ""They're very durable, as they have to last a long time."" They are available for $595 each on the brothers' website.
Currently, there are no professional pichenotte players or TV shows about the game. However, the day may come when the brothers' garage will have a luxury car instead of tools and wood. Until then, they are happy to spend their free time playing the game they hope will bring them success."
FCE_41,B2,"**WELCOME TO THE MODEL VILLAGE**
When you first enter the Model Village, it is hard to believe that a few years ago this was just a piece of empty land, flat and covered with weeds. For a long time, it was seen as useless land. The careful planning and hard work of one man, with the support of his wife, changed this land into the beautiful place you see today. Many tons of soil and clay were moved to change the flat area into the lovely landscape you see now. Although machines helped to change the land, a lot of hard work was also needed.
Once the land was shaped, about 1,000 tons of topsoil were brought in to create the lawns, flower beds, and rock gardens. In building the Model Village, hundreds of trees and bushes were planted. These plants had to be chosen carefully for the area. Only plants that could survive the salty air near the sea were used. They also had to be strong enough to handle the strong winter winds. Most of the plants came from local garden centers, but some were brought from as far away as Canada and New Zealand.
The whole village was created by Colin Sims, who made over 100 models by himself over nine years after the village opened in 1972. The models are made from different materials like stone, concrete, treated wood, and plastic to resist all kinds of weather. At first, Colin needed help from experts who taught him how different materials would last through changing weather. But soon, he became an expert himself.
You will notice that everything is built to the same scale, and even the smallest details on the models have been carefully made. This was done with patience and special building techniques. The Model Village is a very popular place and is known for its high quality and care. The methods used to create these realistic models have been used in other model villages in England and have even been included in some college courses about modeling.
All the buildings you will see in the village show traditional British styles and are not based on one specific place. One of the most impressive buildings is the Manor House. This is a typical 13th-century stone building with a brick tower and stone walls, based on manor houses found in the West Country. As you walk around the village, you will also see the Castle, St Mary's Church, a zoo, and a mini golf course, which is the newest addition to the village.
We ask you to stay on the paths during your visit and not to touch any of the models; if you accidentally break something, it can take us a long time to fix it. You can take photos from the pathways only. Dogs are welcome on a short lead.
To make your visit more enjoyable, you will see buttons in front of some of the working models. Press these buttons to make the models move. At the end of your visit, we would love to hear your comments. We are always planning new models, and your ideas can help us create a more interesting display. We also want to know if there are any models that you think need improvement. We are always replacing and updating the models, and we need to know which ones need attention.
We hope you enjoy your visit and look forward to seeing you again. Don't forget to tell your friends about it!"

Every week, British tabloid newspapers publish pictures that invade people's privacy and break the rules set by newspaper editors. While some pop stars do pose for photographers sometimes, this is not common. More often, serious harm is done to famous people when their private moments are shown on the front page. Very few of them ask for help from the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), which was created to handle these problems. These pictures are rarely in the public interest. For example, do private photos of pop stars help solve a crime? How did a picture of a famous actress on a hotel balcony help public health and safety? The actress has complained about long-distance photos before, and since she was in a hotel, where people expect privacy, she had a good reason to complain, but she did not take any action. It is a scandal that the PCC did not start an investigation. The PCC should also look into a recent shocking story about a pop star's love life. Like the actress, the pop star has not made a formal complaint. Shouldn't the PCC take action on this and other unfair stories? 
This seems like a good idea. It could lead to many decisions against newspapers. These decisions would be reported by other newspapers and shown on TV and radio. The public would not support these newspapers, and editors would have to stop publishing such stories. Photographers would also be affected, as they would no longer be able to hide and take pictures of celebrities. If the PCC decided to act like a ""police officer,"" there would be some problems. How would it decide to start an investigation? Should it talk to the victim and encourage them to complain? And if the person still did not want to do anything, should the PCC still act? Also, celebrities and royal family members might expect that any story about them would be investigated, and they could be upset if it wasn’t. 
The job of the PCC is very big. How could it monitor all of the British press: national, local, and magazines? There is also the issue of embarrassment. Even if someone's privacy is invaded, would they want the added embarrassment of an investigation? Many people just want to forget about it and move on with their lives. Some might have other reasons to stay quiet. They might have a worse story that they want to keep secret, and they know that complaining could make it public. In this way, the PCC could also become a problem for them. 
One British comedian faced issues with the press when he and his wife were secretly photographed on their honeymoon in the Caribbean. He did not complain then, and he also did not complain when he and his family were photographed during a holiday. He was afraid that the newspaper, News of the World, would publish the pictures again with a new story about his anger, saying they thought it was just a joke and that, as a comedian, he would have a sense of humor. This fear is understandable. People think they will be targeted again if they challenge the tabloids. It is hard to find an easy solution to this serious problem. 
**Questions:**
1. What do British tabloid newspapers often publish that invades people's privacy?
2. Why do very few famous people complain to the Press Complaints Commission (PCC)?
3. What is one example given in the text of a situation where a famous person might feel their privacy was invaded?
4. What could happen if the PCC decided to take action against newspapers?
5. Why did the British comedian not complain about being photographed on his honeymoon?"

Juliette Davidson spent her first year after leaving St. Aldate's College working for three lawyers. It was a good first job because they were very supportive. She learned how to work in an office and improved her typing skills. However, there was no chance for promotion. One day, she decided to leave, bought a plane ticket, and traveled for a year.
Now, Juliette works as a Personal Assistant to Brenda Cleverdon, the Chief Executive of Business in the Community. She says, ""In two and a half years, I have become more skilled, and my job has really changed. From the start, my boss wanted to help me grow. My job title is the same as when I started, but my tasks have changed. I now do most of the correspondence and budgets, and I handle questions from company chairmen to people wanting to start their own business. Brenda includes me in all her work and also gives me specific projects and events to organize."""
FCE_17,B2,"'What is the Secret of Confident People?'**
Confident people may seem like they were born that way, but most will say it is a skill they learned. Nina Hathway asks five people how they became confident.
**A. Jenny**  
When I left school, I was very shy and thought I would always be that way. When I was about twenty-five, I helped at my daughter's school. I was nervous, but I did well, and someone suggested I take a university course. On my first day, I was very anxious, but my confidence grew over time. Working at the school changed my life and helped me become more outgoing.
**B. Michaela**  
Four years ago, my father got sick, and I had to take over the family business. I was scared and became a bit too aggressive. I thought that was how confident people acted, but I learned that to be confident, you must believe in yourself. If work gets too hard, I don’t feel guilty about leaving some tasks for the next day. When I face something difficult, I remind myself that I have nothing to lose. Fear can make you feel less confident, so I talk to myself to calm those fears.
**C. Lisa**  
People think I am very confident, but I often feel scared inside. I learned to look confident because it is important in my job on TV. Interviewing people showed me that many of us feel nervous in important situations. The best advice I got was from my mother when I worried about my clothes as a teenager. She said, ""Who is looking at you? Everyone is too busy worrying about themselves."" I also believe you gain confidence by facing your fears. I was very nervous during my driving test, but I passed. After that, I felt I could handle anything.
**D. Barbara**  
My confidence comes from enjoying my work, but I have built it up over the years. If you keep working and learn from your mistakes, you will feel more confident next time. I work hard and am liked at the restaurant, but not everyone will like you. You must like yourself for who you are, not try to be what others want. My company offers training courses, which have helped my self-esteem. It is good to set small goals so you can see your progress instead of trying to do everything at once.
**E. Kim**  
After college, I worked as a secretary and often sat in meetings without speaking up. Eventually, I found the confidence to share my thoughts. When I started working in politics, I had never spoken in public and would shake with nerves. I told myself, ""Don’t be silly. People do this every day, so you can too."" I also found it helpful to write down a few notes to refer to, like a comfort blanket! I believe everyone feels a bit nervous when speaking in public. The real secret to confidence is to keep telling yourself, ""Nothing is impossible."""
FCE_47,B2,"**Visit to Malaysia**
Paul Forster goes to a kite-flying festival and spends a nervous night in the forest. Adnan Ali smiled as I gave him his torn kite. ""You have to keep it,"" he said, ""it's traditional. If the line breaks, finders keepers... and anyway, I have many more."" He pointed to a pile of beautifully decorated kites at his feet. All were 120 cm wide and long, made of tissue paper and bamboo. We sat in the shade of the tall trees behind the Beach of the Seven Lagoons in Kelantan and looked at Malaysia's biggest kite festival. 
In the center of the beach, there were 10 platforms where helpers held up the kites. A row of nervous competitors held the lines of their kites and waited for the countdown. When the whistle blew, the crowd cheered, and the kites flew into the air like rockets. More than 500 men and boys had signed up for the competition, which lasts for five days every year. Each person entered four different kite designs, which were judged on decoration, stability in the air, and flying ability. 
""Flying kites isn't so hard,"" said Adnan, ""but making them takes real skill. Visit me at home, and I'll show you how."" I received five invitations that day, and I decided to accept his. At his house, I drank cold milky tea and ate fish crackers in a large room. As night fell, he asked me to come back the next day to help rebuild his kite, but I couldn't. Instead, I explored the southern part of the state, driving towards Kuala Lumpur, into mountains covered with thick rainforest. 
I took a wrong turn, and the smooth road ended at a river. A small boat was waiting to take people across. Nearby, I saw a sign that pointed up a path into the forest and said: ""Jelawang Jungle 3 km."" Before I started, it would have been good to know that most of this distance was uphill, steep, and slippery. When I reached the track, I found a man named Baba waiting with a flask of tea. He took care of a kitchen and a few bamboo huts. I decided to stay there, trying not to think about insects crawling under my thin mattress. 
The night was very dark and full of different sounds. A waterfall roared nearby, and many creatures moved and squeaked. In the morning, there was a great view over five ranges of green mountains. In the afternoon, it rained. First, the wind blew, then lightning struck the treetops. Seconds later, I was soaked. Sliding downhill, I wondered how the giant butterflies avoided the heavy rain. I also worried about my car being washed away (it sometimes happens) and the chance of drowning if I opened my mouth. Luckily, my car was still there, covered in mud, at the bottom of the track. 
In Kota Bahru, the capital of Kelantan, everyone asked me questions: ""Where are you from?"" ""How old are you?"" But they were friendly. Kelantan is known for its kites, but I remember it more for the kindness of its people."
FCE_48,B2,"What Kind of Shopper Are You?**
We all go shopping, but we do it in different ways. Do you know what kind of shopper you are? Abby Edwards asked some people about their shopping habits.
A. **Melanie, 22, dancer**  
I love shopping! I can't spend enough money. When I have cash, I go shopping and feel happy. I find it hard to walk past sale signs. My boyfriend is the same, so we often go shopping together. We are both addicted to shopping!
B. **Brenda, 40, office manager**  
I don’t like shopping much. My husband does most of the food shopping because he cooks and knows what he likes. I don’t spend much time shopping for clothes. I take my son and daughter shopping, but we all have different tastes, so it’s not fun. I don’t buy things for myself often, and when I do, I feel guilty and tell my husband I spent less money than I really did.
C. **Juliet, 28, personnel manager**  
I only shop for what I need. I really dislike shopping and only go when I have to. When I do go, I know exactly what I want and won’t buy anything else. Shopping makes me tired, and I would rather be doing something else.
D. **Anita, 35, TV producer**  
I like to look around sometimes, but I usually know what I want and where to find it. I don’t waste time and try to shop quickly. However, I have bought things I didn’t really need, so maybe I’m careful but sometimes make mistakes.
E. **Lizzie, 41, secretary**  
I really don’t enjoy shopping. I dislike shopping for clothes because I can never find what I want or get help. The shops are too noisy and messy, which makes it a nightmare for me. Luckily, I don’t have to shop for clothes often because I get most of my clothes for free. For food, I go to the supermarket once a week and do it quickly.
F. **Lisa, 22, actress**  
I think I’m a happy shopper. Sometimes I go shopping with my friends, and we often end up buying things. I don’t usually go with a specific item in mind, but if I see something I like, I buy it.
G. **Suki, 26, art gallery assistant**  
I’m a careful shopper. I enjoy shopping, but I don’t buy a lot. I usually know what I want and don’t spend too much. Sometimes I shop to feel better, but then I often feel worse because I spent too much money.
H. **Ann-Marie, 29, nursery worker**  
I love shopping, but only on certain days and never on Saturdays because it’s too busy. I’m a careful shopper. I usually have an idea of what I want and don’t buy things right away. I like to check other shops to find better deals, which takes me a long time.
I. **Linda, 32, restaurant manager**  
I don’t like shopping much. Since I work in the city center, shopping is not exciting for me anymore. When I have to shop, I don’t try things on because it’s too much trouble. The clothes I buy don’t always fit, but I don’t mind too much. I prefer to make a few mistakes than spend a lot of time in shops."
