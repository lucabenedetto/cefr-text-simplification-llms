**Garbage in, garbage out**

Charging families for each bag of rubbish they throw away seems like a good idea for the environment and money. But it may not be. In many developed countries, people have regular rubbish collection. Rubbish bags or bins are taken away by a special truck to a dump. This service is usually free. Families pay for it through local taxes, but a family that throws away a lot of rubbish pays the same as a couple that throws away very little. However, collecting rubbish is not free. The more rubbish people throw away, the more trucks and workers are needed, and the more money local governments spend on dumps.

If rubbish disposal is free, people will throw away too much rubbish. A solution is to make families pay for the rubbish they throw away. This could make them throw away less and recycle more, if local governments help with recycling.

Two American economists, Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman, studied some towns in America that started charging families for rubbish. The most common way was to sell stickers that families put on their rubbish bags. Only bags with these stickers were picked up each week. In a study about a town called Charlottesville, Virginia, families had to pay 80 cents for each sticker. 

At first, this seemed like a good idea. The number of bags thrown away fell by 37%. But many people just put more rubbish into each bag instead of buying more stickers. This is not good because machines at dumps can compact rubbish better than people can. The total weight of rubbish collected only fell by 14%. In other towns without a pricing system, the weight of rubbish also fell, but by only 3.5%.

Some people even dumped their rubbish illegally instead of paying for collection. This illegal dumping might be responsible for 30-40% of the reduction in collected rubbish. However, there was a 15% increase in recycling, which means people chose to recycle instead of paying to throw away their rubbish. But many people were already recycling before the new fees.

In another study, Fullerton and Kinnaman found that charging for rubbish does reduce the amount of rubbish, but not by much. A 10% increase in sticker prices only cuts the amount of rubbish by 0.3%. This is less than in other studies. To throw away much less rubbish, people would need to buy less of everything. A small tax on rubbish is not likely to change much.

It is important to think about other factors, like income and education. In richer towns, people throw away more rubbish and have less time to recycle. Should we say that charging families for rubbish is a bad idea? Not really, because free disposal is too cheap. But simple ideas can have complicated results. We often need complex economic models to understand them, and sometimes the results are not good.

Theodore Zeldin talks about how our work life can change. Do you feel respected and appreciated at work? Success in a job is not enough anymore. Many people feel their work is not valued. Even famous people can feel unhappy. Loving your job used to be enough, but now you should think about how your job affects you as a person. This is an important question. If your skills make you boring and you cannot talk to others, then having a good job or money will not make you happy.

I want to find out how work can help us feel fulfilled and happy. Work should not just be about making money; it should help us live better lives and meet new people. However, just getting rid of unemployment is not enough. As people learn more, they want jobs that are interesting and helpful.

Even jobs that used to be good, like being a doctor or an architect, can be stressful. Many workers feel unhappy in their jobs. In Britain, only 8% of workers feel their values match their company’s values.

I am studying different jobs to see how they affect people. I want to understand happiness, love, friendship, and respect. I am looking for better ways to earn a living. Many experts focus on making companies richer, but we also need to think about ourselves as people and who we want to be with.

How many of us feel truly alive at work? Many people feel like they are stuck in their jobs, working just to survive. For example, many hotel workers are smart and lively but have low pay and long hours. Hotels could be more than just places to sleep; they could be places where people from different countries meet and share experiences.

Hotel workers often do not have deep connections with guests. Hotels could be cultural centers, helping guests learn about the city. If hotels listened to their workers' dreams, they could offer more services. But often, they focus only on making money.

For me, work is about relationships. Many people want to feel independent at work. They should be able to create their own jobs and choose their coworkers. This means they need to learn to talk to people from different backgrounds. Good communication is important, but real conversation is even more important. It helps create respect and understanding between people. Every time we have a meaningful conversation, we can change the world a little bit. 

**Questions:**

1. What does Theodore Zeldin talk about?
2. Why is success in a job not enough anymore?
3. What do many hotel workers feel about their jobs?
4. How can hotels be more than just places to sleep?

**BROADCASTING: The Social Shaping of a Technology**

The word 'broadcasting' comes from farming. It means to spread seeds widely. This idea is about growth and getting a good harvest. Broadcasting needs a central place to send out information, like seeds from a bucket.

We need to think about why a new technology that sends words and pictures was set up like this. Television is connected to other ways of communication, like the telegraph and the telephone. But from the start, it was made to be a central 'mass' medium. This means it sent information to many homes from one main place. This fit well with how society was changing at that time.

There were some other ideas for how to use television. In the early 1930s, some people in Britain tried to make two-way television, which could work like a telephone. Many people wrote about how to build television machines in popular science magazines. But big companies took over in 1938 and made rules that pushed out the small inventors. This stopped television from becoming a more equal way for everyone to communicate.

In the early 1930s, television was mostly watched in public places in the USA and other countries. In Britain, many people saw television together in public. The idea of small, two-way television was not successful. Instead, companies wanted to sell television sets for homes. As people had more money in the 1920s, they wanted their homes to be places for entertainment. This is happening all over the world now.

There is a link between how society changes and how broadcasting works. As society modernized, power and money became more concentrated. Traditional communities broke apart, and people became more mobile. This made people feel more alone compared to earlier times.

Centralized broadcasting helped governments share important information with everyone. It also helped create a sense of community in the nation. Broadcasting became the main way to share information through radio and television.

However, broadcasting can also support democracy. Between the World Wars, many countries wanted to make sure everyone had equal access to information for political and social life. 

Television is changing now, and the word broadcasting may not fit anymore. It may only refer to a specific way of sharing information during a certain time in history.

1. What does the word 'broadcasting' originally mean?
2. Why was television set up as a central 'mass' medium?
3. What did some people in Britain try to create in the early 1930s?

CPE_13,"**Text: Clutter**

Sometimes, it feels like no matter how many things you have, you still do not feel safe. It is normal to want a home that meets your needs, but sometimes we want too many things. Advertisements make us feel insecure. They often say, ""If you do not have this, you are not good enough."" 

Next time you walk down the street, try not to look at any advertisements. They are everywhere: on TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, t-shirts, and the internet. They all tell us to buy more things.

**Caves**

Many researchers study caves. They want to know where caves come from, how water moves in them, and what lives in them. Caves are small but interesting parts of nature. They make us curious and want to learn more. Many people study caves because they affect our lives. 

However, visiting caves can be hard. This means that many cave studies are done by people who visit caves for fun, not just by scientists.

**Weather Watch**

A long time ago, people started to study the weather using only their senses. Since the 17th century, weather study has become very technical. Now, we use satellites and machines to get weather information quickly. Computers can solve complex problems much faster than people.

Even though weather science uses many difficult words, human experience is still important. People’s observations help scientists understand the weather better."
CPE_16,"**MUSIC AND THEATRE**

I used to think that opera is mainly theatre. Now, I think differently. After working at a national opera house, I learned that music is the most important part of opera. This is how it should be. I come from the world of theatre, where words and actors are very important. In theatre, the audience and the performers usually speak the same language.

At music performances, like concerts or operas, many people do not know much about music. Some feel embarrassed about this. Most people admire the skill of the musicians. Even a good musician shows us years of hard work. Watching great musicians is like watching athletes. We know running for a bus is similar, but we see how much better the athletes are.

Theatre audiences have different expectations. They do not always understand how hard acting is. They may not be impressed when an actor says a long speech. People often ask actors, ""How do you learn all those lines?"" This does not mean theatre audiences are less demanding than music audiences. Many people enjoy both.

The question is, can music learn from theatre? I think yes. I have seen how a different approach can make concerts better. Live music is full of feelings and can connect with the audience. However, music performances often have strict rules, like dress codes, which can make the audience feel separate from the musicians.

Sometimes, music audiences clap between songs, which can break the flow of the performance. This is often a way to show appreciation, but it can also disturb the whole work.

Many people are working to bring new audiences to concerts and operas. They want to show that ""serious"" music is for everyone. I remember a special event called In Search of Angels. It took place in a cathedral and outside in the town. It was a great musical experience, and many audience members felt they were part of it.

I wish music could be more like theatre, which can be exciting and different. Sometimes, using unusual places for performances can surprise both performers and audiences. It may not be comfortable, but theatre audiences are often brave and willing to try new things.

I know that many plays are performed in a traditional way, similar to concerts. However, I believe we can change how people experience music. I love both theatre and music, and I want more people to enjoy them like I do."

**Sand**  
I think sand is not very nice. It can be useful, like making glass and concrete, but I do not like it at the beach. Sand gets in my face and my food. It can hide important things like car keys and coins. When I am wet, sand sticks to me and is hard to get off. But when I step on a towel or walk in a car, the sand falls off. For days, I find sand in my shoes and socks. I do not want sand around me.

**Lock and Key**  
People have always wanted a safe home. A long time ago, they used ropes to lock doors. Now, we have electronic locks with cards. But many people still like to use a real key. They feel safer with a key in their hand. One company made a new electronic lock, but they also added a real metal key.

**Modern Art**  
I was nervous to visit the Tate Modern gallery because I do not understand modern art. I like some art, like furry things and bright lights. I wish I knew more about it. The gallery helps visitors understand the art better. They have labels that explain what the art means. This helps me see the art in a new way."
CPE_46,"**Text: Every Picture Tells a Story**

Making movies from books often means cutting parts of the story. This can be hard for the writer, but it can also help them see things in a new way. When I worked on a movie script, I noticed that I could remove a lot of the dialogue and descriptions from the book and still tell the same story. This does not mean that the original words were not important. In books, some details are repeated to help the reader remember the characters. For example, we might see ""he said"" many times, but this helps us know who is talking. In plays, the dialogue often sounds like real conversations, but sometimes it can be confusing.

**Watching Movies**

When we watch movies, we can feel like we are part of the story. It is a fun escape from real life, but when the movie ends, we return to reality. Some people think movies are just entertainment and not real art. Many older people, like our parents and teachers, enjoyed movies but did not see them as art.

**The Film Studios**

The Leiper Film Company studios had many different buildings. It was hard to find your way around because there were many small rooms that looked the same. There were three main entrances, but none of them helped you find your way easily. Most people who worked there knew how to get around, but it could be confusing for visitors. The workers created stories of romance and adventure for people to enjoy.

**Film-makers**

Many people want to make movies. There are many books and classes about how to write scripts and make films. Some competitions even give away cameras to help new filmmakers. Robert Rodriguez made a famous film called El Mariachi for only $7,000. He became a well-known director quickly. In the past, filmmakers had to work for a long time before making their first movie. They learned by working as editors or writers. For example, John Huston was 35 when he made his first film. Today, many new filmmakers have to work alone without big studios to help them."

In the past, there were many council houses on the west side of the city. These houses were small and not very nice, made of orange brick or white plaster. In summer, there was a bad smell from a factory nearby. In the morning, a paperboy often looked unhappy as he walked to deliver papers. I do not remember much from my early life, but I have a memory of sitting by a window and looking at the houses far away. 

I remember my mother. She was small and often angry. I did not understand why she was angry, so I could not make her feel better. Even as a child, I noticed that she was very lonely, even in a room full of people. She cared a lot about behaving properly, which was not common in our neighborhood. Sometimes, she would clean the house a lot or tell me to ""behave properly."" I did not understand her rules. For example, I could not go into our neighbors' gardens or disturb their flowers. I had to sit quietly at the dinner table and listen to the radio shows my mother liked. There were many rules I had to follow.

My mother had some friends. There was Mrs. Buddery, who loved the Royal Family, Mrs. Winall, who did not say much, and Mrs. Laband, who was more lively. I later realized that they were not very good company. They often talked about their problems, like bad legs and cold weather. I sometimes felt like I was one of the children they complained about.

Looking back, it felt like a heavy weight was on me, made of the houses, my mother, and her rules. I felt I had to grow up quickly and get away from it. Growing up in West Earlham was very structured. Until I was five, I stayed at home. I remember long days playing on the floor while my mother sat in a chair. After my fifth birthday, I went to Avenue Road infants school, which was half a mile away. Some lucky kids had mothers with bikes to take them. My mother usually let other kids take care of me on the way to school.

I remember the summer holidays. During these days, I saw a little of the world outside West Earlham. There was an old man next door who told stories about his time at sea. Once, there was a charity event where a kind woman gave out lemonade and talked about helping others. My mother did not like this and said the people just wanted money. She often talked about how people were greedy, especially politicians. 

My mother did not show much kindness. However, she did care about my education. Sometimes, she took me to the Norwich Castle Museum on Sundays. We would look at paintings together. My mother did not mind this, and she even started to have opinions about the art. I remember one time she saw a painting of a Roman soldier and said, ""I wouldn't want to meet him at night!"" This was one of the few times she tried to make a joke.

CPE_10,"**Text: Philadelphia Avenue**

I walked down Philadelphia Avenue on the odd side of the street. It was getting dark, and the air was humid with a light drizzle. I knew this side of the street very well. Our neighbors were the Matzes and the Pritchards, and there was Han Kieffer's grocery store. The Krings and the Pottses lived nearby, and they were my first friends, all girls. 

The houses on this street were different. I remembered the little troughs in the cement that helped rainwater go from the roofs to the street. I used to ride my roller skates and scooter there. As the street went down, the houses looked simpler. The porches were lower, and the front yards were smaller. 

Over the years, things changed. Wooden porch railings were replaced with iron ones. Some houses I remembered as homes became stores, and some stores became homes again. I wondered how people lived in those spaces. 

Rick Gilbert is a furniture designer. He lives in a flat that used to be a curtain warehouse. His flat has big doors and exposed brick walls. But he did not want an empty space. He wanted to separate his living area from his work area. He used a big piece of plastic to create a hallway and hide his office. He wanted his kitchen to be a place where he could cook for friends or make coffee for clients. 

Bruce Chatwin was a writer who loved to travel. His life was full of secrets and stories. His first book, *In Patagonia*, came out in 1977. It was a special travel book that changed how people wrote about travel. He mixed real facts with stories to make them more interesting. He believed that traveling could help people discover new histories.

**Swimming**

One summer day, it rained heavily. I ran across the lawn behind my house and jumped into the pool. I swam back and forth, with my eyes just above the water. Each raindrop made little splashes that turned into bubbles. The best part was when the rain got stronger, and the sound of birds disappeared. 

During this summer in 1996, I thought about swimming across Britain. I wanted to follow the rain as it traveled to the sea. I wanted to escape from my usual routine. Many places today have signs and labels, but walking, cycling, and swimming let us explore the world in a different way. They help us remember the wild and old parts of nature. A swimming journey would let me see the mysterious parts of our world."
CPE_67,"**Text: 'CRYING'**

Charles Darwin thought that crying did not have a clear purpose. He was likely wrong. Scientists now say that crying is important for social reasons. Psychiatrist John Bowlby showed that crying helps create a bond between a mother and her child. Many people believe that children cry because they feel helpless. 

It is harder to understand why adults cry. The sound of crying is not as important as what we see when someone cries. In early human groups, crying may have helped people trust each other and feel close. 

People cry for different reasons. We may cry to show sympathy for someone who is suffering. Sometimes, we cry without meaning to when we hear beautiful music or moving speeches. We might also cry when we watch a sad movie, and this happens more often when we are with others than when we are alone. Crying has a social purpose, and research is still ongoing."
CPE_27,"**Text: The Heat is On**

We all know about global warming. But how much warmer will the Earth get? How will it change our lives? Many people have some idea about global warming, but not everyone knows what will happen because of it. A warmer climate will change the weather in many places around the world. 

The atmosphere is connected to everything on Earth. Changes in the climate will affect plants, animals, water, and soil. Humans use these natural resources to grow food, build cities, and support billions of people. If these resources change, it is a serious problem. 

We do not know exactly how the world will change or what is causing these changes. Over the last 100 years, human actions have increased gases in the atmosphere. These gases are linked to global temperature. Scientists believe that these gases are already affecting the climate. 

Research shows that the Earth has warmed by about 6°C in the last century. Most scientists think this warming is not natural and is partly caused by human pollution. Scientists use special computer programs to predict what will happen with higher global temperatures. These programs help them understand how temperature, pressure, and sunlight affect the climate. However, these predictions are not always accurate.

Most people agree that climate change will happen faster than before. Predictions suggest that by the year 2100, the average global temperature will rise by 1°C to 3.5°C. Sea levels will also rise by 15 to 95 cm. There will be more extreme weather, like heatwaves, floods, and droughts. 

These changes will affect the environment and humans. Climate change can change where forests and grasslands are located and how many species live there. It can also affect food production, water supply, and where people live. Some changes may be bad, but some may be good. 

For example, in Australia, wheat production has increased because of warmer temperatures. Warmer weather means fewer frosts, which helps crops grow better. But small changes in climate can also cause water shortages, especially in dry areas. 

In some places, like the Mediterranean, there has been less rain in recent years. This can lead to problems with water supply. Changes in ice in the Arctic can also affect wildlife and human life. 

One of the biggest effects of global warming is rising sea levels. Warmer water takes up more space, and melting ice adds to this. Many people live in coastal areas, so rising sea levels can cause flooding. Cities like London, New York, and Tokyo could be affected. 

Many people could lose their homes and jobs because of this. Small island countries could disappear if sea levels rise too much. This would be a disaster for the people living there and for other countries that would have to help them."

Art is important to people, but sometimes it is hard to understand. Many people think of art as just a building, a book, a painting, or a statue. However, art is more than just these things. It is about how we feel and experience them. 

When art is very famous, people often forget how it connects to real life. They see it as something special and separate. This makes it hard to understand what art really means. Art should not be cut off from everyday life. It is important to connect art with our daily experiences and feelings.

To understand art better, we sometimes need to look away from it for a moment. We should think about the simple things in life that make us happy. For example, we can enjoy flowers without knowing much about how they grow. But if we want to understand how flowers bloom, we need to learn about soil, air, water, and sunlight.

Many people enjoy things like movies, music, and comics, but they do not always think of these as art. When people think of art as only what is in museums, they miss out on the joy of everyday experiences. The best appreciation of art happens when it is connected to our daily lives and activities.

Lions are big cats that live in groups. People often think that lions work together very well when they hunt for food. They move quietly and surround their prey. Lions seem to be friendly animals that help each other to find food. 

But after watching lions for many years, we learned that they are not always like this. We started our study in 1978. We wanted to know why lions hunt together, take care of their young, and scare away other animals with their loud roars. 

If we look at how animals survive, we see that sometimes helping others can be a problem. If one lion helps too much, it may not get enough food for itself. So, why do lions help each other? We thought we would find the answer in two or three years. But lions are very good at resting and doing nothing. 

It took us a long time to learn about their behavior. Lions can live up to 18 years, so we are only now starting to understand their actions.

CPE_39,"**Simplified Text: Advertising on Trial**

If you work in advertising, the early 1990s were very hard. There was a big recession. This means that many businesses were not doing well. In Britain, in 1991, the economy got worse. Many people lost their jobs, and many homes were taken away because people could not pay for them. All businesses were affected. Some businesses, like car and building companies, lost a lot of money.

People in advertising also lost their jobs, but those who kept their jobs felt a lot of pressure. They had to work harder with less money. They were told to do more with less. At the same time, companies started to understand that they needed to make products that customers wanted, not just what was easy for them to make. 

Because of this, marketing became more important. More companies started to pay attention to marketing. They learned more about it, and some brands began to market themselves better. This made marketing people more important, but it also made their jobs harder. 

In the 1980s, advertising was very good. But in the early 1990s, it was very bad. This was partly because of the economy. Companies looked closely at how much they were spending on advertising. They wanted to know if it was worth the money. Many companies were not sure if advertising helped them make money.

Companies wanted better advertising. They wanted better ideas and better ways to reach customers. They wanted the best people in advertising to work for them and to do great work.

Even though advertising is a tough business, many people still have to find ways to do more with less money. There are many reasons why making good advertising is hard. Some of these reasons are because of the recession, like high production costs and fear of taking risks. Other reasons are changes in society, like new shopping habits and new laws about advertising.

Now, more than ever, companies need to make sure their advertising works. But it is hard to find help to do this. Many companies and advertising agencies are too busy to talk about their problems. Those that are doing well often keep their success a secret. This means that while some events may help, many books and resources about advertising do not give good advice. They often make it seem like all advertising is great, which is not true."
CPE_18,"**The Kitchen**

When I was in university, I wanted to be a chef. This was not a common choice. Many of my friends wanted different jobs. Being a chef is hard work. Chefs work long hours, and the job can be stressful and not well paid. But I still wanted to be a chef. I was not happy at university. The work was difficult, and the social life was not good. Being a chef seemed like a good escape from my university life. It felt serious and honest.

My wish to cook was not just because I was a student. I also loved the beauty of food. I first saw this when I ate at a famous restaurant in London. The meal was amazing. I remember my first dish very well. After that meal, I wanted to learn how to cook. I changed my student life to prepare for being a chef. My history degree felt unimportant. I learned to cook by reading cookbooks, visiting markets, and making special meals.

**The Swimming Instructor**

The swimming teacher was a small man with strong muscles and tattoos. When I asked him to teach me how to dive, he told me to sit on the edge of the pool, put my hands above my head, and roll forward. I practiced this until my time was up. The next time, he made me stand up and dive off the edge. He was strict. Every time I came up from the water, he told me what to do: ""Don't look down, look up!"" ""Keep your legs straight."" ""Point your toes!""

The next week, I went to the high diving board. It was very high, and I was scared. I stood there, trying to be brave. I waved my arms like I was taught, looked up, and jumped. For a moment, I felt like I was flying. But when I hit the water, I fell awkwardly, and my legs were everywhere. The instructor looked at me with disappointment. But I still felt very happy. I thought, ""This is what they mean by 'free as a bird.'""

**The Traveller**

For people who like comfort, like a nice bed and clean water, the traveller seems strange. Some people choose to take risks. They climb dangerous mountains, sail alone on the ocean, and eat insects if they have to. They can live for months in unknown places. Some people think these travellers are odd. They are different from us, and we can ignore them. We can be happy in our own lives, using microwaves and phones, and feel safe from danger.

**Sailing**

Jonathan Raban is afraid of the sea, but he spends a lot of time on it. He is not a world-class sailor, but he can sail well. He likes to write about sailing. His small boat has a device that tells him where he is on the earth. He likes this device, but he also thinks that using a compass was a mistake. He believes that since the compass was invented, sailors do not pay attention to the sea anymore. The ocean is now just a space to cross. Because of this, a machine can steer the boat instead of a person. This is why Raban has time to look closely at the waves."
CPE_62,"**Simplified Text: Holiday Reading**

Summer gives us two great joys: leaving home and reading books. These joys are connected. Books can help us feel at home in the world. We can see our own experiences in the stories of others. In books, we find our thoughts and feelings. Authors use words to describe feelings we thought we were alone in. They can express our thoughts clearly, which helps us understand ourselves better. 

When we read or travel, we can escape our daily routines. In a new place, we notice many things. We see the colors of the sky, the changes in a person's face, or feelings we didn’t know we had. 

**Author's Note**

These travel stories were published in the Observer newspaper over seven years. I made some small changes to fit the pages, but I did not change much. I corrected a few mistakes, but I wanted to keep the original feeling of the stories. 

Traveling has changed a lot. Now, many people can travel anywhere with just a ticket. I believe that travelers are not blind to the world around them. Even a postcard can have a purpose.

**Ecotourism**

If there were awards for tourism words that have been misused, ""ecotourism"" would win. This word started in the early 1980s when people became more aware of the environment. Tour operators saw that many travelers wanted to travel without harming the places they visited. Now, ""ecotourism"" can mean many things, from living with remote tribes to a short boat trip in Australia. Any tour that includes nature, wildlife, or adventure can be called ecotourism. The original idea was good, but now it is confusing because there are no clear rules.

**Transylvanian Journey**

I lost my notebook about my trip to Transylvania for 50 years. I found it again a few years ago. It helped me remember that time, but it was not perfect. In Transylvania, I had a great time, staying in friendly homes for weeks. When I stayed in one place for a long time, I forgot to write. I thought there was nothing to record. When I moved on, I was slow to start writing again. I worried that some details were out of order, but I decided it was okay. I let the story tell itself without too many worries."
CPE_49,"**Text: Fashion and Writing**

**Fashion**  
Fashion is often seen as something new, but it has a long history. Many people think fashion started in the 16th and 17th centuries when trade grew. As societies grew and changed, the way people dress also changed. This makes it hard to say what clothes really mean. For example, a man's suit can mean different things to different people.

**Writing**  
Many people think that all writers are famous and make a lot of money. But this is not true for most writers. Many writers have other jobs to pay their bills. Some write in the evenings after their full-time jobs. Others, like me, do different small jobs, like teaching or writing articles. I have heard of a job writing for a chocolate factory, but I have not found one like that. Still, I manage to write my novel by working part-time and getting help from friends.

**Sudden Fame**  
When we started performing in small places, many fans came to see us. We had to use secret doors to avoid being crowded by fans. On our days off, it was hard to go outside without being followed. In just a few days, we became famous. Our fans watched us closely, and our managers took care of us. Even though I was shy, I felt a strange confidence. I was not used to this new life and felt very different."
CPE_31,"**Text: Music - The Future of Music**

Technology is changing our lives. Susan Hallam talks about how this affects music in Britain. In the late 20th century, people had more ways to listen to music. They could use radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, and videos. But, fewer people are playing live music, and there are fewer jobs for musicians.

Many people believe that music will always be important. Music is part of big events in the country. It also gives people chances to enjoy many activities. A world without music is hard to imagine. The question is not if there will be music in the 21st century, but what kind of music it will be. It is also important to think about whether people will still want to learn to play instruments.

I think people will still want to learn. The music industry makes a lot of money in Britain. Musical skills are important for many jobs, especially in media. Playing an instrument can help children learn better. Research in the USA shows that making music can help with thinking skills. In Europe, group music lessons help children make friends and focus better in school.

Playing an instrument can also help people develop good habits. For example, practicing can help with studying, and playing in concerts can teach people to be on time and organized. Because of this, more people will want to learn instruments in the near future.

What about the future? I think two things will happen. First, people will listen to many different kinds of music. New styles will mix together. Second, technology will be used more to create and play music. This will make it easier for people to make music, but it may also mean fewer live performances.

More people of all ages will want to make music together in their communities. If this happens, music teachers will need to change how they teach. They will need to help more people learn different instruments throughout their lives. This means music lessons will need to change to be relevant for more people.

Teachers will need to learn new skills to teach and inspire students of all ages. They will also need to work well with different groups and learn how to manage community music projects. This is a big change from how things are done now, but it is a good chance to show how good music education can be.

Finally, we need to make music more important in our lives. Music is very important, but sometimes people forget this. Everyone in the music world needs to work together to make sure music is valued."
CPE_58,"**The Actor's Craft**

Sometimes, people do not like actors. This is often because actors talk about their work in interviews. They should remember what the dancer Pavlova said when someone asked her about her dancing: ""If I could tell you, I wouldn't dance it."" Instead, actors often use boring phrases or talk about gossip. 

Paul Scofield wrote to a friend: ""An actor's work is interesting only when they perform. Talking about it makes it less real. There are no rules for acting, except maybe to be heard. Every time an actor performs, they start fresh and learn about the characters and the story. After a play, they feel empty until the next one.""

**A Review of Hamlet**

Adrian Lester plays Hamlet, a character between being a boy and a man. His performance is simple but strong. He understands the text and controls his body and mind well. He plays a young man with hidden anger, and he is both funny and serious. His performance is very skilled. 

You can see how Lester's body moves, waiting to act. Another actor, Handy, plays Horatio in a way that shows he is moved by something inside him. 

**What is Acting?**

What is acting? Is it copying real behavior or showing feelings? What makes actors move? This is an important question in theatre.

**One Director's Rehearsal Process**

This director has a special way to start rehearsals called ""dropping in."" The stage manager shows the script on a screen. The actors listen quietly. When it is their turn to speak, they look at the screen, think about the words, and find the reason to speak. For example, if the line is, ""Queuing all night, the rain, do you remember?"" they take a breath and think of a memory. 

Actors should not plan too much. They should trust that something will happen when they act.

**The Perfect Theatre**

The perfect theatre makes you feel important. Going to the theatre is special, and the staff should feel this too. It is not nice if the staff act like it is just a job. The theatre should connect the actors and the audience. The audience should be close enough to hear and see everything.

The size of the theatre is important. It should fit the human voice and body. If the theatre is too big, it feels wrong because drama is about people. Many theatres from the late 1800s were good because they made the audience feel close to the stage. 

I like theatres that feel old, like churches with worn steps. They have a sense of history. 

When you go to the theatre, you want to see something new and surprising. If not, you might as well stay home."

**Paul Simon**  
Rock and roll in the 1950s was mainly for young people, but it was also very important for older people. It helped create new rock stars who listened to this exciting music. Paul Simon, like many young people in the US, heard this new music on Alan Freed's radio show called Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party. This show was very popular and many young musicians listened to it. Paul Simon was very interested in the music and wanted to make his own songs.

**Snow**  
I could not see a path, but I thought I would be okay if I was careful. The wind was strong and pushed me over as I walked on the slippery ice. Suddenly, the snow under me broke, and I fell into a hole that was about four feet deep. The snow had covered a space between two rocks. I climbed out, feeling scared and shaken. I wondered what would happen if the hole was much deeper. I sat against a pine tree that was sticking out of the snow to think. In one hour, I had walked about half a mile. I realized I had to change my plan.

**Qualitative Research**  
There are many books that help researchers with qualitative research. These books talk a lot about collecting data, but they often do not explain how to analyze the data. Many people find it hard to understand how researchers analyze their data. To help with this, we asked different social scientists who have done qualitative research to talk about their methods. We wanted to share their experiences and understanding of analyzing qualitative data. This is not a guidebook, but a way to explain the process better. We found it is not easy to do this. So, we let our contributors share their work in different styles, including personal stories and more formal writing."

**Screen Learning**  
A few days ago, I saw my six-year-old son eating noodles in a funny way. He was pulling them up with his teeth and pretending to be a dinosaur. ""I'm a little dinosaur,"" he said. He was acting out a scene from a TV show. I asked him what he remembered about dinosaurs, but he did not remember much. Many people like to use the internet and computers for learning, but is this a good way to learn? One writer talked about using an interactive program with his son. The father read the words while the son played with the pictures. The father thought that if his son had spent ten minutes reading a book, he might have learned something. Research shows that learning happens best when there is talking with teachers or parents. It is good to use new technology to teach our children, but traditional education is still very important.

**Hollywood**  
By 1918, most of the world's movie-making was in Hollywood. People who lived there did not like this change. They thought Hollywood was becoming a place for rude people. But in the end, they accepted it because success is important. Hollywood knows a good movie when it sees one. In less than a hundred years, Hollywood has changed from a small village to a famous town, like New York or Paris. A long time ago, you would walk through orange trees to get to the store. Now, it is still a small place where everyone talks about movies: how much money they make, who is dating who, and who is working on what project. Many successful people try to leave Hollywood to live somewhere else, but it is still the main place for anyone in show business.

**Photography**  
Photography was created by artists in the 1800s. They wanted to make a lasting record of what they saw. The new tools they used made pictures that were better and more detailed than paintings. This surprised other artists. Some art critics said photography could not be art because it depended on machines. But photographers knew they had found a new way to express themselves. They used photography like other artists use paint and pencils to show the world and their ideas.

**Book Illustration**  
In the past, every children's book had pictures. This was also true for many novels for older children. There were many children's books, but most were made with a small budget, which meant some were not very good. However, the best artists always did their best work. The collection of black-and-white illustrations is a mix of good and not-so-good work. It is a great place for research and finding interesting things. Some of the best illustrations will be shown to the public again, either through new books or exhibitions. There are signs that this is starting to happen, and soon, a publisher will likely create a series of classic children's book illustrations from this time."
CPE_68,"**Text: Blogging: Sharing Online**

A while ago, a website talked about the risks of telling people where you are online. The website said that when you say, ""I am here,"" you are also showing your location to many people, not all of whom you may want to see. This shows that sharing a lot online can have problems.

The internet gives us many chances to share our lives with many people. We can share our stories, photos, and feelings. But sometimes, we can feel lost in all this sharing. It can be hard to know what to share and what to keep private.

In the early days of the internet, some people, called bloggers, shared their lives online. They learned about the good and bad sides of sharing. One of the first bloggers was Justin Hall. In January 1994, he started sharing his life on the web. He wrote about everything and shared many photos. People liked to read his blog.

One day, Justin wrote about falling in love. But when he shared this on his blog, his girlfriend told him to choose: either the blog goes, or she does. He chose to stop the blog because he felt it made people not trust him.

Another blogger, Heather Armstrong, wrote a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job. One day, a coworker sent her blog link to her bosses, and she lost her job. This shows that what we say online can have real-life effects. 

Heather took a break from blogging but later got married and started a new blog about her family. Now, she is very popular and makes money from her writing. 

The lesson is that the internet lets us say many things, but we should think carefully about what we share."
CPE_23,"**Text: Enough Sleep?**

Many people today feel tired. In busy countries, not getting enough sleep and feeling anxious are common. In the USA, 40 million people have trouble sleeping. Some popular books in Britain have characters who cannot sleep or are about sleep studies. 

A sleep expert says, ""People need more sleep."" When people are busy, they sleep less. They wake up early to avoid traffic. One researcher did an experiment. He let people sleep for 14 hours a night for a month. After three weeks, they slept about 8 hours a night. This shows they needed more sleep.

In Europe, a university in the English Midlands studies sleep. They look at how tiredness affects sailors, how noise at airports disturbs sleep, and how tired drivers can be dangerous. They ask students to help with their research. Students are paid £5 an hour and change their sleep patterns.

Dr. Louise Reyner helps the students feel better. Some are worried because they wear sensors on their heads. But the researchers are more interested in how the body works. In a dark room, there is a driving simulator. The students come at 2 PM, a time when people often feel sleepy. They drive while answering questions. 

One student tries hard not to fall asleep. At first, he sits up straight, but then he starts to blink more and more. Soon, he nods off, and the car goes off the road. Dr. Reyner says that drinking coffee can help. Two cups can make someone a safe driver for a while. She suggests energy drinks and gum for alertness.

Scientists know that humans sleep in cycles. When we sleep, we go through four stages, from light sleep to deep sleep. We dream during light sleep, and our bodies are safe from injury. Scientists think sleep helps repair our bodies, but they are not sure how. 

Women usually sleep about half an hour longer than men, and older people need less sleep. Some researchers say, ""Sleep is a way to travel through time safely."" 

In the past, people slept differently. A history professor studied sleep in Britain from 1500 to 1850. People went to bed early, woke up after midnight, and then went back to sleep. This time was for thinking, remembering dreams, or even stealing. 

By the 17th century, with more light, rich people changed their sleep habits. The industrial revolution made people work longer hours. In some places, people still do not have set bedtimes. They sleep for a few hours, wake up, and then sleep again. In some tribes, noise and the need to watch for danger make it hard to sleep all night. It seems that people everywhere need more sleep."
CPE_60,"**Simplified Text:**

I am talking about big cowboy boots. I stood in my very expensive cowboy boots in the Arizona desert. I wore a cowboy outfit, but I was not a cowboy. I looked at the mountains and felt out of place. I flew in from Denver early in the morning. I thought I looked like a cowboy, but then I saw a real cowboy at the airport. He was dirty and looked at my new boots with a raised eyebrow. 

I used to be a racing driver. I loved it and I was very good at it. But now I do not race anymore. I wondered what I should do now. A racing driver should have other jobs ready for when he stops racing. I thought I had some ideas, but they did not work out. 

I thought about being a commentator for races, but many other drivers wanted that job too. I also thought about selling classic cars, but that did not work because nobody wanted to buy them. 

Being an ""ex"" racing driver is hard. Nobody wants to hear about my past. Even if I was a champion, people would not want to listen for long. I had a good time racing and made money, but I miss the excitement of driving fast cars. I miss the people who cared about what I said. 

Now, I have a lot of free time. I looked at the blue sky and saw some small birds. They seemed to tell me to leave their nest alone. I did not know there were songbirds in the desert. I realized that I, a fake cowboy in fancy boots, had a lot to learn."
CPE_1,"**Text: Vancouver**

In the last ten years, many people from all over the world have moved to Vancouver, in western Canada. In the evening, people walk in the city streets. If you walk with them, you will hear many different languages. People come to Vancouver for its nice weather, beautiful views of the ocean and mountains, clean and safe places, and good schools and jobs. Some people do not like how fast new buildings are being built, but new people and tourists have helped the city grow. 

People used to call Vancouver 'Terminal City' because it was a place to go to other places. Now, Vancouver is still a gateway to many places.

**Putting Pen to Paper**

Journalists like me are not good at writing letters. Some say this is because we do not want to write for free. I think it is because we always want our writing to be very good, so we find it hard to write letters. A real artist can write freely, even if they change their work many times. I think the best artists understand how their words affect people. When Shakespeare wrote his famous lines, he did not think about how to make them great. 

**Supermarket Opening**

Opening a new supermarket used to be a big event in Britain. A famous person would come to cut the ribbon. Now, new supermarkets open every day, and famous people are not needed. Last week, people waiting to enter the new Superbuy did not care who opened it. They just wanted to be first. A customer said the first five men to enter would get a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women would get flowers. This news made people at the front feel happy and made those who came later feel jealous."
CPE_53,"**Text: Citizen Kane**

The film *Citizen Kane* came out in 1941. Many people talked about it when it was released. Some people were afraid of what William Randolph Hearst, the man the film is about, might do to them. The film got good reviews, but it did not make a lot of money. Later, it became popular again on television. Many people say this film made them want to be filmmakers. This is surprising because it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles said that the film was successful because he did not know what he could or could not do. He just made the film his way. He had a great team with him, including cameraman Gregg Toland and screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz. When Welles and Mankiewicz decided to tell the story of a newspaper owner who was like Hearst, Welles knew he had a great chance to be both the director and the actor. He worked very hard on it.

**Dermot and Carmel**

Dermot thought Carmel was a bit strange that morning. He said twice that he might be late and that he might stop at the golf club on the way home. He wanted to talk to someone, and that was a good place to do it. Carmel nodded her head but seemed like she did not really hear him. ""Will you be okay? What will you do today?"" he asked. She smiled and said, ""Funny you ask. I have nothing to do today, so I will walk downtown and look at the shops. I feel like it is a little wrong to waste the day."" Dermot smiled back and said, ""You should enjoy yourself. If I am late, I won’t want to eat. So don’t worry about it."" ""No, that’s fine,"" she replied.

**Title Race**

""Tea boy? Do you mind? I am a mobile beverage helper."" People often find job titles funny. A recent study showed that job titles can make people unhappy at work. A survey found that 90% of bosses and 70% of workers think titles create problems between coworkers. Most surprisingly, 70% of office workers said they would give up a pay raise for a better job title. If people care so much about titles, it shows that they want to feel important. In the early 21st century, nobody wants to be called ""subordinate."" The titles people want sound nice (like specialist or coordinator), but they often mean the same thing."
CPE_55,"**The Vienna Assignment**

I was in Vienna to take photographs. This was usually why I was anywhere. Photographs were not just my job; they were part of my life. I loved how light fell on things. A single picture could show the beauty of a place or a person. I always hoped to take the perfect photograph. I had my camera ready and kept looking for good moments. 

Once, I took a picture of smoke from a burning oil well. It became very popular, and many newspapers wanted it. It was just luck. After that, I worked for myself, which was a good idea, but life had some surprises. The mid-nineties were not as successful as I thought they would be. That is why I was in Vienna instead of a more exciting place. But I was still taking photographs, and I was getting paid. 

I got this job by chance. I had taken pictures in London for a book called ""Four Cities in Four Seasons."" I took photos of London in spring, summer, autumn, and winter. I showed flowers in Hyde Park and busy streets in Piccadilly. But I knew that many of my best pictures would not be used. It was just a picture book, not something to make people think deeply. 

After Christmas, I sent my winter photos and learned that the Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, had left the job in Vienna. Instead of finding someone new, they asked me to take his place. The publishers liked my work, and I was free to go. I was happy to leave because things were not good at home. A week in snowy Vienna sounded great. 

They put me in a hotel in the old city. I had been to Vienna before with my wife, but it was a busy trip, and I did not take many photos. This time, I was alone in January, and I knew it would be different. When I arrived, I saw the beautiful light over the snowy roofs of the city. I was excited to take great pictures.

On the first day, I did not take any photos. I rode the trams around the city, enjoying the atmosphere. The weather was cold, like the old buildings around me. I did not want to see what Schussner had done before. This was going to be my Vienna, and I wanted to discover it myself.

A photograph is a moment in time. You have to wait for the right moment. So, I looked and waited until I was ready. The next morning, I went out early. The snow made Stephansplatz look beautiful and quiet. I wanted to take a picture of the big cathedral, but it was hard to capture it all in one shot. It was tall and wide, and I knew I would have to focus on just part of it. 

In that weather, it could still be magical. Photography has always felt magical. Even when you know how it works, it still feels mysterious. You can watch a blank piece of paper turn into a photograph in a dark room. That feeling stays with you forever. Maybe that is why what happened at Stephansplatz that morning did not surprise me."

**Kinetic Art**

Good news! The Hayward Gallery in London has changed. It is now a place full of interesting things. This change is not because of a big, expensive show, but because of a special exhibition about kinetic art. Kinetic art is art that moves or shows movement. This exhibition looks at the history of kinetic art in the 20th century. It shows that making art that moves or talks about movement has been an important part of art for many years. 

The exhibition has many paintings, drawings, documents, and films about kinetic art. The curator, Guy Brett, has studied this art for a long time. There are not many texts explaining the art, so visitors can enjoy looking and discovering things on their own.

**David Hockney**

David Hockney is a popular artist. Many people like his work, even if they do not usually like art. People may like his art because it shows real things and is easy to understand. His art often shows fun and relaxing moments, which helps people escape from their daily lives. Some people may even like Hockney because of his fun personality and clever words in interviews. 

Some critics say Hockney is not a great artist. But others think he is good because he is popular. Hockney knows his art is not for everyone, and he does not say he is a great artist. He believes that only time will tell how good his art really is.

**Window-shopping - an Art Exhibition**

In the last few years, I have seen many art exhibitions. Some are great, and some are not so good. I often feel frustrated when exhibitions seem to have a hidden message or idea. Sometimes this works, and we learn about new trends in art. But often, it feels forced or not real. 

So, I decided to create a different kind of exhibition. I worked with seven artists in an empty warehouse. The exhibition was called ""Window-shopping."" It showed different artworks that were connected only because they were all art. 

For example, Sam Cole made knitted cats that chased each other on a toy train track. Matthew Crawley made a video of him opening a camera and breaking it. These artworks do not fit into a specific theme, but they can be together. They do not bother each other and can even help each other look better.

**Art History**

Some people love paintings but are afraid to think too much about them. They worry that thinking will ruin their enjoyment. Some art historians focus on theory and forget the joy of looking at art. This is like knowing how to cook a dish but not enjoying the taste. 

Enjoying art is important, but knowing more about it can also make it more enjoyable. What we like about art can change over time and is influenced by the society we live in. While it is important to feel and enjoy art, thinking about it is also valuable."
CPE_25,"**Text: Metals and St Ives**

**Metals**  
A long time ago, people in the Stone Age liked shiny things. One day, a person sat by a river and found a shiny yellow stone. This stone was gold. It was not like other stones; it was soft and pretty. People wanted gold. They also found copper, maybe by accident. When they saw that copper could make strong tools, they looked for more copper. This is how people started to work with metals.

**St Ives**  
We walked down a narrow, bumpy road to the town of St Ives. The wind was very strong, and waves hit the shore. There were no people outside, and all the windows were closed. We saw the weather get worse as we arrived on a small train. The dark clouds made me think that coming to Cornwall without a car was not a good idea. I had told my friend we would walk by the beautiful coast and enjoy warm evenings by the fire.

**Computer Modelling**  
Studying the past is hard because it is gone. The people who lived long ago are not here anymore. We cannot see what they did or how they lived. Archaeology gives us some clues, but we cannot test our ideas on people from the past. However, we can use computer modelling. This means we can create pictures of old places and make virtual people who act like real humans. We can change things, like the weather or the number of people, and see how they would react."

**Vervet Monkeys**  
Cheney and Seyfarth studied vervet monkeys. One day, the main male monkey saw a strange male monkey nearby. The strange monkey wanted to join their group. If he did, the main male might lose his place. To keep the strange monkey away, the main male made an alarm call that sounds like a warning for a leopard. The strange monkey ran back to the trees. This happened many times. But then, the main male made a mistake. He called out the alarm while walking across the ground. 

**What Cats Catch**  
In a small village in England called Felmersham, people counted what their cats caught. In one year, seventy cats caught over 1,000 animals. A professor in America thought that all the cats in Britain might kill 100 million birds and small animals each year! But this is not true. Most cats live in towns and catch fewer animals than the cats in the village. The important question is: can the bird population survive? Yes, it can. In winter, many people feed birds, and there are many places for birds to nest. The survey showed that cats do catch many animals, but they are not destroying the bird population in Britain.

**Buffalo's Day**  
Buffaloes are very important to the marshman. Every morning, the buffaloes leave their sleeping place and slowly walk to the water. They make sad sounds as they go. They stand at the edge for a long time until the leader goes into the water. Once in the water, they seem tired and forget what they were doing. They stay in the water, making low sounds for many minutes. Finally, they swim away, looking very tired. They spend the day in the reeds, eating green plants.

**Picasso, Pablo**  
In 1940, Picasso painted fish while he was in a fishing town called Royan. The painting shows a fishmonger’s table with a crab and some soles. The fish look alive. The painting is hard to read because Picasso used a flat pattern with see-through shapes. The colors are calm, making it look like an underwater scene. But there is a feeling of danger because the fish seem to be fighting the crab. The sharp shapes in the painting add to this feeling."
CPE_12,"**Text: Photography**

Photography is a way to take pictures of life and activities. It has been around for about 150 years. Photography helps us see moments in time and different places. It shows us images from faraway places and important events in our lives. 

Before photography, people made pictures a long time ago. The first pictures were cave paintings from about 35,000 years ago. We do not know exactly why people made these paintings. They might have shown hunting, been used for magic, or been for religious reasons. Pictures have always been a part of human culture.

When photography was invented in the mid-1800s, it was very important. People thought it could show the truth. The camera works like our eyes and can take a fixed image. This image looks very much like what we see in real life. 

Some people believed that everyone could understand photographs. For example, a photographer named August Sander said that even a person living far away could understand a picture of the sky. But as the world changed, we began to wonder if everyone really understands photographs the same way.

Photography is often seen as a strong way to show reality. When someone shows a picture and says, ""This is my grandson,"" it feels very natural. Since photography was invented in 1839, it has changed a lot. 

At first, photographs were used to keep memories. Now, they are also important historical documents. They tell us about the people and society that made them. Photography can also help bring about social and political change. For example, during the Italian Renaissance, new ways of seeing changed art. Today, photography is a big part of our media culture and shows us the real world."
CPE_26,"**How to Write Poetry**

Writing poetry is like walking in a dangerous place. You can be free and creative, but one wrong move can cause problems. It is hard to give advice about writing poetry. For someone who is just starting, the best way to learn is to read a lot, write a lot, and let your imagination go. Some people need to feel safe before they can write a poem. Others write when they are sad. Some people write on a schedule, while others wait for a good idea. All ways are okay, as long as you find your own style. It is important to listen to your inner voice and let it grow. One day, it will be strong enough to stand on its own.

**The Short Story**

In a short story, there should not be too many characters or long descriptions. Flashbacks should be quick and only used when necessary. A memory in the main character's mind can help move the story forward, but it should not slow down the action. Dialogue is very helpful. Two people talking can show different sides of a story faster than one person explaining. Too many words can ruin a short story, but it should not be too short either. A short story needs conflict and action, just like a novel, but every word must count.

**Screenplays**

Writing a screenplay for a film is like playing chess. Chess players often make mistakes, but they learn as they play. At first, they can only see a few moves ahead. But as they practice, they start to see the whole game and understand the patterns. In chess and screenplay writing, the more you practice, the more you understand the game.

**Looking at Writing**

People naturally want to talk, as we see in young children. But writing is not natural. Charles Darwin said that language is a human instinct, but writing is not. All children learn to speak without lessons. When children do not have a language, they create their own. Writing systems were created only a few times in history. Most children did not learn to read or write in the past, and many still struggle today. Children are good at listening, but learning to write takes time and effort. We need to understand how writing works and how to help children learn it."
CPE_8,"Text: ""I am starting a book, and I feel unsure about it. I call it a novel, but I am not sure if that is the right word. I do not have a big story to tell, and there is no wedding or death at the end. I leave the reader wondering. This book is about my memories of a man I met a few times. I do not know much about his life in between our meetings. I could make up stories to fill in the gaps, but I do not want to do that. I just want to write what I know.

To protect the people in this story, I have given them made-up names. The man I am writing about is not famous. He may never be famous. When he dies, he might not be remembered at all. My book, if anyone reads it, will be interesting for what it is. But maybe the way he lives and his kind character will inspire others. After he is gone, people might realize he was special. Then, it will be clear who I am writing about, and those who want to know about his early life may find something useful in my book.

I think my book will help people who want to write about my friend. I do not say that the conversations I wrote down are exact. I did not take notes, but I remember what was important to me. I have put these conversations in my own words, but I believe they show what was said. I have also added some things that I did not hear, like historians do, to make the story more lively. I want people to enjoy reading my book.

Another reason I feel unsure is that the people I write about are from a different culture. It is hard to really know someone, and I think we can only truly know people from our own country. People are shaped by where they were born, the games they played, the food they ate, and the schools they went to. You cannot understand these things just by hearing about them; you have to live them. Because I cannot know people from another country well, it is hard to make them believable in my book.

I have mostly written about my own countrymen. If I have written about others in short stories, it is easier because you can give a few details and let the reader imagine the rest. In this book, I do not say that my characters see themselves the same way I see them; they are seen through my eyes."""
CPE_4,"**POETRY RECITALS**

Poetry recitals are events where poets read their poems to an audience. Many people today feel confused about poetry. There are many types of poetry and different ways to write and share it. Some poets write poems to be read on paper, while others like to perform their poems in front of people.

In the last twenty years, poetry readings have become more popular. Small groups in towns hold these events in places like village halls or homes. Schools and colleges invite poets to read their work to students. Arts festivals also have poetry readings with famous poets.

For poets who perform their work, public readings are very important. Their poems are often simple and easy to understand. However, poets who write more complex poems may not be appreciated by audiences who are hearing their work for the first time. These poets might choose to read their easiest poems instead of their best ones.

Listening to poetry readings is not the same as reading poetry on paper, but it can be fun and helpful. Hearing poets read their work can show the audience how to understand the poems better. It is good for the audience to have the text in front of them or to know the poems before the reading.

One reason for popular poetry readings, sometimes with music, is to help people enjoy poetry. This way, more people can see poetry as something fun and not just for a few special people."
CPE_30,"**Oral History**  
Historians often use stories from people to learn about the past. However, this can be difficult. When someone tells their story, it is not always true or complete. The person telling the story and the historian listening can change how the story is told. The historian chooses who to talk to and what to ask about. Even if the historian just listens, their presence can change the way the person remembers things. The memories can also be affected by other things, like what they see on TV or how they feel about their past. Sometimes, people remember things better because of their feelings, but these feelings might come from later experiences, not from the time they are talking about.

**Animal Science**  
There are two main ways to study animals: the physiological approach and the whole animal approach. Physiologists study how the body works, like how nerves and muscles help animals behave. The whole animal approach looks at how animals act in their natural environment. There are two types of scientists in this area: psychologists and ethologists. Psychologists often study a few types of animals, like rats and pigeons, in labs. Ethologists study animals in the wild and how they behave naturally. Both types of scientists are now working together more. Physiologists think their methods are very important, but to understand animal behavior, we also need to study it in a natural way. For example, looking at how a bird builds a nest by only studying its nerve cells would not help us understand the whole behavior.

**The Social Sciences**  
When students start studying social sciences, they have to learn two things at once. They need to understand the subject and also learn how to study it. This means they must know both the facts in their books and the methods used to find this information. The two parts are connected. We all know about social life from our daily experiences, so it may seem easy. But social sciences are more than just common sense. Each area of social science looks at different parts of society and uses special methods and ideas. These ideas help social scientists understand more than what we see every day and help to separate one area of study from another.

**Classical Architecture**  
In Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building. The Roman architect Vitruvius said that architecture is about order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, and distribution. He also used Greek words for some of these ideas. He did not include utility and function in his definition, but he did talk about how to build for different purposes later in his book. At first, he focused on the beauty of buildings. The beginnings of classical architecture are complicated. Before this, there were simple homes made of basic materials in Greece and Italy. These simple homes were not artistic, but they helped shape later architectural ideas. Even though classical temples look complex, they are based on the simple design of a single-room hut."
CPE_7,"**Simplified Text:**

Lily and her sister Mui kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for a while. Lily drove around the gardens and the train tracks. She even drove over a small bridge with all four wheels in the air! Chen found out and was happy. ""So you can really drive, Lily? Good job!"" he said. Mui thought it was strange that Chen was not upset. He was excited to make plans with Lily to go for a drive. They chose a Monday next month because it was a quiet day. They would leave early in the morning and come back by noon so they would not lose any customers. Lily would practice driving in the gardens.

Mui bought a road map, which made Chen happy. But Lily felt a bit hurt because she thought Mui did not trust her to find the way. Soon, they were at the English Channel. Lily drove very well. Even Mui, who was in the back seat, had to agree. Lily passed some slow cars, and Chen clapped for her. They drove past the gasworks and the lagoon with small boats. Lily parked in a quiet street by the sea. She was not sure about the parking signs, so she paid to park instead of risking a ticket.

Lily locked the van doors carefully. Chen joked, ""No one will want that old van."" The sisters were not happy with him. Lily told him he should be more grateful. Mui told him he was too proud. Chen took their son Man Kee to look at the sea. Man Kee was a warm and happy baby. He put his little hand on Chen's sleeve. Chen thought about how he wanted to raise Man Kee. He wanted him to learn about numbers and own many restaurants one day.

Chen looked at the sea and felt good. He saw a ship far away and used a telescope to look at it. At first, he could not find it, but then he did. It was a small, old ship. Chen lifted Man Kee to the telescope. ""Do you see the ship, Son?"" he asked. ""It is a special ship for us. It will take us back home one day."" Chen kissed Man Kee's head. Lily and Mui were behind them. Lily put her arm around Chen. 

""The little old ship,"" Chen said. ""Let your mother see, Son."" Man Kee did not want to give up the telescope. When he finally did, the view was just a bright white light. By the time Chen found another coin, the ship was gone, and Lily could only see seagulls flying around. 

**Questions:**

1. What did Lily and Mui keep a secret from Chen?
2. What day did they plan to go for a drive?
3. Why did Lily pay to park the van?
4. What did Chen want Man Kee to learn?
5. What did Chen see far away in the sea?"
CPE_43,"**THE WELL**

I read that if you go deep enough into a hole, you can see the stars when it is clear. I asked you to help me with my idea. You watched with big eyes as I pulled up the well bucket, put it on the wall, and then climbed in. I told you to let me down. I did not think about how heavy the bucket was or that you might not be strong enough to hold it. You held the handle while I pushed the bucket away from the wall. I fell into the well. I hit my head. At first, I saw strange lights. Later, I thought about how cartoon characters see stars when they hit their heads.

At first, I was confused, then scared, then relieved, and finally angry at you for letting me fall. I was also worried about what my mother would say. You called down to me, asking if I was okay. I wanted to shout, but then I heard panic in your voice, and I stopped. I lay still and watched you through my eyelashes. You went to get help. I waited a moment, then climbed back up and pulled myself over the edge. I landed on the ground. I heard loud voices from the castle. I ran away to hide in the shadows.

Mother and Father came with you and old Arthur. Mother was screaming. Father told Arthur to pull on the winch handle. You looked pale and shocked. I was hiding in the shadows, feeling excited. Then I saw drops of water on the ground from my wet clothes. I looked in horror at the dark spots on the dry stones. I looked back at the courtyard, where Father was shining a flashlight into the well. The drops sparkled in the sunlight. I could not believe no one had seen them. Mother was screaming loudly now. I felt scared. What should I do? I had played a trick on you, but now it was serious. I felt I would be punished.

I thought of a plan. I gathered my courage and came out of my hiding place. I cried out softly, then louder when no one heard me. I fell down on the stones. I sat up, feeling comforted in my mother’s arms. I said I had found a secret tunnel from the well to the moat and crawled through it to get out. I thought I was almost safe until Father came to me. He asked me to tell my story again. I hesitated. His eyes looked serious. I said the secret passage had fallen in after me and that the well was dangerous. I looked into my father's eyes, and it felt like he was seeing me for the first time. 

“Don’t be ridiculous, boy,” he said, sounding very disappointed. He stood up and walked away. Arthur looked at me with a sad face. He seemed worried about me because he knew I was lying. His look hurt me more than my father’s words. I felt ashamed and scared about what I had done."
CPE_51,"**REMOVAL DAY**

Susan is a widow. Her children are now grown up. She is leaving her family home. A van is outside. It says, ""Removers of Distinction."" Susan sees that everything in her house is being taken away. Fred, the removal man, is packing her things carefully. He is big and strong, but he is gentle with the breakable items. 

Susan's house is beautiful. It has four floors and looks over a small harbour. She remembers the years she spent there with her children. When they first bought the house, her son Robert, who was five years old, asked, ""Mum, how do you get a house home?"" Now, Robert is helping her move. He is making sure they take care of the piano. Francesca, her daughter, is also helping. She is very bossy and wants to make sure the piano is safe.

Fred, the removal man, says, ""She doesn't look like she's going to cry."" Susan asks, ""Do people cry?"" Fred replies, ""Yes, they do. They are happy while we pack, but when they see the empty room, they cry."" Susan understands this feeling. 

The piano is very special. It is in the best room of the house. They will move it last. Susan sits on the bottom stair and remembers the day they moved in. The piano was the first thing they brought in, but it got stuck on the stairs. The removal men worked hard for two hours to get it inside. Robert watched, and Francesca cried, ""We can't live without a piano!"" 

Peter, Susan's late husband, helped solve the problem. They had to take out a window to get the piano inside. A crane was used to lift it through the window. The children were very happy to see the piano inside. 

Now, Susan thinks about how her children are busy and do not come home often. She feels tired climbing the stairs. She worries about the piano. Fred asks her if she is okay. She feels nervous. Robert and Francesca come to watch. 

Fred says, ""No tears then?"" Susan feels like crying. Moving things makes her feel sad. Suddenly, the piano comes down the stairs. Fred is careful with it. They take it outside and put it down by the van. 

Robert laughs first, and soon they are all laughing together. They are happy that it is over. As they walk down the path for the last time, Susan only sheds tears of laughter."

**Online Book Reviews for Everyone**

Anyone can write book reviews online. The Internet lets people share their thoughts about books easily. Amazon.com is a popular online bookstore where anyone can write a review. People can give a book up to five stars and say what they think about it. This is a good way for readers to see what others think before they buy a book.

Amazon has many reviews because it is the biggest online bookstore. But, with so many reviews, it is hard to check all of them. Amazon has rules for reviews. For example, one-word reviews or mean comments about the author are not allowed. Reviews that are rude or give away the ending of the book are also not allowed. However, people can write reviews without using their real names, so some people might write fake reviews.

Some authors write good reviews for their own books. For example, a writer named Lev Grossman was upset about bad reviews for his book. He wrote good reviews for his own book without saying who he was. Later, he told people he did this, and Amazon removed his fake reviews.

Authors can also leave comments about their books on Amazon. They can ask readers to buy and enjoy their books. Some authors even share their email addresses so readers can contact them. But Amazon does not always check if the comments are really from the authors.

Sometimes, readers write angry reviews. For example, when a book called *We've Got Spirit* was published, some people mentioned in the book were upset. They wrote many bad reviews, but some of these reviews were removed after a few days. Amazon thinks it is good that many people write and read reviews.

Most reviews on Amazon are serious. They help other readers decide if a book is good to buy. A famous writer, George Orwell, once said that writing too many reviews can be hard. But it is good that everyone can share their opinions about books now."

**Art in Modern Times**

In the last two hundred years, people often say that artists must go against the art of their time. We like to think that art is special, new, and surprising. We feel good when we admire artists whose work was not liked a hundred years ago. But when we look at art today, we sometimes think that an artist has gone too far and that their work is not really art. The media often say this for us, and we agree because we expect art to be very different. We do not see that today’s art has old ideas and methods too. 

In the past, people asked artists to make art for specific reasons. Art was a part of everyday life. Now, we let artists work alone and sometimes get upset if they do not connect with us.

**Picture This**

I will describe a situation and then ask an important question. An artist picks a piece of text from an art book. The text talks about different kinds of pictures and asks, ""What are they all about?"" It then says, ""There are many kinds of pictures."" 

The artist then asks someone to make a canvas for him. He tells the person to write the text on the canvas in simple black letters. My important question is: Is this finished work a painting?

**Underground Encounters**

At the Mercury Gallery in London until June 26, there is a rule for painters: once you find a style that sells well, you should stick to it. Collectors want artists to keep making the same kind of art. If an artist tries something new, people may not like it. Some artists, like Picasso and Hockney, can try new things and still be successful. 

Eric Rimmington is another artist who is trying something different. He is moving from painting still lifes to painting the London Underground. He has made drawings of the railway land in Kings Cross Station and now looks at what is below the ground. His new show, called Underground Encounters, has 40 paintings and drawings that show the interesting world of the Underground.

**Extract from a Novel**

I have come to this island with a few books. I do not know why I say ""escape."" The villagers joke that only a sick person would choose such a quiet place. I am here to heal myself. I am alone except for an old woman who comes from the village to clean my house. I do not feel happy or sad; I feel like I am floating in my memories. 

I talked about the uselessness of art but did not say how it can help us. The comfort of art is that it helps us see reality in a new way. Our daily actions are like a cover that hides the true meaning of life. For artists, art helps us deal with the pain of life. It allows us to fulfill our true potential through imagination. Otherwise, why should we hurt each other?"
CPE_63,"**Family Business**

""Look here, it's no good!"" said my Dad. We were in the car going back to London. My father, with my brother Maurice, had just picked me up from my school. I had just won two prizes: one for Latin and one for my end-of-school exams. My father had talked with my headteacher, and now we were going home for the holidays.

""What isn't?"" I asked, but I already knew what he was thinking. He usually talked a lot, but now he was quiet. ""You can't fool me. You will do what you want now,"" he said. ""With all those certificates, I heard you will get a scholarship to Oxford.""

""So?"" I replied. ""Mightn't that be useful?"" 

""I also heard,"" he continued, ""that you want to be a barrister. A barrister!"" My father knew a lot about lawyers. ""I just said that,"" I said. ""I couldn't think of anything else to say!""

""And apparently,"" he went on, ""you have the right personality. You can understand things quickly, you are good at talking, and you like to perform."" 

""I don't know about that,"" I said. ""I only know what I see on TV.""

""Anyway,"" he said, ""I feel you will not want to join the family business. You will go to Oxford University, and after that, I don't think you will want to work with us."" 

I felt trapped by what my family expected. I wanted to explore different jobs, but I didn't want to upset my father. I was not as scared of him as Maurice was - I was his favorite - but I still found him strong.

""It's too soon to know,"" I said weakly. ""You will not want to join us,"" my father said. ""It's a pity because you have the skills."" 

""There's still Maurice,"" I said, unhappy. My father laughed. We both knew Maurice did not like the business. ""Anyway,"" I said, ""you could always use me as a consultant."" 

My mother was not around to help - she had died when I was young, and my father raised me and Maurice. I took care of Maurice because he was younger than me. I loved him. Because the business was successful, we lived well - in a big house in London, nice schools, good clothes, and fun events. My father knew many important people, and our house was always busy with interesting conversations.

""I tell you what,"" my father said. ""You can help us during the holidays until you leave Oxford. Then if you want to leave, you can. It will give you some money and help me."" 

""OK,"" I said, happy to avoid making choices right now. I did not want to see my father sad if I disagreed with him. This was how he controlled us. 

So, I helped out during my last term at school and during university breaks, but only a few times a year. I became a smart student, with a small house, a nice car, and good clothes. I had a special black dress for my final exams.

In my last term, my father came to see me. He took me to a village for a meal and a talk. My tutor said I would get a First Class degree in Law. I felt ready and confident. 

Then my father told me he needed me to do one last job for him. It was very important for the family business, and he said it would be worth my time. 

""But Dad,"" I said, ""I have my final exams soon. I need to focus on that. It is really important!"" 

I could see my father did not understand how important my exams were. He would think that if I said no, I was betraying him. As he explained the job, I saw how focused and strong he was. He was very good at his work, and I admired that. It made my own plans seem less important. 

""All right,"" I said. ""I'll do it."""
CPE_56,"**Simplified Text:**

Simon Costello knew that buying the house in Pembroke Square was a mistake within a year after he and Lois moved in. It was a house they could only afford by being very careful with money. At first, it seemed like a good idea. Simon had many successful cases, and they were coming in regularly. Lois went back to her job at the advertising agency two months after the twins were born, and she got a raise to thirty-five thousand. Lois wanted to move to a bigger place, and Simon agreed. They needed more space, a garden, and a separate room for an au pair. They could have found these things in a cheaper part of London, but Lois wanted to live in a nice area. She thought that living in Mornington Mansions was not good enough for a young barrister and a successful businesswoman like her.

Lois decided that one of them should take public transport to save money. Since her office was far away, Simon had to take the tube. The crowded journey made him feel unhappy and angry. He remembered his grandfather's house in Hampstead, where he felt safe and cared for as a boy. His grandmother always made sure his grandfather had peace after a long day at work. But that life was gone. Lois had said before they married that her job was just as important as his. They needed both salaries to pay for the house and everything else. 

Now, Simon was worried about Venetia, who had come to their office in a bad mood. She was very angry about something. He wished he had left his room earlier to avoid her. He remembered her accusations. She said, ""I defended Brian Cartwright today. He told me that you knew he bribed the jury four years ago. Is that true?"" Simon replied, ""He's lying. It isn't true."" But he felt guilty, and his answer sounded weak. He remembered feeling scared like he did when he was a child. He looked into Venetia's eyes and saw that she did not believe him. 

He thought he should have said, ""Cartwright told me after the trial, but I didn’t believe him."" Instead, he had told a dangerous lie, and she knew it. He wondered why she was so angry. What did his past mistakes have to do with her? Why was she trying to ruin his career? He was scared of what she could do. If people heard about this, it could be the end for him."

I chose this place to live because I thought I could be alone. I wanted to be around people who did not care if their houses looked old and messy. But I was wrong. People in the shops soon start to recognize you. The beautiful roses from next door remind me that gardens can be nice. I usually stay inside, trying to forget that it is summer, but tonight I am watching the birds fly between the trees and roofs. I have cut some plants to make space for a chair, and my arms are a little scratched. 

It is a small garden in London, where plants have to grow tall to survive. My upstairs neighbor, Jaz, leans out of her window. She is a writer, and I sometimes help her with her work. I have her latest story with me. ""How is your writing going, Jaz?"" I ask. She complains about her job. ""I have something to drink in the fridge. I will bring it down,"" she says. I do not want Jaz in the garden, and I see that it looks messy. Jaz knocks on my door. 

""So, you are on holiday now,"" she says. She sits in the chair while I put a cushion on the ground. ""I should have become a teacher,"" she says. ""Writers do not have holidays."" I feel worried about the empty days of my holiday. I think about the hot streets and the lonely park. 

""Actually, I am going to Stonebridge tomorrow. Can you feed my cats?"" I ask. ""Of course,"" Jaz replies. ""Where will you stay?"" she asks. ""I will stay with my friend, Ruby,"" I say. This is not true, but I often deal with stories. 

Jaz asks about her story, ""The Cruelty of Red Vans."" I tell her I like the title. I think red vans can be cruel because they bring gifts to other houses. I decide to give her some advice. ""Try writing about nice people,"" I say. Jaz does not like this. ""I keep a journal,"" I tell her. ""I write something good about each day."" 

""Get a life, Ann,"" she replies. I have my work, and I go out sometimes. When we go back inside, my kitchen feels calm. Then I remember my old geography teacher, Miss Tarrantine, who once winked at us and said, ""I've had my moments."" We all laughed. 

**Questions:**

1. Why did the narrator choose this place to live?
2. What does the narrator usually do in the summer?
3. Who is Jaz?
4. What does Jaz bring down from her apartment?
5. What does the narrator ask Jaz to do while she is away?
6. What is the title of Jaz's story?
7. What advice does the narrator give to Jaz about her writing?"
CPE_6,"**Heritage**

Heritage means the things we get from our past. It helps people feel connected to their history. We often know about our grandparents and their stories. Learning about our past helps us understand our future. Heritage is important because it gives us a sense of belonging. Just like we inherit our genes, we also inherit our culture from our families. Some parts of our heritage may not be good, but it is still a part of us. Heritage teaches us many things and is important for our happiness. It includes our customs and the things we make. In the past, we learned about our history through stories from our ancestors. But now, many of these stories are lost. We can learn about our past from places and buildings. It is important to take care of these places to remember our ancestors.

**The Fens**

I wrote a book called Waterland. In this book, I wrote about a place in England called the Fens. At first, I did not know much about the Fens. I chose this place because it seemed quiet and simple. But when I learned more, I found that the Fens are very interesting and different. Many people in England think the Fens are strange, even though they are part of England. The Fens are both empty and full, and they are both farmed and wild. I have not visited some places in the Fens, but I like to imagine what they are like. The Fens are not just a place; they are also a way of thinking.

**Museums**

Museums should make their collections easy to see and understand. In the past, museums just put things in cases with long labels. Now, museums should be more interesting and fun. They should help everyone in the community. For example, some museums give boxes of objects to teachers and also help elderly people who are losing their memory. Museums show real items from history, not copies. This is what makes them special. Museums that create exciting displays and programs will attract more visitors who want to see real history.

**Architecture and Environment**

Wanting to keep things safe is not new. But now, changes in our towns happen very fast. This makes some people want to protect old buildings and places. People who have lived through big events, like wars, often want to keep things the same. If we need to preserve our history, planners should think about this. Change is not bad if we learn to manage it. Changes in our towns show changes in our society, like how many people live there and what they need."
CPE_33,"**Text: Einstein**

If you stop someone on the street and ask them to name a scientist, they will probably say Albert Einstein. His face is used to sell many things, like computers and books. Most people do not know much about what Einstein did. They know he made important ideas about 'relativity'. These ideas are famous but hard to understand. 

Einstein helped change how we think about science. He looked at time, space, matter, and energy in a new way. Before him, Isaac Newton said that stars and planets moved in a fixed space and time. Einstein said that time and space are not fixed; they can change.

**Young Readers**

When we were children, Lydia and I did not like prize-winning books. We thought they were boring. Our mother did not like this, but our father gave us money to read better books. He would also give us special books for Christmas and birthdays, marked as 'This Book is NOT Literature'. We thought many of his books were for boys, but he did help us read some good stories and poems.

**Language**

Jacob Grimm wrote in 1851 that the start of human language is a secret and wonderful thing. Many people have strange ideas about how language began. Charles Caller said in 1928 that early humans made sounds like ""meuh"" when they were scared. This sound is sad. Early humans made sounds when they were in danger, and some words today still show this, like ""malaria"" meaning ""fever"" and ""mors"" meaning ""death"".

Many people thought these ideas were silly, but now, studying how language started is important. Language likely began in East Africa about 100,000 years ago. At first, people used speech to be friendly and to help in fights. Sharing information was not the main reason for language, which is different from what philosopher John Locke said."
CPE_20,"**Simplified Text: Writing Reviews**

Frank Kermode talks about writing reviews. Most reviews are short and do not last long. They have deadlines and must be a certain length. When they are published, they are only in the newspaper for a short time, like a day or a week. Because of this, many people think that writing reviews is not very important. Some writers do reviews because they need money, or because they cannot spend all their time on a book.

However, writing reviews is a skilled job. It is different to write a short review of 600 or 800 words than to write a longer review of 6,000 or 8,000 words. A reviewer must think about who will read the review. Some readers just want a quick look, while others want to read a serious article.

A good reviewer needs to know a lot about different topics and must write in a way that is easy to understand. Many reviewers also write other things, like books or articles. For example, the American writer John Updike writes reviews between writing his novels. He collects all his reviews into books.

Some people think that less famous writers should accept that their reviews will not last long. But if they believe their best writing is in reviews, they should be allowed to keep them. I feel this way about my own work. I mostly write academic books, which are for professors. In English-speaking countries, it is common for the same people to write reviews and do academic work.

In the past, some professors did not like other professors writing reviews. They thought it was not serious work. But now, it is more accepted. There are many reviews today, so many people can write them. This is good for readers because they can trust that the reviewer knows what they are talking about. It is also good for professors because it helps them remember to write clearly for everyone.

In conclusion, writing reviews is important, but it is usually a secondary job. You can do it well only if you are also doing something else well."
CPE_40,"Ralph opened the door to his flat. It was dark and quiet inside. He felt a small sense of ownership, even after three years of living there. When he first bought the flat, he was always excited to come home. He wondered what had happened in his flat while he was away. It felt like a welcome place for him, a space that was always his.

Sometimes, he worried about things like break-ins or leaks, but his flat was always there, waiting for him. It looked either clean or messy, depending on how he left it. Over time, he started to see it as part of himself, a place where his thoughts and feelings spilled out. He wanted to change it, but it stayed the same.

There were always some letters by the door and a blinking answering machine when he got home. He was glad that his windows were not broken and that nothing bad had happened to his things. From his small office on the third floor, Ralph looked forward to his quiet evenings at home. After a long day at work, he felt like he was starting to remember who he was on the bus ride home. But once he got home, he didn’t want to be alone anymore, even though he thought he did.

At his desk, he wanted to be alone with his things, but when he got home, he felt empty. He thought that his job was changing him and making him feel lost. He would read or listen to music at night, but he started to wonder why he did those things. His thoughts became unclear, and he felt confused.

Ralph remembered a time when he felt stronger and more in control. He wanted to improve his life after university, but he found that he just wanted to get by. He applied for jobs that his friends talked about, but he felt like he was just following them. He went to one job interview and was happy to talk with Neil, the boss. Neil offered him the job right away, saying he was the only graduate who applied. Ralph took this as a compliment at the time."

I was going to see goat racing. It was Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. There were many ice-cream vans, lots of people, food stalls, and loud music. I pushed my way through the crowds to find a good place to watch. An area was blocked off for the race. It was not like a big racecourse, but people stood on both sides of the ground where the goats would run. They were trying to keep a few goats in order. This was not easy because goats can eat almost anything.

**Canoe Trip**

As the day ended, I thought about the night. I felt scared. The canoe was too wet to sleep in, and there was nowhere to stop. We had not seen any villages or huts since morning. In the dim moonlight, we used our flashlight to see the cliffs. The flashlight batteries were low, so we changed them, but they did not work. We could not find a place to camp. A little later, Lesley said she saw a light far away, and we felt hopeful. But the light was just the moon shining on the waves. Soon, we heard loud water, but we could not see it. We kept moving.

**How to Be Presentation Perfect**

I am not good at making presentations, but as a manager, I have to present to my colleagues and to important people. How can I get better at this? You are not alone. Making a presentation is different from running a company, but many leaders need to do it well. If you want to convince your audience, you must believe in what you are saying. Show your passion and enthusiasm in your presentation. This means you need to prepare. Test your ideas before the presentation. Ask your colleagues what hard questions the audience might ask. You should also create a good atmosphere from the start. Begin with something everyone can relate to and then lead to your main point."
CPE_64,"**Simplified Text:**

Some activities take time and cannot be rushed. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you are impatient with mayonnaise and add the oil too fast, it will not work. If you pull on a tangled fishing line, it will get tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some things happen very fast, while others take a long time. We can get better at some tasks, like solving puzzles, but some things cannot be rushed. If we try to hurry them, they can break, like the mayonnaise, or get tangled, like the fishing line.

Sometimes, we need to think fast, but this is not always good. We learn and think in different ways, and these ways work at different speeds. There are three main speeds of thinking. The first is very fast. Some situations need a quick reaction. For example, if you fall off a bike, your body knows what to do before you think about it. This quick thinking is called our ""wits.""

The second speed is thinking carefully. This is when we solve problems and make decisions. For example, a mechanic fixing a car or a student doing homework is using this kind of thinking. We often call this ""intellect."" People who are good at this are called ""clever.""

The third speed is slower and more relaxed. This is when we think about things without rushing. For example, when we sit by the sea and listen to the waves, we are in a different thinking mode. This slow thinking is also important. It helps us understand complex situations better. 

Sometimes, we need to take our time to think about problems, especially when they are difficult. For example, if we are not sure how to manage a group of people at work, it might be better to sit and think rather than rush to find a solution. This slow thinking is connected to creativity and wisdom. 

Scientists are now studying these slower ways of thinking. They find that our minds can do many important things if we give them time. They can understand complex situations and solve difficult problems better than fast thinking."
CPE_29,"**Text: Surviving in a Foreign Land**

I have been welcomed warmly. It is a friendly place in a very isolated area. There are about forty people here - scientists, students, and weather experts. We all help each other. My school French is okay for talking, but not for chatting. I miss some words, and my phrasebook does not help at breakfast. This is not a big problem, but at first, I felt shy. I was nervous at mealtimes. I did not know which table to sit at, and I felt scared when I spoke. I still smile a lot or feel nervous when people talk to me. I think I feel a bit sad because I cannot talk as easily as I used to.

**Elliot**

When I first met Elliot, I was a young writer. He did not notice me. He remembered faces, and when I saw him, he shook my hand but did not want to be friends. If I saw him at the opera with important people, he did not see me. Then, I became a successful playwright, and Elliot started to be friendlier. One day, he invited me to lunch. I thought he wanted to know me better. After that, I saw him more often because my success brought me new friends.

**Alfred Hitchcock**

Alfred Hitchcock was a famous film director. He said he did not care about the story or the acting in his films. He cared about the pictures and the music. For Hitchcock, it was not the message or the acting that moved the audience. He believed that good films could make people feel the same way, no matter where they were from. If a film is made well, people in Japan and India should react at the same time. Hitchcock was very clear about his work. He was a smart man who liked to see the audience react. He focused on making great films and how they could affect people."
CPE_57,"**Text: Amateur Astronomy**

Many things have changed in astronomy in the last 50 years. About 30 years ago, there were not many charts and books about astronomy. Telescopes were not very good, and there were few books for beginners. Now, there are many types of telescopes and equipment available. Computers and calculators help make charts and analyze observations. This is a great time for amateur astronomy.

However, some things are worse now. People may have to travel far to find a dark sky. In cities, the sky is often not clear because of airplane trails. These trails can stay in the sky for a long time and make it hard to see the sun and stars.

**Text: Too Much Choice**

Today, there are too many choices in life. People have many things to do and many options. In our modern world, people want new products and services all the time. Technology makes this faster. New products come out quickly, and it can be hard to keep up. This can make people feel tired and stressed. 

Because of this, many people want to find simple things that make them happy. But it is not easy to simplify life when there are so many products and choices. There are many brands of soap and breakfast cereals, and it can be hard to choose.

**Text: McAndrews Hotel**

Every summer, my family goes to McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. This is a family tradition started by my grandmother. It is very important to us. We do not want anything to change this tradition. 

The guests at McAndrews Hotel are often old-fashioned. I do not like the bad manners of some shop assistants today. I prefer to be polite and keep my distance from others. I know many of the other guests because we have been coming here since we were children. When I see them, we only say hello and do not talk much. This respect for privacy is hard to find in hotels today."
CPE_9,"**Text: Othello**

There is a play called Othello by Shakespeare. It is now in London. I wrote a bad review of it last spring. I said that Ray Fearon was too young to play Othello. I was wrong about his acting. He did a great job. The whole cast is great. 

Some important scenes are when Cassio plays games with other officers and when Iago starts to lose control. The scene where Emilia helps Desdemona get ready for bed is very emotional. The play is exciting and full of tension. You should see this production.

**Lake Vostok**

In Antarctica, there is a place called Lake Vostok. It is under 4 kilometers of ice. This lake has been there for 25 million years without air or sunlight. Scientists want to explore it and find out what lives in the lake. 

**Scientists**

Last week, I heard something interesting on the radio. Some scientists are thinking about why they want to be scientists. They want to know why we want to learn about everything. They think it is important to know if what they do is right. Science is a tool, and we should decide how to use it."

**Food**  
Food is very important to us. Many people who like cooking buy cookbooks. Sometimes, we think cooking is only for special occasions or fancy dishes. But that is not true! You can make a tasty soup by putting chopped carrots, a leek, celery, and some herbs in water. This soup is better than buying a packet or a tin. Instead of buying a sweet chocolate dessert full of chemicals, you can make a delicious treat in five minutes that everyone will enjoy. Cooking is also a way to show care and love. Sharing food is special, and we often celebrate important events like birthdays and anniversaries with food. No one would want to eat takeout at a wedding!

**In the Elevator**  
This morning, Alistair tried to clean his office, but it was still messy. Papers were everywhere, and he had many tax forms and other documents to organize. As he took the elevator to his floor, he knew Mallory would be on time for their meeting. She was always on time and liked things neat. He wondered how she would feel about the mess. She might think someone had made a mess in his office. Alistair saw his cleaning woman, Mrs. Wilson, and smiled at her. But she looked unhappy and did not want to go into his messy office.

**Karen**  
Karen wanted to be different from her mother. She made her own story about strength. One important moment was when she was twelve years old. Her brother accidentally hit her in the eye with a golf club. At first, she thought she would go blind. But the doctor said she was okay, and she only needed a few stitches. When she opened her eyes in the doctor's office and saw her mother, she felt grateful and knew she was saved for a reason.

**Miss Fogerty**  
Miss Fogerty was walking back to her work on the village green. She felt both happy and sad about something she had just seen. It is exciting to know something important in a small town, but she was also sad about Dr. Bailey's health. He had been her doctor for many years and always cared for her. She remembered how he helped her with her throat problems. Dr. Bailey made her feel like he had time to listen to her worries. This made him very loved in the village. He always gave his time, knowledge, and humor to his patients, and they appreciated him very much."
CPE_59,"**Joanna's Lessons**

Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist. She plays music for many people. She also writes books for young children who want to learn the piano. Joanna plays the piano very well. She can play many types of music, like classical, jazz, and blues. 

At a concert for kids, one boy asked her, ""Can you play Match of the Day?"" This surprised her, but she thought it was funny. She played it for him. Joanna cares a lot about how children learn to play the piano. She has written a book called *Joanna MacGregor's Piano World* to help children learn.

Even though she has a lot of work, she wants to help kids enjoy music. She believes that everyone should be able to learn the piano, just like swimming or speaking a little French. Some kids learn quickly, but others take more time and sometimes give up. Joanna thinks it is important for kids to enjoy music, not just to be the best.

Joanna does not want to say bad things about other piano books or teachers. She knows her books are fun and colorful, but there are many good books to help kids learn. Her books have stories and music to make learning interesting. 

She believes learning should be fun. Kids should be able to play freely and try new things on the piano. As they learn, they need to practice reading music. Joanna understands that practice can be hard. She did not practice a lot until she went to music school. Now, she practices a lot and loves it. 

Joanna wants to help kids who find practice difficult. She says it is important to know what you want to do before you practice. She also suggests playing the whole piece, even if there are mistakes, and mixing easy songs with hard ones."
CPE_54,"**Simplified Text: Writing by Hand and on Screen**

Dr. Johnson said that ""what is easy to write is usually not fun to read."" This means that good writing is hard to do. When I look at my old school essays, I see that I did not make many mistakes. Today, I would change my writing many times. I think this is because writing by hand is hard. Writing slowly helps me think better. When I write on a computer, I can change things easily, but this can make my writing careless. 

Many writers spend a lot of time fixing their work on a computer. Writing emails is different from writing letters by hand. Emails are often not as special. Many people now write love letters by email, which is good. At least they are writing in English, but words on a screen can feel boring. People sometimes use too many words and their meaning can get lost. Fast writing on a computer does not have the care of handwriting.

One day, I looked at a CD. The case was not nice, but the shiny disc inside was interesting. Mr. Warriston came into the room and said, ""These are wonderful!"" I agreed and gave him the disc. He said it was amazing that they could fit seventy minutes of music on a CD. He turned on the music player, and lights came on. He put the disc inside and pressed a button. 

""Do you have to turn them over, like records?"" I asked. 

""No,"" he said. ""You only play one side."" 

""Why?"" I asked. He thought for a moment and said, ""I don't know. You could make both sides play."" He smiled and said, ""Good point."" Then he told me to sit in the best place to hear the music.

**Books vs. Electronic Text**

Malcolm Bradbury said that if matches were made after cigarette lighters, we would think they were better. Many people say that electronic text is as important as the invention of books. They think this change is almost done. But it takes a long time for people to change how they think. 

In 1979, a book said that books would slowly disappear in the 1980s. This was wrong. Reading long things on a screen is not nice, so many people do not do it. Computers make people read only parts of texts. Some people say this is good because it leads to new ways of telling stories. But many books have not been read from start to finish, like religious texts and dictionaries. The problem is that computers do not help people read everything carefully.

**The Office**

Charles walked into the office and saw everything was neat. The carpet was clean, and the desk was dark wood. There were file holders in the right places. Twelve years of trade journals filled one wall. Kathleen was trying to close a filing cabinet and then looked at him. 

""You have to use computers, Charles. This is too much,"" she said. 

""Hello, Kathleen. This is amazing,"" he replied, looking at the room and its old furniture. He did not think about computers at all. 

Over the two years he had known her, they had talked about this many times. She did not understand why he did not want to use technology, even though he was good with computers and had written an important paper about them. She could use any software and make it do new things."
CPE_32,"Text: ""You don’t take sugar, do you?"" shouted his secretary. She was not really asking; she was stating a fact because she had been making coffee for Lancelot for many months. She forgot sometimes because he was not usually there. But now, he was there all the time. He thought about how he had gone from a valued helper, meeting authors for lunch, to someone who was always busy and had trouble finding a place to park at work.

""This came,"" she yelled, waving a folder before putting it in front of him. ""From that man in Los Angeles. You wanted to see it."" The label said: ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert."" Under that, it said ""An Expanded Synopsis."" Lancelot did not want to see the word ""synopsis."" He wanted to see ""A First Draft."" He had already seen a synopsis of this book and did not want to see another one.

Ian Cuthbert had received a lot of money for this book when Lancelot bought the company. Ian was a friend who Lancelot had made a mistake by asking to write a book. Lancelot skipped the introduction he had read many times and looked at the synopsis. He recognized almost every phrase. He closed the folder and moved it aside. It seemed that Ian's manuscript would never come. The synopsis was not as good as it should be, and it felt like it had lost its purpose.

Lancelot remembered a famous author whose last book was published after he died. That author had been paid little by little for each chapter. But Ian had received a lot of money upfront, which was not how things should work. Lancelot remembered when Ian was a promising writer. His friends wanted to take over British theater, and they did. But Ian seemed lazy compared to them. He wore his coat like a cape and talked about famous writers as if he had met them.

For some reason, Ian's talent stayed hidden. While others became successful, Ian stayed away. He was hard to work with. He was supposed to edit a magazine about the arts, but it never got published. His contract with a fashion magazine was renewed three times, but he still did not produce anything. At meetings, he was mean to others' ideas. Ten years later, he could hardly be counted on to show up for anything. Lancelot was starting to think that ""A World History of the Short"" was a mistake from the beginning."
CPE_65,"**Text: England's Breakfast Change**

A good breakfast is very important, say health experts. But in the past, breakfast was not common in England. In medieval times, people did not often write about breakfast. Some travelers ate a meal at dawn before long trips, and sick people had breakfast for health reasons. But most people did not eat breakfast unless they were kings or nobles.

In the sixteenth century, breakfast became more common. Some people think this happened because there was more food available. Others believe that changes in work also made breakfast more important. Many people started working for set hours, often starting very early. So, eating a meal in the morning became necessary and was not just for rich people anymore."

**Photography**  
When a photographer takes a picture, they choose what to show based on their skills, feelings, and experiences. This choice is also influenced by social and cultural ideas. In this book, we will see how these things change the style and meaning of a photograph. We will also look at how people see and react to these images. For example, when someone reads a newspaper, they understand the photos in a special way. But instead of just believing the photo, we can ask if it shows the scene as it really was. Or, does it show what the photographer thinks? Is the exact moment in the photo important, or does it represent something bigger in the world?

**More than a Game**  
For me, sports are more than just a game. The best athletes believe in themselves completely. To be the best, you need to focus and put everything else aside. Sports can be tough, and no one will do it for you. You either succeed or fail. Sports have taught me discipline and determination, but they also show the importance of teamwork. My sport lets me shine as an individual, but it is also a team game, and I must balance both. It is like life - you can do well alone, but you must remember others are around you. Sports have given me a lot, not just money. They have opened doors for me and shown me things in the world that many people will never see. But you also have to give up a lot for these rewards.

**Tuning In**  
Some experiences stay in our memory very clearly. For me, one special moment happened one night in California a long time ago. I was awake, listening to a mockingbird singing from a tree in my neighborhood. I was not awake because I could not sleep; I was awake because the bird's beautiful song kept me up. As I listened to the bird's music, I felt like I was in a special place. To understand the bird's song, I thought about jazz and Indian classical music. The bird made me feel like I was hearing an amazing performance. I cheered and groaned as the bird sang different tunes through my open window, until finally, I fell asleep."
CPE_52,"Text: 

People have always talked a lot about birds. But what does this say about us? 

In a greenhouse, a little brown bird called a wren is bumping against the glass. Is it trying to tell us something? Or is it just a bird that is lost? Depending on how you see it, both could be true. 

Wrens have been part of British culture for a long time. In the past, people believed that the way wrens flew could tell them about their luck. Today, we still see pictures of wrens in many British homes. Even if old beliefs are not as strong now, people still like wrens. A place without wrens feels sad. 

Long ago, people were more connected to nature. They understood the importance of birds and other animals for their survival. This connection changed over time. For example, the red kite bird was once seen as a helpful bird in London. But later, people thought of it as a pest and many were killed. Now, red kites are protected again and are important for conservation in Britain. 

Birds are important to us for many reasons. They can show us when danger is near or when food is available. Birds also connect us to our dreams. When we think about why birds matter to us, we also think about who we are. Birds can fly, sing, and are free. Our interest in birds shows us something about ourselves. 

In recent years, birds have become important for understanding the environment. In Britain, 30 bird species are in danger. This is sad because it means we are losing not just birds, but also part of our culture. Birds like the skylark and turtle dove are symbols of love and magic. Many poems and stories mention these birds, and losing them makes us feel bad. 

Folklore, or traditional stories, is very important. These stories connect us to birds in a way that science cannot. They help us feel emotions and understand our world better. Whether we watch birds on TV or in our gardens, the joy we feel cannot be explained by science. 

The wren in the greenhouse connects our present with a long history. Its song makes us think about the past and the future, leaving us with questions."
CPE_28,"**Text: Maps**

A map shows where places are on the earth. It helps us understand how far apart things are and which way to go. Long ago, people talked about distance in time, like ""a two-hour walk"" or ""a day's trip by boat."" This helped people know how easy it was to travel, not just how far things were.

Direction is also important, but for many travelers, the main questions were ""Where do I go?"" and ""How far is it?"" So, maps were not always very accurate about direction. For a long time, people used written directions instead of maps. Even now, some maps, like train maps, do not show true directions.

In the past, important places along a route were marked with signs. These signs could be big or small, depending on how important the place was. Different maps used different signs, so it is important to understand what each map shows.

The history of making maps, called cartography, is about making maps more accurate over time. People learned to use tools like the compass to find direction better. They also learned more about the earth through exploration. They found out that the earth is not a perfect ball; it is a bit flat at the poles. This helped make better maps.

As time went on, more people started using maps. Soldiers needed accurate maps for battles. They wanted to see the land clearly, so new ways to show land features were created. Other people, like archaeologists and historians, also needed maps for their work.

Today, map makers use many methods to show different things, like weather and land use. Maps are very important in many fields of study. However, making maps has not always been easy. Sometimes, old ideas stayed with new ones, and map makers had to wait for better tools to use their ideas.

Many maps we have today are the result of a lot of hard work. They are important records of human history. This is why studying old maps is interesting and helpful."

I met a young man named Andrew Lloyd Webber in his nice room. It was much better than the messy rooms in his house. He had many records and the first stereo record player I had ever seen. Andrew was a teenager who liked music and had bought nice things like wine glasses and furniture. He won a scholarship to study history at Magdalen College, Oxford. He had nine months before starting school, and he wanted to be a famous composer like Richard Rodgers.

I also had big dreams. I wanted to be a pop star for fun, money, and fame. My dreams were not as important as Andrew's. When Andrew asked me to try to be a famous lyricist like Oscar Hammerstein, I agreed. He played me some of his music, and I thought he was very good. He needed someone to write lyrics for his songs.

I did not have much to show him, except for a song I had written that a small band recorded. We promised to meet again and write music together. I was more interested in pop music than in theater, but I knew Andrew was talented and would be successful.

The next day, I was back at my office, training to be a lawyer. I thought about my time with Andrew and how I might not be in show business. I still looked for ads for bands needing a singer. I thought I would probably become a lawyer by twenty-five, like my father said I would. This worried me because I wanted to enjoy pop music for longer.

I decided to see Andrew again. It would be fun to write lyrics for musicals. Andrew liked good food and talked about buildings and football. He had an idea for a musical about Dr. Thomas Barnardo, a man who helped orphans. I thought the story was not very exciting, but Andrew believed in his music.

I started to work on the songs, especially the funny ones. Andrew told me the story and played the music. I even skipped a day at my lawyer job to write my first lyrics. That day, I did not know it, but I was starting a new career.

1. Who did the author meet in the nice room?
2. What did Andrew want to study at college?

4. What kind of music did Andrew play for the author?
5. What was the idea for Andrew's musical about?"

**Language**  
You and I are part of a special group of living things. We can share thoughts and feelings with each other using words. Language is very important in our lives. If you see two or more people together, they will probably be talking. When people are alone, they might talk to themselves, their pets, or even their plants. I think of language as a natural skill. Just like spiders know how to make webs, people know how to talk.

**Climate and Weather**  
Climate and weather come from the air around us. They affect how animals and plants live. Climate can change how a place looks. For example, warm and wet places can have tropical jungles with many different plants and animals. Cold and windy places have fewer living things. The weather changes every day because of big air movements. The sun also helps to move the air.

**Coffee**  
As a barista, my job was to serve drinks and make coffee. In Melbourne, a restaurant's success can depend on its coffee. I had many days of training to learn how to use the coffee machine. I learned how to make a good cappuccino. After a week, I realized that making coffee was harder than it seemed. I thought I might have to do easier tasks again. Luckily, my boss was kind. He said, ""Making coffee is both an art and a science, and you need time to learn it."""
CPE_41,"**Text: Art on TV**

Why does television not do well with shows about art? Painting and sculpture are good for the camera. The camera can show the whole artwork and then zoom in to see the details. But there are not many TV shows that show the joy and complexity of looking at art. 

A good example is Robert Hughes's show about American art called *American Visions*. Hughes is a trusted critic. He has a strong personality and has almost eight hours to show British people a type of art that British galleries do not show. I thought the show would focus on great artworks. Instead, it talked about how American history and culture are shown in its art and buildings.

**Dealing in Metals**

For 20 years, I worked as a metals dealer and became known as a speculator. The metals market is not as controlled as other markets. With some luck, a willingness to take risks, and a good understanding of the market, you can make a lot of money. Taking risks is part of this business. This adventurous culture fits well with a free market. 

But now, the free-trade economists who said the market would keep the price of rare metals have found the opposite is true. More minerals are being taken from the ground, and the price of raw materials is going down. If we think about inflation, the prices of most metals are about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to look into claims against a big company that benefits from these cheap raw materials.

**Extract from a Holiday Brochure**

Abaco and its small islands are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas. They stretch from Florida to Cuba. Each island is different and has something to offer. To get around the islands, you need a boat. If you do not get a boat with your room, do not worry. There are many ferries and water taxis. You can also rent a boat if you want to go by yourself. 

Sailing is the most popular way to travel here. Abaco is called 'The Sailing Capital of the World' for a good reason. The calm waters are also great for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The islands and their beaches stretch for 200 miles like a string of pearls. At night, the lights of the restaurants and cafes in Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay sparkle."

You can build your own bike at the Bamboo Bike Club in the UK. This workshop is run by two engineers, James and Ian. You will get a special bike frame made from bamboo and have a fun weekend building your bike.

It is Saturday morning in Hackney Wick, east London. The Bamboo Bike Club is the only place in Britain where you can build a bamboo bike. I am here to watch. There is a lot of energy and fun in the workshop. Bamboo is a new and interesting material for making bikes. Some companies, like Calfee Design and Bamboo Bikes, have been making bamboo bikes for many years.

Many people find bamboo bikes expensive. A ready-made bamboo frame can cost about $2,995 or £1,868. James and Ian wanted to make bamboo bikes that everyone can afford. They worked hard in a shed in Wales to create a bike that is not too expensive. They wanted to share the joy of making something special.

Now, the Bamboo Bike Club is a community project. James makes wind turbines, and Ian is a civil engineer. They run monthly courses where you can build your own bike frame. The course is fun and not too expensive.

On the first day, James and Ian teach us how to choose strong bamboo and how to make strong joints. We start by making the front part of the bike with thick bamboo. They help us with every step and check our work. If we make a mistake, it is okay. We can try again with a new piece of bamboo.

On Sunday, we spend time making the joints stronger with hemp bindings and glue. After that, we add wheels, brakes, and other parts to finish the bike. The bamboo bike is strong and can last a long time. Ian has used his bike for over a year, and James has tested his bike for three months.

The bamboo bikes look different from metal bikes. They may not look as perfect, but they are unique. James and Ian say that is the point. I think bamboo bikes are good for riding slowly and enjoying the ride. I choose a frame that is easy to ride.

I try James's bike, and it feels light and smooth. It is fun to ride. James says these bikes are very light and easy to ride. The price for building your own bamboo bike is less than £500."

Dr. Gray became very rich, and Diane started her own company. Dr. Gray's book helps people understand each other better. It is part of a big self-help industry in America. This industry helps many people who want to improve their lives. There are many self-help books, but many are not published because they are not good enough. Editors look for books that will sell well. They ask questions like, ""Is the author interesting?"" and ""Does the title catch attention?"" A good title can help a book succeed.

**Autobiographies**  
When someone writes an autobiography, they promise to tell the truth. But this promise is not always kept. Sometimes, writers do not share everything because they feel ashamed or think some things are not important. Other times, they might change the truth to make their story better. They may call their book an autobiography to make readers believe it is true, even if it is not. This can happen without the writer being dishonest.

**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**  
Dashiell Hammett wrote detective stories that show problems in society. In these stories, a crime represents human feelings like greed or desire. Solving the crime helps bring order back to society. In Hammett's stories, the detective and the criminal understand each other. The detective is part of both worlds: he is a little too honest for criminals and a little too shady for the law. His job is complicated because he feels connected to both sides.

At Cannons Gym, many workers from the City of London come for lunch. This summer is very hot, so the gym has turned on the air-conditioning a lot. Sometimes, it feels very cold inside, like the Arctic. This shows how people often use air-conditioning too much. Air-conditioning is now common in many places, but there are other ways to keep buildings cool. For example, buildings can use sunlight and fresh air. They can also have thicker walls to keep heat out during the day and let it go at night. These ideas can help reduce the need for air-conditioning.

**Sundials**

Now, many people are interested in sundials again. Sundials are tools that tell time by the sun's position. A hundred years ago, they were very important for keeping time. But as clocks became better, sundials were not used much and became just decorations in gardens. Now, people are looking at them again. David Harber, who makes sundials, thinks they are special because they connect us to the planets. He says there is a magical moment when a sundial starts to work. They are calm and beautiful objects that remind us of our place in the universe.

**Paint Your Own China**

I remember seeing china-painting at an art show. Older women painted flowers on teacups very carefully. It was amazing to watch them. Their hands were steady, and the paint was perfect. I thought it would be hard to learn china-painting. But when I joined a class, it was not scary at all. Everyone was there to have fun, and even the teacher did not want to paint like the women I had seen before."

Uncle chose a holiday for Keith and Dawne. It was a good price: a flight from Gatwick Airport, twelve nights in Venice, in a hotel called Pensione Concordia. When Keith and Dawne went to the travel agency to book the holiday, the clerk said they would be with a school group from the south coast. They were all learning Italian.

But something went wrong. They ended up in a hotel called the Edelweiss, in Switzerland, not Venice. At Gatwick, they gave their tickets to a girl in a yellow-and-red uniform. She checked their tickets and said everything was fine. An hour later, they heard older people on the plane speaking with accents from the North of England. Keith thought there was a mistake.

When they landed, a woman with glasses told them to stay together. They did not see anything about an overnight stop in the brochure. When they got off the coach, it was almost midnight. They were tired and did not ask about their beds. But the next morning, they learned they would stay in the hotel for their holiday. They were worried.

Keith told the receptionist, ""We were meant to be in Venice."" The receptionist said he did not know that hotel. Dawne said the name of the travel agency. A woman named Mrs. Franks, who was with the group, smiled at them. She said she was married to a man with a bad leg. Dawne asked if she was in charge. 

Keith said they were in the wrong group. They had given their tickets to the girl at Gatwick. Dawne said they should have known something was wrong when they heard the other people talking about Darlington. 

Mrs. Franks explained that there are many holidays with the same yellow-and-red labels. She laughed and said if they followed the wrong people, they could end up in a wildlife park. But she said that could not happen. 

Keith insisted, ""We are not meant to be in Switzerland."" Mrs. Franks then walked away. The receptionist was gone, and they could hear typing. Dawne said Mrs. Franks seemed nice, but Keith was not listening. He thought about everything that happened: giving the tickets, waiting, and getting on the plane.

An old man spoke to them. He said his name was Mr. Nottage. He and his wife were happy to be there. Dawne said that was nice. Keith and Dawne left the hotel. They did not say anything to each other about the funny situation. They had wanted a holiday away from older people, but now they were on a trip with them. Uncle had said this would happen when they tried to get him to come with them."

American business leaders are looking at Ernest Shackleton as a good example of management. Many people in Britain know who Sir Ernest Shackleton is and what he did. In America, people are just starting to learn about him. The Wall Street Journal called Shackleton ""an Antarctic explorer"" who was not well known for most of the 20th century. Now, Americans are very interested in him. Many books and stories about his journey on the Endurance are being made. The American Museum of Natural History is having a big exhibition, and a film about Shackleton's life is being prepared.

Some American managers see Shackleton as a role model. They tell stories about his actions and learn lessons about leadership and communication from him. Shackleton is known for being determined and resourceful. Jim MacGregor, a manager in New York, has looked up to Shackleton for a long time. His company helps with communication during business changes and crises.

Shackleton was a leader who cared about his team. He made a tough choice to turn back when he was only 97 miles from the South Pole. This decision showed that he valued the lives of his men. In a crisis, people want to know who is in charge. While some managers today avoid responsibility, Shackleton was ready to take charge.

In 1914, Shackleton's ship, the Endurance, got stuck in ice for nine months and was finally crushed. When the ship sank, Shackleton told his men that they would be safe if they worked hard and trusted him. He always kept his men informed and listened to their ideas. Shackleton was flexible and ready to change plans if needed.

Shackleton believed that an explorer needs to be optimistic, strong, and patient. He showed this when he helped his team during difficult times. For example, he gave his gloves to a photographer who had none. Shackleton also valued small things, like a biscuit, during tough times.

Caroline Alexander, who wrote about Shackleton's journey, says that people today want to hear stories of heroism. Shackleton represents the ideals that many people long for now."

In the forests of Madagascar, there is a special animal called the aye-aye. The aye-aye is a primate, and it has a way of finding food that is similar to a woodpecker. Both the aye-aye and the woodpecker look for insects in wood. The woodpecker uses its beak to make holes in the wood and its long tongue to get the insects. The aye-aye uses its sharp teeth to make holes and its long finger to reach inside and get the insects.

Scientists have studied the aye-aye to understand how it finds food. Dr. Carl Erickson from Duke University studied two male aye-ayes named Nosferatu and Poe, a female named Samantha, and her baby, Annabelle. He wanted to see if they could find insects by looking for signs, like holes in the wood. Dr. Erickson made logs with holes. Some holes had food inside, and some did not. The aye-ayes went straight to the holes with food, showing they did not need to see the holes to find it.

Dr. Erickson thought the aye-ayes might find food by smell or sound, but they could also find food when there was no smell or sound. He found that the aye-ayes could feel the empty spaces in the wood. When looking for food, an aye-aye taps the wood with its long finger and listens carefully. It can hear sounds that tell it where the food is.

The aye-aye is interesting because it acts like both a woodpecker and a squirrel. Its teeth keep growing like a squirrel's teeth. Recently, scientists saw an aye-aye in the wild eating nuts. It used its long finger to get the nut meat out of the shell.

**Questions:**

1. Where does the aye-aye live?
2. What does the aye-aye use to make holes in the wood?
3. Who studied the aye-ayes?
4. What did Dr. Erickson want to find out about the aye-ayes?

CAE_19,"**Text: 'Ordinary People, Ordinary Lives'**

Many of us have pictures of our grandparents. But how many of us know what their lives were like when they were young? Sometimes, we can read old diaries or hear family stories, but they are often not complete. And what will our grandchildren know about us? We want to write things down, but we often forget. We might leave videos instead of pictures, but videos are not the same as real life.

Hannah Renier has a solution. She writes life stories for other people. She makes a book with at least 20,000 words and pictures if needed. This is not about famous people, but about ordinary people. Hannah got this idea when she talked to her family and saw that many stories from the past were being lost.

""When I started, I did not think it was very serious,"" she says. ""But I met people who have interesting lives and want to share their stories. They say they do it for their children, but they also enjoy it.""

People feel safe to share their stories with Hannah. A 62-year-old man said, ""I was honest. I talked about my divorce, and it still hurts."" He wrote his story for his family, but he does not want his children to read it yet. He thinks they might be hurt by some things in his life.

Hannah sees that many people repeat the same mistakes from their childhood. ""Many people are affected by their parents,"" she says. ""What parents say to their children can change their lives. Some people marry people their parents like, while others choose the opposite to rebel.""

Many people have regrets. Even after many years, they still feel sad about things that happened with their parents. They try to impress parents who are not impressed. Some people want to say, ""I don’t like my mother.""

Hannah listens to people without judging them. ""I am not here to be nosy,"" she says. People sometimes share things and then worry if they should have said them. But Hannah writes everything down. People can change things later if they want.

Hannah's books are not for everyone. They are not about showing off. She believes we are losing touch with our past. Her books help people remember their roots and connect with their family history. 

Each book takes about 30 hours of interviews. Hannah uses these talks to write the life story. She can make the book look nice, and people can choose the color and title. The books are special and cost nearly £3,000, with extra copies for £25 each. Hannah gets about 10 requests each week, but the price stops many people from buying.

""I thought more people would want this,"" she says. ""But the people I have worked with are often wealthy and like to read certain magazines."""

A. The Theatre Director  
I have had 35 years with small children, and I love it. This morning, I fed the baby, and that is what being a father means to me. I am very lucky with my children. We all enjoy the same things: opera, theatre, books, and music. This brings us close together. Now that they are older, I feel more like a friend than a father. I do not believe in hitting children. I have done it when I was angry, but I do not think it is right. I may not have been the best father, but I always try to be there for them. I wait for them to call me. I do not want to make them feel guilty for not calling.

B. The Advertising Executive  
I was young when my children were born, only 25 years old. I found it hard to have so many responsibilities. It made me feel older, but it also kept me young. As they grew up, they showed me new things like music and fashion. This helped me in my job. I missed some important events when they were young, like concerts and sports days, and I feel sad about that. But now, I can take them on holidays, and they enjoy being with my friends at parties.

C. The Politician  
My first child was born when I was starting my political career. My wife and I wanted to spend time with our children, but my job takes a lot of time. I only go to meetings on weekends if my kids can come with me. This way, they can see what I do, and they do not feel like I am gone all the time. I see more politicians bringing their kids to work. Maybe we all want our children to be part of our lives.

D. The Writer  
My first marriage ended when my daughters, Kate and Bonnie, were young. I wanted to stay close to them. My ex-wife and I even lived next to each other for a while, but I think it confused the kids. Kate has said I was always there for her, but I wonder if I was a good father. I was around a lot, but I treated them like adults too soon. Kate said we were too relaxed as parents. I think I should have had more rules. I still worry about my daughters, no matter how old they are.

E. The TV Presenter  
I was ready for kids when I turned 30. I met my wife, and we had a nice home. We thought, ""Why not have a child instead of just buying new things?"" Having my daughter, Betty, made me think about who I am. It feels special to have a child, but it also makes you just one of many parents. Sometimes I feel frustrated, but when I see her smile, all my worries go away. A baby's smile is very powerful."

**Flying in Weightlessness**

Journalist Tom Mumford joins students who are testing their ideas in weightlessness. The plane looked normal from the outside. The pilot said it was built in 1964 and was a Boeing KC-135. But inside, it was very different. The inside was a long white tunnel with few windows and bright lights on the walls. Most of the seats were gone, except for a few at the back where the 13 students sat. They were nervous but excited. 

For 12 months, these students from Europe and America worked hard to join this flight. The European Space Agency asked them to think of fun experiments to do in weightlessness. The best ideas won a place on this special flight, which felt like a big roller coaster. 

For the next two hours, the plane would go up and down like a bird. The pilot would turn off the engines at 3,000 meters. The plane would go higher for a moment before falling back down. During this time, everything inside the plane would be weightless. The students would feel like they were closer to the moon than to the Earth.

The plane took off smoothly, but soon the pilot made the plane climb steeply. The engines roared, and the students felt heavy. Then, the engines stopped, and they felt weightless. For 20 seconds, they floated in the air. It was like jumping on a trampoline. They could not tell which way was up or down. 

After 10 seconds of falling, the pilot pulled the plane up again. Gravity came back, and some students landed hard. They had 30 curves to do, which gave them 10 minutes of weightlessness for their experiments. 

The Dutch students studied their robot cat, Leonardo, to see how cats land on their feet. They released a device to help with this. Another student accidentally landed on it during a curve. A German team studied how metal joins change without gravity, which is important for building space stations. 

A team from Utah State University tried to make solar sails from thin films in microgravity. They believe these sails could help satellites use the sun's energy like a sailboat uses the wind. 

After two hours of flying, the students felt excited, not sick. One student said, ""It was an unforgettable experience. I want to be an astronaut even more now.""

Jonathon Porritt is a writer. He wrote a book called ""Seeing Green - The Politics of Ecology."" 

Jonathon had a strange time in his life when he did not have any summers. He went to New Zealand every summer, but it was winter there. So, he had nine winters in a row. He liked winter. His parents had an idea to buy a small piece of land for Jonathon and his brother and sister to take care of. His mother said, ""If you plant trees, you can have it."" They wanted to have a connection to New Zealand because Jonathon's father grew up there. They found land about 20 miles north of Auckland in a place called Rangitoupuni. The land was not very good, but it was good for planting trees.

Jonathon liked land a lot. He worked in Australia on farms before. So, he was excited to plant trees. He started planting in 1968, and by 1972, he and his siblings had planted 70 acres of trees. In 1968, it rained a lot while they were planting. It was a happy time, even though it was very wet and cold. Every morning, he had to get ready to plant trees in the rain. 

At first, Jonathon had a helper who knew how to plant trees. This was good because Jonathon had never done it before. He used a planting bag to carry trees. When the bag was full, it was heavy. It was easier when the bag was lighter. The hardest part was making straight lines to plant the trees. They used poles to help with this. Once they were in line, they planted the trees in a row.

Jonathon liked hard work, and it made him fit. After a while, he could plant trees easily. He learned a rhythm for planting. He took the tree out of the bag, dug a hole, put the tree in, and moved on. While planting, he thought a lot about nature and life. 

Jonathon went back to New Zealand four times and saw the trees grow. This made him happy because he planted them. He worried when he read about bad weather in New Zealand. But the trees grew well, and they are now 20 years old. 

In 1984, Jonathon took time off from teaching and went back to New Zealand alone for three months. He wrote his first book there. He stayed in a simple cabin with just a bed, a table, and a chair. In the mornings, he wrote. In the afternoons, he took care of the trees. He still feels a strong connection to that place. It is very important to him.

CAE_10,"**Text: 'CARING FOR BADGER CUBS'**

One day, I saw a helper bring a cardboard box to me. My husband Derek and I have an open farm in Somerset. We help orphaned animals. I heard strange noises from the box. I looked inside and saw three small grey badger cubs. They were about eight inches long. They had soft fur and looked up at me with their milky eyes. I had never seen badger cubs before. 

Badger cubs are usually born between January and March. They live underground and if they lose their mother, they can die. These three cubs were found by builders. The builders accidentally hurt their home while working. The mother was dead, but the cubs were still alive. They were cold and scared. I took them to my kitchen to keep them warm. There were two girls named Primrose and Bluebell, and one boy named Willow. 

At first, I fed them with a syringe. I had to wipe them with a warm cloth to help them feel like their mother was licking them. This helped them go to the bathroom. For the first few days, I fed them every four hours. After a week, they learned to drink from a bottle and started to move around. They were happy with each other and a warm pad. 

Three weeks later, I saw that Willow was not very active, but he was still eating. I should have acted quickly. The next morning, I found him dead. The vet said he had a lung infection. It was important to feed him slowly, but I did not know this. I felt sad about Willow, but I continued to care for the other cubs. 

Then, a farmer came to see me. He found another male cub, alone and hungry. I named him Willow II. He was younger than the girls. Feeding him was hard. I had to move the bottle around to help him drink. By the end of April, the girls were eating rice and other food. Willow II was happy to stop using the bottle, but he made a mess when he ate. 

After a week, I gave him a sausage, and he learned to eat it. Soon, all the cubs were eating cereals, meat, vegetables, fruit, and nuts. Badgers usually eat earthworms, bugs, and small animals. My badgers were lucky because it was a hot summer, and finding food was hard for others. 

By August, the badgers started to be active at night. We took walks in the orchard. The cubs would play and chase each other. I learned to avoid their playful bites. One night, I saw other badgers in our field. They were looking for food. Badgers protect their homes, so we had to be careful. 

The local news took pictures of me with the badgers. Many people wanted to help build a home for them. We made plans for a sett with tunnels and a special gate. It took a lot of money, but local businesses helped us. 

One evening, the badgers moved into their new home. I watched them for a while and then left them alone. Later, I checked on them and saw three badgers sleeping. Now, I do not walk with them as much because they wake up late. Primrose has moved to another sett, but Bluebell and Willow II still come to say hello before they run off into the night. This is their home now."
CAE_67,"**Text: In Search of True North - The Man Behind Halley's Comet**

Dr. Toby Clark is a researcher at the British Geological Survey. He wants to follow the journey of Sir Edmund Halley, who studied compass variations. Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is famous for the comet named after him. He also did important work to understand how compasses work. 

Halley used his sea trips on a warship called Paramore to study the ""variations of the compass."" These variations are called ""declination."" Declination is the angle between magnetic north and true north. Sailors needed this information to use their compasses correctly and navigate the oceans.

Halley planned to travel to the Cape Verde Islands to study declination in the North and South Atlantic. His first trip ended early because of problems with the crew. But he tried again. This time, he traveled to Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, Newfoundland, and back to England. In 1701, he published a chart showing the variations of the compass in the oceans.

Dr. Clark wants to celebrate the 300th anniversary of Halley's trip by retracing his route. He needs to raise £70,000 for this journey. Sir Vivian Fuchs, who led the first expedition across Antarctica, is helping him.

Dr. Clark became interested in Halley while he was in Antarctica. He read about Halley's life. Dr. Clark says, ""Halley was a great scientist. He did many things, not just astronomy. He also helped Sir Isaac Newton with his work.""

Dr. Clark's journey, called ""In the Wake of the Paramore,"" will also be scientific. He will take measurements like Halley did, but with better tools. The Earth's magnetic field changes slowly, so these measurements are important. 

Dr. Clark explains, ""We need to know true north to measure the direction of the magnetic field."" He will use satellites to help with this. The British Geological Survey and the United States Navy will provide instruments for the trip.

Halley's journey was the first scientific expedition at sea. He was the first civilian to be a naval captain for this kind of work. 

Dr. Clark has experience for this journey. He spent two years in Antarctica and has sailed from Rio de Janeiro to England. He plans to complete the expedition in four parts with different crews. 

When asked if he is obsessed like Halley, Dr. Clark says, ""I am ready to spend eight months on this journey. Some people might think I am obsessed, but I want to do this for a good reason. Halley and his life inspire me."""

**PEACOCKS IN WHIPSNADE**

Every summer, peacocks walk around Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire. They show their beautiful tails to the hens. This is a mystery that Charles Darwin thought about a lot. He wondered how birds could have such big and colorful tails in nature, where it is hard to survive. 

Darwin said that living things change over time through evolution. He believed that the strongest animals survive and have babies. But he thought that peacocks' tails were not useful for survival. So, he created the idea of ""sexual selection."" This means that female birds like beautiful males just because they are beautiful.

Darwin's friend, Alfred Russel Wallace, had a different idea. He thought that if hens liked the males with the biggest tails, then those males must have something special that helps them survive. 

Now, 100 years later, scientists are still studying this. At Whipsnade, there are 200 peacocks that live like wild birds but are used to people. Marion Petrie and her team want to answer two questions: Do peahens really choose the males with the biggest tails? And do these males have something extra that helps them survive?

The peacocks show off their tails in groups, and the hens choose the best ones. Observations show that hens like the males with the most eye spots on their tails. These males attract more mates. But it is still unclear if these males are better in other ways.

William Hamilton from Oxford University thinks that showy male birds are healthier and have fewer parasites. This means their beautiful feathers show they are healthy. However, Dr. Petrie and her team have not been able to check the health of the peacocks at Whipsnade yet.

This year, Dr. Petrie is studying the babies of attractive and unattractive males. She wants to see if the babies of attractive males grow faster and are healthier. If they are, it would mean that the hens' choice is smart, just like Wallace said.

There is also an interesting idea from a mathematician named R A Fisher. He said that if a female chooses a male with a slightly better tail, their sons will have long tails, and their daughters will like long tails. This could lead to more males with long tails over time. This idea supports Darwin's thought that females might choose beauty for beauty's sake. 

**Questions:**

1. Where do the peacocks live?
2. What do peacocks show to the hens?
3. Who thought about the mystery of peacocks' tails?
4. What is ""sexual selection""?
5. What do the hens like in male peacocks?
6. What is Dr. Petrie studying this year?"
CAE_66,"**THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS**

Tom Cunliffe says the best boat design should mix old and new ideas. He made this idea real with his boat, 'The Westerman'. This week, the Summer Boat Show in London has many beautiful yachts with new technology. Most of these boats come from a big change in boat design that happened 25 years ago. 

My boat is different. It is quiet and sits in a tidal creek on the south coast. It was designed last year, but it looks like it is 100 years old. Some people might think I am a romantic for owning it. Maybe I am, but I don’t think so. My boat uses old boat design ideas, but modern technology helped a lot. 

However, new technology can sometimes keep sailors away from the real sea life. Sailors often want to feel the sea when they go sailing. I don’t think sailors should go back to having a hard life. I like my boats to have a stove for warmth and comfortable places to sleep. But why should every sail work by itself? Sometimes, dealing with sails is part of being a sailor. 

A boat should be a boat, not a big house on the water. When I bought my first boat, Hirta, I sailed around Britain for a TV race. The last owner said she had comfort but no luxury. Hirta taught me that this was true. She had heavy sails, no running water, no electricity, no fridge, no heating, and no electronics, but she was the easiest boat I ever sailed. 

On land, classic boats need a lot of care. When I hurt my back, I knew I had to stop sailing Hirta. I looked for a younger boat but could not find one, so I decided to build a new boat. The Westerman has never let me down. 

The designer, Nigel Irens, used a computer to help design the boat, but he first drew it on a paper napkin. After making a model, we changed the design until it was perfect. The finished boat has crossed the North Atlantic and won four out of six races. It looks great, moves well in the sea, and feels peaceful inside. 

This is because it was made just for sailing, not for furniture. It shows that you don’t need to follow trends to be happy, and sometimes it is good to learn from the past. Made from special wood, the boat does not take in water. It has the good parts of a fiberglass boat but looks and feels like a real boat."

Health farms and country hotels with spas are very popular now. We asked five journalists to visit some of these places.

**A. HENLOW GRANGE**  
I was happy to go to Henlow Grange for six days because I was tired and needed to relax. My room in the big old house was very comfortable. On the first day, I did nothing and slept a lot. From the second day, I started to join classes like yoga and body conditioning. The teachers were very good. I felt more flexible as the week went on. They have many treatments, like aromatherapy, seaweed baths, manicures, and pedicures. The facial treatment made me feel like a new person. The staff were very friendly and professional. Henlow is planning to make some big changes this year, including a swimming pool. You can also ride bicycles around the grounds. If you want to relax, you can read a magazine or take a walk in the garden. I felt great when I left and I want to visit again. This is a perfect place for busy women. 

**B. SHRUBLAND HALL**  
Shrubland Hall is a calm and relaxing place. When I arrived, I saw a big staircase and a nice library. Everyone gets a health check when they arrive. They check your weight and blood pressure. I was called a patient, which felt strange because I am healthy. They found a shoulder problem and helped me with it. Each person gets a special diet. I lost weight but felt hungry. My meals included grapefruit, salads, and fruit. If you are not on a diet, you can eat tasty food in the dining hall. You can also have massages or water therapy. 

**C. CAREYS MANOR**  
Careys Manor is not a health farm, but it is a nice old hotel with cozy fires and a big lounge. If you want to lose weight, you might not enjoy the rich food. The chef makes delicious meals. The hotel has a gym and a pool to help you stay fit. There is also a spa and a clinic for sports injuries. I got advice for my shoulder pain. Careys is comfortable and relaxing, and there is beautiful countryside to explore.

**D. CLIVEDEN**  
Cliveden is a beautiful country home and a five-star hotel. It treats guests very well. They offer health and beauty treatments, a gym, saunas, a swimming pool, and horse riding. There are lovely walks and gardens. The restaurant has amazing food. I enjoyed my meal, especially the dessert. The next morning, I spent time in the gym to burn some calories. I also had a facial and a massage. Cliveden has everything you need for fitness and relaxation.

**E. SPRINGS HYDRO**  
The best thing about Springs Hydro is the carrot cake. It is very tasty but has a lot of calories. The second best thing is the aromatherapy massage. I felt so relaxed during the massage that I fell asleep. The hotel is modern and has many beauty rooms. There are many treatments available, like manicures and facials. The guests are a mix of people, from families to friends. I would love to visit Springs Hydro every month."
CAE_22,"**NATURAL TALENTS**

Humans and chimpanzees have been separate for about seven million years. We are still very similar to chimpanzees. We share more than 98% of our genes with them. This means that the differences between humans and animals are very new. 

Our ability to make art and do other things that are special to humans comes from just a small part of our genes. Studies show that many things we thought were only human are also found in animals. For example, both humans and wild chimpanzees use tools. Chimpanzees use sticks to eat and to fight. Sea otters use rocks to open clams. 

Monkeys also have a simple form of language. They make different sounds to warn each other about leopards, eagles, and snakes. This shows that there are not many big differences between humans and animals, except for art.

If art is special to humans, it is strange that our ancestors did not make art for almost seven million years. The first art might have been wood carvings or body painting, but we cannot find these old materials. The first clear evidence of human art is from about 35,000 years ago. This includes cave paintings, statues, necklaces, and musical instruments.

Some people say that human art is different from animal art in three ways: 

1. Human art is not made for a purpose. 
2. Human art is made for beauty and pleasure. 
3. Human art is learned, not instinctive.

Oscar Wilde said, ""All art is quite useless."" This means that human art does not help us survive like animal behaviors do. Some human art does communicate ideas, but this is not the same as passing on genes. Bird songs help birds defend their territory and attract mates, which helps them pass on their genes. 

The second point is that we do not know if birds enjoy their songs. They sing mostly during the breeding season, so they may not sing just for fun. This makes human art seem special.

The third point is that human art styles are learned. Different groups of people have different art styles. For example, songs in Tokyo are different from songs in Paris. People can learn each other's songs. But some birds are born knowing how to sing their species' songs. They can sing even if they have never heard the song before.

Human art changes quickly. For example, people can tell when a painting was made just by looking at it. In 1957, two chimpanzees named Congo and Betsy had an art show in London. Congo made many paintings and was upset when his pencil was taken away. Their paintings were sold, which is something many human artists cannot do.

These chimpanzee paintings show that the line between human art and animal behavior is not so clear. Like human art, the chimpanzee paintings were made for enjoyment, not for a specific purpose. Some people might say that human art is different because it is meant to communicate. However, some famous human art was made just for the artist's own pleasure."
CAE_39,"**Text: A Big Adventure**

The Taklamakan Desert in western China is a very big and dangerous place. Charles Blackmore crossed it and lived to tell his story. There are not many big adventures left in the world. In the past, stories for children were about brave explorers. These explorers had sunburnt skin and looked far into the distance. Today, we do not see such people in stories or in real life. But then I met Charles Blackmore.

Charles Blackmore led a group of people across the Taklamakan Desert. The desert is very hard to cross. Its name means ""once you enter, you never come out,"" and local people call it the Desert of Death. Charles talked about the dangers and excitement of his journey at home with his family. 

His team had four British people (one was a doctor), an American photographer, four Chinese experts, 30 camels, and six camel handlers. The camel handlers had never worked with camels before; they were truck drivers. This mistake could have been very dangerous for everyone. 

They set out to cross 1,200 kilometers of the desert. Charles Blackmore wrote a fascinating story about their journey. At that time, he was leaving the Army after 14 years. He wanted to have fun and find out who he really was. His wife, Tina, was worried that he might not come back because no one had ever crossed that route before. 

It took them 59 days to cross the desert. Charles said the desert was very kind to them. The team faced many problems: they got sick, felt very hot and thirsty, and lost some of their water. But they found water when they needed it. They did not have to deal with big sandstorms or very cold weather. 

Charles said, ""What pushed me to keep going was the need to survive. We had no backup plan. We were alone in the desert."" He was scared about whether he could finish the trip. On the first day, it was so hot that he could hardly breathe. He thought, ""We have to do this now!"" 

After walking 1,000 kilometers, they did not want to stop. They were very thin but strong. Charles felt fit and could walk over anything. 

In the middle of the book, Charles described lying in the desert and looking at the full moon while thinking of his family. He felt he needed to find peace with himself. He said, ""I feel prouder of this trip than anything else I have done. But my family and our happiness are more important than the desert.""

Has Charles Blackmore found peace? He said, ""I want the challenge and the open spaces. I find it hard to live in the same way as everyone else today."""

Susan Harr is tired of technology. She decides to unplug her gadgets and enjoy doing things by hand. Many people love technology because it makes life easier. We think we need gadgets to save time. But Susan had a bad experience with her broken computer. It cost her a lot of money to fix it. She wonders if we really need all this technology.

Little by little, Susan stops using some of her gadgets. She thinks about what ""time"" technology gives us. Does it really give us more time for fun? She feels that companies trick us into buying more gadgets. When her computer made strange noises, she put it outside. Now, she is not tied to a noisy machine. She can take her time to sew by hand.

Susan knows some gadgets are useful, like her washing machine. But she also finds joy in not using some gadgets. She and her family watched too much TV, so they returned their color TV and now use a small black-and-white one. This helps them spend more time walking their dog, reading, and talking. Susan used to have a sewing machine, but now she sews by hand. 

She thinks people believe they cannot live without gadgets. But she enjoys sewing and listening to the radio or talking to friends. She can even watch TV while doing simple sewing. Sewing by hand is relaxing, and she feels happy doing it. 

Susan also enjoys washing dishes by hand. She thinks about what gadgets she really needs. Do they need a freezer, a microwave, or an electric lawnmower? She believes they could save money by not using so many electric things.

CAE_62,"Text: 'Charles Hurst is a cabinet-maker. He makes beautiful furniture. Joanna Watt meets him. Charles Hurst seems to be a busy man. When I arrive at his workshop in East London, he greets me quickly and says, ""Well, let's start!"" He is busy, and his workshop is full of furniture pieces and wood in many colors. Hurst has been a cabinet-maker for ten years. He has a good reputation. Many people want to order furniture from him, and he is very busy. 

It is not hard to find a furniture-maker, but it is hard to find one who makes furniture with good quality. Hurst says, ""There are not many real cabinet-makers now. Many people just call themselves furniture-makers."" He is not happy with some modern furniture. He thinks some furniture-makers do not make good work. Hurst wants to make perfect furniture, and this is why he is successful. He is confident in his skills. He says, ""I have a natural ability. I have always been good at making things."" 

Hurst learned his craft by asking questions. Most of his work comes from private clients. Some clients come back to him many times. He enjoys making furniture for their whole house. But sometimes, clients do not know what they want, and this can be frustrating. He likes clients who know what they want. 

Hurst is proud of his work, but he also respects other craftsmen. He says, ""There are people better than me."" He does not like craftsmen who take a long time to make one piece of furniture. He thinks furniture should be useful, not just a fashion statement. Hurst is confident, but he is also humble. He says, ""After all, I am only making furniture,"" as I leave.'"
CAE_49,"**Text: Three Theories About Sleep**

People spend about one-third of their lives sleeping. Sleep is very important for us. But, scientists do not agree on why we need sleep. There are three main ideas.

The first idea says that sleep is good for our bodies. When we sleep, our bodies fix themselves and get better. 

The second idea is about learning. This idea says that sleep helps us remember things we learned during the day. Without sleep, we cannot learn well.

The third idea is about energy. This idea says we need sleep to have energy for the next day. Sleep helps us feel ready and strong."
CAE_31,"**ECCENTRICS**

An eccentric is a person who acts differently from most people. They do not follow the usual rules of their society. This makes us think, ""What is normal?"" Many of us have our own strange habits. For example, some people like to enter contests in newspapers, collect beer mats, or write letters to the newspaper about many topics.

Eccentricity shows our individuality. Inside us, there is a struggle between two feelings. One feeling is to be ourselves, and the other is to fit in with others. Most people want to be accepted and liked, so they often choose to fit in rather than stand out.

People with unusual hobbies or strong opinions often find each other. They create clubs and hold meetings to talk about what they like or their problems. They want to share their interests with others who understand them. Being in a group can make them feel better.

We all feel a mix of wanting to be ourselves and wanting to fit in. Even when we follow the crowd, we may not like it when someone says we are doing that. For example, a man at a bar might say, ""I say what I think,"" to show he is different. 

Anyone can choose to be more individual. Many successful people do this. Bob Dylan, a famous American singer, said, ""When you feel what you are doing and go for it, you will surprise many people."" But being different is not the same as trying to be noticed. 

If a singer wears strange clothes just to get attention, that is not eccentricity. But if they keep being different for a long time, they may become eccentric. The key to eccentricity is being natural. Eccentrics do not try to be odd; they just are.

True eccentrics do not care much about what others think. They act based on who they are. This makes them different from people who want to impress others or escape from society. Eccentrics live their lives happily, no matter what others think."
CAE_58,"**Simplified Text: Natural Books**

We asked four nature experts to tell us about a book about wildlife that has influenced them the most.

**A. Geoffrey Lean**  
It was easy to choose the author. I am an environmental journalist, and I have met many important people in this field. One of them is Barbara Ward. She is a small, frail woman, but she is very important for environmental issues in Europe after the war. She combined her experiences from different environmental movements into her own ideas. When I was a young journalist, she helped me understand these issues. Choosing the book was harder. It could have been ""Only One Earth"" or ""Progress for a Small Planet."" But I think Barbara's most important book is ""The Home of Man."" It talks about the fast growth of cities and important themes in her life. It is a strong call for what we now call ""sustainable human development."" I have read many books since, but none are as good as this one.

**B. Linda Bennett**  
When I read ""Signals for Survival"" by Niko Tinbergen, I can hear the calls of herring gulls and remember the smell of the guano in the sun. This book explains well, with words and pictures, how animals communicate. If you read ""Signals for Survival"" and then watch a gull colony, you will see how their chaos turns into a smart social structure. You can see which birds are partners and where their boundaries are. Niko Tinbergen was a great behaviorist who wanted to explain his work to everyone. He worked with a talented wildlife artist, Eric Ennion, to make this book interesting for all wildlife lovers. Eric's paintings show how one gull is aggressive and how another is calm. This is the art of a true naturalist.

**C. Lee Durrell**  
The book that has influenced my life the most is ""My Family and Other Animals"" by Gerald Durrell. This book helped me find a wonderful husband and a great career in conservation. It also made me love the natural world. I was doing research on animal sounds in Madagascar when I first read this book. I had been there for two years and was feeling sad because of many problems. But when I opened ""My Family and Other Animals,"" my world became brighter. The book shows animals, people, joy, and beauty together. Many people say humans are bad because of what we have done to other species. But I like to remember Gerald as a boy in the book, seeing all living things as a family. This is a concept we all need to understand.

**D. Bruce Pearson**  
I found ""The Shell Bird Book"" by James Fisher in my school library after it was published in 1966. I was drawn to it because of the 48 beautiful pictures of birds by Eric Ennion. I already had other bird books and had spent holidays learning to identify birds. These books made me start sketching what I saw. But ""The Shell Bird Book"" had much more. It had beautiful paintings, chapters on bird migration, the history of birds in Britain, and even a chapter on birds in music and art. This book helped me appreciate birds and nature more. It showed me that my feelings and creativity about nature are just as important as scientific facts. Since art was my stronger subject, I began to see new opportunities for myself."
CAE_37,"**Text: DO REVIEWS SELL BOOKS?**

We asked five British publishers if book reviews help sell books. Here is what they said.

**Publisher A**  
Reviews are very important for publishers. They look at reviews first in the newspaper. A study showed that many people buy a book because of reviews, more than because of ads or word of mouth. Authors feel sad when there are no reviews. Publishers also feel sad, but they think that any review, good or bad, can help sell books. They like reviews that match their own feelings about a book.

**Publisher B**  
Publishers and newspapers both want good book reviews, but they want different things. Newspapers want to entertain their readers, while publishers want their books to be reviewed well. Book reviews are better now than 40 years ago, but many paperback books still do not get enough attention. Publishers need reviews to help people know about their books. Good reviews can help sell books, especially if there are many of them.

**Publisher C**  
Reviews are very important for publishing. Many books are not by famous authors, so publishers need good reviews to sell them. Good reviews are better than ads because they show the reader that the review is honest. Good reviews can help a book sell well, but they need help from other things like recommendations from friends and good marketing.

**Publisher D**  
In Britain, the connection between publishing and reviewing is not clear. In the United States, a review in the New York Times can make a book popular. In Britain, bookshops may not pay much attention to reviews. Sometimes, it takes many years for people to notice a good writer. Some books that get bad reviews can still sell very well. Non-fiction books allow reviewers to talk more about the subject than the book itself.

**Publisher E**  
All publishers and writers want great reviews. But do they help sell books? I published a biography with great reviews, but it did not sell well because people thought they could just read the reviews instead of buying the book. The name of the reviewer can matter. Thirty years ago, if certain reviewers liked a book, people would buy it. Now, sometimes a surprising reviewer or a clever review can make people want to buy the book."

Making weathervanes is an old skill. It started in ancient Egypt. Today, Graham Smith makes weathervanes in his workshop. He is one of the few people in the country who makes them by hand. Graham creates special designs for his customers. He says, ""This way, I can make a unique gift."" Many of his customers are women who want to buy gifts for their husbands. They want something special that shows the man's job or hobbies.

Most weathervanes are shaped like cockerels, but Graham's first weathervane was a witch on a broomstick. His friends liked it and asked him to make weathervanes for them. Graham saw that he could make many different designs. He decided to start a weathervane business. Before this, he worked as a precision engineer for 15 years. Then, he and his wife, Liz, changed jobs. Liz went to work, and Graham stayed home to take care of the children and build his business. This was five years ago, and he is happy with his choice. He says, ""My old job was not creative, but this work is exciting.""

Graham has made over 100 original designs. He pays attention to detail and always asks the customer to approve the design before he cuts it by hand. He also keeps traditional designs in stock because people like them too. Graham says, ""People like handmade things. They want something different.""

Graham does not want to grow his business. He wants to keep it a small craft. He enjoys making unique weathervanes. He says, ""For many years, weathervanes have helped people know the weather by showing wind direction."" Now, more people are moving to the countryside and want special items for their homes. This helps crafts like his.

Graham is busy and sends weathervanes to customers all over the world. People from America and Denmark are especially interested. He says, ""The price depends on how detailed the design is."" His latest request was for a weathervane shaped like a curly-coated dog. No matter the occasion, Graham can create a special gift."

**A New Writer's Success**

Before it was published, *The Horse Whisperer* was a very popular book. It is the first novel by British writer Nicholas Evans. He earned a lot of money from it. Here, he talks about his ideas and success.

At the start of the year, Nicholas Evans was not doing well. A film he was working on did not happen. He was worried because he had not made money for two years. He needed money to pay the bank. A smart person would have found a job, but Nicholas did something different. He bought a ticket to America to research his first novel for three months.

Nicholas had an idea for the story from a farrier he met in Dartmoor. The farrier told him about a calm horse that suddenly became very angry. The owners were sad until they heard about a gypsy who could talk to the horse and change its behavior. These people are called ""horse whisperers."" Nicholas was very interested in this idea.

He started to learn more about horses and the people who work with them. He drove around the US, visiting ranches. He felt alone and worried about his life. He had tried to be a filmmaker for ten years, but now he was in debt and worried about his family.

By the end of August, he had written the first half of the book. The bank manager was getting angry, and he needed to know if he should keep going. He showed the book to a friend who was a literary agent. The friend said it was ""fine"" and thought Nicholas could get $30,000 for it. Nicholas needed this money to pay off some of his debt.

In October, he sent the first two hundred pages of the book to seven publishers in the UK. Soon, his agent called to say that they had turned down the first offer of $75,000. Nicholas was surprised. His agent felt something good was going to happen.

A week later, the book was sold for $550,000 in the UK and $3.15 million in the US. This was a record for a first novel. Nicholas and his team could not believe it. They did not send the book to New York, but it got there anyway. Many movie studios wanted to make a film from it.

Nicholas was happy but also careful. He did not want to write the movie script because he liked the way things were going. He wanted to write another novel instead."

**Young Masters**

Bobby Fischer is getting older. He wants to play chess again. Chess is now a game for young people. After 20 years away, Bobby Fischer is back and playing against Boris Spassky, his old rival. Bobby won the first game, and it was a great game. But Bobby is now 49 years old. He has not played much and is not in good shape. Boris Spassky is also older.

Chess has changed a lot in the last 20 years. Bobby Fischer made chess popular. Now, many players want to win more than anything else. In chess today, a player needs to be strong and calm, not just smart. The game is very intense. Players have a chess clock to keep time. If they do not make their moves in time, they lose the game. Games can be long, and players often do not take breaks. This makes it harder for older players.

In the last 30 years, new world champions have been younger. Most of the top ten players are under 30 years old. Chess is also played differently now. Players prepare a lot before matches. Computers help players study many chess games. They can find out how to beat their opponents. In some matches, players have teams to help them prepare.

A chess game can last up to eight hours. Players must stay focused. If they lose concentration, they can lose the game. The chess clock makes it even more stressful. At the end of the game, players often rush to make their moves. They have only a few seconds to finish. This is very exciting and tense.

Winning a game feels great, but players must be ready for the next game. Chess tournaments can last 9 to 11 days, with games every day. World championship matches are even harder. One match in 1984 lasted for months and had to stop because the players were too tired.

Bobby Fischer loves chess. He once said, ""All I want to do is play chess."" He left chess after 1972, which was surprising. If he is back for money, he will earn a lot. But if he wants to prove he is the best, it could be very hard for him."

He left school at 16 but went back a year later. After finishing A-levels, he joined the Young People's Theatre. ""I wanted to write for actors. I wanted people to hear my writing,"" he says. ""I was happy to be with people who liked the same things. It was the first time I enjoyed learning.""

B. Simon Pegg is 28 years old. He studied drama at Bristol University. Now, he is writing a comedy show for TV and just finished a long tour with comedian Steve Coogan. He has always worked hard. Even in Bristol, he was practicing comedy in clubs. ""University was very theoretical,"" Simon remembers. ""I realized I did not want to be a regular actor. I liked comedy more. People think comedy is very hard, but it is not. If you have courage and good material, it is great to make people laugh."" He has worked with the comic group Funny Business, but his best work is with Steve Coogan. ""He saw my show, and I was a big fan of his,"" Simon says.

Ciaran acted in school plays and then joined the Ulster Youth Theatre for four years. ""I used acting to avoid homework,"" he laughs. ""But then I wanted to be serious about it because I liked it."" Now, he waits for praise, but he thinks about fame. ""When you are 18, you think you will love the photos and interviews, but you learn it is not why you act. It is about respect for good work.""

CAE_53,"**Text: Volunteer Tourism**

Four writers talk about international volunteer work.

A. It is hard to say that volunteer work helps a lot. Volunteer tourists can help build homes or schools, but they usually pay a lot of money to do this work. If this money went directly to a local community, it could pay for more help than one volunteer can give. This is especially true for gap years, where volunteers often do not need special skills or experience. Many studies ask if gap year volunteering is really about helping others or if young people want to improve their own careers. However, these projects can help people learn to be kind and help those who have less.

B. Volunteering can help people understand each other better. It can also help solve problems, allow more people to take part in global issues, and create international friendships. In this way, everyone can benefit, and it can help the world. But if only rich people can volunteer, it may help them in their careers but not help the communities that need it. Volunteers will keep getting benefits while using local organizations and communities to help themselves.

C. Sometimes, international volunteering can be like a rich person trying to help but really just helping themselves. It can also be a way to give real help to communities. When done well, volunteering can help both the volunteers and the organizations they work with. It can also help people understand and care about the problems of poverty and injustice.

D. Volunteer tourism fits with the idea of helping others. This idea can seem good, especially when people do not trust big governments or businesses. It seems positive because it focuses on personal help. But it can also ignore the need for real change in poor communities. Some people think volunteering is not enough. While volunteer tourism can be simple and good, when it is sold as a way to help develop communities, it can show a misunderstanding of the real problems of poverty in the world."

Stuart Harris reports

Many people listen to the radio in the morning. Most of us need an alarm to help us get out of bed. This is why we have clock radios. But how do you choose a good one?

I, Tom Granger (an inventor), and Paul Bridges (a broadcaster) tested five clock radios. One model has a 'dual alarm function'. This means you can set two different wake-up times. One for work days and one for weekends. But who really needs this? This model costs about the same as another one we tested. It has a cassette player, so you can listen to your own tapes to fall asleep and wake up to music. We all thought the radio quality was very good, but the clock radio is very big, like a rugby ball. Paul Bridges said, ""I need space on my bedside table for my keys, wallet, glasses, and phone. I always book a wake-up call just in case the alarm does not work.""

This model was voted the best. Paul Bridges said he loved it, but the clock kept getting stuck at 4:00 PM. I liked the digital display with nice grey numbers on a green background. The snooze button is wide, so you can tap it easily. However, the buttons felt nice to touch, and I accidentally pressed them too much. The clock has a backup battery, so it still works if the power goes out. We all liked this feature. But setting it up was hard. When we finally did it, we felt cool and smart.

Tom Granger said this model with a lamp was ""very cheap"" in quality. He had to read the instructions twice to make it work. The light was hard to move, and you could not read by it. Paul Bridges liked the lamp idea but said the radio was hard to tune. The buzzer sounded like a submarine alarm, and it made me want to throw it away. Still, this model is the third most popular one.

This clock radio is bright and colorful. Tom Granger and I liked it because it stands out. He said, ""I would choose this one because it is different."" The controls were easy to use, and we set it up without reading the instructions. But the alarm can be 20 minutes early or late. Paul Bridges laughed at this and said the model was ""very annoying"" and ""useless.""

The simplest and cheapest model was liked by Tom Granger because it was small and easy to use. It has old-fashioned dial tuning, which is easier to set up. With modern buttons, you are not sure if you pressed them right. He agreed that radio quality has improved with new technology. I thought the tuning was not very good, but the radio quality was fine. The buzzer on this model worked well; it got me out of bed in just two beeps!"
CAE_50,"**Text: Hedgehogs**

A hedgehog is a small animal with sharp spines on its body. Hedgehogs live in many parts of the world, but they are not found in America or Australia. When a hedgehog is in danger, it can roll into a tight ball. The spines stick out to protect it. Some hedgehogs, like those in the desert, have fewer spines. They may try to run away instead of rolling up. 

Hedgehogs are mostly active at night and sleep during the day. They sleep under bushes or in holes in the ground. All hedgehogs can hibernate, but not all do. Some hedgehogs stay awake all year if the weather is good."

It is hard to be good at any sport, even for men, but women have to work even harder. Training and competitions take a lot of time, so they must make sacrifices. But they are proving that they can succeed and break records. Here, we talk to some amazing British sportswomen who are reaching their goals.

A. **Jill, 27, Skier**  
""I love to ski and feel great when I jump and land well, but it can be scary. Sometimes I don’t feel good or the weather is bad, but I keep going. I train for ten months each year, so I don’t have much time for friends. There are six men and three women on the British team. We all compete together and are treated the same.""

B. **Caroline, 22, Cyclist**  
""Two years ago, I borrowed a bike for a charity race and I won! I was surprised because I had never cycled before. Now, I earn good money as a professional cyclist. I train for at least four hours every day, plus I do some stretching, swimming, and running. My boyfriend is also a cyclist, so he understands how much time it takes.""

C. **Annabel, 26, Rower**  
""Rowing is hard for girls because not many schools have rowing teams. Most girls start when they are 19 or 20, which makes it harder to compete internationally. Coaches often change, so it is difficult to have a strong team. But I enjoy it and like being fit, and I have fun with my teammates.""

D. **Ffyona, 24, Long Distance Walker**  
""When I was 13, I wanted to walk around the world. I didn’t know how big it was! Walking across Australia was very hard. I walked 50 miles a day with little sleep and had many blisters. But I set a record! Some people think women are less likely to succeed, so it is harder to get sponsors.""

E. **Lisa, 26, Saloon Car Racer**  
""Some men think they are better drivers. When I do well, they ignore me. Being a woman in racing can be tough. Men often want to beat me, and I have had many accidents. It is hard to earn money, and I spend what I make on my sport. More women are racing now, which is great!""

F. **Alison, 28, Triathlete**  
""I wake up at 5:30 three mornings a week to swim. I need to sleep on other mornings. In the evening, I cycle or run. Sometimes I feel very tired! Racing is hard, but I am happier when I stay fit. Men and women usually compete together, but the news often talks more about the men’s events. The prize money for women is not as good, but we are working to change that."""

One day, Richard Cork, who was 18 years old, met the famous artist Picasso. Richard was a student traveling in a van around Europe and Morocco. He ran out of money and found a job painting boats. He liked to draw and had a sketchbook with him.

Richard saw Picasso eating lunch at a restaurant in Cannes. Picasso was easy to recognize. He was sitting with his wife and some friends. Richard was surprised to see him there because Picasso usually stayed at home to work. Richard was nervous but asked Picasso for his signature. Picasso smiled and wrote his name on Richard's paper. Then he drew some lines on the page.

Richard was happy and started to talk to Picasso. They had trouble understanding each other because Picasso did not speak much English, and Richard did not speak much French. An American woman at the table helped them talk. She called Picasso ""the Maestro."" Richard told Picasso that he loved art and admired his work.

After a while, Richard went back to his boat. His friend asked him why he did not go back to talk to Picasso again. Richard took his sketchbook and returned to Picasso's table. He did not ask if he could draw Picasso's portrait because he was afraid Picasso would say no. Instead, he just started to draw.

When Picasso saw Richard drawing, he made funny faces to distract him. Richard wanted to stop, but he felt challenged to keep going. Finally, Picasso sat still for a few minutes, and Richard could study him. He noticed that Picasso looked strong and young for his age.

The American woman told Richard that Picasso wanted to see his drawing. Richard felt shy and thought it was not good enough. But Picasso wanted to see it. Richard showed him the drawing, and Picasso nodded. Then Picasso took the crayon and quickly drew a picture of Richard. It was very different from Richard's drawing.

Richard thanked Picasso and asked him to sign the new drawing. The American woman said that Picasso said he already gave Richard his signature. Richard felt lucky to meet Picasso and to have his attention. It was a very special moment for him."
CAE_12,"**Text: Shopping Tricks**

Have you ever gone to a store and bought more than you planned? Here are some tricks that stores use to make you spend more money.

A. **Fresh Food**  
Supermarkets know that people like fresh food. They often put fruits and vegetables at the entrance of the store. They might also have a bakery that makes the smell of fresh bread fill the store. The colors in the store, like green, can make you think of fresh food. But most of what supermarkets sell, like frozen food and cleaning products, is not fresh.

B. **Product Placement**  
Where products are in the store is very important. Supermarkets use computers to find out where people look for items the most. They put the most expensive products at eye level because people are more likely to buy them. Special bins with discounts can also attract shoppers. Sometimes, stores put items that go well together near each other, like ice cream and toppings.

C. **Moving Essentials**  
Supermarkets often place cheap items like bread and sugar far from the entrance. This way, shoppers pass by more expensive items on their way. Stores also put popular products far from the entrance, hoping that customers will look for them and see other items they might want to buy.

D. **Less is More**  
Some stores, like Next, show their clothes in a way that makes them look special. They do not put many items on display, which makes shoppers think the clothes are unique. This good design helps the store sell more clothes.

E. **Total Price**  
Shoppers often pay more attention to the total price of their shopping than to the price of each item. Supermarkets mix cheap and expensive items to attract customers. Sometimes, they sell cheap items at a loss to bring people into the store. They can get lower prices from manufacturers by buying in large amounts.

F. **Price Tags**  
In chain stores, shoppers usually buy fewer items and notice prices more. For example, a blouse priced at £14.99 seems cheaper than one at £15. This pricing can also help reduce theft in the store.

G. **Lighting**  
Stores think carefully about lighting. Chain stores try to use natural light so shoppers can see the true colors of clothes. Supermarkets use special lights to make fresh fruits and vegetables look better.

H. **Store Layout**  
Many chain stores use different carpets to guide shoppers. One pattern shows the way through the store, and another shows sales areas. This helps shoppers move through the store, but some may not want to explore the sales areas.

I. **In-Store Ads**  
When you enter a supermarket, you see big pictures of delicious food. In some stores in the U.S., shopping carts have screens that show ads for products while you shop. These ads are meant to catch the attention of shoppers and can increase sales a lot."

Chris Bonnington (58) is famous for climbing Mount Everest in 1985. He has also made new climbing paths in Britain and the Alps and has written many books, like Quest for Adventure and Everest the Hard Way. Robin Knox-Johnston (53) started his sea career in the Merchant Navy. In 1968-9, he was the first person to sail around the world alone in his boat, Sunhaili. He set a record by sailing from New York to the Lizard in 10 days. Chris and Robin worked together to sail and climb in Greenland. They wrote a book about their trip called Sea, Ice and Rock.

In 1979, Chris was working on Quest for Adventure. He called Robin for an interview, and Robin invited him to sail. Chris could teach Robin some climbing skills, and Robin could teach Chris about sailing. It was Chris's first time on a yacht. They sailed for a while and then stopped. Robin's wife and daughter stayed on the boat while Chris and Robin went to the shore to practice climbing. The climb was hard, but Chris was impressed with how steady Robin was. 

When they reached a big drop, Chris asked Robin if he had climbed before. Robin had not, so Chris showed him how to climb down. Robin wanted to use his arms like on his boat, but Chris wanted him to use his legs. Chris was not happy, but Robin got down safely. During this trip, Chris and Robin became good friends. Robin suggested they go on another trip to Greenland together.

Robin was a good leader. He asked everyone for their opinions before making decisions. Chris found sailing boring and hard. He liked being on land more than being at sea. Robin enjoyed fixing things on the boat. Chris sometimes felt useless because Robin was very skilled. There were six people on a small boat meant for four, so they were very close together. 

When they reached Greenland, Chris had to lead the climbing. He felt nervous about keeping Robin safe. Climbing the highest mountain in Greenland, called the Cathedral, was very hard. The first time they tried to reach the top, they climbed for 24 hours. On the way down, they were very tired. Robin trusted Chris and followed him. When it became too hard, they decided to turn back. Robin was also worried about their boat and if it would be okay in the ice, but he wanted to try climbing again.

The only time they had a problem was on the way home. They took turns watching the boat. Chris was supposed to wake up at 4 am, but Robin did not wake him. Robin thought he could do it alone. Chris felt that Robin did not trust him, and he told him. Robin said Chris was wrong to think that. They enjoyed their trip to Skye, but they really got to know each other during the Greenland trip. Chris found out that Robin was a kind and sensitive person.

CAE_8,"**A Simple History of the Apple**

Apples have been around for a very long time. They come in many colors, shapes, and sizes. But today, we might lose some of the old types of apples.

**Early Apples (8,000 BC)**  
People have eaten apples since ancient times. In Britain, they threw away apple seeds. About 10,000 years ago, people found apple remains near lakes in Switzerland and Italy. In Switzerland and near the Caucasus mountains, ancient people stored apple halves for winter. These apples were small and wild, called crab apples. They were very different from the apples we eat today.

**Norman Apples (1000 AD)**  
The Romans taught the French how to grow fruit. This knowledge came to Britain. The Romans brought some apple types, but they did not grow well in Britain. The French apples became more popular. British monks also grew new types of apples. Most apples we have today come from these old varieties.

**Medieval Apples (1200)**  
In the thirteenth century, many apple types became popular in Britain. The Old English Pearmain was a common dessert apple. The Costard was a cooking apple sold in markets. But bad weather and diseases made it hard to grow apples. Many apples were imported from other places. In the sixteenth century, King Henry VIII asked a fruit expert to learn about growing apples in France. He brought back many new apple types.

**Apples in New Lands (1750)**  
By the seventeenth century, apples were very popular in Britain. When people moved to Canada, Australia, the US, South Africa, and New Zealand, they took apples with them. Captain Bligh took apples to Australia. The Pilgrim Fathers took them to America. A man named Johnny Appleseed planted many apple trees in North America.

**New Apples (1850)**  
In Iowa, a farmer named Jesse Hiatt found a new apple tree. He named the apple 'Delicious' after a judge said it was very tasty. This apple became very popular. Another famous apple, Granny Smith, was found in Australia by Maria Anne Smith. She found a small tree growing from old fruit and took care of it. This tree grew green apples that became famous.

**Modern Apples (1950)**  
Today, apples are grown all over the world. Most apples come from a few types that are chosen for their looks and how well they travel, not for their taste. Many old apple types are disappearing. In the UK, some gardeners keep old varieties alive, but in the US, many apples are gone forever. People want more types of apples. We need to protect the different kinds of apples for everyone to enjoy."

Richard Nerurkar is a long-distance runner from Britain. He visits a training camp in Kenya. This camp is ten miles south of the equator, near Mount Kenya, which is the highest mountain in Kenya. For three years, Richard has trained in Kenya, but he has never run with Kenyan runners before. On his fourth trip, he decided to change this. He ran in his first race in Kenya and stayed at the national team training camp. This camp is where the best Kenyan runners train for big competitions.

Richard was invited to the camp after he finished fifth in a big race. He was happy to go because training at high places helps runners. It makes their bodies better at using oxygen. Many Kenyan runners are successful because of this training.

Richard's first race in Africa was in Nairobi. It was the first international cross-country race in Africa. He finished behind 41 runners, and most of them were Kenyan. He felt good about his race, even though he did not win. He thinks that Kenyan runners are not just good because of the high altitude. They also have a simple and relaxed way of running. They enjoy competing and have a good diet.

At the training camp, Richard learned how the Kenyan runners train. The camp is at St Mark's College, high up on Mount Kenya. The runners live with other students in simple rooms. They train three times a day: a morning run, interval training in the middle of the day, and another run in the afternoon. They start their day at six in the morning. The coach tells them to run easy because they have a hard day ahead. They run about 40 kilometers each day, except on Sundays when they run 20 kilometers.

Life at the camp is simple. They wash their faces and brush their teeth before breakfast. Breakfast is tea, bread, and boiled eggs. Lunch and dinner are similar: ugali (a maize dish), stew, cabbage or spinach, and tea. After running, they go to a stream to wash.

By the end of his stay, Richard understood more about why Kenyan runners are successful. It is not just because of their genes or where they live. He thinks the simple life in the mountains, hard training, and love for running are the real reasons for their success. 

**Questions:**

1. Who is Richard Nerurkar?
2. Where is the training camp located?
3. How many times a day do the runners train?
4. What do they eat for breakfast?
5. Why does Richard think Kenyan runners are successful?"

**The Problems with Advertising**

Many people know that advertising is not doing well. This is not just because of the economy. Advertising started to go down in 1989, before the economy got bad. The problems with advertising are serious and happen all over the world. 

Advertising has not changed with the economy. Advertisers think about big groups of people, but now there are many different groups. Even big brands should try to reach smaller groups, but they usually do not. This is a big problem for advertising.

Think about your shopping. When you go to a supermarket, you might buy 30, 40, or even 50 items. Most of these items are not from brands you see in ads. You might buy a few well-known brands, but you do not buy many different brands in a year. You probably buy about 400 different brands each year, but there are many more brands advertised.

There are about 32,500 brands and services that are advertised. But most people only buy a small number of these brands. This means that a lot of advertising is not effective. When you watch TV, count how many ads are for brands you buy. Most people find that only about 1 in 16 ads are for brands they might buy. 

Many people think they are different and do not pay attention to ads, but this is not true. Most people do not buy most of the brands they see in ads. It is normal for advertising to waste money because not everyone will buy the products they see.

Even though advertising can waste money, it can still be effective. Advertisers need to reach many people to find the few who will buy their products. They cannot know who will buy before they advertise. 

If an advertiser knows who will buy, they can talk to them directly. But this is not possible with ads. If an advertising campaign can get 2% of the population to buy a product, it is very successful. 

To make advertising work better, it needs to be more focused on specific groups of people."

Charles Clover visits a very green home in Southwell, Nottinghamshire, England. This place has two interesting things. First, it has Southwell Minster, a little-known old cathedral with carvings of 'green' men made by craftsmen long ago. Second, it has the 'autonomous house,' built by Robert and Brenda Vale. 

The Vales use rainwater for washing and drinking. They recycle their waste into compost for the garden. They also heat their home using heat from their appliances and their own bodies, along with their three teenage children and two cats, Edison and Faraday. The house looks traditional with a clay tile roof and is located 300 yards from the Minster. It was built to match the old buildings in the town and was approved by planners.

When you ring the solar-powered doorbell, it is very quiet inside. The house is well-insulated, so you cannot hear anything. Inside, it is calm and peaceful. On a sunny summer day, the windows are closed, and the conservatory warms the air. Robert opens special windows to let fresh air in. The house is designed to keep out drafts, even the cats have their own small door.

Robert and Brenda teach architecture at Nottingham University. They cared about the environment before it was popular. They wrote a book about green homes in the 1970s. They wanted to build a house that did not produce carbon dioxide. They also decided to not use mains water. They made special toilets and used rainwater tanks. They filter the water before using it. Water from washing goes into the garden. They do not use a dishwasher because they do not want to use strong soaps.

Robert says they want to show that it is possible to build a house that is good for the environment. The house looks modern, but the hall has a staircase that goes up to the top. The Vales do not pay for water. Last winter, they used only nine units of electricity a day, which is much less than other four-bedroom houses. Soon, they will add solar panels to make even more electricity. They will still use mains electricity for cooking but will have extra electricity to charge an electric car.

The only heat in the house comes from a small wood stove, which they do not use much. One night in February, Robert said it was too warm to light the fire. The temperature was 18C, which is lower than usual, but he felt comfortable because there were no drafts. He says that people used to feel warm in colder homes because of their clothing. 

The house is simple and easy to build. Most materials were bought from local shops and built by local workers. This made the house cheap to build, the same price as low-cost rental homes. Many building companies do not like this idea. 

**Questions:**

1. What is the name of the cathedral in Southwell?
2. Who built the 'autonomous house'?
3. What do the Vales use for washing and drinking?
4. How do they heat their house?
5. What do they do with the water from washing?

Arthur Conan Doyle wrote the Sherlock Holmes stories. He thought he was a smart man and a scientist. In 1920, he saw pictures of fairies in a garden. He believed these pictures were proof that fairies were real. He wrote an article and published the pictures, saying fairies are wonderful.

In 1939, the two women who took the pictures said they were fake. They cut out pictures of fairies from a book and put them in the flowers. The pictures are very pretty. But this shows that photography can be tricked. People often think that a camera always tells the truth. But it can lie. Today, we can change pictures with computers. Photography has never been completely true.'"
CAE_11,"**Text: Blacksmiths**

For a long time, iron has been very important to people. The men who work with iron, called blacksmiths, are not just skilled workers; they are also seen as artists. Before the Industrial Revolution, blacksmiths were as respected as doctors because they made weapons, armor, and tools for farming.

In the 1700s, blacksmiths made beautiful ironwork for places like St Paul's Cathedral. In France and Belgium, blacksmiths created lovely metal designs for buildings. However, by the late 1960s, there were not many blacksmiths left in Britain because heavy industry did not need them anymore. Modern architects often did not use beautiful ironwork.

In the last 10 years, blacksmithing has become popular again. People are more interested in decorative architecture and new interior design. However, much of the new work looks similar to old styles, like ""classical"" or ""Victorian-style."" You can find many trendy stores selling rusty candlesticks.

There are events happening soon to promote blacksmithing. The first event is an exhibition of ironwork by the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA). It opened last week at the Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey. Alan Dawson, the secretary of BABA, says this could be the start of a new Iron Age. He believes that both the public and blacksmiths are seeing new possibilities.

With power tools, blacksmiths can work more easily. They can bend and shape metal without much effort. Dawson says, ""These artists can now express themselves with metal."" About 250 pieces of work are in the show, including bookends and a spiral staircase. Prices start at £90 and can go much higher. Most of the money will go to the blacksmiths, but some will help promote good ironwork.

Dawson has made an eight-foot gate and a lamp with a glass shade. He says, ""I let the steel bend and flow when it is hot. It is like drawing with metal."" Many artists love working with iron. Susan May, a jeweller, says, ""It is magical because it is soft when hot, but hard when it cools down."" 

Ann Catrin Evans makes door-knockers and handles that look like things from horror movies. One design looks like a ball and chain, and another looks like a Celtic cross. She says, ""I love that steel is cold and hard. It feels like it will last forever."" Iron gives people joy and a sense of security. It is likely that iron will be used for decoration for many years to come, as long as we do not see any more rusty candlesticks!"

I thought my friends would be happy when I stopped smoking, but one of my coworkers was very angry. She said, ""What do you mean? If it was easy, why didn’t you stop before?"" I could not explain how I went from smoking a lot to not smoking at all in just a few hours. It was strange for me too.

I went to a stop-smoking class two months and three weeks ago. I did not plan to stop smoking, and I did not really want to. I felt pressure from people who do not like smoking, and I still feel that way. I was healthy and did not often get sick. I thought I was fine.

On that Thursday afternoon, I went to the class to write an article about it. I said, ""I will not try to stop. I am here to write, not to stop."" I liked smoking. It made me happy. The teacher looked at me like she understood. We could smoke as much as we wanted, and the room was full of smoke. I noticed that when I was told to smoke, I did not want to. The messages about stopping smoking started to make sense to me. 

I began to think that stopping smoking was a good idea. I felt strong because I could stop. The need for cigarettes went away after a few days. I thought working without cigarettes would be hard, but it was not a problem. I was surprised that the hardest part was being at home on weekends. I realized that smoking helped me not feel bored. 

I do miss smoking a little, but not too much. Every new experience as a non-smoker is different. Eating out, waiting for a plane, checking into a hotel, and waiting at the theater are all moments when I used to smoke."

Dorothy Hodgkin is important because she is the only British woman scientist to win a Nobel Prize. She died in 1994. She studied crystals and had a very interesting life. Her life shows important changes in the 20th century, like better education for women and the growth of science around the world.

When I started my research, I wanted to read about other scientists. A friend told me to read about Linus Pauling, who was a friend of Hodgkin. He was also a famous scientist and won Nobel Prizes. I went to a bookshop, but I could not find any books about him. I was surprised that people did not find him interesting, even though he was very important.

Some scientists think that their lives are not interesting to read about. Peter Medawar, another Nobel Prize winner, said that the lives of scientists are often boring. If scientists think this way, it is not surprising that publishers and bookshops feel the same.

Many people do not know about scientists' lives. Some scientists do not want to be in the media because they do not want to seem like they are showing off. This makes it hard for young people to see science as interesting.

However, things are changing. Scientists are now seen more in public. For example, Professor Richard Dawkins gives prizes on TV, and geneticist Steve Jones advertises cars. These activities help people see scientists as real people.

Books about scientists are also changing. They used to be very serious and boring. Now, books like Richard Feynman's ""Surely You're Joking, Mr Feynman?"" show that scientists can have fun and interesting lives. Famous scientists like Isaac Newton and Marie Curie are now shown with their flaws.

Dorothy Hodgkin worked hard in science. She solved the structure of penicillin and vitamin B12, which won her the Nobel Prize in 1964. She also worked on insulin in 1969. She had three children and a husband who was often away for work. Her personal life is important, and we can learn from how she balanced everything.

Hodgkin loved science. It is important for scientists to share their passion. However, many readers find scientific ideas hard to understand. Learning science is not harder than reading Shakespeare or learning a new language; it just takes practice.

It is sad that many educated people do not know about important scientists like Dorothy Hodgkin. They would feel embarrassed if they did not know famous writers or artists, but they do not know about scientists who have made great contributions to the world.

CAE_56,"**Text: Margaret and Her Water Finding**

Margaret Wilkins has a special ability. She can find water underground using a forked hazel stick. Many farmers need her help because their wells are dry. Margaret and her husband have a well-drilling business. They use machines to drill wells, but Margaret uses the hazel stick to find water.

Margaret is very good at her job. She finds water more than 90% of the time. This ability to find water is called dowsing. Some people think it is a special skill. There are different ideas about how it works. One idea is that everything vibrates, and water vibrates more than other things. Some dowsers say they can feel or smell water.

In recent years, many farmers have needed help because of droughts. Most of Margaret's customers are farmers. They usually only need her help once because wells last a long time. Some customers have holiday homes far from water pipes. Others are building golf courses.

Margaret looks for water between 50 and 70 meters deep. She must be careful to avoid waste in the water. The water she finds is clean, but she must be careful about minerals in the water. She also needs electricity to pump the water, so the well should be close to power sources.

To find water, Margaret first looks at a map. She uses a pendulum over the map. If the pendulum swings, there may be water below. Then, she walks in the fields with her hazel stick. When she is above water, she feels something special. She uses the stick to find the exact spot to drill.

Margaret holds the stick with both hands. If the stick rises, it means water is below. It is important to drill in the right place. If she and her husband do not agree on where to drill, they will keep looking until they do.

Margaret's ability to find water is interesting to many people. She calls it an ""intuitive perception of the environment."" This means she has a special way of understanding where water is. This skill helps her family run their well-drilling business successfully."

**We changed lives for a day!** 

Have you ever wanted to live like someone else for a day? Four people did this. Here are their stories.

**A. Amanda's story**  
I am Amanda, 23 years old. I am a mother with two daughters. I swapped lives with my friend Cindy, who is 30 years old and works in a busy restaurant in London. 

I had never been in a place like this before. It was dark and loud, and there were many people. I felt nervous! Being a mother is busy, but this was different. I had only fifteen minutes to learn how to carry drinks on a tray. The other waitresses made it look easy, but I dropped the drinks on the floor! I felt embarrassed, but the other waitresses laughed. Everyone makes mistakes at first!

When the restaurant opened at 11:30 am, there was a long line of customers. I was worried about remembering their orders, but the computer helped me. After a few hours, my feet hurt, and the loud music was hard to handle. I had to say ""Pardon?"" a lot when customers spoke to me, which was embarrassing. By 5 pm, I was very tired. I was surprised when a waitress said it was a ""quiet"" day! I never knew waitressing was so tiring. I thought it was an easy job, but you need to be friendly and calm. I am shy, and I don’t think I could work on a busy night. I was happy to go back to my children. Taking care of them seems easy after waitressing!

**B. Cindy's story**  
I am Cindy, 30 years old. I was nervous about being a mother for a day, but I was also excited. Amanda warned me that her daughters were cheeky, but I thought I could handle it. 

When Amanda left for the restaurant, I had to get the two girls dressed and fed. After dropping off Sophie at school and Katie at nursery, I thought I would have three hours of peace. I was wrong! Amanda reminded me to clean the house and do the laundry. 

At 1 pm, I picked up Katie, went to the supermarket, and then took her home for lunch. When I brought Sophie home, they started jumping on the couch and screaming! I thought they would get tired, but they didn’t. I tried to get them to sleep by 8 pm, but then they wanted more water. I knew they just wanted to watch TV! It was tiring to spend all evening talking to them. I never knew taking care of two small children could be so hard. You don’t have time to think about yourself. But I really enjoyed the day!

**C. Rosemary's story**  
I am Rosemary, 42 years old. I run a dairy farm. I woke up at 5:30 am, but today I could sleep until 7 am! I was nervous about how to look at school. I didn’t want to stand out. 

At school, I saw about 400 students. I hoped I could blend in. I helped in a math class and a nature project. By lunchtime, I was tired but only had five minutes to eat! There was a lot to do before the next classes. I went to a meeting and helped with sports trials. After lunch, I had a reading lesson and a French lesson. The children wanted to practice French with me, which was fun. Finally, we had Physical Education. I was very tired, but the children had a lot of energy. Speaking in front of the class was hard for me. Teachers have more holidays, but I think I will stay on the farm!

**D. Hilary's story**  
I am Hilary, 30 years old. I arrived at Rosemary's farm at 8:30 am, but she had been up for three hours! Rosemary has a big farm with cows and sheep. 

I spent the morning in the ice-cream shop, filling milk containers and making ice-cream. It was hard not to eat the ice-cream! At lunchtime, I checked the sheep. If a sheep falls over, it needs help quickly. After feeding the calves, I started milking the cows. It took two and a half hours! Rosemary does this twice a day, every day. 

I felt lonely. I missed the children because animals don’t talk back! The hardest part is that you can’t take time off. The cows need to be milked every day. Farming seems nice, but it is very hard work. The money is not always good, and I wouldn’t like to depend on the weather.

1. Who did Amanda swap lives with?
2. How did Amanda feel when she first entered the restaurant?
3. What did Cindy think would happen after she dropped off the girls?

A trumpet is not just for Christmas. Many musicians come from families without music. Hakan Hardenberger is a famous trumpet player from southern Sweden. He is 30 years old and is known all over the world. He plays old music and new music. When you see him, he looks young and happy, just like the sound of the trumpet.

When Hakan was eight years old, his father gave him a trumpet for Christmas. His father liked Louis Armstrong's music, so he bought a real trumpet, not a toy. Hakan loved the trumpet and played it all the time. His mother found a trumpet player from the Malmo Symphony Orchestra to give him lessons. This teacher, Bo Nilsson, saw that Hakan had talent. Hakan is thankful for having such a good teacher.

Hardenberger says that the trumpet is not a perfect instrument. Every trumpet has small problems. He believes it is important to understand these problems and work with them. Even when he was a boy, people could recognize his special sound.

Unlike another famous trumpet player, John Wallace, Hakan always wanted to be a solo artist. He admired the French trumpet player, Maurice Andre, and listened to his records. Hakan's parents supported his dream to play the trumpet. When he was 15, he needed to choose a place to study. He could have gone to America, but instead, he went to Paris at 16 to study with Pierre Thibaud. Thibaud told him that playing in an orchestra was not for him.

Hardenberger knew he played better than other kids his age. At 17, he entered a competition in Paris. He only prepared some pieces but made it to the second round. In the final round, he faced a hard piece. He did not win first prize, but he enjoyed playing. He realized that even if he thought he played badly, people still listened to him.

Hardenberger is honest about his music. He does not want to explain how he connects with people through music because he believes it might ruin the magic of it. Music has the power to move people. 

**Questions:**

1. How old is Hakan Hardenberger?
2. What gift did Hakan receive for Christmas when he was eight?
3. Who was Hakan's teacher?
4. What did Hakan think about playing in an orchestra?
5. Did Hakan win first prize in the competition?"

**Career Power: Take Control at Work**

A. **What is a good leader?**  
A good leader inspires others. They help people and show the way. Being a leader is not about being tall or very smart. Pat Dixon, who wrote a book about work, says that a leader makes things happen with the help of enthusiastic people. A good leader should speak clearly and confidently. They should say ""I believe"" instead of ""I think.""

B. John van Maurik, who teaches about leadership, says that many people can be good leaders. To be a leader, you need to find your talents and use them. Everyone can be a leader if they have the right support. It is easy to see great leaders like Emmeline Pankhurst or Mahatma Gandhi, but it can be harder to see leadership in our own jobs. However, being a good leader is very important for good management.

C. Think about the best and worst boss you have had. They might have been good at setting goals and meeting deadlines. But how did they do it? The best boss motivated you and supported you. The worst boss made you feel unimportant and blamed you when things went wrong. The first boss led well; the second boss managed badly.

D. Leaders and managers are different. Managers like to work within rules. Leaders create new ideas. Micheal Shea, who writes about leadership, says a good manager can keep a company running, but a good leader can change a sad company into a happy one.

E. Whether you are the boss or a middle manager, you can improve your leadership skills. Here are some tips:  
- Leadership is best when you choose to do it. Find what you care about and act on it.  
- Think of yourself as a leader. You have the power to lead.  
- Sometimes you need to lead firmly. Try different ways of leading. If you usually ask others for their opinions, try taking charge. See how this changes things.  
- Set goals and try to achieve them. Look at your job and see where being a leader can help you.

F. Leadership does not just happen. You need to practice leading, take risks, and learn from mistakes. Learn to delegate tasks, motivate others, and give praise.  
- Don’t think everyone will like your way of leading right away. Keep working on how you communicate. You don’t have to be liked, but your ideas should be good.  
- Be present and available for important people.  
- Remember, you don’t have to lead all the time. Know when you are needed and how you can help others become leaders too."

**Film critic Nick James reviews some recent movies.**

**A. Abyss**  
Before Titanic, director James Cameron made a tense movie about oil workers and navy experts trying to save a nuclear submarine deep underwater. The main character, Bud, and his team are brave and funny. The special effects are very good, but the dialogue and characters are not strong. The story feels like a simple B-movie.

**B. The Thin Red Line**  
This movie is based on the book by James Jones about the battle for Guadalcanal. Director Andrew Marton made a more traditional war movie compared to Terrence Malick's poetic version. Marton focuses on one soldier and his tough sergeant. Malick's film is richer, but Marton's version has some good moments, like a flashback where the soldier dreams of his wife.

**C. On Guard**  
This movie is based on a novel from 1875. It is a fun swashbuckler with a bad guy played by Fabrice Luchini. Vincent Perez is a lively hero, and Daniel Auteuil plays a moody character. The film has many clichés, but it is entertaining.

**D. Character**  
This film is set in Rotterdam at the turn of the century. The costumes and sets look very detailed, like a museum. Jan Decleir plays a harsh bailiff named Dreverhaven, who is cruel to his tenants. The story focuses on his bad relationship with his son, but the film spends too much time on details and not enough on the story.

**E. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly**  
This re-released movie shows the skill of director Leone. The sound is very clear, and every noise is loud. The story is harsh, and when it slows down, Morricone's music makes it exciting. The characters, the good (Clint Eastwood), the bad (Lee van Cleef), and the ugly (Ell Wallach), all act badly as they travel through the West after the Civil War.

**F. The Longest Day**  
This war movie has many famous stars and was made by four directors with 23,000 extras. The early parts of the movie are slow as soldiers wait for news about an invasion. It is a big project, but it is better to watch on a big screen. Watching it on video is not as good."

**BOOK A** Steve Martin's *Compelling Evidence* is very interesting. The main character is a lawyer. He is trying to start a new job after leaving a big law firm. He has to defend his boss's wife because she is accused of killing her husband. The trial is exciting, and we do not know what will happen until the end. There is a big surprise at the end of the book. This is a great first book in a busy genre.

**BOOK B** *Curtains for the Cardinal* starts with a lot of action. The main character, Sigismondo, helps rich people in Italy during the Renaissance. He gets into a lot of trouble with politics and murder, but we know he will find the bad people. The story is complicated, and the book is a bit long, but it is still very good.

**BOOK C** *File Under: Deceased* is a new detective story by Sarah Lacey. Leah Hunter is a tax inspector. One day, a strange man falls dead in front of her. She is not scared and tries to find out what happened, even when people do not support her. Leah is brave and smart.

**BOOK D** *Double Deuce* by Robert B. Parker is about a private investigator named Spenser. He helps his friend Hawk to get rid of drug dealers in a poor area of Boston. The dialogue is quick and clever, and there is more thinking than usual. It is always good entertainment from Parker.

**BOOK E** *False Prophet* by Faye Kellermann has two detectives, Pete Decker and Marge Dunn. They investigate a robbery at the home of a famous film star's daughter. The author's easy writing and focus on strange human behavior make this a fun mystery.

**BOOK F** *Blood Red, Snow White* is written by husband and wife team Diane Henry and Nicholas Horrock. It is about another lawyer and a female client, but most of the action happens outside the courtroom. The lawyer becomes a victim as the story unfolds. It has romance, money, and violence, making it a gripping suspense novel.

**BOOK G** *Dead for a Ducat* by Simon Shaw features actor Philip Fletcher as a target. A funny group of characters comes together to film a story about Robin Hood, but Philip feels this is not the right way for his career. Simon Shaw usually entertains, but this time the story is not as good as his others.

**BOOK H** *Fall Down Easy* is Lawrence Gough's best book in a while. Canadian police are looking for a clever bank robber who targets female bank tellers. The story builds tension slowly, and the robber is smart and disturbed, making it better than an average detective novel."

I might be too old for this, but here I go! Tim Pozzi is 34 years old. He left his good job to go backpacking. He thinks about why he and others his age want to travel. This summer, he quit his job and decided to rent his flat. He wants to travel in South East Asia for a year. Some people think he is lucky, but he feels nervous. He has traveled before. After university, he spent two years backpacking in North and South America. When he came back, he wanted to travel again. But then he fell in love, started a career, and bought a flat. He realized he was not happy just working for money. When he quit his job, he felt like he was in control of his life again. 

Many of his friends are married with children. They do not want to change places with him, but they envy his freedom. He is not in a relationship and does not have big career goals. He feels he should enjoy his freedom for his friends. But he is nervous. He has to make many plans. He worries about renting his home and where to go. He is already behind on his plans. He thinks about staying in England for the summer and watching football. 

It is hard to leave his old life. He wonders if he can still backpack. Will he be okay living simply? Will he fit in with younger backpackers? Many people in their late twenties and thirties want to travel and change their lives. Jennifer Cox from Lonely Planet says more people realize they can have adventures. They just need to be brave and organized. 

Danny, a 30-year-old accountant, and his girlfriend Tammy, a 28-year-old teacher, want to travel before settling down. They bought a round-the-world ticket for a year. Danny says he is ready to give up job security for the trip. He knows he will return to the same job position, but he thinks it is worth the risk. 

Matt, who just left the Army, says traveling helped him change. In the Army, there is a strict way to do things. He needed to change that to live well as a civilian. There are many reasons to travel at this age. Angela Baron from the Institute of Personnel Development says more people work on short-term contracts. If a contract ends, they have nothing to lose. Some companies even allow career breaks. 

Dan Hiscocks, from Travellerseye, says many people in their thirties are thinking about their lives. If they are not happy, they know they can change. Travel helps them think about what they want. 

Is wanting to travel a sign that my generation cannot be adults? Jennifer Cox does not think so. She says it shows we are better educated and want a balanced life. We ask ourselves, ""Is this what I want?"" Ben, a 32-year-old picture researcher, is going to Central America for a year. He does not think he is running away. He wants to find things for himself. But he feels nervous about leaving his comfortable routine. 

I also feel unsure about leaving my easy life. I might not be going if my boss was not so difficult. Jennifer Cox says this is common. A big change, like a breakup or losing a job, can push people to travel. I needed a push to start my journey, but now I feel excited about the next year. No matter what happens, I will be happy that I took this chance. I think many older backpackers feel the same way.

Georgina McGuiness took a long break from her job as a journalist. She felt lost because of new technology. In this story, she shares how she changed her home into a good place to work.

Last Christmas, I turned 37 years old. I realized I needed to get back to my job in journalism. I looked at my resume and saw that I was stuck in the past. I used to type on a typewriter, and now computers were everywhere. I thought no one would want me in a newsroom because I did not know how to use a computer. Many job ads asked for experience in desktop publishing, but I had none. I felt scared to use a computer. Even using a calculator was hard for me.

I knew I had to learn quickly. I thought it would be hard to leave home before my kids went to school. Then, I entered a contest in a local newspaper. To my surprise, my family won a computer! We got a laptop for my husband and a personal computer for us all. We started to learn about the Internet and how to chat with people from around the world. My kids loved using the computer, and I set up a small office in the kitchen. I had a phone, a fax machine, and a modem to connect to the Internet. I could work from home and still take my kids to school.

My children were good with computers, but I was nervous. I thought I would lose my work if I pressed the wrong button. But I learned the basic skills I needed. It was easier than I thought. I started writing articles for a magazine, and now I feel happy that I can work from home.

The computer helped me a lot. Before, my desk was always messy, and I lost important papers. Now, I am more organized. I can keep track of money and use templates for letters and invoices. The Internet helps me find information for my stories and talk to other writers.

However, working from home has some problems. I can feel lonely because I do not see many people. There are also distractions at home, like chores and my kids wanting to use the computer. Many people in my neighborhood are also using computers for work and fun.

A report says that many people who work from home are educated and own personal computers. I feel I am doing well with my computer skills. One day, I hope to send my articles to a newspaper in Australia or even start my own magazine. The possibilities are endless!"
CAE_59,"**The Tartan Museum**

The Tartan Museum is in Edinburgh, Scotland. It has modern buildings that look like cheese wedges. The museum has a big yellow tower and a garden on the roof. Many people have different opinions about the building. Some think it is beautiful, while others do not like it.

The museum has many interesting things to see. It tells stories about Scotland's history. There are important objects, like jewels from Mary Queen of Scots. The museum wants to be fun and easy to understand for everyone, not just experts.

Dr. David Clarke is in charge of the exhibitions. He wants visitors to enjoy their time at the museum. He believes that the museum should show the truth about the past. There are no fake scenes; everything shown is based on what experts know.

The museum has many spaces to explore. The walls are light, and there are big windows that let in sunlight. Visitors can take their time to look at each item. There is also a special area for children to learn and play.

On the top floor, there is a gallery that changes every three years. It shows objects that are important to Scottish people, like electric guitars and toys. This gallery is fun, but some think it does not deal with serious topics.

Overall, Dr. Clarke believes that objects can tell stories about the past better than anything else. The museum is beautiful inside, but some wonder if it is in the right place."

The end of print may take some time. ""Transition"" is a nice word. It means moving from one place to another. Some people are scared of change, but it can also be good. 

Now, newspapers are trying to move to the online world. This is not easy. Many people think that print newspapers are selling less, while more people visit their websites. For example, The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian have seen a drop in print sales of about 8% to 10% each year, but their websites are getting more visitors.

However, not everything is clear. A survey showed that the total number of newspapers sold around the world went up by 1.1% last year. In some places, like Asia, sales increased. Some magazines also saw a rise in sales of 5.4%. 

When it comes to books, e-readers like Kindle are very popular. But when bookstores looked at their sales of physical books, they found that sales were only down by 0.4%. This means people still buy both e-books and paper books.

Many people think young people do not read newspapers anymore, but this is not true. The latest survey shows that nearly 5 million people aged 15 to 35 read national newspapers. Different countries have different trends. In Britain, print sales have dropped by 10.8%, but in Germany, the drop is only 7%. In France, it is just 3.1%.

Some experts thought that online ads would help newspapers make money, but now online ads are going down. Many US newspapers have started to charge for online access. The best way to get readers is to offer both print and online access together. 

Print newspapers are still important for selling online subscriptions. They make much more money from print ads than from online ads. However, it is hard for newspapers to keep both print and online versions running. But print newspapers still have a strong presence, while it is harder to be noticed online."
CAE_32,"**Simplified Text: Photographing People**

People are very interesting to photograph. A photo with a person is usually better than one without. But taking good photos of people can be hard. The photographer must pay attention to how people move and what they show on their faces. Sometimes, just having a camera can make people act differently.

A. **Grouping People**  
When taking a photo of a group, do not line people up in a straight line. Ask them to stand at different angles and distances. Some can sit or kneel in front so you can see all their faces.

B. **Posing for Pictures**  
People often feel stiff in front of a camera. Help them relax by suggesting they find a comfortable position, like folding their hands or putting them in their pockets.

C. **The Right Approach**  
Do not pretend you are not taking a picture when it is clear you are. Most people will agree to have their picture taken, but they may feel shy. You might need to help them feel comfortable. A photo can be less interesting if the person looks away from the camera.

D. **Eye Contact**  
A photo looks better if the person looks at the camera. Ask them to look into the lens. They do not have to smile. If they look away, remind them just before you take the picture. You can also say something funny to get a real reaction.

E. **Candid Concentration**  
Instead of looking at the camera, the person can look at something else in the picture. This can make the photo feel more natural. Candid shots can be very interesting.

F. **Expressions and Gestures**  
The way a person looks and moves tells us a lot about them. A laughing child can make us smile, while a sad face can make us feel sad. Look for different expressions like smiles, frowns, or thumbs-up.

G. **Situation Interest**  
The background of a photo can add more interest. Make sure the background does not take attention away from the person. Use a camera that can focus on the person and blur the background.

H. **Interaction**  
Good photos can happen when people are talking, laughing, or working together. Look for moments when people connect, like a handshake or a smile.

I. **People and Places**  
Many photos of people are taken on trips. To show both the people and the place, step back to get everything in the picture. Make sure the people are close enough to be seen clearly.

J. **To Pose or Not to Pose?**  
Think about why you want to take the picture. If you want to remember someone, ask them to pose nicely. But for family photos, candid shots of fun moments are often better than stiff poses. A spontaneous picture can bring back good memories later."
CAE_65,"**Text: 'Under Sarah's Spell'**

Sarah Janson is an artist. She paints in a style called trompe-l'oeil. This style makes paintings look real. In this interview, Joanna Watt talks to Sarah.

Sarah does not sign her paintings unless someone asks her to. She thinks the painting is more important than the artist. She says, ""It's not the artist who is important, but the work."" Sarah is very humble. She does not like to talk about herself. When asked to take a photo, she covers her face.

After a while, Sarah feels more comfortable. The interview becomes fun and interesting. Sarah has been a trompe-l'oeil artist for sixteen years. Before that, she studied art for two years and worked in a publishing house. She did not like illustration, so she started working with a decorator named Jim Smart. He asked her to create one trompe-l'oeil painting, and she loved it. She decided to work on her own.

Sarah believes that you cannot learn trompe-l'oeil from a school. She says, ""Trompe-l'oeil is the school of life. It's all about observation."" She is always learning. She admits she is not good at painting bread and has trouble with math. Once, she was confused about measurements for a big project at Lulworth Castle. She thought, ""You're not Michelangelo. Who do you think you are?""

Sarah often talks about herself in the third person. She says, ""When I finished that ceiling, I thought, 'Well, I didn't do it, she did.'"" Her trompe-l'oeil paintings are very special. Many people want her work, and she has done many important projects. 

Some of her paintings are inspired by buildings. For example, she created a trompe-l'oeil dining room that looks like a Venetian palace. She also painted a hallway that looks like it has two more rooms. 

Sarah knows that trompe-l'oeil must do two things. First, it must trick the viewer. Second, it must keep the viewer's attention. She believes that the art should also be personal to the client. She enjoys working with her clients and listening to their ideas. Many of her clients become friends because she spends a lot of time with them.

Sarah is thankful for her clients. She says, ""I am very grateful for the mad ones who have let me loose on their walls."" They are happy with her work, which is why she is always busy. She does not like to brag about herself. She says, ""I really don't like to shout about myself."" 

Sarah believes that art should not be loud. She thinks you can get bored with things that shout. But you can never get bored with Sarah or her work. Her art deserves to be known more, and I want to share it with others."
CAE_61,"**Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success**

Daniel Goleman talks about the 'people skills' that are important for success at work.

A. The rules for work are changing. We are not only judged by how smart we are or by our training, but also by how well we manage ourselves and work with others. This new way of judging is used to decide who gets hired and who does not. It helps to show who will do well at work and who may not. These new rules are important for our future jobs. They are different from what we learned in school. Doing well in tests is not as important anymore. Now, it is more about social skills and personal qualities, like being friendly, understanding others, and being able to adapt. These skills are called emotional intelligence.

B. Today, many jobs do not offer security. Instead of having one job, people need to have 'portable skills' that they can use in different jobs. Personal qualities are becoming more important at work. Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand and manage our own feelings and the feelings of others. In our work, it includes being aware of ourselves, controlling our emotions, being motivated, understanding others, and having good social skills. Some people think emotional intelligence just means being nice, but it can also mean being honest, even when it is hard. It is not about showing all our feelings, but about managing them so we can work well together.

C. More businesses are realizing that emotional intelligence is very important for good management. The more complicated the job, the more emotional intelligence matters. If someone lacks these skills, it can make it hard for them to use their knowledge and skills. Many people have succeeded without strong emotional intelligence, but as work becomes more complex, companies that work well together have an advantage. In today’s workplace, where teamwork and good customer service are important, emotional intelligence is essential for doing well in any job.

D. Unlike IQ, which does not change much, emotional intelligence can grow as we learn from our experiences. Studies show that most people get better at managing their emotions and understanding others over time. This growth in emotional intelligence is called maturity. We can learn these skills and use them to help us in our jobs. This is important now, as having a stable job is not always possible. Emotional intelligence is not a magic solution for companies, but if we ignore the human side of work, nothing else will work as well."
CAE_52,"Text: 'Should the media make money from content they do not own? Digital cameras and camera phones make it easy to take pictures of news events. Social media has changed how people share these pictures. Now, some journalists look at social media for images when news happens quickly. But some reporters use pictures from users without asking for permission. There are rules that say images on social media can be used without permission in special cases or if it is very important to the public. People still talk about whether this is right or wrong. Research shows that about one in ten people would take pictures or videos of a news event. This means user-generated content (UGC) is important for the future of the media. However, to keep a good relationship with the public, the media should make sure that people are paid for their work and that they always ask for permission.'"

**Acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine**

Acupuncture is a type of medicine from China that is over 2,000 years old. It is part of traditional Chinese medicine, which also includes herbs, massage, diet, and exercise. Acupuncture is often used to help with pain. Many doctors, midwives, and physiotherapists in the West use it for this purpose.

**What is Traditional Chinese Medicine?**

In traditional Chinese medicine, health means that the mind, body, and spirit are in balance. There is a special energy called Qi (pronounced ""chee"") that flows in the body along paths called meridians. There are twelve main meridians connected to organs in the body. If the flow of Qi is blocked or weak, a person may feel weak or sick. An acupuncturist checks the flow of Qi by feeling pulses on the wrist, looking at the tongue, and asking about health and habits. They use very thin needles to help the Qi flow better.

**Acupuncture Points**

Acupuncture points are connected to the meridians and may not be near the area that hurts. People often feel a gentle ache or tingling when the needle is used. There are over 300 acupuncture points on the main meridians.

**How Does Acupuncture Work?**

Doctors in the West believe that acupuncture can help with pain, even if they do not follow traditional Chinese medicine. They think that acupuncture can block pain signals or release natural pain-relieving substances in the body.

**What Pain Can Acupuncture Help?**

Many people with long-term pain try acupuncture when other treatments do not work. It can help with back pain, arthritis, headaches, and pain after surgery. Acupuncturists also say it can help with menstrual pain and pain from serious illnesses.

**Using Acupuncture in Surgery**

Acupuncture has been used in China for a long time, but using it instead of anesthesia during surgery started in the 1950s. In China, acupuncture is used in many types of surgeries. Some people say it helps reduce pain without the side effects of regular anesthesia.

**Is Acupuncture Always Effective?**

Studies show that 50 to 80 percent of people find acupuncture helps with chronic pain. Acupuncturists say it usually takes six to seven visits to feel real relief, but some people feel better after just two or three visits.

**A Different Way to Treat Pain**

Acupuncturists look at the whole person, not just the pain. They ask many questions to understand the pain better. They want to know if the pain feels sharp or dull and if it gets worse in certain weather. This information helps them decide how to treat the pain.

**Choosing an Acupuncturist**

Some doctors have training in traditional acupuncture, while others use scientific methods. It is important to choose a good acupuncturist. If needed, they should refer you to a medical doctor for more help.

P.D. James is a famous crime writer. Her full name is Phyllis Dorothy James. She seems calm and strong, but she is shy. Her main character, Adam Dalgliesh, is a detective. She says Dalgliesh is like her, but he is a man. Dalgliesh likes to solve crimes alone, just like P.D. James likes to write alone. She needs quiet time to write.

Many people read her books. She has written 12 detective novels. P.D. James likes the books of her friend Ruth Rendell, who writes under the name Barbara Vine. She also enjoys books by women writers like Iris Murdoch and Anita Brookner, but she likes some male writers too, like Graham Greene.

P.D. James became successful later in life. She was 42 when her first book, Cover Her Face, was published. She was born in Oxford and grew up in Cambridge. She met her husband there. Life was hard for her at times. Her husband was sick after the war, and she had to work a lot to take care of him and their two daughters, Clare and Jane. Her husband's parents helped take care of the girls.

P.D. James worked for the National Health Service and then for the Home Office. She worked in the Police Department and learned about forensic science. She saw many dead bodies, but she was not interested in death. She liked writing crime stories because it was a way to learn how to write serious novels. She believes that writing detective stories helps to make sense of chaos. Solving a crime shows that life is important, even if it is not perfect."

The pen is stronger than the psychoanalyst. The study of handwriting to show a person's character is becoming popular. If you want a job in some countries, you will likely be asked to give a sample of your handwriting. This handwriting can help decide if you are right for the job. Handwriting analysis, or graphology, is seen as a real science in many places. Researchers say it can help show some illnesses, like heart disease and cancer, and can show feelings and mental states.

Many big companies now use graphologists to look at the handwriting of people who want important jobs. But many doctors and psychiatrists are not sure if graphology is useful. Patricia Marne, a graphologist for over 20 years, thinks they should take it seriously. She believes handwriting can show mental traits and some health problems. She says, ""Handwriting can show social class and intelligence. It can also help decide if a person should study arts or sciences and if they are open or secretive.""

Ms. Marne says graphology can help find possible criminal behavior. She says, ""Criminals often have bad handwriting. Many come from poor backgrounds and have emotional problems. This can show in childish handwriting and in writing letters many times."" She believes handwriting can show if someone is honest or not. 

Ms. Marne says that handwriting can show if someone is under a lot of stress or has violent thoughts. It can also help predict if someone might think about suicide. Heart and lung problems can also be seen in handwriting. She says, ""You cannot make a diagnosis from one sample, unless the writing is very shaky. But if the handwriting changes over time, it could mean something serious is happening.""

A big emotional problem can change a person's signature for a short time. Ms. Marne says handwriting can show other mental traits. People who write with letters that connect are often clever and secretive. Those who write in all capitals may be hiding their true selves. Light pressure in writing shows sensitivity. Original handwriting shows confidence and creativity. Writing that is not connected can mean a person is lonely. Small signatures can show shyness, and circles over the letter ""i"" can mean a person wants attention.

Ms. Marne says it takes six years to learn how to analyze handwriting well. She believes more research is needed to make graphology a real science. She thinks it is more accurate than psychoanalysis because it can show a person's history and feelings without asking questions. However, many psychiatrists do not agree. They say handwriting is just a result of education and has no other meaning."

Is your office good to work in? Fresh air and good chairs are important for happy and healthy workers, according to a new survey. We visited four different offices to see how healthy and happy they are. We had three experts with us: a building health consultant, an ergonomist (who studies working conditions), and an occupational psychologist. Here are their opinions.

**Office A: Advertising Agency**  
*Building Health Consultant:* This office is very simple. It has no central heating and no mechanical ventilation. The windows open to the street. It is surprising that this office works well, but the seven people who work here are happy. They change the office temperature by opening doors or using electric heaters, like at home. This may be why they are happy.  
*Ergonomist:* The furniture does not match. Some chairs are old and broken, and they do not help good posture. But the workers have different tasks, like meeting clients and making presentations. This variety helps them avoid tiredness and boredom.  
*Occupational Psychologist:* The staff like the different types of work and the size of the office. It is small enough to know what others are doing but big enough to work alone. The office is fun and looks efficient.

**Office B: News Service**  
*Building Health Consultant:* This office is not very exciting, but it is comfortable. The air quality is good, and there is a No Smoking policy.  
*Ergonomist:* The company has good chairs and lighting. The space is okay, but the layout could be better. The walls are plain and not very interesting.  
*Occupational Psychologist:* The walls have some planners and a poster about maternity rights. Most workers have been there for over five years, and they get along well. The office could be better if desks were arranged to share information easily.

**Office C: Bank**  
*Building Health Consultant:* This office gets mixed feelings from workers. It feels like being in a glass box. The air is not stale, even with smokers nearby.  
*Ergonomist:* The office is standard and not inspiring. The desks are okay, but some chairs are not good for computer work.  
*Occupational Psychologist:* The staff help each other and use technology well. There are many awards on display. The office is busy.

**Office D: Newspaper**  
*Building Health Consultant:* This office has many problems. The air conditioning does not work well, and the space is messy. There is a lot of dust.  
*Ergonomist:* The furniture is not good for a modern office. Many chairs are old and do not help workers.  
*Occupational Psychologist:* The office is dirty, with old chairs and carpets. It needs cleaning and better air conditioning. Workers seemed stressed and not happy. The company should encourage teamwork."
CAE_38,"**Chewing Gum Culture**

Chewing gum is popular in America. People chew 12 million sticks of gum every day. It is a big business. Chewing gum has less than ten calories in each stick. It is a food and must follow rules from the American Food and Drug Administration.

Today, most gum is made with synthetic materials. These materials help keep the flavor and make the gum soft. Long ago, the ancient Greeks chewed a gum-like substance from the mastic tree, which grows in Greece and Turkey. Greek women used mastic gum to clean their teeth and make their breath fresh.

American colonists learned to chew gum from the Native Americans in New England. They chewed resin from spruce trees. In the early 1800s, people sold spruce gum in the eastern United States. This was the first commercial chewing gum in the country.

Modern chewing gum started in the late 1860s with chicle, a substance from the sapodilla tree in Central America. Gum made from chicle was smoother and more enjoyable to chew. However, it is hard to grow sapodilla trees. Because of this, companies now use synthetic materials to make gum.

Today, there are few chicle gatherers, called chicleros. They work hard to collect chicle from trees. They face many dangers, like poisonous snakes and insects. Chicleros climb trees to collect the sap and carry it to a camp. At the camp, they boil the sap until it becomes sticky and make it into bricks.

Life for chicleros is difficult. They eat a simple diet and drink local alcohol. Even though their work is hard, chicleros worry about losing their jobs. Not long ago, the United States imported 7,000 tonnes of chicle each year from Central America. Last year, only 200 tonnes were collected in Mexico.

As chewing gum sales have increased, companies have turned to synthetic materials to save money. Gum makers also find new ways to sell their products. They say gum can help you relax, give you energy, and reduce tooth decay. Chewing gum can help your mouth produce more saliva, which protects your teeth.

Research is ongoing to create new flavors and textures for gum. Most new flavors are artificial, but some still use natural ingredients. In America, a large area is used to grow mint for the two most popular chewing gums in the world."

Sue Brown is a hotel inspector. She checks hotels for her job. Christopher Middleton watched her work. One minute into her inspection, things are already going wrong at the Globe Hotel. The receptionist is talking on the phone and does not see Sue and Christopher. Sue says, ""She hasn't even looked at us. This is very bad."" This is a common mistake that Sue sees often in her 11 years as an inspector. 

Sue expects better because the Globe Hotel has three red stars. This means it is one of the best hotels. But even before they enter, things do not feel right. The door from the parking lot is not manned, and they have to walk down a long, empty hallway to get to the hotel entrance. Sue says, ""This is not what I expected.""

Things get worse. The receptionist says, ""We have no record of your booking."" There are 15 rooms in the hotel, but 12 are empty. One room is on the top floor, but it is not good. It is stuffy, and there is a big hole in the wall behind the wardrobe. 

When Sue started her job, people called her ""The Woman in Black,"" but she did not wear black and did not think she was tough. The next morning, after paying her bill, she tells the hotel manager, Robin Greaves, who looks scared. He apologizes for a bad smell in the lounge. He says, ""We think there is a blocked drain."" Sue suggests that he should not let guests go into that room. 

Greaves takes notes and looks worried. He has worked at the Globe for only five months. Sue tells him that her comments will help the hotel in the future. 

Not everything is bad. Sue praises Emma, the assistant manager, and Trudy, the waitress, for their good work. Dinner was also good, so the hotel keeps its two-rosette food rating. Greaves asks, ""What do we need to do to get three rosettes?"" Sue replies, ""Do not serve pudding that falls apart."" 

Sue's job is to tell the hotel what is wrong. Sometimes, people complain about her. She remembers a woman who said Sue got her son fired. Sue only told the truth: the son served her apple pie with his fingers. 

Sue must write a report about her findings. The hotels pay for her help. It is good for Greaves to hear that Sue will not take away the Globe's red stars. The bad news is that another inspector will come back in two months to check if things are better. Greaves smiles but looks worried. ""We will look forward to that,"" he says.

Doug Scott is a mountaineer. He climbed the highest mountains on each continent, called the Seven Summits. He shares his experiences with us.

**A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)**  
Doug and his climbing partner, Dougal, were in a snow cave. They were 91 meters below the top of Mt. Everest. Dougal talked to their Equipment Officer, Dave, even though he was not there. Doug thought this was strange. He started talking to his own feet because they were cold. He remembered other climbers who lost fingers and toes to frostbite. Doug felt calm and believed they would reach the top. He found a good rhythm and continued climbing.

**B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)**  
In April 1976, Doug and Dougal arrived at the Kahiltna Glacier. They carried equipment and food for four days. They followed a route from 1967 but then chose a new way to the top. They climbed with everything on their backs. They camped under a rocky cliff. The weather was bad, and they were tired. They finally reached the summit and felt happy.

**C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m)**  
In September 1976, Doug and his friend Paul flew to Nairobi to climb Mt. Kenya. Instead, they got a free ride to Kilimanjaro. They got lost in the jungle and had trouble finding water. They found arrows on trees that led them to a rock pool. They decided to take a different route to the top.

**D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)**  
In January 1992, Doug and his wife, Sharu, arrived at Punta del Inca. They met a guide named Phil who invited them to climb Aconcagua with him. After waiting for bad weather to pass, they started climbing. They chose a different route to avoid the busy path. The wind was strong as they reached the top.

**E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)**  
Doug learned that climbing Vinson Massif needed money to get there. In November 1992, his team left Britain for the South Pole. The sun was always shining. On December 7, they climbed to the summit in strong winds and very cold temperatures. They were happy but could not see much because of the storm.

**F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)**  
In summer 1994, Doug's team met in St Petersburg. They went to Elbrus and took a cable car to 3,900m. They walked to a refuge at 4,200m. After two days, they climbed in strong winds. They thought they reached the top, but there was more to climb. They returned to the refuge and then went down the mountain.

**G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)**  
On their trip to Carstensz, Doug wanted to climb and meet the local Dani people. They were warned about bandits but continued anyway. On May 12, they climbed. The weather got better, and they reached the top by 11 am. Doug was happy to complete his seventh summit.

For those who like classic styles, he has a navy-blue summer suit that many women wore in the 20th century. But he makes it look new.

**Sally Quail: Jeweller**

They are made from fine materials like calfskin and silk. A Grimson bag is special because it is both chic and well-made.

**Peter Little: Hairdresser**

Peter Little has been a hairdresser for over 20 years. Many famous people have had their hair styled by him. He says, ""Most women want hair that looks real and is easy to manage."" He wants his clients to look natural, not like they just came from a salon. His services are expensive, costing £250 for the first visit, and there is a long waiting list. He has also made his own hairdryers and styling tools for people to use at home.

**Penny Pratt: Florist**

Penny Pratt runs a small flower shop and helps a big supermarket chain with flowers. She has no formal training in floristry and used to be a teacher. Ten years ago, she decided to do something different. Her modern flower arrangements have won many awards, and she started her own London Flower School. She has also given lectures in Japan and the USA. She says, ""Flower arrangements are simpler now. Keep them simple and strong, and do not use too many leaves. For wedding bouquets, all the flowers should be the same type."""

The Merrion Hotel is a new five-star hotel in Dublin. It took almost two years to change four old houses into this hotel. The hotel has the latest technology to help both guests and staff.

The General Manager, Peter MacCann, wants his staff to know the guests' names. He uses a computer system to remember what guests like. This system helps the hotel give special service to returning guests. It cost a lot of money to install, but it will help the hotel save money in the future. For example, if a guest asks for certain music during their first stay, the hotel will have that music ready for them when they come back.

Many guests complain about room temperature. The hotel has a system that lets guests change the temperature in their rooms. They can set it between 14°C and 25°C. 

The hotel also has special technology for business guests. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine, and a video-conferencing system. The hotel is ready for new technology, so they have extra cables for future upgrades. They rent televisions and DVD recorders, so they can change them for newer models.

The hotel has 145 comfortable and welcoming rooms. There is a swimming pool, a gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a beautiful garden. The food is excellent. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, who has two Michelin stars, has moved his restaurant to the Merrion. He has a new kitchen and better parking.

With good technology and staff, the Merrion Hotel is likely to be very successful."

Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. She has a big garden around her house. This garden has many of her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wild and spread all over the garden. There are two long flower beds along a path that goes from one side of the garden to the other. The previous owners of the house were good gardeners and left many plants that Susan likes. She also kept the gardener, Danny. Susan says, ""It was really his garden."" At first, Danny did not like some of the flowers Susan wanted to add, but when she said she wanted to paint them, he understood.

Susan likes to paint individual flowers instead of the whole garden. She often picks flowers and takes them to her studio. She does not paint everything at once. She takes one flower, paints it for a few days, and then brings in another flower. Sometimes, it takes her a couple of years to finish a painting. 

Spring and early summer are her busiest times because the tulips and poppies bloom. Susan says, ""They all come out together, and you're so busy."" She also finds it interesting to see how flowers change over time. For example, when she puts tulips in water, they change shape and look beautiful. At first, they may seem boring, but they become more interesting.

Susan has always liked plants. She studied botany in school and collected wild flowers from the countryside. She did not like garden flowers because they looked fake to her. She thought wild flowers were real because they grow in tough places, like rocks or cliffs.

Now, her garden has many plants from different countries, and they grow well there. She is relaxed about her garden, like a kind aunt who lets children play as long as they do not break anything. Susan has two art exhibitions coming up, so she has less time to work in the garden. She now has another gardener to help her, but she knows that to stay connected to her flowers, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""

Many trees in Brackham fell down in the strong storms in March. The town lost two big lime trees from the old market square. This change made the town look very different, and some people were not happy about it. One of these people was Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, who was the head of the local police. But during the storm, Pelham was very sick with bronchitis. He had a headache and a tight chest. His wife, Molly, wanted him to see a doctor, but he did not want to go. He thought the police needed him. 

Finally, his colleague, Sergeant Lloyd, took him to the doctor. Pelham was too weak to argue. Soon, he got medicine and went home. Molly sent him to bed. On Thursday morning, Molly told him that the walnut tree in their garden had fallen down. Pelham was surprised. On Thursday evening, he asked if the house was damaged. He was happy to hear it was not, and he went back to bed.

On Saturday, Pelham felt better. He got up and saw that the living room looked different without the walnut tree. Their big house had a nice garden, and Pelham liked it. The garden made them feel private. Before, the walnut tree made the living room look nice with light and shadow. But now, without the tree, the room was too bright, and the old furniture looked bad. 

The view from the window was not nice either. The tall house next door, which the tree had hidden, was now visible. It had ugly purple bricks and many windows that seemed to watch the Pelhams. 

“Doesn’t it look terrible?” Pelham said to Molly. But Molly, standing in the doorway, seemed happy. “I have been saying this since we moved here. We need to buy a new sofa, no matter the cost.”"
FCE_16,"**Text: Living in the Valley**

We lived in our valley for sixteen months when we first saw the dangers in the hills around us. It was the year when the storms came early, before winter started. Until then, we felt safe in our valley below the hills. Soon, snow began to fall. In one day, it was about 15 centimeters deep. The snow almost blocked our road and made the path by the stream slippery. 

In the hills, the snow was much deeper and stayed longer. The wind was very strong up there. In our valley, we felt only small gusts of wind; the trees moved but did not break. We knew we should worry. The snow and wind were annoying, but they did not really scare us. The river, called the Ryburn, was what worried us the most. It usually flowed gently, but we remembered what could happen if the water from the hills was not controlled by dams.

Soon, the snow started to melt. Every day, we saw dark clouds gather over the hills. These clouds warned us of what was coming. We watched the river, which was getting fuller and wilder. The snow melted as more rain fell from the clouds, and the reservoir in the hills was filling up quickly. Then it happened - the reservoir overflowed for the first time in years. The water rushed over the dam like a waterfall and poured into the stream below. 

The river looked wild as the water rushed down. Just a few meters from our cottage, the stream was deeper than we had ever seen. For three days, we hoped it would stay below its banks. Luckily, the dam held, and the water began to go down. 

In the past, the river had flooded nearby villages many times. Now, the dam controls the river, and usually, everything is fine. The water from the hills stays behind the dam, and we can enjoy the big clouds above the valley. Thanks to this dam, we feel safe in our home in the valley."

Film critic Mark Adams thinks about his ten years of work as a film critic for a newspaper called The Front Page. Writing articles about films for The Front Page was his first real job. Before that, he wrote reviews for books in other newspapers, films for a magazine, and did some work for the radio. This is how he met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page. Tom also worked in radio and television. He hired Mark, but Tom was not a journalist, so he did not choose his staff carefully.

At first, Tom wanted a team of critics to cover different art forms like books, TV, theatre, film, and radio. They would have a weekly lunch to talk about what to write about. It felt like a dream for Mark to be part of a new newspaper. He thought it was strange that a new paper could start in a busy market. He even thought a rich person was helping him and pretending to hire him. The first time he saw someone reading the newspaper with his review in it, he felt very shy.

Tom's idea for a team of critics did not work out. They did not meet as planned, so they talked on the phone instead. People liked to have one reviewer for each subject, so Mark chose to write about films. Without Tom's help, Mark would not have the job he has now, where he writes a long article each week about one film. He likes this way of working. He did not want to be a regular film critic who has to watch every new film. That would make him tired and unhappy.

Mark has the space to write more about his ideas. He thinks about what his role is for the public. He believes people choose films based on stars, ads, or the director. People usually stick to what they like. Someone who does not like westerns is not likely to watch one just because of a review. So, if a film review is not a guide for buying tickets, what is it? Mark does not feel he must be ""right"" about a movie. He does not think there should be a set number of ""great"" or ""bad"" films each year. He just needs to share his opinion. He does not want to be a judge."

Why would a schoolgirl want to swim 1500 meters, cycle 40 kilometers, and then run 10 kilometers? Because ""it's fun."" 

Melanie Sears is a teenager who loves sports. She is looking for a training partner for triathlons, especially a girl. She wants someone who likes running, swimming, and cycling. It is important to be able to do all three sports without resting.

Triathlons are very popular in the Olympics. Many people watch athletes swim 1500 meters, cycle 40 kilometers, and then run 10 kilometers without stopping. It looks hard, but Melanie enjoys it. She started doing triathlons when she was 14 years old. 

In her first triathlon, she won the junior section, but she was the only junior there. She felt confident and entered the National Championships. She swam fast and ran fast, but she got lost and cycled too far. She cried while running, but she did not give up. 

Melanie works very hard. She once pushed herself so much that she fell off the running machine. Steve Trew, the coach, admires her determination. This year, she was the top junior in the European Triathlon Championships, finishing 13th. She is training hard to improve her cycling.

Melanie wants her parents to buy her a new bike for the World Championships in New Zealand. The bike costs a lot of money. She trains a lot and does not have much time for friends. She says, ""I don't have a social life."" After swimming for two hours, she just wants to sleep. But she still talks to her teammates about their training times.

Melanie has tried shorter triathlons, but she wants to do even harder events. She says, ""The big trouble is, I have no one my age to train with.""

**The Collectors**

Amanda Roy writes about collecting things and why many people like this hobby. Many adults enjoy collecting. It is a fun and exciting world. But if you want to collect something, remember: you should love the object. 

People have collected things for a long time. Long ago, early humans collected pebbles and wore them. They liked the shapes and colors of the pebbles. Today, children still collect stones and seashells because they are beautiful.

I have collected many things in my life. I started with stones from my parents' garden when I was six years old. I went to a school in a cold place in England. When my parents visited, they took me to a local museum. The museum had many interesting objects collected by people long ago. I loved looking at these objects.

Many adults also like to collect. Some people collect because it is something they can control. For me, I just enjoy it. One famous collector was the Duc de Berry in France. He had a ""room of wonders"" with many strange and beautiful things. Another collector, Catherine the Great of Russia, had more than 4,000 paintings.

You do not need to be rich to collect. I have collected tulip bulbs and china cups. I remember when I got a special tulip from another collector. I planted it, but one year it disappeared. Someone took it!

I also collected 350 American rag dolls. I looked all over the USA for them. Sadly, my collection was lost in a fire. The next day, I saw the burned remains of my dolls and furniture. I was very sad.

I find it interesting how collections change hands. A silver spoon that belonged to a king is very valuable. When small objects become popular, their prices go up. For example, toys from the 1950s are now worth a lot, especially if you still have the original boxes. (I threw mine away!)

Four people talk about their jobs.

**Lisa - Exhibition Organiser at the Science Museum**  
I put together exhibitions. I plan and design the exhibition and tell people about it. I read about the topic of the exhibition and talk to important people to find out what the main ideas are. I decide what objects and pictures to show. I make sure the public can understand the exhibition. I plan fun activities like workshops and shows. I also work with engineers and electricians to keep visitors safe. Before the exhibition opens, I help make brochures and leaflets to tell people about it.

**Janet - Teacher for London Taxi Drivers**  
I start my day at 7:30 a.m. by checking the accounts. Then, I see what new maps and documents we need for the taxi-driver test. By midday, about 50 students are in school, learning the best routes to take. I help when there are questions, like if you can turn right at a certain place. When they are close to the test, I give them a simple route. I tell them they must find a different way if the road is closed. This helps them think.

**Sarah - Marine Conservationist**  
I live by the sea and work from home. I answer phone calls, make educational materials, and set up training courses. Sometimes, I go to the main office, but I mostly work by the coast. I work with schools and run courses for people who manage the coast. I take them out to sea in a boat to help them understand the life in the ocean. This often changes how they think. I love my job because conservation is my hobby. But I work for a charity, so I always need to find more money to do everything I want.

**Chris - Map and Atlas Publisher**  
My job is very different every day. I make sure our books match what people want and keep enough books in stock. We have high standards for our information. We get many letters from readers about maps, and I need to answer them carefully. I talk about future projects and sales with my co-workers. I enjoy working with my team. But like many jobs, I have too much paperwork, which takes time away from more interesting work like designing new products."

We always went to Ireland in June. Since we started going on holidays together, we spent the first two weeks of June at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. It is a big house by the sea, not far from the village of Ardbeag. The Malseeds, an English couple, bought the house and made it bigger, but they did it carefully. Strafe found Glencorn for us. He saw an advertisement when the Malseeds were still advertising. 

""How about this?"" he said one evening and read the details. The summer before, we went to a hotel that friends recommended, but it was not good because the food was terrible. The four of us have been playing cards together for a long time: Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia, and me. They call me Milly, but my real name is Dorothy Milson. Dekko got his nickname at school. He and Strafe were in the same school, so we call Strafe by his last name like the teachers did. We are all about the same age and live close to where the Malseeds lived before moving to Ireland. 

""How very nice,"" Mrs. Malseed said, smiling to welcome us again this year. She seems to know when guests are coming because she is usually waiting in the big hall that smells of flowers. ""Arthur, take the luggage up,"" she told the old porter. ""Rose, Tulip, Lily, and Geranium,"" she said, naming the rooms for us. Mrs. Malseed painted flowers on the doors instead of using numbers. In winter, when few people come to Glencorn Lodge, she takes care of little things like that; her husband does repairs and redecorating. 

""Well, well, well,"" Mr. Malseed said, coming into the hall from the kitchen. ""A hundred thousand welcomes,"" he greeted us in the Irish way. He was smiling, making us feel special. Everyone smiled, and I could feel that our holiday had truly begun. Nothing had changed at Glencorn; everything was good. Kitty from the dining room came out to greet us. ""You look younger every year, all four of you,"" she said, making everyone laugh again. 

Arthur led the way to our rooms, carrying as much luggage as he could and coming back for the rest. After dinner, we played cards for a while but not for too long because we were still tired from the journey. In the lounge, there was a man alone and a French couple. There were other people at dinner because Glencorn Lodge is always full in June. From our table by the window, we could see some people walking on the lawns and others going down to the beach. 

In the morning, we would walk along the sand to Ardbeag and have coffee at the hotel there, back in time for lunch. In the afternoon, we would drive somewhere. I knew this because we had done it many times before. Since we first came here, we all fell in love with the beautiful landscape."

Sarah Sutherland-Pilch is a chalet girl. She is 24 years old and comes from West Sussex, England. Sarah works in Val d'Isere, France. She cooks and cleans for visitors who come to ski and stay in wooden houses called chalets.

This is Sarah's second year as a chalet girl. She studied French and History of Art at university. Sarah says being a chalet girl is not a career, but it is a fun way to spend a year or two. She meets many interesting people.

Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to work. The chalet can have up to 18 guests each week. She eats her breakfast first, then makes breakfast for the guests. They have porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants.

After breakfast, Sarah cleans up and either makes afternoon tea or cleans the rooms. She thinks cleaning is the worst part of her job. By 11 a.m., she goes skiing. On good days, she can ski until 4:30 p.m.

Sarah comes back to the chalet to prepare dinner. Dinner is served at 8 p.m., and coffee is ready by 10 p.m. After dinner, she cleans the kitchen. Sometimes she talks with the guests, but sometimes they want to be alone. Good guests can make her week better.

Sarah lives in the chalet with her friends. They go out at about 11 p.m. on some nights. They visit different places to have fun. But on Saturday nights, she does not stay out too late because Sunday is her busiest day.

On Sunday, she starts work early. Breakfast for guests leaving has to be ready by 7 a.m. After the guests leave, Sarah cleans quickly. She prepares tea for the new guests who arrive at about 4:30 p.m. Sometimes the new guests have many questions.

Between tea and dinner, Sarah helps guests who need boots or skis. Then she gets a ride back to the chalet. After dinner, she might have a drink, but sometimes she is too tired and goes to bed early."

Miss Rita Cohen was a small girl with pale skin. She looked much younger than Seymour's daughter, Marie, but she said she was six years older. One day, she came to Seymour's factory. She wore overalls and big shoes, and her hair was messy but framed her pretty face. Seymour was surprised that she was studying at the University of Pennsylvania and doing research about leather in New Jersey for her Master's degree.

A few times a year, someone would call or write to Seymour to ask if they could see his factory. Sometimes, he would help students by answering their questions or giving them a short tour if they seemed serious. Rita was very small, like the children from Marie's class who visited the factory years ago. Seymour showed them how he made gloves, especially the special table where the men shaped the gloves using hot brass hands. Marie called them ""pancake hands"" because they looked strange.

Rita asked, ""How many pieces come in a shipment?"" Seymour replied, ""Between twenty and twenty-five thousand."" She took notes and asked, ""Do they come to your shipping department?"" He said, ""They come to the tannery. We buy the material, and they make it ready for us. My grandfather and father worked in the tannery here. I worked there for six months when I started."" 

Rita said, ""I have not been inside a tannery."" Seymour replied, ""You should go if you want to write about leather. I can help you. Tanneries are old places. The technology is better now, but they are still similar to what they were hundreds of years ago. It is hard work. Tanning is one of the oldest industries. They found tanning tools that are six thousand years old in Turkey. The first clothes were made from animal skins that were tanned by smoking.""

Seymour said, ""My father knows a lot about leather. You should talk to him. He can talk for two days about gloves. Glovemen love their work. Have you ever seen anything being made, Miss Cohen?"" Rita answered, ""No, I have not."" Seymour laughed and said, ""You have never seen anything made?"" Rita replied, ""I saw my mother make a cake when I was a child."" 

Seymour found her funny and liked her spirit. His daughter was much taller than Rita, but Rita reminded him of Marie. She had a bright mind and remembered everything she learned in school. Seymour said, ""We will show you how to make gloves. What size do you wear?"""

Raquel loves her job and gets along well with her boss. But she has one small problem - she does not like flying. ""On a long trip to California, I take sleeping pills to help me relax,"" she says.

David Brown has worked as an accountant and a golf caddy. A caddy carries a golfer's bags. He likes being a caddy more because he loves golf. But there are some problems. He earns a small flat fee and a part of the winnings. He usually makes between £25,000 and £35,000, but much of that goes to travel and hotels. He was 31 when he first worked for golfer Greg Norman. ""You do more than carry bags. You give advice and try to understand the course,"" he says. His skills in accounting helped him get a job with European Tour Productions. He collects and analyzes statistics from the caddies. These results are important for TV commentators, golf magazines, and the golfers.

""If people can pay, it is their choice,"" he says. ""I would rather spend £120 on a meal I will remember than buy a microwave."" He became a food writer because a friend offered him a food column. At that time, he worked in advertising and it helped him earn extra money. He was 42 when another newspaper offered him a full-time job. ""It meant I would earn less money,"" he says. ""But it was a chance to do what I love."" He still cooks at home and tries to stay healthy by cycling to the tube station.

Where do his ideas come from? ""It is not easy; I have to work hard,"" he says. ""I usually write in the mornings. I do not wake up very early. After lunch, I spend a few hours typing what I wrote in the morning. I use an old typewriter, not a laptop. I get 50 to 100 letters a week, and I enjoy that part of being a writer.

In the lumberyard by the lake, there was an old brick building with two floors. Outside, there were big piles of soft sawdust. The sawdust looked like golden mountains and covered the yard down to the blue lake. 

One afternoon, Michael and his friends were bored. They followed Michael up the ladder to the roof of the building. They sat with their legs hanging over the edge and looked at the lake. Suddenly, Michael said, ""I dare you to jump down."" He jumped off the roof and fell into the sawdust, rolling around and laughing. ""I dare you all!"" he shouted. ""You're all cowards."" 

His friends looked down from the roof, scared. But one by one, they jumped down and landed in the sawdust, smiling with relief. They lay on the sawdust pile and told jokes. Then one friend said, ""Come on up to the roof again and jump down."" 

They were not very excited, but they went up to the roof again. They jumped off quickly until only Michael was left. The others were down below, smiling and calling, ""Come on, Mike. What's wrong?"" 

Michael wanted to jump down, but he stayed on the edge of the roof, feeling nervous. He tried to count to ten and then jump, but he could not. His friends started to laugh at him. They were tired of waiting, and it was almost dinnertime. ""Come on, you're a coward! Do you think we will sit here all night?"" they shouted. 

Michael felt sad and alone. He looked at the ground for a long time. The sun was setting, getting bigger and bigger. Finally, he closed his eyes and jumped down into the sawdust. He lay there for a long time. The yard was quiet because the workers had gone home. 

Michael felt ashamed and slowly walked home. He was late for dinner. His stepmother said, ""You should be able to get home on time. If you won't come home, you can stay out tonight."" She looked serious, but Michael did not hear her. He was thinking about his friends laughing at him."
FCE_44,"**Careers Advice**

Are you unhappy in your job? Do you want to change it but don’t know how? Kitty Doherty has some good advice. Many people who want to change their job go to a careers adviser. First, you write a short history of yourself. Then, you take some tests called 'psychometrics'. After the tests, you get a summary of the results and suggestions for different jobs. 

I tried Career Analysts, a big organization that gives career advice. Taking the careers test felt like being in a science exam. I was with about ten other people, and we had to answer questions quickly. I had to remember that it was not about passing or failing. The tests were hard. They included finding mistakes in lists of names and numbers and matching shapes. 

After the tests, I talked with an adviser. He gave me a report with his thoughts and suggestions. I agreed with most of what he said, but I was a little sad to learn that I did not do well in the science and technical tests. I am glad I did not become a nurse! However, it was good to hear that I made the right choices about journalism.

Changing your career does not always mean a big change. Last March, Donna Laney, 25, lost her job as a marketing manager after five years. Her friends told her to go to Career Analysts for help. Donna said, ""Losing my job was a good chance to think about my career. I wanted to look at my skills and interests."" Some results surprised her. ""I did not know I was good at design. But I had to think about the cost of retraining for design,"" she said. 

Donna also got other ideas, like taking a year off to work in the Far East. In the end, she decided to use her skills and find a job that suited her better than insurance. Now, she works as a Public Relations officer. She believes she could have reached this point without Career Analysts, but they helped her understand what she wanted to do. She has sent many friends there, and they are all happy with the service.

Some people feel they need help to make big changes. Juliet Greene, 26, went to Career Counselling Services after working at a bank for six years. She said, ""My job was boring, and I needed a new challenge. I did not know what I wanted to do, so I went to Career Counselling Services with an open mind."" After taking the tests, she learned she was interested in sciences. 

Juliet had four meetings with an adviser. The third meeting was recorded, which helped her remember what she said. After the fourth meeting, she decided to study geology and start a degree later this year. She thinks the advice from Career Counselling Services was worth the money. Now, she is much happier.

However, career advice does not work for everyone. Amanda Margetts, 24, a sales representative, said, ""I did not know where to go in my career. I thought a careers adviser might suggest something new. I got many new ideas, but I did not like them because they needed a big drop in salary or a lot of retraining. I did not learn anything new about myself."" She felt that if she had told a friend the same things, they would have given her similar advice."
FCE_22,"**Text: Fun at the Dentist's**

If you go to W. Lloyd Jerome's dental office in Glasgow, you will see bright paintings on the wall and a blue couch. Patients sit on the couch while he checks their teeth. Jerome says, ""Many people only go to the dentist when they are in pain. They are scared."" To help with this, he wants to make the office a nice place. He does not wear a white coat because many people think that means pain. He believes dental visits should be relaxing and fun.

Jerome uses new ideas to help people feel better. He was the first dentist in Britain to use virtual-reality headsets. Patients wear these headsets during their check-up. They sit on the blue couch and watch a film about underwater animals while Jerome checks their teeth. Then, the headset shows them a view of their mouth.

Most patients like this part of their visit. The office also smells nice, like a perfume shop. Today, it smells like orange. Jerome wants people to feel that this is not a normal dentist's office. The usual dentist smell can make people scared.

Jerome is known as a fashionable dentist, but he takes his work seriously. The relaxation ideas are important, but good treatment is the most important. He uses a special tool that sprays warm water on the teeth to clean them. It feels a little strange, but it is not painful if people are relaxed.

Five years ago, Jerome went to the United States to learn about dental techniques. He found that when it is easier for the patient, it is easier for the dentist too. He wants to change the way dentists work in Britain to be less formal.

One day, a patient arrives. Jerome quickly goes to him, offers tea, asks what video he wants to watch, and leads him to the chair. The patient seems to enjoy this special treatment. The office feels more like a beauty salon than a regular dentist's office."

Chocolate comes from South America. Now, it is a big business around the world. In Britain, people spend over £230 million on chocolate at Easter. This is about eight percent of all chocolate sales in a year. People eat more chocolate at Christmas than at any other time.

The cacao plant, which makes chocolate, was first grown by the Aztecs, Toltecs, and Mayans over three thousand years ago. The cacao tree grows in warm places like Africa, South America, Central America, the West Indies, and South-East Asia. The fruit of the cacao tree is big and has 20-40 seeds inside. When the seeds are dried, they become cacao beans. In English-speaking countries, these are often called cocoa beans. This name is a mistake from the 17th century.

The Aztecs used cocoa beans as money. They also made a drink called xocoatl, which means ""bitter water"" in their language. The Aztecs added spices to this drink for special occasions. The Spanish liked the drink better with cinnamon and sugar, but it took a long time to become popular in Europe.

In the late 1600s, chocolate houses opened in big cities in Europe. People went there to drink chocolate. Until the last century, people made chocolate drinks from solid chocolate blocks. In 1826, a man named CJ van Houten from the Netherlands made chocolate powder. This was made by taking most of the cocoa butter from the beans. 

In 1847, a company in Bristol called Fry and Sons made the first chocolate bar by mixing cocoa butter, chocolate liquor, and sugar. A Swiss company later added milk to make milk chocolate. At that time, French companies sold most of the chocolate in Britain. In 1879, the English company Cadbury named their factory Bournville to sound French. 

Cadbury then made the Dairy Milk bar in 1905. They advertised it as healthy because it had milk from the English countryside. Now, people in Britain eat about four chocolate bars each week. Chocolate companies are trying to find new ways to sell chocolate. They make chocolate bars into ice cream, drinks, or desserts to attract customers.

Cacao farmers still have problems because cocoa bean prices fell in the late 1980s. Many small farmers lost their businesses. So, think about them when you eat your chocolate bars. 

**Questions:**

1. Where does chocolate come from?
2. How much money do British people spend on chocolate at Easter?
3. What did the Aztecs use cocoa beans for?
4. What is the name of the first chocolate bar made in 1847?
5. What do chocolate companies do to attract customers now?"
FCE_18,"**THE SHELL ARTIST**

Peter Cooke is 83 years old. He is a master at making art from shells. He wants to try new things like making paper and working with feathers, but for now, he is happy making beautiful objects from shells. 

Peter shows me his work in his apartment. He asks, ""Am I boring you?"" He is not boring. He is very interesting and his work is beautiful. He points to some shell decorations above his fireplace. He says, ""I don’t mind if people don’t buy them. I love them."" Peter never planned to sell his art. Five years ago, some friends told him to have an exhibition so more people could see his work. They helped him talk to a gallery owner. 

His first exhibition was in London, and 70% of his pieces were sold. His second exhibition opened yesterday. The prices for his art are high, around £2,000 for some pieces. There are 86 pieces in the exhibition, with prices starting at £225 for a shell flower in a crystal vase. Peter says he does not set the prices. He believes his work is special and that people will want it when he stops making it.

Peter wishes he had started making art earlier in his life. He thinks he could have made even more wonderful things. Now, he feels he cannot do as much because he is older. But his work is very different from the common shell art you find in seaside shops. He has a creative mind and makes boxes with tiny shells, pictures made from shells, and baskets of realistic flowers.

Peter uses materials he finds. He uses cardboard from shirts for flower bases, glue from a sail-maker, and washing-up liquid to clean the shells. He says, ""I have an idea of what I want to do, and it just happens."" His work is very detailed and beautiful.

Peter travels to many places to find shells, like France, Thailand, Mexico, South Africa, and the Philippines. He looks for shells on the beach. He only collects dead shells and does not take shells with living creatures. He believes that many shells are broken by people walking on the beach. He thinks it is okay to collect shells that are empty. 

Peter’s work is beautiful, and he loves what he does."

Father and son start Gold Rush

Terence and Chris Madden are looking for gold. They have traveled from Canada to Africa to find it. Terence is the father, and Chris is the son. They think their mine on a Welsh mountain has a lot of gold. They believe there could be 10,000 ounces of gold in the mine. After ten years of digging, they think they are very close to finding a lot of gold worth five million dollars.

Terence, who is 68 years old and from Liverpool, said, ""As we dig, we are finding high levels of gold. We just need to dig a little more to find it."" The father and son have worked hard to find gold. They started their search after Terence read about gold in the 'Dolgellau gold belt' near the town of Dolgellau in Wales. They read old mining books and chose a good place to dig.

They cleared the land, found some gold in the rocks, and spent ten years getting permission to work. They took samples of the earth and removed old cars and trash. They dug out 150 tonnes of rock to make a tunnel and a 10-metre shaft. Now, they need more money. They have spent their savings and need to find someone to give them £50,000 to dig deeper for the gold.

Chris says it is hard to find a backer, but they have some people to contact. Last week, news about their dig spread, and people in the area became interested in gold. Dolgellau depends on tourists, and the people there are hopeful. Peter Woolven, the manager of the Royal Ship Hotel, said, ""If they find gold, it could bring more tourists here, but I hope many people do not come and damage the hillside.""

The gold industry in Wales has become smaller since the late 1880s when many people worked in many mines. One of the last mines, Clogau-St David's, closed a month ago. Now, more individual gold-diggers are coming back. George Hall, another gold seeker, wants to dig a tunnel on the other side of the hill from the Maddens. He is 70 years old and said, ""Searching for gold is very exciting. It is like finding hidden treasure. Maybe I will be lucky this time."""
FCE_31,"**Text: IN HOT WATER**

Rachel Mills is a scientist. She spends a lot of time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. Rachel studies marine geochemistry. This means she looks at the chemicals in the sea. She teaches at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. 

When she is not teaching, she goes into a small steel vehicle. This vehicle is for exploring underwater. It is the size of a small car. Rachel dives three kilometres down into the ocean to study underwater volcanoes. Inside the vehicle, there is not much space. She can touch the two pilots. They cannot stand up or move. They must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. 

A dive can last for 16 hours. It takes three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours to collect rock and water samples, and three hours to come back up. If there is a problem, Rachel can press a panic button. This makes a small escape vessel come out. It goes quickly to the surface. Rachel thinks it would not be a nice journey.

The first time Rachel got into the vehicle, she was nervous. She was on a ship with an instructor. He told her what to do in an emergency. They tested how she would react in a small space. Now, Rachel has made six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian team. They went to a place five days away from the Canary Islands. There are many underwater volcanoes there. 

When Rachel is not at sea, she works in her office at the Oceanography Centre. She loves teaching, but she also wants to do research on ""black smokers."" This is another name for underwater volcanoes. Water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke. It comes out very fast and is very hot.

Once, Rachel was scared when she dived with an American team. They were using equipment when there was an explosion. There was a loud bang, and Rachel thought she would die. They waited in silence, but they were still alive. 

Diving to the deepest part of the ocean is an adventure for Rachel. Every time she looks out of the porthole and sees the volcanoes, she feels wonder. She studied black smokers for three years for her PhD. When she saw them for real, it was an amazing feeling."
FCE_58,"Text: ""I was dirty, smelly, hungry, and a little sunburned. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. I was very tired. I could not understand any more train times, money, or languages. 'Never again,' I said when I got home. I said the same thing the next year and the year after that. I just had to buy one train ticket. Because I was under twenty-five years old, I could travel for a whole month anywhere in Europe. 

Sleeping in a train corridor is different from sleeping in a bed. The train rocks you to sleep. Carrying all your things in a backpack makes you travel simply. You can waste things, like burning old socks and throwing away finished books. This is part of the fun of Inter-Rail. You can forget about rules and just enjoy your trip. 

With this ticket, young people can travel to many countries in one day. On my first trip, my friends and I did not know how special this ticket was. We thought it was just a cheap way to get to our campsite in southern France. But we wanted to see more countries. The extra miles did not cost us anything. 

We were not only interested in culture. This was our first holiday without parents, like many other Inter-Rail travelers. We made our own plans and only saw the most interesting sights. We wanted to do something different. I was proud that sometimes all I wanted to see was the view from the train station. 

We were just trying to enjoy ourselves, like many other Inter-Railers who shared the train with us. The excitement of travel comes from seeing a place you only knew by name. When the train arrives, you see the city for the first time. 

To really understand Europe, you must see it yourself. Everyone knows about it, but it is not the same until you visit. This is why other people's holiday photos can be boring. The train trip may not show you new things in the world, but it is a special experience. Europe is big, and Inter-Rail helps people see this, even if it takes time."""
FCE_37,"Text: 'It is very disappointing to arrive at an airport in another country and find out that your bags are not there. You may have to wear the same clothes for a long time until the airline finds your luggage. Sometimes, you may be in a different place with different weather and have to wear clothes that are not right for that place. Airlines do not often say how many bags they lose, but it happens to many travelers. Even good airlines can make mistakes, and it is hard for any airline to promise that your checked bags will go on the same flight as you, especially if you have to change planes.

Airlines ask passengers to arrive at the airport early. This is to give enough time for bags to be checked and put on the plane. There is also a minimum time needed to change from one flight to another. This time is often longer to help with bag transfers. Usually, this system works well. But sometimes, extra security checks and air traffic problems can delay flights. This can cause bags to be lost. Human mistakes can also happen, like if a bag label gets torn off. 

Big airports, called 'hubs', can have more problems because they handle many bags. For example, last year, Heathrow airport in London had over 41 million passengers, with many changing planes. British Airways had two million transfer passengers at Heathrow. Even good airports like Amsterdam and Singapore can have bad days. 

To avoid losing your bags, try to take direct flights and check in early. If you must change planes, try to use the same airline. Allow extra time for connections by taking an earlier flight. Make sure to label your bags with your home and holiday addresses, and include your flight numbers. If your bags are still missing, talk to the airline staff in the baggage area and fill out a report before you leave the airport.'"
FCE_2,"**Text: The Kingfisher**

Wildlife photographer Charlie James knows a lot about the kingfisher. The kingfisher is a beautiful blue-green bird. It lives near streams and rivers and eats fish. Old trees grow over the stream, giving some shade to the shallow water. The main colors around are soft greens, browns, and yellows from the sunlight. The kingfisher moves quickly and looks like a flash of light. It is gone in a second, but you remember it because it is so special.

Charlie James loved kingfishers when he was young. He does not know exactly why he loves them so much. There are many stories about kingfishers. In Greek myth, a kingfisher is a moon goddess that became a bird. Another story says the kingfisher flew so high that its top became blue like the sky, and its bottom became hot from the sun. 

Kingfishers do not have blue color in their feathers. Instead, their feathers reflect light and look blue. This is why a kingfisher can look bright blue or green depending on the light. Many wildlife photographers love to watch them. Kingfishers are shy, but you can watch them from a hiding place. 

Charlie James's first hiding place was an old blanket over his head. He waited near a kingfisher's favorite spot. The bird came back in a few minutes and sat very close. But it took him four years to take his first good picture. He spent a lot of time by a stream with kingfishers. School took time away from watching the birds, and he missed lessons. He called himself an ""academic failure."" 

At 16, he got a job as an advisor for a nature magazine. Then he worked as an assistant to the editor. Later, he became a freelance wildlife film cameraman. Now, he wants to make a special kingfisher film. He wants no talking, just beautiful images. He likes to take pictures of the kingfisher's wings. 

Charlie thinks about the colors of the bird he loves. His photographs show some of his feelings. But he knows there is much more to his love for kingfishers than what his work can show."

Giving directions to an orchestra is not easy. Anne Inglis talks to five new conductors about their work.

A. **ANNE MANSON**  
Anne Manson is 30 years old. She asked to watch conductor Claudio Abbado's practice in Vienna. She ended up helping him because an assistant was not there. Later, she had to lead the first rehearsal for Abbado. She was not nervous. She likes standing in front of an orchestra. Anne Manson is from America. She works with a London opera company that focuses on modern music. She is also becoming known in other European countries. She has helped Abbado on many projects.

B. **ANDREW CONSTANTINE**  
Andrew Constantine is 31 years old. He says the hardest part of being a conductor is getting good chances to work. He won a big competition in 1991 after trying two other times. He is happy about the timing of his win. The competition gave him many chances to perform and work with a famous conductor. But he is worried about being known only for the competition. He hopes that in three years, people will know him for his work with orchestras like the English Chamber Orchestra.

C. **WASFI KANI**  
Wasfi Kani started Pimlico Opera. She loves the long practice time for opera. She thinks the music needs four weeks of attention. She began conducting seriously when she was in her late twenties. After university, she worked in London until Pimlico Opera became professional two years ago. Taking lessons with Sian Edwards was important for her. She liked that Sian was the same size as her. She enjoys the complex nature of opera because there are many different personalities.

D. **ROGER VIGNOLES**  
Roger Vignoles is 48 years old. He says conducting surprised him, but he finds it very interesting. He started as a musician in an opera house and worked with good conductors. Last year, he directed Handel's Agrippina from the piano at a festival. He thought it would be hard, but it was easier than he expected. He knew the music well and tried to get the best performance. He has learned from all his experiences and is open to trying new things.

E. **WAYNE MARSHALL**  
Wayne Marshall is 32 years old. In 1986, conductor Simon Rattle noticed him and told his agent about him. Wayne soon had to conduct a musical in London with little notice. It was a tough start. Some musicians were reading newspapers during the show, but he was firm with them. He always gave a clear beat and tried to get the best results. He has not studied conducting formally, but he is determined and knows what he likes."
FCE_23,"**Variations on a Theme**

If you want to take children to a theme park, there are many in Britain. We asked five families to try the best ones.

**Fun Island - The Burns family**  
Last year, we went to a big theme park in the US. We thought Fun Island would be boring. But we were surprised! The park is good for younger children, so our three-year-old had fun. The kids loved the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. There is a special dodgems ride for little kids, which was very popular. For older kids, there are scarier rides, like Splash Out, where you jump into a pool! After five hours, Steve and I wanted to leave, but the children wanted to stay because they were having fun. Our only problem was that the park could be more exciting, and the view was not great. But the staff were very helpful, and the park was clean and safe.

**Wonderland - The McMillan family**  
None of us had been to a theme park before, so we did not know what to expect. We thought Oscar might be too young, but he loved it. He enjoyed the Mountain Train and liked Little Land, which has small models of famous buildings. The older kids liked the ferris wheel and driving toy cars. We spent six hours there and were happy there were places to rest. The park looked nice, and the staff were friendly. There is something for everyone, even adults.

**Adventure World - The Jeffree family**  
After seven hours, we still wanted to see more. The children loved the Big Top Circus, which had a great trapeze act. We went on the Terror Line, and the girls were scared but said they enjoyed it. Their favorite ride was Running River, where you think you will get wet, but you don’t. Toy Land is fun for younger kids. The children wanted to try the new ride, Fear Factor, but we were glad they were too small for it! The park is so well made that waiting for rides is not boring. It is very clean, and the staff are nice. One staff member helped me with one of the girls when I could not sit with both.

**The Great Park - The Langridge family**  
We arrived at one o'clock and were sad that the park closed at 5 p.m. This is a great park for younger children because the rides are not too scary. I am scared of rides, but I had fun. We all loved Exotic Travels, a boat ride that starts slow and then becomes very fun. We waited for half an hour for Lightning River, and it was over quickly! I would not go on the Big Leap, but it looked fun if you are brave. If the children were older, they might have found it a bit boring, but they loved it.

**Fantasy World - The Break-all family**  
The park says there is ""No Limit to the Fun,"" and we felt that was true. The tallest roller-coaster in Europe, the Rocket, is very big. Ben thought it was the scariest ride, but Jennie said the Hanger, where you hang upside-down 30 meters high, was worse! There are many main rides, and the older kids went on them many times. Sarah was too small for some rides but liked the Long Slide. The staff were nice to younger children, but some were not very friendly. You need a whole day to enjoy Fantasy World. We could not tell the kids we were going home early."

Five women talk about their experiences starting a business in the countryside.

A. ""My customers are friends,"" says CHRISTINE HOGAN. She has a computer design business. She makes over £200,000 a year and has four full-time workers. ""My husband and I moved from London to the countryside when our children were small. I wanted to work from home. I worked with computers before I got married, so my husband suggested I start this business. It was hard at first and I needed a lot of money. I was careful with my spending and told the bank manager if I might spend too much. Working from home saves money, and I can work in the evening if I want. It is still a small business. People from the area come to pick up their work.""

B. ""I enjoy being independent,"" says MAGGY SASANOW. She designs greeting cards from home. ""I studied art at university and wanted to work in a museum. But when I got married, we moved to the countryside, and there were no jobs like that. So, I started my own business and make 50 different greeting cards to sell to museums. I work in a big room upstairs. The bad thing about working from home is that there is always something to do, like mowing the lawn. I do not advertise; my business grows by word of mouth. People send me work from London because I am cheaper than other artists. I work alone, so I miss sharing ideas with others, but there are more good things than bad.""

C. ""It has been hard at times,"" says DELIA TURNER. She makes curtains. ""I started my business eight years ago. At that time, my business grew a lot. In two years, I made £80,000. I had six full-time workers, but I had to let them go because the economy got worse. It was hard because it is not easy to find jobs here. Now, I make the curtains at home with my husband’s help and work with women who work from their homes. I have to lower my prices sometimes and look for new chances.""

D. TESSA STRICKLAND runs a children's book publishing business from her farmhouse. ""I moved to the countryside three years ago for two reasons. First, it was cheaper than London, and second, I love the countryside. I like to work when I want. Most of my money comes from deals with Australia, the Far East, and North America, so I take calls at strange times. The bad thing is that I need to be disciplined to close the office door. I publish children's books from different cultures and work with authors and artists. I felt very alone at first because all my work experience was in London.""

E. MEG RIVERS runs a cake business and a shop. She makes £250,000 a year and has six workers, some part-time. ""I started ten years ago at home. I care about health, so I made fruit cakes with good flour and eggs. Friends and family asked for cakes, and soon I was sending cakes all over the country. Seven years ago, I rented a small building, and now we have a baker and an assistant. I do not bake anymore; I manage the business. My biggest problem has been money because we did not have a lot to start with."""

The Watkins family is very special. They are all musicians. The sons write music and play instruments. Their dad makes the instruments. 

John and Hetty Watkins are teachers in South Wales. They have a ten-year-old son named Paul. Paul wanted a cello, but it was too expensive. John thought, ""Maybe I can make one."" He found a school where he could learn to make instruments. He took evening classes for three years. 

After making some violins, John made his first cello. Paul, now 28, says, ""It turned out really well. I used it for many years."" John has stopped teaching to make instruments full-time. He makes about twelve violins each year. He even sold one to a famous American musician named Jaime Laredo.

Paul and his younger brother, Huw, started playing music when they were young. Paul remembers, ""I played the piano first. I loved it!"" Later, he wanted to play the cello. His dad played the viola and wanted Paul to play the violin. Paul tried it for six weeks but did not like it. He liked the cellist in his dad's group. That cellist gave Paul lessons, and he started playing the cello.

Huw, now 22, says, ""My parents were very supportive. I wanted to be like Paul."" Huw is now a pianist and composer.

Paul won a big music competition with the cello his dad made. At 20, he became the main cellist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra. He played his dad's cello until last year. Now, he has a very old cello on loan from the Royal Academy of Music. 

Paul will soon play on television. He will perform Elgar's Cello Concerto. He says, ""I will play it my way."" But he cannot watch himself on TV because he is playing at the Cheltenham Festival that night. Huw's String Quartet will also perform in London that evening. John and Hetty will be very busy trying to see all their sons' performances!"

**THE NATIONAL TRUST**

The National Trust is a group that wants to protect the British countryside. Gill Page visits the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and talks to a warden who works for the Trust.

Gareth Roberts is a National Trust Warden. He says, ""You need common sense and you must be good with people."" He talks to farmers, visitors, and builders every day. Gareth grew up on the Lleyn Peninsula and worked on his parents' farm. Many people wanted to be the warden, but Gareth got the job because he knows the area well and has farming experience.

Gareth still helps on his parents' farm. This helps him understand farmers and their problems. He can also do physical work like building fences and planting trees. Since he started working for the Trust, he has learned more about nature. When he was young, he liked to pick flowers and collect butterflies. Now, he sees that farming has changed the countryside. He believes it is not the farmers' fault; they were just following the government’s rules.

At first, farmers and conservationists did not get along. They both wanted different things. Now, they talk and understand each other better. Gareth says, ""We just need a small step to work together.""

Gareth's job includes helping people visit the Trust's land, planting trees, and working with tenant farmers. He wants to finish jobs quickly and without problems. He enjoys seeing projects completed, but he also spends a lot of time on reports and paperwork.

Gareth loves his job, but sometimes he finds it hard to deal with some visitors. He says, ""Some people come in, want everything, and then leave. It can be annoying!"" But he believes that common sense is important.

If you have common sense and like working outside, you might want to be a warden like Gareth. But remember, there may not be a job available on the Lleyn Peninsula for a long time!"
FCE_55,"**The Netball Captain**

In our series about women in sports, Suzie Ellis met England's netball captain. Kendra Slowinski is the captain of England's netball team. When I met her, she had a busy day. She taught at a local school and then trained in a supermarket car park. 

""Don't you get strange looks?"" I asked her. She replied, ""I am focused on my movements and my feet. I might see cars slow down, but that is all."" 

Kendra said, ""My life is about being my best for the Championships."" She is following a strict plan to be fit for the games. This is her fourth World Championships, and it will be the biggest one yet, with 27 countries taking part. ""We will have home support, which is special,"" she said. ""It is important to improve the reputation of netball in our country. There will be more pressure because we are at home. People expect us to play well.""

Their first game is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. ""We have always beaten them, but they will be fun to play. They are very good,"" Kendra said. The England team is ranked fourth in the world. But Kendra knows the Championships will be hard. ""You must push yourself to play every day. There is no rest between games. You can lose the first game in a series and still win. But in the Championships, you have only one chance.""

In the fifteen years she has played, the sport has become harder and faster. Players are more aggressive. ""You train hard to win,"" Kendra said. ""But after the game, we are all friends.""

Netball is also using more science for fitness testing. ""We must think and train like world-class players,"" Kendra said. ""As captain, I need to have a strong mind and lead by example. I support and encourage my team.""

Kendra said, ""My netball career has always been planned. I decided that this competition would be my last as a player."" She will coach young players in the future, but now she is focused on her last big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she may have a tear in her eye."
FCE_50,"**SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS**

What can parents do for a child who is very good at music? It can be hard to know how to help them. Some parents may not see their child's talent until the child becomes upset or difficult. Most schools help children who are good at subjects like math or English, but children who are good at music need special support that regular schools may not provide. 

Children who are musically talented can benefit from going to a specialist music school. There are five of these schools in Britain. They help children aged seven to eighteen develop their music skills with professional musicians. 

At these schools, children spend a lot of time on music. They have individual lessons, play in orchestras, and practice singing. They also practice in special rooms, sometimes with a teacher. The rest of their time is spent on important subjects like English, math, science, and languages. 

These schools are independent, which means they are not run by the government. The classes are small, so teachers can give more attention to each student. Most children live at the school, which means they eat and sleep there. This helps them be with other children who love music too.

However, there are some problems. The cost is high, around £12,000 to £17,000 a year for children who live at the school. The schools try to help with scholarships for families who need money. Also, some parents do not want to send their young children away to live at school. 

The directors of these schools worry about admitting very young children. They want to help children grow up to be well-rounded people. It can be stressful for musically gifted children. Sometimes, their talent may fade as they grow older, and the pressure to succeed can make them feel like they are failing. 

The schools watch how each child is doing and offer help if needed. Many former students say they learned a lot from the music teaching, but some think it is not good to focus too much on music and not enough on other subjects. Many talented music students are also smart and want to learn more in school. 

It might be better to wait until a child is older to decide on a specialist music school. Children who are good at both music and school subjects can do well in regular schools with good music programs.

Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. She has a big garden around her house. This garden has many of her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wild and spread all over the garden. There are two long flower beds along a path that goes from one side of the garden to the other. The previous owners of the house were good gardeners and left many plants that Susan likes. She also kept the gardener, Danny. Susan says, ""It was really his garden."" At first, Danny did not like some of the flowers Susan wanted to add, but when she said she wanted to paint them, he understood.

Susan likes to paint individual flowers instead of the whole garden. She often picks flowers and takes them to her studio. ""I don’t set everything up at once,"" she explains. ""I take one flower out and paint it. This can take a few days. Then I bring in another flower and keep painting."" Sometimes, it takes her a couple of years to finish a painting.

Spring and early summer are her busiest times when the tulips and poppies bloom. ""They all come out together, and you're so busy,"" she says. She also finds it interesting to see how flowers change over time. For example, when she puts tulips in water, they change shape and look beautiful. At first, they seem boring, but they become more interesting.

Susan has always liked plants. She studied botany in school and collected wild flowers from the countryside. She did not like garden flowers because they looked fake to her. She liked wild flowers that grew in hard places, like rocks or cliffs.

Now, her garden has many plants from different countries, and they grow well there. She is relaxed about her garden, like a kind aunt who lets children play as long as they do not break anything. Susan has two art shows coming up, so it is hard for her to work in the garden. She now has another gardener to help her, but she knows that to stay connected to her flowers, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""

Sarah Sutherland-Pilch is a chalet girl. She is 24 years old and comes from West Sussex, England. Sarah works in Val d'Isère, France. She cooks and cleans for visitors who come to ski and stay in wooden houses called chalets.

This is Sarah's second year as a chalet girl. She finished her studies in French and History of Art at university last summer. Sarah says being a chalet girl is not a career, but it is a fun way to spend a year or two before starting a regular job. She meets many interesting people every week.

Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to work. The chalet can have up to 18 guests each week. She eats her breakfast first, then makes breakfast for the guests. They have porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants. After breakfast, Sarah cleans up and either makes afternoon tea or cleans the rooms. She thinks cleaning is the worst part of her job. By 11 a.m., she is ready to ski. On good days, she can ski until 4:30 p.m.

After skiing, Sarah goes back to the chalet to prepare dinner. Dinner is served at 8 p.m., and coffee is ready by 10 p.m. After dinner, she cleans the kitchen. She does not like a messy kitchen in the morning. Sometimes she talks with the guests, but sometimes they want to be alone. Good guests can make her week better.

Sarah lives in the chalet with her friends. They go out at about 11 p.m. They usually start at a place called Bananas and may go to other places later. But on Saturday nights, Sarah does not stay out too late because Sunday is her busiest day.

On Sunday, she starts work early. Breakfast for guests is at 7 a.m. After breakfast, she cleans quickly. If she did not shop for food on Saturday, she does it now. At about 3 p.m., she prepares tea for the new guests who arrive at 4:30 p.m. Sometimes the new guests are confused and have many questions.

Between tea and dinner, Sarah helps guests who need ski boots or skis. She gets a ride back to the chalet from the ski shop staff. Then it is time for dinner again. Sometimes she talks with friends, but if she is too tired, she goes to bed early."

Mandie Currie is a zoo-keeper. She spent a day at the magazine Marie Claire. ""Choosing my clothes for Marie Claire was hard because I usually wear a uniform at the zoo. First, I went to a photo studio, then to press previews, all before lunch. The zoo is a calm place, but here I was busy. Some people on the fashion team looked stressed, but my job is not stressful. At a fashion shoot, I laughed because I usually clean cages or handle rats. I like to see how magazines work, but I love my job at the zoo.""

Alice Cutler is a fashion assistant at Marie Claire. She spent a day at London Zoo. ""I wore leather boots and dark blue trousers. The zoo gave me a green polo shirt to wear, which was good because I got very dirty. When I touched an elephant, I thought Mandie was probably packing clothes. By five o'clock, I was dirty but had a great day. When I stop working in fashion, I might work with elephants in Africa.""

I like gardening, but I will keep my nursing job.""

Charlie Dimmock is a gardener on the TV show Ground Force. She worked a shift at Hammersmith Hospital. ""I made beds and gave out medicine. I thought I would feel faint, but I was okay.

Lucy Harvey is a personal trainer. She spent a day with Ryanair as cabin crew. ""I changed into the uniform, and I felt different. People looked at me. Before the flight, our supervisor told us about safety. I knew some of this from my training. When the passengers got on the flight to Paris, I gave out magazines. Everyone looked at me, and I felt shy. On the way back, we had 80 schoolchildren who would not sit still. I wished I was back in the gym with one sensible adult.""

Sonia McDermott is an air hostess with Ryanair. She spent a day as a personal trainer in a gym. ""I was worried about this swap because I do not exercise. I was surprised at how much attention you give to one person. In my job, I meet 130 passengers four times a day. At lunch, I saw that some trainers did not eat very healthily, but they drink a lot of water. I would not change my job for this, but it made me want to join a gym and be healthier."""

Five famous people share their favorite memories of train journeys.

**Andrea Thompson - Newsreader**  
I love the south of France. I try to go there often. There is a local train from Cannes that goes along the coast to Italy. The views are beautiful, no matter the weather or the time of year. Out of the window, you can see nice gardens and big houses. It feels like looking into the homes of rich people. The people on the train are always happy. There are tourists and locals, all enjoying the amazing trip.

**Raj Patel - Explorer**  
I have had many train journeys, but my favorite is the Nile Valley Express in northern Sudan. When I was young in South Africa, I missed a family train trip from Cape Town to Kruger National Park because I was too young. When I moved to England as a teenager, I saw my first real train station, London Waterloo. The big glass roof amazed me.

**Betty Cooper - Novelist**  
One special train for me is the Blue Train. It took my husband and me on our honeymoon across France to catch a boat to Egypt. On the train, my husband gave me a pink dress. Someone said pink is good for the brain, and I still wear it. The journey was lovely, traveling through France and then by boat up the Nile. It was a perfect way to relax after our wedding.

**Martin Brown - Journalist**  
We were writing articles about a trip around the world and had to cross a desert in Africa. There was no road, so we took the Desert Express train. The schedule was not reliable; we only had a day. The driver sometimes waited for people to arrive. When the train came, many people rushed to get on, even on the roof! At night, the train went through beautiful landscapes. It felt like a dream.

**Arisu Mezuki - Actress**  
Many people love trains from when they are children, but I did not. I grew up in Singapore and Cyprus, where there were few trains. I started to love trains as a teenager when I made a film in Yorkshire. We filmed on an old train line that volunteers took care of. I loved riding the train, and when I went back last year, everything was the same, even the gas lights on the platform!"

Do you want to get your story published? If you are not sure where to send it, Margaret Stubbs can help you. Many readers of this magazine ask, ""I have written a story or a book. Who can I send it to?"" 

First, you need to learn about publishers and practice your writing. It is important to know about the market for your writing. You can do this by reading a lot. Go to your local library and visit bookshops. Reading different things will help you understand what publishers want. 

You should keep learning because new magazines and books come out all the time. Publishers always want new writers, so you need to know what they like. 

If you want to write short love stories, find magazines that publish love stories. Get some recent copies and read them. Learn what kind of stories they buy and who their readers are. Readers want different things, and the editor wants to meet their needs. 

Sometimes, new writers send their stories to me and say, ""This has been rejected three times. Am I wasting my time?"" I do not want to discourage anyone, but it is hard to get published if your work is not ready. Many new writers send their work too soon. If you have only written one story, it is very unlikely to be published. 

When you hear about someone’s success, they usually have been writing for a long time before that. When you send your work out for the first time, keep writing more stories while you wait for a reply. Write ten more stories or even twenty. Each story will be better, and you will start to see yourself as a writer. 

Do not give up on your stories. Try to make them better instead. In the beginning, do not show your work to others. Remember, every successful writer has faced many rejections before they succeeded. 

Do everything you can to improve as a writer. Look for a creative writing course near you. If you cannot find one, join a local writers' group. This will help you get ideas and build your confidence. Think of yourself as a writer and practice writing every day if you can."

On the last day of a bad year, I was at the Baltimore train station, waiting for the 10:10 train to Philadelphia. There were many more people than I expected. The station did not feel clean and nice like before. Older couples with matching bags filled the benches, and college students left their bags on the floor. A grey-haired man was walking around and talking to different people. He looked rich: he had tanned skin, a nice sweater, and a soft coat. He asked a woman sitting alone if she was going to Philadelphia. She said she was going north, but to New York. 

Then he asked a girl near me. She had long blond hair. I thought I would like to talk to her too. The man asked her, ""Are you going to Philadelphia?"" She said no, and he moved to the next bench. Now I was really watching him. He asked an old lady if she was going to Philadelphia. She said she was going to Wilmington, and he walked away. 

I was going to Philadelphia. I thought he could have asked me, but I understood why he didn’t. He looked at me quickly and then went to another bench. He looked very stressed. He asked a woman reading a book, ""Please tell me you are going to Philadelphia!"" She looked up and said, ""Yes, I am."" 

""Can I ask you a favor?"" he said. I stood a little away and looked at my wrist, even though I did not have a watch. The woman seemed worried. The man said, ""Nothing too difficult, I promise!"" 

They announced my train. People started moving to Gate E, pulling their bags behind them. The man said, ""My daughter is flying out this afternoon for a study year abroad from Philadelphia. I put her on a train this morning and went home to find my wife upset. My daughter forgot her passport. She called from the station in Philadelphia and didn’t know what to do."" 

The woman felt sorry for him. I thought it was better to stay quiet and see what he would say next. The man continued, ""I told her to stay at the station, and I would get someone to bring her passport."" 

I thought, ""Why doesn’t he go himself?"" The woman asked him, ""Why don’t you go yourself?"" He said, ""I can’t leave my wife alone. She is in a wheelchair."" I thought this was not a good excuse. 

I looked at them. The man was holding a packet, not a plain envelope, but a padded envelope. I thought, ""Watch out, lady!"""

John Moore is the owner of a restaurant. He talks about his son, Gary, who is a famous TV chef. John believes everyone has a chance in life. Gary had his chance with cooking, and John had his chance to run a restaurant. When John found out about a restaurant for sale, he went to see it. The restaurant was in bad shape, but John thought it was perfect for him.

John remembers his childhood. His mother worked in a factory, and he felt sad when she left him alone. He wanted to have time for family. John's wife took care of the children and helped with the money, while John ran the restaurant. They lived above the restaurant and always had meals together. This helped their children, Gary and Joe, become confident. From a young age, they talked to the customers.

Gary was a lively child. When he was seven, he jumped into a corner bath and hurt himself. As he grew older, he did small jobs for money. By ten, he worked in the kitchen every weekend and earned a lot of money at school. He was very disciplined and woke up early. In a family business, everyone helps out, and John liked seeing Gary work.

Gary was not very good at school, but he was great in the kitchen. By 15, he was as good as the adult cooks and sometimes was in charge. He could make over a hundred meals. John knew Gary would work in catering because he had talent. When Gary needed work experience for school, John sent him to a friend’s restaurant.

Gary also started playing the drums and has his own band now. John told Gary to focus on one thing at a time. He advised him to achieve his goals by the age of 30. Gary went to catering college at 17. On his first day, he finished his work very quickly and even helped other students.

Everyone is surprised by how successful Gary's cooking show is. John is very proud of him. He always tells Gary that to get what you want, you must work hard. Gary has seen his chance and worked for it. John believes that if children listen to even a little of what you say, it is good. He thinks Gary must have listened sometimes."

Finding a good flat in Dublin that you can afford is very hard. The best way to find one is to know someone. If you know a person who knows someone else who is moving out, that can help. But if you are new in Dublin, like Jo, you do not know anyone. Jo had to stay in a hostel and look for a flat. 

Dublin was new and big for Jo. She felt nervous when she took the train to go there. She did not think about why she was going. Everyone at her school thought she would go to Dublin. They wanted to leave their small town and see new places. Some of her friends went to other towns, but Jo was going to Dublin alone.

Jo's mother thought it would be good for her to stay in the hostel. It was run by nuns, so her mother thought she would be safe. Jo's father hoped the hostel was warm because many hostels are cold. Jo's sisters, who worked in a hotel, thought it was crazy for her to stay in a hostel for a week. 

Jo saw an advertisement for a flat in Ringsend. It said, ""Own room, own television, share kitchen, bathroom."" It was close to the post office where she worked. Jo hoped it would be nice and not too expensive. There was no line for this flat because it was looking for a third girl to share. 

The flat seemed nice, but Jo was worried it might be too fancy for her. The house was a normal red-brick house, and the flat was upstairs. A girl with a college scarf was coming down the stairs. She looked unhappy. 

""Bad place,"" she said to Jo. ""The girls are not nice."" 

Jo asked what happened. The girl said, ""A girl just looked around and acted like she was better than us. We don’t want her here."" 

Jo met another girl named Pauline. Pauline had colorful clothes and hair. Jo thought she looked interesting. 

""I'm Jo, I work in the post office,"" she said. Nessa, the girl with the college scarf, said they were going to have tea. She got three mugs. One mug had 'Nessa,' one had 'Pauline,' and the other had 'Other' on it. 

""We can put your name on a mug if you come to stay,"" Nessa said kindly."

People love dolphins. We go to see them in seaside places, movies, and TV shows. But the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society says dolphins are in trouble. Mark Simmonds talks about this problem.

Dolphins are special to us. They are very smart animals. They can feel human emotions, and they make us think of freedom in the ocean. We see this love for dolphins in TV shows. First, there was Flipper, and now there is Darwin from Seaquest. But these happy shows hide the real problems dolphins face in dirty and overfished seas.

The number of North Sea harbour porpoises (a type of dolphin) has gone down a lot. It is estimated that there are 89,000 fewer porpoises now. You might think that such popular animals are protected by law and cared for in special places. But this is not true, and this could be a big problem for wildlife.

There are forty different kinds of dolphins in the world. In northern Europe, the most common dolphins are the striped dolphin, the common dolphin, the bottlenose dolphin, and the smaller harbour porpoise. The striped and common dolphins usually live far out in the sea. We see them in small groups, and we do not know much about them. 

Bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises used to be seen near European coasts. Bottlenose dolphins are very social and were often found in places like the Channel coast and the Thames River in Britain. Now, we can only find them in a few places, like the Moray Firth in Scotland and Cardigan Bay in Wales. The few dolphins that are left show signs of stress.

It is hard to know exactly why the number of dolphins is going down. Overfishing is taking away a lot of fish from the sea. This is bad for dolphins and porpoises because they need to find food quickly. If fish are taken from one area, dolphins may not find food in time. They can also get caught in fishermen's nets, which they cannot see. 

In modern fishing, big nets are often left in the water or pulled quickly through the sea. Many dead dolphins have been found on beaches in France and Cornwall. Marks and cuts on their bodies show that they died because they were caught in these nets.

Dolphins can also get poisons from the sea. For example, pesticides can build up in their bodies. Female dolphins can pass these poisons to their babies through their milk. There is already one case of a baby dolphin dying from its mother’s milk.

Another big problem for dolphins is noise from humans. Dolphins live in groups and use sound to understand their world. In the sea, noise travels much better than in the air. This noise can disturb dolphins in ways we do not fully understand."
FCE_51,"**GETTING FIT**

Exercise is very important for your mind and body. It helps you feel good and stay healthy. Many people talk about fitness because it is really good for you. There are many reasons to exercise, and not many reasons not to.

Exercise helps your muscles and changes your body shape. It makes your muscles stronger and helps you stand and sit well. It can stop injuries and helps with areas like your thighs, stomach, and arms. Exercise is also good for your heart and lungs.

Exercise can help you feel less sad and tired. It can help you sleep better and reduce stress. It can even help with some health problems. 

There are many types of exercise you can do, like aerobics, jogging, or using weights. But be careful! If you train too hard, you can get hurt. Start slowly and ask your doctor if you are not sure what is good for you.

Good posture is very important. If you stand or sit badly, you may look and feel tired. To help with posture, think of a balloon pulling you up. This can help you breathe better and make your body look slimmer.

Stretching is also important. It helps you move better and prevents injuries. If you stretch four or five times a week, you will feel more flexible and fit. 

A good exercise routine should include warming up, stretching, a workout, and cooling down."

What makes film-makers Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman stay away from home for a long time? They want to find the perfect shot of animals. Amanda and Owen work in East Africa, in a place called the Ngorongoro Crater. It has rained a lot there for six months. This has caused some problems for them. Owen said they had to buy a special tool to help when their car gets stuck in the mud.

Amanda and Owen have made some of the best wildlife films on TV, like their famous film about leopards. While people were watching this film, they were already back in the field, looking for another shy animal, the jackal. Film-makers like them travel all over the world to film wild animals.

I talked to Owen when he was at a safari lodge with other people. He said, ""We do have some arguments, but we get over them quickly."" They do not see one person as the leader. They both understand animals in the same way. 

When they travel, they set up their tents each night. This time, they are staying in one place. They wake up at 5 a.m. and make tea the night before. They eat pre-packed meals that they heat up. Owen said, ""We can be out for up to eight weeks, so cooking can be a little stressful.""

It can be tough, but being in nature helps them get close to the animals. Owen remembers filming a family of lions. One lioness would go away and then come back to greet her family. She even greeted their car!

Owen first worked with Amanda in 1988 on a film called ""The Great Rift."" Two years later, they started working together to film Arctic foxes. They now spend four months in one place to get enough material for each film. Before they start, they must send a script for approval. 

Owen said, ""Amanda and I have a good working relationship because we have the same ideas. We want to make a film that shows the true spirit of the place and the animals. We want to touch people's hearts."""

She taught at a local school and then trained in a supermarket car park. I was surprised about where she trained. I asked her, ""Don't you get strange looks?"" She replied, ""I focus on my movements and my feet, so I don’t see much else.""

Kendra said, ""My life is about being my best for the Championships."" She has a strict schedule to be fit. This is her fourth World Championships, and it will be the biggest one yet, with 27 countries playing. ""We will have home support, which is special,"" she said. ""It is important to improve the reputation of netball in our country. There will be more pressure because we are at home. People expect us to play well.""

Their first game is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. Kendra said, ""We have always beaten them, but they will be exciting to play. They are very good."" The England team is ranked fourth in the world. Kendra said the Championships will be tough. ""You must push yourself to play every day. There is no rest between games. You can lose the first game in a series and still win. But in the Championships, you have only one chance.""

In the fifteen years she has played, netball has become harder and faster. ""You train hard to win,"" Kendra said. ""But after the game, we are all friends."" Netball is also using more science for fitness. Kendra said, ""We must think and train like world-class players."" As captain, she wants to have a strong mind and help her team.

Kendra said, ""My netball career has always been planned."" She decided that this competition would be her last as a player. She may coach young players in the future, but now she is focused on her last big event. When she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she might have a tear in her eye. Her loyal supporters will be with her every step of the way."

Rachel Mills is a scientist. She spends a lot of time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. Rachel teaches and studies marine geochemistry. This means she looks at the chemicals in the sea. She works at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University.

When Rachel is not teaching, she goes into a small steel vehicle. This vehicle is for exploring underwater. It is the size of a small car. Rachel dives three kilometres down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes. 

Inside the vehicle, there is not much space. Rachel can touch the two pilots. They are used to being in this small space. They cannot stand up or move around. They must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last for 16 hours. It takes three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours to collect rock and water samples, and three hours to come back up.

If there is a problem, Rachel can hit a panic button. This button makes a small escape vessel come out. It goes quickly to the surface, like a ping-pong ball in water. No one has tested it yet, but Rachel thinks it would not be a nice trip.

The first time Rachel got into the vehicle, she was nervous. She was on a ship with an instructor. He told her what to do in an emergency, like if the pilot had a heart attack. They wanted to see how she would react in a small space.

Now Rachel has made six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian team. They went to a place five days away from the Canary Islands. There, on the ocean floor, are many underwater volcanoes. The volcanoes blow out black smoke. The Russian team was leaving scientific equipment to study a project that would make a hole through a volcano.

When Rachel is not at sea, she is in her office at the Oceanography Centre. Two-thirds of her salary comes from teaching, which she loves. She teaches so she can do research on ""black smokers."" This is another name for underwater volcanoes. Water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke. It comes out very fast and is very hot.

The only time Rachel was scared was when she dived with an American team. They were using a 50-metre rope when there was an explosion. There was a loud bang, and Rachel thought she was going to die. They waited in silence. When nothing happened, they were very relieved. They were still alive!

Diving to the deepest part of the ocean is an adventure. Every time Rachel looks out of the window, she sees the chimneys of the volcanoes. She feels wonder. She is at the bottom of the sea, and no one else has seen them before. Rachel studied black smokers for three years for her Ph.D. When she saw them for real, it was an amazing feeling."
FCE_56,"**Interview Tips**

First impressions are very important. Studies show that people make opinions about us in the first few minutes of meeting. They notice how we dress, our eye contact, our body movements, how fast or slow we talk, our voice volume, and our words.

Mary Pearce wanted to be a teacher. She worked hard to get her degree. When she graduated, she felt very confident. She applied for a job at a nearby primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher. That morning, she saw a small hole in her jacket. She thought about changing, but she did not want to be late. She believes it is important to be on time. Mary did not get the job. A friend who works at the school told her that the Head Teacher said, ""If someone does not take time to look their best at an interview, what kind of teacher will they be?""

Simon Grant, a hotel manager, says, ""People who look like they care about themselves are more likely to care about their jobs. People think what is inside is important, but in an interview, you should try to look your best.""

Many people do not think about looking professional. For example, Janet Goodwood worked for ten years as an administrative assistant. When her boss retired, she applied for the job but did not get an interview. She asked why and the Director of Personnel said she did not look like an office manager. He told her to improve her clothes before applying again. Janet was shocked. She does a good job, and she thought her clothes should not matter.

How we move and use our hands can also affect what the interviewer thinks. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian found that 7% of our message comes from our words, 38% from our voice, and 55% from our facial expressions. If our words and our face say different things, the listener will believe the non-verbal message more. So, make sure your words match your body language. Mixed messages can confuse the interviewer.

It is also important not to seem too desperate for the job or too eager to please. Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, applied for a promotion. Her interview went very well, and she was offered the job right away. She was very happy but showed too much excitement. The boss saw how excited she was and offered her a lower salary than she wanted. She thinks she could have gotten more if she had controlled her excitement.

Finally, what we say and how we say it can help us in an interview. David Artesio, a manager of an employment agency, suggests learning about the company before the interview. For example, the annual report can tell you about the company. Mention something that interests you during the interview. This shows you care about the company.

Business consultant Marian Woodall suggests having a few questions ready and avoiding long, confusing sentences. She says, ""Poor communicators talk in long sentences. Successful communicators talk in short sentences and key points."""

I feel happier now and less stressed. I miss talking to my colleagues. I love that I am responsible for my work. If I do a bad job, it is my fault.""

I train at home in winter and then go to Florida for three weeks before the season starts. It is fun there, and I have to be very disciplined. If my friends ask me to go out the night before training, I have to say no. I wish I could go, but I need to work hard. My main goal is to go to the next Olympics - that would be amazing.

B. **Gabriel (Surfer)**  
The surfing community is small, so I see the same people at competitions. Professional surfers are serious, and the best waves are in the morning. If I want to be good, I cannot go to late-night parties. I do not mind this too much, but I love to sleep in. I have to give that up too. But it is worth it because I won the National Championships last year. After a win, I like to celebrate, and if I win money, I go somewhere nice. Winning the championship helped me get a job on TV, so now I am a bit famous.

C. **Dieter (Yacht Racer)**  
When I am on a boat with my friends, we have a lot of fun. We celebrate wins in a big way. Some people say we act like kids, but we do not look for media attention. Sometimes reporters care more about our celebrations than our race results. I am away for eight months a year, so I enjoy coming back and spending time with my friends. You cannot only focus on sailing; it is not healthy. I am known in sailing, but not many people recognize me on the street. I do not want to be famous. I get nice letters from fans who want signed pictures, and I reply to every one, even if it takes time.

D. **Tomas (Tennis Player)**  
It feels great to walk onto the court and hear the crowd cheer for me. At my last tournament, it got a bit crazy with many people around. I like being recognized by fans when I am out shopping. But it can be hard too. My last girlfriend did not like it when I got attention from female fans. Tennis players travel a lot, and that is why we broke up. It was tough, but you have to make sacrifices in sports. I focus on my game now and will think about other things in life when I retire, which happens early in this sport."

Shopping in a supermarket with children can be very hard for parents. One mother says, ""They want everything! If it is not the new sugary cereal, it is a Disney video or a comic. Usually, they want all three. I cannot buy all this. If I say yes, I feel bad because I know it is not good for them. But I also feel bad when I say no. I try to avoid taking them shopping, but I worry they need to learn how to make choices. I cannot win.""

Research shows that children ask for something to buy every two minutes in a supermarket. More than £150 million is spent on advertising for children, mostly on TV. This number is likely to grow. Children do not always understand why their parents say no to certain things. Parents often talk about how bad sugar is for teeth, but children see fun ads that make them want the products.

Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, ""Most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, but these ideas are not always right. It is good for parents and children to talk about food. If children only hear about products from ads, they get a one-sided view. Parents feel they must compete with ads and often disappoint their children.""

The Independent Television Commission says that ads cannot tell children to ask their parents to buy things. But Dibb says, ""The goal of advertising is to make people want to buy things. Even if they do not say, 'Tell your mom to buy this,' that is what they want.""

Shopping with children can be stressful for parents. One mother says she talks to her children about food and ads. She feels better because her son now thinks ads are not good. They do not argue much in the supermarket because the children do not ask for things she does not want to buy.

Parents sometimes say no to their children's requests but then buy treats for themselves. Mike, a father of a seven-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter, says, ""We do not buy him sweets because they are bad for him, but we buy cream and chocolate for us. It is nice to buy good things, and it is normal for children to want to share that. But I still get annoyed by their requests. It depends on how I feel. If I am happy, I am more likely to say yes. It is hard to be consistent.""

Supermarkets could help parents by moving sweets away from the checkout area or by having play areas for children. Parents might buy less if their children are not with them, but shopping without their children's demands could bring in more customers."

The Merrion Hotel is a new five-star hotel in Dublin. It took two years to change four old houses into this hotel. The hotel has the latest technology to help both staff and guests.

The General Manager, Peter MacCann, wants his staff to know the guests' names. For special details about guests, he uses a computer system. This system helps the hotel give good service to returning guests. It cost a lot of money to install, but it will help the hotel save money over time. 

For example, if a guest asks for certain music during their first stay, the hotel will have that music ready for them when they come back. The hotel also has a system to control room temperature. Guests can change the temperature in their rooms between 14°C and 25°C. 

The hotel is good for business guests. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine, and a video-conferencing system. The hotel is ready for new technology. They rent televisions and DVD recorders so they can change them for newer models easily.

The hotel has 145 comfortable bedrooms. There is a swimming pool, a gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a beautiful garden. The food is excellent. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, who has two Michelin stars, has moved his restaurant to the Merrion. 

With good food, great staff, and new technology, the Merrion Hotel is likely to be very successful."

FCE_45,"**ICE SKATING**

Ice skating is a fun activity that people have done for many years. Long ago, people used skates made from animal bones. These bone skates were used until iron skates were made in Scandinavia around the year 200 AD. For rich people in Scandinavia, skating was an important skill. 

In the early 1900s, skating was seen as fancy. But in 1924, a young girl named Sonja Henie changed this. She made skating more exciting and popular. Today, skating is both beautiful and hard work. 

For beginners, it is very important to have balance and control. You can go faster as you get better. To keep your balance, your body should lean slightly forward. Your legs should be a little bent, and your feet should point outwards. When you start, your heels should almost touch. 

To move, push with your back foot and make a small movement with the other foot. It is easy to learn! If you practice, you can make bigger movements as you get better. 

Learning how to fall is also important. Even the best skaters fall sometimes. To fall safely, stay relaxed. This helps you not to get hurt. To get up, use your hands to kneel, then stand up. 

Once you can skate well, you can try different styles like figure skating, freestyle, or speed skating. It is best to start with figure skating and then learn freestyle. Many ice rinks have teachers who can help you learn. 

Good skaters look relaxed and move easily. To skate well, you should practice exercises to stay flexible. It is important to warm up your legs, back, and shoulders before skating. After skating, do the same exercises to avoid stiffness. 

Skating helps you with balance, coordination, and movement. It is good for your heart and lungs and makes your body stronger. When you skate with swimming or jogging, it is a great way to stay healthy and fit."

If you see a child winning a medal, it can make you very happy. Julia Gregson talked to three young stars and their mothers about their lives.

A. Annika Reeder, 15, won a gold medal for gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games. She wants to be a physiotherapist and compete in the next Olympics. ""The training is very hard. I don’t have time to watch TV or go out with friends. I focus on gym and school. Sometimes I feel very tired, and my coach gives me a day off, but usually, I keep going. You can’t take too many days off because it makes you stiff.""

B. Annika's mother said, ""Annika showed great talent from a young age. Some parents push their children too much, but it does not help. To do what Annika does takes a lot of time and energy. You have to want to do it. People say we, as parents, have given up a lot, but they don’t see what the sport has given us. We love it and what it has done for Annika. Before gymnastics, she was very shy, but now she has confidence and friends from all over the world.""

C. Sarah Stokes started show-jumping at ten. She has won the British National Championship. ""My parents love show-jumping because they train me and take me everywhere. The shows can last from one to five days. I never get tired of it; I love it! Even without my parents, I would still do it because I am determined. My goal this year is to qualify for the British young riders (under-18) team. I want to win a gold medal at the Olympics.""

D. Sarah's mother said, ""From the first time Sarah sat on a horse at age 1, she loved it. When she was 5, she woke up early to exercise her pony. To qualify for big shows, we travel all over England. We save money by sleeping in our horse box. Sarah is very organized. She is happy on a horse and knows what to do. Watching your child succeed at something they love is amazing.""

E. Jane McShane, 10, is the Under-14 Chess Champion in Britain. ""Tournaments are friendly. I know everyone, and it is fun. When I play, I don’t concentrate as much as I should. I just look around and don’t think. I am not scared of being proud. I don’t talk about my success at school because I don’t like to feel embarrassed.""

F. Jane's mother said, ""Jane played her first game when she was 5. My father wanted to see if she liked it. I was bored when my father tried to teach me, but Jane loved it. By the end of that day, she knew all the moves and started to beat adults. I am happy when she wins, but if she wanted to stop playing tomorrow, I would support her. I don’t want to stop her from being great. If she has this talent, I want her to use it."""

Chris Greener was fourteen years old when he told his teacher he wanted to join the navy. The teacher asked, ""What do you want to be? The flagpole on a ship?"" This was funny because Chris was already very tall. Today, he is 228 cm tall and is the tallest man in Britain.

Every ten years, people in Europe get a little taller. More tall people are being born. This does not mean we are becoming a super race. Instead, we are going back to how we were as cavemen. We are getting taller because we are eating better food now. Professor Chris Stringer says, ""We are becoming like Cro-Magnons, the people who lived 40,000 years ago.""

Long ago, our ancestors ate many different foods. Women gathered fruits and herbs, and men hunted animals. They ate from 85 different wild plants. About 9,000 years ago, farming started. This changed everything. Now, most of the world's food comes from just three plants: wheat, rice, and maize. This simple diet has made people less healthy. 

In Ohio, scientists found that when people started farming corn, they became sick and underweight. Their teeth got worse, and they got more diseases. Corn was not good for health. But farming spread because it could feed many more people than hunting.

Today, many people are still not healthy, even in rich countries. In Europe, the US, and Japan, people are starting to eat better again. Now, the average man in the US is 179 cm tall, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm tall. This is good, but there are still problems. Beds have not gotten longer since 1860, and there is less room in planes and trains. Clothes companies have to change their sizes often.

Some scientists think we might stop growing taller soon. Robert Fogel says we could reach a height of 193 cm this century. But there is a problem. While some people are getting taller because of better food, as a group, humans are actually getting smaller. A long time ago, during the ice age, people were rounder and taller to keep warm. Now that the climate is warmer, we are getting thinner and smaller. If the planet keeps getting hotter, we might get even smaller. 

**Questions:**

1. How tall is Chris Greener?
2. What did Chris want to be when he grew up?
3. What are the three main plants that provide food for many people today?
4. What happened to people’s health when they started farming corn?
5. What is the average height of men in the US?"
FCE_57,"**Text: Studio Audiences**

What is it like to be in the audience when a TV show is made? Cosmo Landesman found out. Studio audiences are a common part of TV, but many people do not understand them. When we watch game shows, we see the audience getting excited and wonder, ""Who are these people?""

Some people think studio audiences are not important. They say that even TV workers do not respect them. I thought studio audiences were just made up of silly people who want to be on TV. But there is no typical studio audience. They come from different backgrounds and jobs. TV shows want to attract different people.

Many people at home do not understand why anyone would want to watch a show in a studio. Why would someone apply for tickets, travel far, and wait in a studio just to see what they can watch at home? One idea is that people hope to be on TV for a moment. I did not believe this until I talked to Angela. She said, ""I came for a chance to be on TV.""

Another idea is that people are curious to see how a show is made. But many people said, ""A friend gave me a ticket."" Few of us have been in a studio audience, but we think we know what it is like. You sit close to strangers while someone shows signs that say APPLAUD or LAUGH, and you clap or laugh when you see them. This is true for some shows, but not all. One studio manager said, ""We believe a show should be good enough not to need these signs.""

Is there a real difference between being in a studio and watching at home? For Claire, being in a studio is ""more exciting."" Charlotte liked being part of live TV. She said, ""Last year I saw my favorite comedian. When you watch him at home, you miss a lot."" What I missed was seeing the actors live. I could only see the back of someone’s head. The opening scenes were far from me, so I watched the show on a monitor.

Going to a studio may not be the best way to watch TV, but that is not what matters. For most people, it was just fun and a free night of entertainment."

**Favorite Places**

**Bruce**  
I do not like wild landscapes. I like places with people. When I travel, I enjoy lovely villages with old temples, not empty deserts. When I was eight, I went to school in England. On Saturdays, I would ride my bike to the village of Lastingham. Cycling was fun for me. I loved exploring the hills, valleys, and old villages. I am from Scotland, so the landscape felt familiar but also different. I still visit there today. I wrote about my adventures in my diary. This was my first travel writing.

**Sophia**  
There is a small train that goes from Hythe to Dungeness. It is run by volunteers. I always travel first class because it is not much more expensive. The view is not amazing. The train goes over Romney Marsh with sheep and next to a canal. But I look forward to one part of the journey. The train goes through back gardens. For a moment, we see people doing everyday things, like making tea or folding chairs. I see myself in their eyes, a woman in a small train, looking into their homes. I like the simple landscape of fields, sheep, and the sea. It makes me look closely and find new things.

**Matthew**  
The Hartland Peninsula is a quiet and beautiful coast. The beaches are hard to reach and have many rocks, so there are not many people here. Some surfers come, but most visitors enjoy the sea. This coast faces the Atlantic Ocean and is known for shipwrecks. There are walking paths along the coast and into beautiful valleys with oak trees, ferns, and wildflowers. We stay in a simple place with a family in the village of Southole.

**Annette**  
My favorite place in England is the Trough of Bowland. It is a wide-open area perfect for hiking. There are not many people living or visiting there. It is quiet and empty, and I like the space. I found this place by chance when I was a student. Since then, I visit every year, sometimes alone, sometimes with my boyfriend, and now with my son. It has not changed much since my first visit. Having a child makes these visits special. I feel sad that he is growing up in a city.

**James**  
I bought Glenthorne, my favorite house in Britain. I wanted peace and to connect with my English roots. I grew up in what is now Sri Lanka, but at twelve, I went to school in Devon, England. I used to ride my bike around the moors and village streets. There was a story about a place we would never ride past: if you went down the driveway, you would never return. That place was Glenthorne. It is my dream place. It is a magical, quiet, romantic house. You can only hear the sea, wind, and birds."

We are 'animal people' who love all kinds of animals. One afternoon, my daughter called me at work. She said she found a wonderful pine snake. ""Can we keep him?"" she asked. I said, ""Yes, but only for one night."" We had a special tank for animals like this. One night was enough to look at it and read about it in our natural history book.

I got home late. I quickly put a pot on the stove. Suddenly, I heard my sons screaming, ""Oh, Mother! Help! Do something!"" I ran to their room. The problem was with Domino the cat and Bianca the white mouse I got for Mother's Day. Domino had the mouse in his mouth and was running around the room. He wanted to escape with the mouse, but he was running into furniture and kids.

I jumped into the room and tripped over something. I fell on the floor. I saw the snake. It had escaped and was moving all over the floor. The snake was long and strong. The cat, mouse, and kids were jumping around, making a lot of noise. The dog was barking. The pot on the stove boiled over, and I ran to turn it off. I came back with more energy. I caught Domino by the tail and saved the little mouse from him. 

Later, I looked at the snake. It did not have any weak points. I sat on the floor like a snake-charmer, moving back and forth. Slowly, the snake relaxed and put its head on its body. I carefully put my hands under the snake and stood up. I walked to the end of the garden and pointed the snake to a tree. I was scared it would bite me, but it slid away and rested on my shoulders like a colorful shawl.

We stood together in the evening light: four kids, Mum, and the snake. My oldest son, DJ, said, ""Mum, you are nice and warm, and the shed is not."" I had the kids help me encourage the snake to move. Slowly, it did. It climbed up the wall and disappeared over the roof. As the last part of the snake went away, my three-year-old son Clay said, ""Boy, that was one big snake!"""

In our fast world with phones and computers, writing letters is becoming rare. But for me, getting a letter is special. I love the surprise of getting a letter, seeing who it is from, and reading what it says. Writing letters has been part of my life for a long time. I started by writing little notes to my mother. She always made me write thank-you letters for gifts. It did not matter if they were short or messy, as long as they were letters.

When I was 18, I moved to London to study to be a doctor. I wrote to my mother every week, and she wrote back. Sometimes my father wrote to me, and I loved his funny letters. Most letters from home were about everyday life with my parents and their friends. We also called each other, but I remember the letters more.

I also got letters from my boyfriends. They were away for work or school, and we kept in touch by writing. Writing letters helped our relationships. I found it easier to say what I felt in a letter than in person. I enjoy letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. Notes are nice, but letters with news are better! I love getting letters from faraway places, like Sri Lanka, Australia, and Vancouver. I also have a friend in France. We started talking in a restaurant, and I asked for her address. Now we write to each other regularly. I can practice my French with her, and we have visited each other.

This summer, my family and I visited my American penfriend in Texas. We had been writing to each other for 29 years but had never met. People were surprised that we wrote for so long. My children are also writing letters. Like my mother, I make them write thank-you letters. My daughter writes me little letters, just like I did for my mother. She and my son have penfriends in Texas, too. I hope everyone keeps writing letters and does not let it disappear!"

**Tourists Hurt Old Rock Art**

Many old pictures are carved into the rocks in Mont Bego, a famous place in France. There are about 36,000 drawings that are very old. Scientists are worried that these drawings are being damaged quickly. They want to save them for future generations. 

The mountain has drawings that are 4,000 years old. These drawings show cows, fields, and gods. More and more people visit the site, but some tourists are careless. They write on the rocks and hurt the pictures. 

Jean Clottes is the leader of a group that studies rock art. He says, ""People think these pictures will always be here. But if the damage continues, there will be nothing left in 50 years."" He has seen tourists stepping on the drawings and making them less clear. Some people even take pieces of the rocks home. 

Some visitors try to make the pictures look better by rubbing them. They think they need to see the drawings more clearly. Other people bring sticks to scratch their names or their own drawings on the rocks. 

Experts have different ideas about how to protect the drawings. Henry de Lumley, who works at a museum in Paris, thinks the best way is to close the mountain to the public. He believes this will help save the site. But Jean Clottes thinks this idea will upset local people. 

David Lavergne, an architect, wants to keep the site open. He says it is hard to stop visitors from damaging the area. He thinks they might need to charge money to visit the site because they do not have enough money for guards. 

Annie Echassoux, who also studies the site, is worried that more tourists will come because it is easier to reach now. She believes they should block off some areas and have guides. She says, ""We need money to protect this historic site. If we do not act, we will lose these drawings for the next generation.""

Climbers used to go to the mountains. Now, people can climb indoors or outdoors. The crowd is quiet. High on the climbing wall, hanging upside down by two fingers, is the French climber Francois Lombard. He is in the World Cup Climbing Championships in Birmingham. The National Indoor Arena is known for the TV show Gladiators, but it also has climbing competitions.

Before the 1960s, climbers practiced on cliffs. In winter, they had to deal with cold weather or climb on snow and ice in Scotland. As climbing became more popular, climbers needed to stay fit. When they could not use cliffs, they climbed on brick edges or stone buildings. This helped them keep their fingers strong and fight boredom.

Soon, many sports centers built climbing walls. These walls used special bricks to hold on to. A teacher named Don Robinson built a climbing wall in a hallway at Leeds University in the 1960s. He put natural rock in concrete to make climbing walls.

In the 1970s, many climbing walls were built, but they had problems. The walls were straight, but real cliffs have different shapes. Once the walls were built, they could not be changed, and climbers got bored.

In 1985, a Frenchman named Francois Savigny made a new material that looked like real rocks. This material could be put on any wall and taken off when climbers wanted something new. French companies also made climbing walls with steel frames. Steel was lighter than concrete, so they could make different shapes. This gave climbers many new ways to climb."
FCE_61,"**Text: 'So you want to be an actor'**

Do you want to be an actor? If you tell someone this, they might say it is a risky job. Acting can be risky because there are many actors but not many jobs. When you choose to be an actor, some friends may think you are crazy. But everyone has different opinions. It is your choice, and you are responsible for your dreams.

There are no easy ways to become an actor. You do not have to take tests, but there is no guarantee you will get a job after training. Success depends on luck and talent. There is a need for new actors, and acting can be exciting and rewarding.

Many people want to know what talent is. Talent is a natural skill and imagination. Imagination is hard to measure. It also depends on a person’s courage and belief in what they do. 

Why do people want to act? It can be hard to explain. In theater, the important moment is when the actor connects with the audience. This connection is what makes actors want to perform.

If you ask actors how they succeed, they may not know. They understand some things about their skills, but they do not take success for granted. They know they must keep working hard because their fame may not last. 

Disappointment is a big problem for actors. Last month, you might have been without a job, selling clothes or waiting tables. Then, you may get a chance to audition for a role. But even if you want the job, you might not get it. 

Actors often do not talk about their chances of getting a role. They find ways to deal with the stress of competition and rejection. No one likes to be rejected. From the first moment you try to get a job, you are saying you are ready and talented. If you do not care enough, others may not care about you either."

Chris Greener was fourteen years old when he told his teacher he wanted to join the navy. The teacher asked, ""What do you want to be? The flagpole on a ship?"" This was funny because Chris was already very tall. Today, he is 228 cm tall and is the tallest man in Britain.

Every ten years, people in Europe get a little taller. More tall people are being born. This does not mean we are becoming a super race. Instead, we are going back to how we were as cavemen. We are getting taller because we are eating better food now. Professor Chris Stringer says, ""We are becoming like Cro-Magnons, the people who lived 40,000 years ago.""

Long ago, our ancestors ate many different foods. Women gathered fruits and herbs, and men hunted animals. They ate from 85 different wild plants. About 9,000 years ago, people started farming. This changed everything. Now, most of the world's food comes from just three plants: wheat, rice, and maize. This simple diet has made many people unhealthy.

In Ohio, scientists found that when people started to farm corn, they became sick and underweight. Their teeth got worse, and they got more diseases. Farming could feed more people, but many of them were not healthy. Only in Europe, the US, and Japan are people starting to eat better again. Now, the average man in the US is 179 cm tall, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm.

Even though people are getting taller, some things have not changed. Beds have been 190 cm long since 1860. Airplanes and trains have less space for legs now. Clothes companies have to change their sizes often. 

Scientists wonder how tall people will get. They think we might reach a height of 193 cm this century. But there is a problem. While some people are getting taller because of better food, as a group, we are actually getting smaller. A long time ago, during the ice age, people were rounder and taller to keep warm. Now that the climate is warmer, we are getting thinner and shorter. If the planet keeps getting hotter, we might get even smaller."

**The Farmer**  
Matt Froggatt used to work as an insurance agent in London. Now, he runs a sheep farm. ""After 14 years in my job, I felt that London was no longer fun. I wanted to work there for a few more years, but then I lost my job suddenly. I did not get a lot of money when I left, but it was enough to start my farm. I met the head chef of a local hotel. I started selling meat to them, and now I also sell meat by mail. I am happy to be out of the office, but I still work a lot, about 80 to 90 hours a week.""

**The Painter**  
Ron Able was a manager in advertising. Now, he is an artist. ""I started painting as a hobby. I enjoyed it more than my job. So, I decided to leave my job and become an artist. A career counselor helped me. I told him, 'I don’t want to go back to my old job.' He was surprised because most people want to go back to work for money. My wife and I got married young, and our children are grown up now. We moved to the north of England, where we did not know anyone. We left our friends, but they still visit us.""

**The Hat Maker**  
Katherine Goodison worked as a lawyer for five years. Now, she makes hats in her flat in London. ""Being a lawyer was fun, and I earned a lot of money, but I worked too many hours. I did not want to become a senior partner and work even more, so I left. Some people said I would get bored, but I have not. I have deadlines for my hat business, so I always have work to do. I feel happier now and less stressed. I miss talking to my colleagues. I love that I am responsible for my work. If I do a bad job, it is my fault.""

**The Masseur**  
Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16 years. Now, he is a masseur at the Life Centre in London. ""I worked in finance since I was 22. I liked the excitement, but I did not find it rewarding. I almost lost my job in 1989, but I left and traveled for a year. During that year, I thought about what I wanted to do. I was interested in health, so I visited gyms and talked to the owners. I knew I needed training, so I took courses in massage. Then, I got a part-time job at the Life Centre. I have no regrets. I feel in control of my life now, and that is the best part."""
FCE_5,"**Simplified Text: 'A Winning Game'**

Two brothers are finding that their childhood game is good for business. Dave and Norm Lagasse are sitting in their home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA, and playing a game called pichenotte. This game is special to them. Their grandfather, Lucien Rajotte, brought the game from Quebec, Canada, to the USA. The family played pichenotte every weekend and holiday. Dave says they had a lot of fun.

The family moved to New Mexico, but they still played pichenotte. Their grandfather made the game board from old wooden crates. When visitors came, they were curious because the game was unknown in the southern USA. Three years ago, Dave made a new pichenotte board because the old one was broken. A relative saw it and wanted one. Then a friend wanted one too.

One night, the brothers took a new game board to a sports bar in Santa Fe. People watched and said, ""I won't play that silly game."" But soon, they sat down to play! When people asked about the game, Dave did some research. He found out that the game might have started in India. It became a game called 'squails' in Britain, and British people brought it to Canada. Pichenotte is the French-Canadian version of the game.

Pichenotte can be played by two to four people. Each player has 12 pieces called 'pucks'. They flick the pucks across a round board with their fingers. If a puck goes into a small hole, it is worth 20 points. There are three rings around the hole worth 15, 10, and 5 points. The game has eight small posts that are obstacles. The game usually lasts about two minutes.

When the game became popular at the bar, the brothers made more boards and took them to markets and craft fairs. Many people came to buy them. Soon, they started having championships and a trophy called the 'Lord Pichenotte Cup'. The brothers sold many boards quickly. They decided to make pichenotte boards full-time. They set up a workshop in their garage and made over 450 boards. Each board is made of birchwood and mahogany, weighs 12kg, and is 1cm thick. Norm says, ""They are very strong and last a long time."" 

The boards are sold for $595 each on their website. There are no professional pichenotte players or TV shows yet. But the brothers hope that one day they will be very successful and have a nice car instead of a workshop in their garage. For now, they are happy to play the game they love."
FCE_41,"**WELCOME TO THE MODEL VILLAGE**

When you enter the Model Village, it is hard to believe that a few years ago this was just empty land, covered with weeds. For a long time, people thought this land was useless. One man, with help from his wife, worked hard to change this land into the beautiful place you see today. 

Many tons of soil and clay were moved to make the village. Machines helped, but a lot of hard work was done by hand. After the land was shaped, about 1,000 tons of topsoil were added to create the lawns, flower beds, and rock gardens. Hundreds of trees and bushes were planted. These plants were chosen carefully because they needed to survive near the sea and strong winter winds. Most plants came from local garden centers, but some were brought from Canada and New Zealand.

The village was created by Colin Sims. He made over 100 models by hand over nine years, starting in 1972. The models are made from different materials like stone, concrete, wood, and plastic to last in all kinds of weather. At first, Colin needed help from experts to learn about the materials, but soon he became an expert himself. 

You will see that everything is made to the same scale, and even the smallest details are important. The Model Village is very popular and is known for its high quality. The techniques used here have been used in other model villages in England and in some college courses about modeling.

All the buildings in the village show traditional British styles. One impressive building is the Manor House, which is a typical 13th-century stone building with a brick tower. As you walk around, you will also see a Castle, St Mary's Church, a zoo, and a mini golf course, which is the newest part of the village.

Please stay on the paths during your visit and do not touch the models. If you touch them, it can take us a long time to fix them. You can take photos from the paths only. Dogs are welcome on a short lead.

To enjoy the Model Village more, you will see buttons in front of some models. Press these buttons to make the models move. At the end of your visit, we would love to hear your comments. We are always planning new models, and your ideas can help us make the village better. We also want to know if any models need fixing.

We hope you enjoy your visit and come back again. Please tell your friends about it!"

Every week, British tabloid newspapers show pictures that invade people's privacy. These pictures often break the rules of the newspapers. Sometimes, pop stars take pictures with paparazzi, but this is not common. Most of the time, it hurts people when they see their private moments in the newspapers. Very few people ask for help from the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), which is a group that helps with these problems. These pictures are rarely important for the public. For example, do pictures of pop stars help solve crimes? Did a picture of a famous actress on a hotel balcony help keep people safe? The actress has complained about such pictures before, and since she was in a hotel, where people expect privacy, she had a reason to complain, but she did not take action. It is a problem that the PCC did not start an investigation. 

The PCC should look into a recent story about a pop star's love life. The pop star, like the actress, did not make a formal complaint. Shouldn't the PCC take action on this and other bad stories? This seems like a good idea. It could lead to many decisions against newspapers. Other newspapers would report this, and it would be on TV and radio. The public would not support these newspapers, and editors would stop publishing such stories. Photographers would also be affected and might not be able to hide and take pictures of celebrities anymore.

If the PCC decided to act like a ""police officer,"" there would be problems. How would it know when to start an investigation? Should it ask the person who was hurt to make a complaint? If that person does not want to complain, should the PCC still investigate? Also, famous people might expect the PCC to help them, and they could be upset if it does not. The job of the PCC is very big. How could it watch all the newspapers in Britain? There is also the problem of embarrassment. Even if someone’s privacy is invaded, would they want to go through an investigation? Many people just want to forget about it and move on with their lives. Some might have other reasons to stay quiet. They might have a worse story that they do not want to become public if they complain. In this way, the PCC might also become a problem.

One British comedian had trouble with the press when he and his wife were secretly photographed on their honeymoon. He did not complain then, and he did not complain later when a photographer took pictures of him and his family on vacation. He was afraid that the newspaper would make a new story about him being angry. They thought it was just fun, and since he is a comedian, they thought he would laugh. This fear is understandable. People think they will be targeted again if they complain about the tabloids. It is hard to find an easy solution to this serious problem.

**Questions:**

1. What do British tabloid newspapers often show?
2. What is the Press Complaints Commission (PCC)?
3. Why did the famous actress have a reason to complain?
4. What might happen if the PCC takes action against newspapers?
5. Why did the comedian not complain about the pictures taken on his honeymoon?"

Many college students get advice when they finish school and look for their first job. This article talks about finding a second job. We are not talking about people who want a short job while looking for a permanent one. We also do not talk about people who leave a job they do not like after a few weeks. Instead, we will help those who want to take a real step in their career. You have learned some skills and know what you want to do.

What kind of job should you look for? It depends on your long-term goals. You need to think about whether you want to focus on one area, move up to a job with more responsibility, or change to a different field. Whatever you choose, you should pick your second job carefully. You should try to stay in this job for two to three years. This job will be important when you apply for your next job. It should show that you are serious about your career. Most importantly, it should help you grow and give you more responsibility.

If you want to travel, now is a good time to do it. You can work temporarily when you come back and then find your second job. Future employers will be happy to see that you have traveled and are ready to work.

Juliette Davidson worked for three lawyers after leaving St. Aldate's College. It was a good first job because the people were supportive. She learned how to work in an office and improved her typing skills. However, there was no chance to move up in the job. One day, she decided to leave, bought a plane ticket, and traveled for a year.

Now, Juliette works as a Personal Assistant to Brenda Cleverdon, the Chief Executive of Business in the Community. She says, ""In two and a half years, I have learned a lot and my job has grown."" From the start, her boss wanted to help her develop. Her job title is the same, but her tasks have changed. She now does most of the letters and budgets. She also answers questions from important people and those who want to start their own business. Brenda includes her in all her work and gives her special projects and events to organize."

**Confident People: What is Their Secret?**

Confident people may seem like they are always confident, but many say it is a skill they learned. Nina Hathway talks to five people about how they became confident.

**A. Jenny**  
When I left school, I was very shy. I thought I would always be shy. When I was about twenty-five, I helped at my daughter’s school. I was scared, but I did well. Someone suggested I take a university course. I was very nervous on my first day, but my confidence grew. Working at the school changed my life.

**B. Michaela**  
Four years ago, my father got sick, and I had to run the family business. I was scared and became too aggressive. I thought that was how confident people acted, but I learned that confidence is about believing in yourself. If work is too hard, I don’t feel guilty if I wait until the next day to finish tasks. When I face something difficult, I remind myself that I have nothing to lose. Fear can make you feel less confident, so I talk to myself to feel better.

**C. Lisa**  
People think I am confident, but I often feel scared. I learned to look confident because it is important in my job on TV. Interviewing people showed me that many of us feel nervous in important situations. My mother gave me good advice when I was a teenager. She said, “Who is looking at you? Everyone is busy worrying about themselves.” I remember this often. I also think you gain confidence by facing your fears. I was nervous when I took my driving test, but I passed. After that, I felt I could face anything.

**D. Barbara**  
I feel confident because I enjoy my work. I have built my confidence over the years. If you keep trying and learn from mistakes, you will be more confident next time. I work hard and people like me, but not everyone does. That is okay. You need to like yourself and not try to be what others want. My company offers training courses, and these have helped me feel better about myself. It is good to set small goals and see what you achieve.

**E. Kim**  
After college, I worked as a secretary. I sat in meetings and was scared to speak. Eventually, I found the confidence to share my ideas. When I started working in politics, I was very nervous about speaking in public. I told myself, “Don’t be silly. People do this every day.” I also wrote down some notes to help me. I think everyone feels a little nervous when speaking in public. The secret to confidence is to keep telling yourself, “Nothing is impossible.”"

Paul Forster goes to a kite festival in Malaysia. He spends a nervous night in the forest. Adnan Ali smiled when I gave him his broken kite. ""You have to keep it,"" he said. ""It is a tradition. If the line breaks, the finder keeps it. I have many more kites."" He showed me a pile of beautiful kites. All the kites were 120 cm wide and long, made of paper and bamboo. We sat in the shade of the trees behind the Beach of the Seven Lagoons in Kelantan. We watched Malaysia's biggest kite festival.

On the beach, there were 10 platforms. Helpers held up the kites, and many competitors waited for the start. When the whistle blew, the crowd cheered, and the kites flew into the sky. More than 500 men and boys joined the competition, which lasts for five days every year. Each person had four kites to show. The kites were judged on how they looked, how well they flew, and how stable they were in the air. 

""Flying kites is not hard,"" said Adnan, ""but making them is a real skill. Come to my house, and I will show you."" I got five invitations that day, and I decided to go to his house. There, I drank cold tea and ate fish crackers in a big room. As night came, he asked me to come back the next day to help fix his kite, but I could not. Instead, I drove to the south of the state, heading to Kuala Lumpur, into the mountains with thick rainforests.

I took a wrong turn and found a river. A small boat was there to take people across. I saw a sign that said, ""Jelawang Jungle 3 km."" I did not know that most of the path was steep and slippery. When I reached the jungle, I met Baba, who took care of a kitchen and some bamboo huts. I decided to stay there, not thinking about the insects under my mattress. 

At night, it was very dark, and I heard many sounds. A waterfall was loud nearby, and many animals were moving. In the morning, I saw a beautiful view of green mountains. In the afternoon, it rained. First, there was wind, then lightning. I got very wet. I slid down the hill and worried about my car getting washed away. Luckily, my car was still there, muddy at the bottom of the hill.

In Kota Bahru, the capital of Kelantan, everyone asked me questions: ""Where are you from?"" ""How old are you?"" They were friendly. Kelantan is known for its kites, but I remember it for the kindness of the people."

**New Picture**  
The Gallery has a new still life painting by the Dutch artist Jan van Os from the 18th century. This large painting (89.1 cm x 71 cm) shows flowers and fruit in bright colors on wood. It is one of the first paintings of this kind in the Gallery. The painting is signed and dated 1777 and 1778. It is normal for artists to date their work in two years because they wait for flowers to bloom in different seasons. This painting was given to the Gallery by Miss Violet Churchman in memory of her sister, Ida Nancy. It is now in Room 25.

What is money? Money is things like the pound, the dollar, or the franc. Money is different from things like grams or kilometres because you can use money to buy things. For example, a five-pound note can buy a book, a big bag of sweets, or two cinema tickets. But the note is just a piece of paper that does not cost much to make.

A long time ago, people did not have money like we do now. There were no banks or shops. Back then, Mr. Green, the farmer, traded corn for honey with Mr. Hive. This was a trade between two people who wanted what the other had. Over time, many societies made their own types of money so people could trade more easily. Now, most people use a national currency."

Grass is a very successful plant. There are more than 9,000 types of grass. You can find grass in every part of the world. Grass can grow in very cold places like the Arctic and Antarctic. 

Grasslands are home to many animals. These animals include small insects, birds, cows, and lions. All these animals need grass to live. 

Grass grows back quickly after it is cut or hurt. Unlike other plants, new grass grows from below the ground, not from the top. This is why many animals can live in one place. When they eat all the grass, new grass starts to grow again."

She did not tell her parents, who own a supermarket, that she wanted to work in fashion. She thought they wanted her to have a different job, so she studied management at university. After university, she moved to London and worked in an advertising company. She went to events but could not buy the nice clothes she wanted. So, she started to make skirts and tops for herself. Her friends liked her clothes and asked her to make some for them. Then, she found a small shop in London that sold her designs. The clothes were very popular, and nothing came back to her. This made her feel good, so she left her advertising job, took a loan of £20,000, and started her own women's clothing brand. Her parents were happy and said they would help her. Now, her clothes are in over 70 stores, and her business makes more than £500,000. Her clothes are in fashion magazines, she designs for pop stars, and she won an award. She feels very lucky.

The hotel is on a main road to the town center. It is about 20 minutes by bus from the center. Buses to other parts of the town stop outside the hotel. Guests should not take buses with a blue sign that says ""Express"" because they do not stop near the hotel. An underground station is less than 100 meters away.

The hotel has 200 single rooms. Each room has hot and cold water. Showers, baths, and toilets are at the end of the hall. The hotel has a shop, sitting rooms, four TV rooms, a table tennis room, a library, and a laundry. There are also eight pianos for guests to use. Guests can park their cars in the hotel drive. Daily newspapers are free, and guests can buy stamps at the office.

The Ghan Train

Mark Ottaway took a train from Darwin, in the north of Australia, to Adelaide, in the south. The Ghan train goes across Australia, from the warm north to the cooler south. People often call it the ""famous Ghan,"" but it is known for being late.

In the 1920s, there was a plan to connect Darwin and Adelaide by train. They built a line to Alice Springs, but floods made it hard for trains to run. A new line was finished a few months before my trip. The train can go fast, but the Ghan is not a high-speed train. It has few stops, and most passengers are on holiday.

The Ghan was first built to carry goods, not people. It was thought that sending goods from Europe to the south of Australia by train would save time and money. The Ghan is the first train in the world to go north to south across a continent.

When I waited to get on the Ghan, everyone was excited. Many older Australians were on the train. Our first stop was at Katherine, where the train stayed for four hours. Some people got off to take a boat trip. I stayed on the train until Alice Springs, where I went on a two-day trip to Uluru (Ayers Rock) with a small group. Climbing the rock is not encouraged now, so we just walked around it and watched the sunset.

From Alice Springs, there are two trains a week going south, so many people stop there. The view from the train after Alice Springs is not very interesting. There is a lot of flat land with cattle. But on the third day, we reached the hills near the Southern Ocean. My journey was over. The train may not have done everything the ads say, but it took me to some amazing places in Australia."
PET_31,"**Text: Climbing Ben Nevis**

Every year, many people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland. It is the highest mountain in Britain. The weather can be very cold. Climber Keith Hewitt talks about his first climb on Ben Nevis.

It was February, and it was my first big winter climb. We climbed up the north side of the mountain to Tower Ridge. It is six hundred metres high, which is a long climb. We planned to camp for three days in the 'Carries'. These are big bowls in the mountain, halfway up. We carried tents, sleeping bags, and metal spikes for our boots. You need these spikes because the snow is very hard, like ice. 

Even though some people in my group were very good climbers, we took safety equipment. This included lights, hard hats, and extra clothes. The weather was good, but I still felt nervous when we started. Climbing Ben Nevis in winter is always hard. 

The path went up, and my legs felt heavy. I was the weakest climber, so I had to rest more often. The others stopped to wait for me, but when I caught up, they started again. I promised myself to train better before my next climb. 

After climbing 200 metres, we reached Tower Ridge. It is very narrow, only a metre and a half wide. The mountain drops down hundreds of metres on each side. We had to stay calm and focus on every step as we moved slowly along it. 

After seven hours of climbing, we reached the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and the island of Skye, which is 48 kilometres away. But we were not lucky; a mist came down. 

Getting back down to camp can be as hard as going up. You need to read a map well. A wrong turn can be dangerous in winter. I was happy we took turns reading the map. 

That first time, I only felt I enjoyed the climb when I was safe in the tent. But at least I made it to the top!"

Anna is very happy because her school has a new building! The new school is big and made of wood, like the old school. It is also good for the environment. The school took a long time to build. Anna saw the builders working. It was exciting, but it was also sad to see the land go. The building was noisy, and sometimes the builders had to stop because of the rain. 

Now, there are five big classrooms in the new school. They are much bigger than the old school. There is also a room for meetings, a nursery, a dining room, and big changing rooms for sports. The sports field is not ready yet, but they are excited to use it.

When you enter the school, you will see that there are no heaters. The school gets warm from the people inside and the computers. The building keeps the heat and sound inside, so when they sing, it sounds like a concert!

You will also see a tree on the roof. The builders put it there because it is a custom in Austria, where the roof was made. The school gets electricity from a wind turbine on a hill. Anna and her teacher saw it, and it spins very fast. It is very big and can be seen from far away. They took pictures to put on the school website.

Even though they are using the new school, some parts are still being finished. They are putting on a play for parents, but they have to go back to the old school hall to do it. The new hall will be ready next year. Anna and her friends are very happy with their new school, and their teachers say they will learn better here!"

Now, I looked down at the river far below me and understood why people like rock-climbing. My friend Matt and I arrived at the Activity Centre on Friday evening. The place was not great, but we had what we needed: beds, blankets, and food. We were happy to be out of the city and in the fresh air.

On Saturday morning, we met the other ten people in our group. Cameron came with his friends, Kevin and Simon. Sisters Carole and Lynn came with their friend Amanda. We all came from different places, and none of us knew the area. We knew we would spend the weekend outside, but we were not sure how.

Half of us went caving in the morning, while the others went rock-climbing. Then we switched activities at lunchtime. Matt and I went to the caves first. Climbing out was harder than going in, but after a lot of pushing, we finally got out. We were covered in mud but happy and excited about what we had done."

**Letter to the Newport Evening News**

On Saturday afternoon, I left my handbag on the bus. In my handbag were my cheque book, address book, and my purse. My purse had about £50 in cash and some credit cards. When I realized I lost my handbag, it was too late. I was 72 years old, far from home, and I felt very worried. I stood by the road and cried.

A young man asked me what was wrong. I told him what happened. He gave me some money for my bus fare home. When I told the bus driver what happened, he said I could keep the fare. I got home safely. Soon after, the phone rang. It was the manager of CityBus. He said they had my handbag and would bring it back to me. 

I got my handbag back, and everything was inside and untouched. I want to say thank you to everyone who helped me that day. I appreciate their kindness and honesty.

Sharks are scary animals in the ocean. They can see very well and feel movement in the water. This makes them dangerous for smaller sea animals that they eat. 

Sharks are different from other fish. Most sharks must swim all the time to breathe and stay alive, so they do not sleep much. If a shark is turned on its back, it can stop moving. This helps scientists study sharks better."

My name is Nathalie. Last year, I was one of the youngest foreign students to join the Kirov ballet school in St Petersburg, Russia. At my first ballet class, I was nervous because I didn't know anyone. Everyone came to me and asked questions in Russian. I tried to speak in Russian, and then they talked to me in English, so we could understand each other.

Now, six months later, everyone is very nice to me. My Russian has improved a lot, and I understand my teachers. For the first two weeks after I arrived, my mum stayed with me. When she left, I felt a bit sad. I even called her late at night because I felt lonely.

The ballet classes in Russia are harder than in England. I eat a lot to have energy. This helps me do well in class. In the evenings, I watch my favorite films on my computer, but sometimes I fall asleep before the movie ends.

Now that I feel at home, I like to walk around the city and visit different shops. In December, it was very cold. I bought a fur hat because it was minus 10 degrees Celsius, but the Russians said it was warm for that time of year! My room is warm and cozy.

The Arctic is a special place. In summer, many people visit to see the midnight sun. In winter, there are not many people, and the snow and ice are quiet. In the late 1980s, people thought winter could be fun. 

In 1990, a French artist named Jannot Derit had an exhibition in a snow building called an igloo in Jukkasjarvi. This igloo was on the frozen Torne River. Many visitors came to see it. One night, some guests decided to sleep in the igloo. They liked it very much, and the idea of an ice hotel started.

Now, the ICEHOTEL is famous all over the world. When winter starts, a team of builders, architects, and artists come to Jukkasjarvi to build the hotel. They work on it until January 7th. The hotel is made of snow and ice, and it is built outside. Sometimes, the weather can change the plans.

In spring, when it gets warm, the hotel melts. Inside the hotel, it is never colder than -5 to -8 degrees Celsius, even if it is very cold outside. Guests get warm clothes like overalls, hats, and gloves when they stay at the hotel. It is also good to bring sweaters, scarves, and thick socks. Guests should wear bigger shoes for thick socks.

If you want to visit the hotel, you can buy warm clothes on the ICEHOTEL website. You can order them when you book your stay. The clothes will be in your room when you arrive.

The ICEHOTEL is in Jukkasjarvi, 200 km above the Arctic Circle. It is 15 km from Kiruna airport and 17 km from Kiruna train station. You can take a bus from the airport or train station to the ICEHOTEL."

A report by Dave Worthington

Homestyle is a new furniture shop. It opened at midnight last Thursday. Many people came to the shop. There were special offers, like a leather sofa for £45 (only until 3 am) and a bed for £30 (only between 3 am and 8 am). 

The shop's normal hours are 9 am to 9 pm every day. But Homestyle said it would stay open for 24 hours. However, it had to close after only half an hour. 

A police officer said, ""We knew a lot of people would come, but they were not patient. The shop was full, so the managers decided to close the doors. The people outside were angry because they thought everything would be sold before they could go in. They did not want to wait in line. 

There was also a long line of cars trying to park. Many people left their cars in the road and walked to the shop. This blocked the road.

One customer, Jenny Smith, said, ""I waited in line for three hours, but I did not have time to buy what I wanted. The staff were calm and explained what was happening. It was not safe. I will come back when they reopen, but I do not want to wait in line again."""

Tanya Streeter is a free-diver. She has four world records in free-diving. In free-diving, people dive deep into the ocean on one breath of air. In 2003, Tanya became the first person to dive 120 meters deep while holding her breath. She swam back up without help. A year before, she went deeper but used a balloon to come back up. This time, she held her breath for over three and a half minutes. She was the first woman to break a man’s world record in any sport.

A team of fourteen safety divers watched her dive. Some people think free-diving is too dangerous, but Tanya believes safety and training are very important. Most free-divers focus on one or two events, but Tanya trains the same way for all her events. She spends two-thirds of her training in the gym and the rest in the pool and ocean. She uses an exercise bike to make her heart strong. She does not run because she does not want to hurt her knees. Instead, she walks fast to stay fit.

When Tanya practices diving, she usually travels away from home. She tries to do fourteen dives in four weeks, with a rest day between each dive. It is important for her to not get tired because that can ruin her training.

When she is not training, Tanya makes public appearances to promote sports products. She also helps environmental groups by doing research or making films. Tanya grew up on the Caribbean island of Grand Cayman. She loved swimming and exploring the sea life in rock pools. She says her life now is like living her childhood dreams. Because she is famous in some countries, people listen to her when she talks about the environment.

Tanya is now in her thirties. She plans to keep breaking her own world records. She started free-diving when she was twenty-five, and she does not want to stop for many years."

Cartoon films have few limits. If you can draw something, you can make it move on the screen. New ideas and computer programs make cartoons exciting for everyone. In the late 1970s, many people thought cartoons were only for children. But then, some directors had new ideas. They showed that both adults and children can enjoy cartoons together. However, not all cartoon films were good. For example, *The Black Cauldron* did not do well because it was too scary for children and too silly for adults. Directors learned from this, and film companies started to make a lot of money again."

Honey is a sweet liquid made by bees. It is made of water and sugars. Bees can travel a long way, up to seventy-five thousand kilometers, and visit over two million flowers to make just half a kilo of honey. The color and taste of honey depend on the flowers the bees visit. There are more than three hundred types of honey. Lighter honey is usually milder in taste than darker honey. 

In ancient times, honey was the main sweet food because sugar was very rare. The ancient Egyptians valued honey and used it as payment. Today, honey is made and eaten all over the world. Research shows that honey can help with tiredness and improve sports performance. Honey is not just food; it can help with sore throats and is used in many skin and hair-care products."

Norwich is the capital of East Anglia, a part of Britain. It has been a place to live for more than two thousand years. It started as a small village by the River Wensum. In 1066, when the Normans came, it was one of the largest towns in England. Norwich has two cathedrals and a mosque, making it a place for many religions. The first cathedral was built in 1095 and celebrated its 900th birthday recently. In 1994, Norwich celebrated 800 years of being a city. This meant it could govern itself.

Today, Norwich is smaller than cities like London or Manchester, with about 150,000 people. In the 16th century, it was the second city of England. It grew for 300 years and became rich. It was famous for having many churches and pubs. Now, there are fewer churches and pubs, but in 1964, the University of East Anglia was built in Norwich. The city has many students and is a busy place for business, especially for insurance services.

Norwich has many fun things to do, like theatres, cinemas, nightclubs, cafes, restaurants, and arts centres. There is also a football team with green and yellow colors. The team is called 'The Canaries', but no one knows why.

One new place in the city is a shopping centre called 'The Castle Mall'. For over two years, there was a big hole in the city because builders were working on it. They moved a lot of earth to make a park on the roof of the Mall, with water pools and trees. The people of Norwich are happy that the old market is still there, next to the new shopping centre. Both places are busy, showing that Norwich has a good mix of old and new."

During the day, you can walk around the balloons and talk to the pilots as they get ready to fly. The balloons are in many sizes and colours, some look like animals or cartoon characters, and some are shaped like popular drinks and fast food. Kids will love it!

In the afternoon, you can fly in a balloon over the desert with one of the many companies that offer rides. You can also take a cable car from the desert to the top of the nearby mountains. This is the longest cable car ride anywhere, and you can see the festival from above.

There are many other fun things to do for visitors of all ages, like balloon races and fireworks on the first night and the last three nights of the festival.

**The Albuquerque Box**

This is a special wind pattern that helps balloon pilots. The Sandia Mountains protect the balloons from strong winds and create gentle winds at different heights. This helps skilled pilots control where their balloons go.

**Practical Advice**

Buy your tickets early (you can buy them online) to avoid a long wait. Wear several layers of thin clothes. It can be cool at night and in the early morning, but during the day, you need sunglasses and sunscreen. Bring a flashlight for night events and don’t forget your camera. If you use film, make sure to bring high-speed film for evening and night pictures."

The Eden Project is in the south-west of England. It is a very popular place for tourists. The big 'biospheres' look like something from a science fiction movie. Each biosphere has a different climate. It shows how important plants are for people. Many things we use every day come from plants, like wood, rubber, fruit, rice, sugar, coffee, and chocolate. There are over 135,000 types of plants here. Even if it is cold outside, heaters keep the plants warm. In the Rainforest Zone, it is always wet because of a big waterfall. There is also a zone that looks like the Mediterranean, California, and South Africa. They plan to build a desert zone soon."

Some people have said they do not like this year's book, New Writing 3. I do not understand why. This book has 500 pages of good writing for £6.99. That is great! Most of the book has stories. There are short stories and parts of novels. Some famous writers, like Candia McWilliam and Rose Tremain, have written in this book. 

It is interesting that many less-known writers wrote about food. I suggest you do not read Jane Harris's story, Those Nails, after eating. It has some very bad scenes that might make you feel sick! 

There are also poems from nineteen poets, like R. S. Thomas and John Burnside. You can read parts of novels by Jim Crace and Jane Rogers. There is a little non-fiction too. One funny article is by Alan Rusbridger about some newspapers. Ursula Owen wrote a special piece about herself. 

This is a great collection, and I am excited to see what next year's book will be!"
PET_14,"**Text: Learning the Violin**

""The best age to start learning the violin is between three and six,"" says Margaret Porter, a violin teacher. ""It's a good time to learn about the world."" Margaret, who lives in London, likes to teach children who are three or four years old. She sometimes teaches five-year-olds who really want to learn.

Margaret started teaching the violin in 1972. Her first class had her children’s five-year-old friends. Her students have group lessons. Each group has about twelve students, and each lesson is one hour long, every two weeks. Each student also has one private lesson with her every week. Parents must come to the classes. It is important for parents to be interested in the lessons.

In the first lessons, students learn to play by ear. They do not read music for several years. At first, there is a big difference between how they play and how they read music. Margaret says her method is not to make great violinists. She tells students who do very well to leave and learn with other methods."
PET_56,"**Text: Moonshine**

The band Moonshine released their third CD last week. The CD is called ""Here Again."" It comes after their last CD, ""The Waves."" There are some changes in the band. Tom Wilcott plays the bass guitar now. He replaces Simon McVee, who left the band last year. Tom Simpson is the new drummer.

The first song on the CD is a dance song. This shows that the band will not focus on slow songs anymore. The second song is also a dance song and is very loud. Most of the other songs are slow, like the band usually plays. These two dance songs will surprise many fans. They could become popular because they are very good.

The singer, Rob Letchford, sings very well. He reaches every note perfectly. Fans are happy he recorded the songs before he had problems with his throat. Because of this, the band had to cancel their next tour. Fans who bought tickets do not need to worry. The concerts will be rescheduled when Rob feels better.

On this CD, Moonshine shows they can make great music in different styles. They have slow songs and dance songs that make you want to move. I think they put their best songs at the beginning, and the last songs are not as good. Still, ""Here Again"" will be a big hit and bring more success to the band."

San Francisco is a city on the coast of northern California. The first Europeans to see this area were led by a Spanish explorer named Gaspar de Portola. He saw it in 1769. San Francisco Bay is a beautiful natural harbour, but it was found by land, not by sea.

In 1849, many people came to San Francisco to find gold. But the people who got rich were not the gold miners. The rich people owned banks and law firms. They built big houses on a hill called Nob Hill.

Today, many tourists visit San Francisco. They want to see famous places like Chinatown and the Golden Gate Bridge. Some take a short boat trip to Alcatraz Island to see the old prison."

PET_33,"**The History of Shoes**

A long time ago, shoes were not very comfortable or stylish. People used animal skins to cover their feet. They tied these skins around their ankles when it was cold. Today, we still use leather for shoes, but we also use other materials like silk, plastic, and cotton. 

About one hundred and fifty years ago, people started to wear different shoes for each foot. Before that, shoes were the same shape and could be worn on either foot. 

In the past, all shoes were made by hand. Now, many shoes are made by machines in big factories. Sewing machines helped make many shoes quickly and at a lower price for more people."

When I hurt my back, I had to stop running for a while. I wanted to help more women enjoy running. I wanted to show them how fun it is and help them feel good about running. I started a running club for women in my area because I was unhappy with some race organizers. They say there are not enough women in running, but they do not make good places for women to change.

I put up posters, and 40 women joined the club. They were young and old, fit and not fit. Many of them wanted to lose weight, but I think they did not think about running before. When they did think about it, they thought it was hard and painful. They did not think about having fun, talking, and smiling while running in nice places, like by a river.

At first, they could only run for one minute, but now they can run for thirty minutes! They also learned about healthy food and staying fit. I wanted to help women with running, and I feel very happy to see how much they have improved. They are happy too!"
PET_40,"**THE HISTORY OF THE IDITAROD - THE LAST GREAT RACE ON EARTH**

In the 1880s, people found gold in Alaska, the northernmost state of the USA. Many people came to Alaska to find gold and get rich. New towns were built quickly. One town was called Iditarod, which means ""far, distant place."" In 1909, Iditarod became the largest city in Alaska for a short time.

In summer, boats brought supplies to the towns. But in winter, rivers and the ocean froze, and boats could not come. So, in 1910, a winter path was made for dog teams pulling sleds. They took mail, food, and clothes to the gold miners. This path was called the Iditarod Trail. It took a team of dogs about three weeks to travel across Alaska. They stopped at ""roadhouses"" to sleep and eat.

The trail was used every winter until the 1920s when airplanes replaced boats and dog teams. But in 1925, there was a big problem. A disease called diphtheria hit the city of Nome. The medicine to cure it was in Anchorage, far away. Airplanes were new, and no one knew if they could fly in the cold. The best pilot was away, so they decided to use dog teams to bring the medicine.

The trip was over 1,000 kilometers, mostly on the Iditarod Trail. It took twenty dog teams just six days to finish the journey. Leonhard Seppala, a Norwegian looking for gold, traveled the first 400 kilometers with his dog Togo. Togo was a good guide in the snow. The last part of the journey was done by Gunnar Kaasen, who had driven dog teams for 21 years. His lead dog was Saito. At one point, Balto, another dog, stopped the team from falling into icy water. The medicine arrived, and Balto became a hero.

Now, every year, there is a dog sled race from Anchorage to Nome. This race follows the famous route from 1925. It is called the Iditarod and is known as ""The Last Great Race on Earth."""

The village of Jukkasjarvi is in Sweden. In winter, it can be very cold, up to -40 degrees Celsius. Many people visit this place every year. They come to see a special hotel made of ice. 

In this hotel, you can eat, drink, and sleep in ice rooms. You can even have a wedding there. The bar is made of ice too, so you should not put hot drinks on it! The bedrooms are about -4 degrees Celsius. Guests get special sleeping bags to keep warm. They can also get warm clothes if they need them.

The hotel is new every winter because it melts in summer. Each winter, workers build it again. It takes a lot of ice and snow to make the hotel."

In 1988, Maria Mutola was the only girl on a boys' football team in Mozambique. ""We won,"" she said. ""At first, no one cared that I was a girl. But then the other team complained."" A local newspaper wrote about her story. Jose Craveirinha, who helped African athletes, heard about Maria. He went to see her and found her playing football outside. He saw that she was very fast.

Jose talked to Maria about athletics. She did not understand at first because she only knew about football. Then he bought her running shoes and took her to train. It was hard work, and her legs hurt. Jose spoke to her parents and told them she could be successful. They agreed to let him help her train.

In 1991, Maria went to train in the United States. She had said no before because she would miss her family. The girls in the US were good athletes, but they worried about different things, like dresses and make-up. Maria worried about her parents having enough food. She felt lucky to be there. The trainers were great, and she learned a lot.

Today, Maria still runs and lives happily in South Africa with her mother for most of the year."

Most cities have a zoo or wildlife park. Some people think zoos are good. They say zoos help us learn about nature and see wild animals up close. 

Other people do not like zoos. They believe it is wrong to keep animals in cages. They say that in some zoos, animals live in dirty places and do not get good food."
PET_59,"**JAZZ**  
By Katie Atkins, aged 14  

I play the trumpet in my school jazz band. Last month, we had a jazz competition with bands from other high schools, and our band won! Each band wore different costumes. My band wore black school uniforms, and other bands wore bright T-shirts. We did not look like professional adult bands, but we played very well. Everyone was young, but we were used to performing. Players from each band even made new songs on stage. It was exciting to watch, and it was even better when my band played!  

My school has a great jazz band, but not everyone can join. Only about half of the people who want to play can be in the band. But anyone who wants to play can go to jazz practice before school. We also spend time together after school, listening to jazz and learning about it. There are trips to jazz summer camps in the country. I have been to a couple and learned a lot.  

Adults are often surprised that young people like jazz. My music teacher thinks it is because pop music is not hard enough for people like me who care about music. I find jazz exciting because it is both new and old. You can make your own music, but you also feel part of its history when you play on stage like great jazz musicians before you. My school is lucky because we have great teachers and parents who help us. Without them, we would not get far with our music!"

In Marrakesh, Morocco, it can rain from November to March. It does not rain often, but when it does, the streets can flood with water. The people of Marrakesh are happy when it rains because many winters are dry. 

Marrakesh has parks and gardens, but they do not get water from rain. They get water from underground channels. These channels were made a long time ago, in the 11th century. They bring water from the mountains all year round. 

Places that are mostly dry and get water this way are called oases.

PET_52,"**Eight-eighteen News**

Eight-eighteen News is a news group for young people. The members are aged 8 to 18 years old. We collect news and write reports, stories, and articles. We send these to newspapers, magazines, TV, radio, and websites to be published. You can read or listen to the news stories and articles on the Eight-eighteen website.

We have three places in the country where young people can meet and join projects. We want to open more places soon. Since we started in 1994, over 2,500 young people have been members. Sophie was one of them. She says: ""I first heard of Eight-eighteen when they interviewed me about young people's opinions on hip hop music. I was in a room with young journalists and was surprised by the chances they had. Age was not important; they could do stories by themselves. I started going to the Eight-eighteen place in my city, got some training, and was a member until I was 18. Eight-eighteen helped me do more than I thought I could. With the skills I learned, I got a job at 19, and now I check articles for a big news website.""

**Get Involved at Every Level**

When you join Eight-eighteen, you will get training and join monthly meetings to decide who will write each news story. Eight-eighteen helps members share skills. ""Peer trainers"" are members who are 12 years old and older. They train new members and teach them basic journalism skills. Some members present sessions to young people and adults outside Eight-eighteen, often in youth clubs and summer camps. Older staff support these young trainers on their trips.

Eight-eighteen News has training sessions for new members three times a year. Our next training for new members will be in February. If you or someone you know wants to join, call Director Den Ley at 01622 657874 for more information. The Eight-eighteen program is good for children with reading and writing skills at all levels. Membership is free, and there is no test to join."
PET_28,"**Antarctica Sightseeing Flights Website**

Welcome to our website! Here is what you need to know before booking a flight.

During the short summer in Antarctica, we take tourists on a big plane (Boeing 747) from Sydney, Australia, over Antarctica and back. The flight dates for next year are not ready yet, but if you book now, you can change your date if needed.

**Questions**

Here are answers to common questions about Antarctica Sightseeing Flights.

**How long is the flight?**  
The flight is about 12 hours. After about four hours, we see the first sea ice and icebergs. We spend four hours over Antarctica and the rest of the time flying back home. During the flight, experts who have worked in Antarctica talk about the environment and history, and they answer questions. There is a camera next to the pilot that shows you what the pilot sees from take-off to landing.

**Will I get a seat next to a window?**  
All passengers get two boarding passes. At the middle of the flight, you will move to the seat on your second boarding pass. Business and first-class passengers will have a window seat for half of the flight and a seat next to a window for the other half. Economy passengers will have a window seat or a seat next to a window for half of the flight and a seat at the end of the row for the other half. While over Antarctica, we encourage passengers to get up and move around the plane to see the sights.

**What happens if the weather is bad?**  
We have 17 different flight plans. The captain checks the weather on the morning of the flight and chooses the best direction for clear views.

**Will I see penguins and other wildlife?**  
Most wildlife in Antarctica lives far below the plane, so we cannot see them well. We do not land in Antarctica because of environmental reasons. To see wildlife, you would need to go on a boat tour.

**Can I take photographs?**  
Yes! You can bring all cameras. We also have some fun photo opportunities where you can wear Antarctic cold weather clothes."

A group of children aged ten to fifteen learns to cook on Saturdays. Many children want to join, so there is a waiting list of 30 kids. Parents pay £280 for the course. The children have fun and learn to make good food.

Bill is ten years old. He says, ""I love my mum's cooking, and now I can cook better than her. The teachers make us laugh when we eat the food we made.""

Flora is twelve. She has trouble with onions. She says, ""I love cooking. I made a meal for ten friends, and they liked it. My mum told me to find a hobby for the weekends. I was happy at home, so I did not want to come at first. But now I am very glad I came.""

Their teacher, Philippe, says, ""It is great fun. Children pay attention and remember better than adults, but the kitchen is not always clean when they cook! Adults keep learning about food. If parents teach their children to cook when they are young, the children will know how to make food for themselves when they grow up."""
PET_5,"**Winter Driving**

Winter can be dangerous for driving. It is hard to know what will happen, and accidents can happen easily. Fog can be on the road when you go over a hill. Ice can be under the snow, making the road slippery. A car coming towards you can slide on the road.

**Rule Number One**: Drive smoothly. If you move the car too quickly, it can be hard to control. When you turn the wheel, touch the brakes, or go faster, do it gently and slowly. Imagine you have a full cup of hot coffee next to you. Drive carefully so you do not spill it.

**Rule Number Two**: Pay attention to what might happen. If there is a lot of ice, look further down the road. Test how long it takes to stop by gently pressing the brakes. You may be driving faster than you think. 

In general, when the road is wet, allow double the time to stop. On snow, allow three times the time, and on ice, allow even more time. Try to keep control of your car at all times to avoid problems."
PET_41,"**Craigie Aitchison**

Craigie Aitchison was a painter from Scotland. He moved to London to study law, but he went to art school instead. In art school, he found drawing classes hard, but he kept painting. When he was in his late twenties, the Italian government gave him money to study art. He became interested in early Italian artists, and this can be seen in some of his paintings. 

Aitchison loved the green and brown colors of the Italian fields and the bright light there. He wanted to show this light in his paintings. He painted colors thinly, one on top of another, from light to dark. He said, ""It's a secret - because I don't know what will happen."" He does not start with a color like yellow and plan what to put on top.

Aitchison thinks painting is easy. He said, ""Anyone can do the colors - you can buy them. I just notice what colors are next to each other."" He does not make drawings before he paints because he thinks he might get bored. Instead, he changes his paintings many times before they are done. He likes to paint people who do not want to see their pictures while he is painting. He said, ""If they are worried and want to look, I can't paint.""

Since he moved to London, Aitchison has not felt part of the Scottish art scene. He does not want to follow any tradition; he just paints in his own way. Still, his work influences young British painters."
PET_38,"**Text: Rock Band**

Two years ago, our 14-year-old son, Ben, asked us for a drum set for his birthday. At first, we did not want to buy it because of the noise. Ben said, ""It is better than watching TV or playing computer games. It will keep me out of trouble."" In the end, we agreed. We said, ""Okay, but you must think about the family and the neighbors when you play.""

This was just the start. Drums are big and hard to move, so Ben's friends came to our house with their guitars and other music equipment. Now, for many hours each week, our house is loud with their music and singing. 

When the band practices, my husband and I go for a long walk. I must say, even if their music is a little strange, they are a nice and polite group of young men. I cannot say if they are good musicians, but they play at local clubs for young people.

Our main worry is that they will not do enough school work because of music, but this has not happened yet. I always tell Ben that his studies are very important. But one thing is clear: Ben was right. Playing music has kept him out of trouble, and he is never bored."

Last week, I visited Atlantic College. It is a good private college in Wales. The college helps young people learn about life outside the classroom and study for their exams. 

The students are between 16 and 18 years old and come from many countries. In the morning, they study. In the afternoon, they do useful activities. They might help on a farm, care for people with learning difficulties, or check rivers for pollution. 

Atlantic College has students from different backgrounds and countries. Many students cannot pay the fees of £20,000 for two years, so there are grants to help them. About a quarter of the students are British, and many get help from the government.

Barbara Molenkamp, a student from the Netherlands, said, ""I admire the college for helping young people understand each other. You learn to live with people and respect them, even if you don’t like them. My mother said I argued less with my sister during the summer.""

In summary, Atlantic College gives its students a great education with methods that work well."

I am 32 years old. I just finished my first year at university. I go to classes and learn to read books quickly. I also write long essays. I decided to go to university after being away from school for fourteen years. 

Before, I worked as a secretary. I earned good money, but I was bored. I did not have to think much at my job. I felt sad because I thought I was stuck in that job. I saw students at the local university. They looked happy and full of hope. I wanted to feel that way too.

Now that I am a student, I find it hard to make friends with younger students. They often think I am a teacher and ask me questions I cannot answer. I also feel different from the teachers. Even though we are the same age, I know less than they do. 

I am happy to study because I know I need a good qualification to get a good job. This is very important to me. Unlike most eighteen-year-olds, I prefer to spend my weekends reading books instead of going to parties. 

I also enjoy the benefits of being a student, like long holidays and discounts for the theatre and cinema. Sometimes I worry about what I will do after university, but I hope that going back to school now is a good choice."

Henry Ford was born on a farm in Michigan in 1863. He did not like farming. When he was fifteen years old, he started working as a mechanic. In 1893, he made his first car. After driving it 1,500 kilometers, he sold it and made two bigger cars. In 1903, he started the Ford Motor Company. He used strong and light steel to make cars that were cheap for regular people. In 1908, he made the first Ford Model 'T', which cost $825. Soon, he was selling 100 cars every day. By 1927, the Ford Motor Company was worth $700 million. Early Ford cars were simple and cheap, but this sometimes meant there were fewer choices. Henry Ford said about the Model T, ""You can have any color you like, as long as it's black."""

KET_46,"**Corryvale Farm**

Corryvale Farm is in the west of England. Stephen and Jenny Blackler have cows and chickens. They sell milk and eggs. Most of their money comes from Jenny's sheep. She has 50 sheep. Each sheep has enough wool for six sweaters. Every six months, Stephen cuts the wool off the sheep so they do not get too warm.

Five years ago, Jenny made sweaters with the wool. She tried to sell them at country markets, but it was summer and hot. People did not want to buy sweaters. So, she made socks instead. Everyone loved the socks because they were cheap, strong, and easy to wash. This is how Jenny's business started.

At first, Jenny made the socks at home. Soon, she had many customers. She had to send the wool to a factory. Now, all the socks are made by machines. There are six colors, five sizes for all ages, and different socks for walkers, sportsmen, and skiers. 

Jenny is very busy at Christmas because Corryvale socks are a popular gift. In Jenny's office, there are many letters from happy customers from all over the world."

KET_10,"**Text: 'BURGLARS LIKE THE AFTERNOON'**

Most house burglaries happen between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m., say the police. Inspector Ian Saunders told us that house burglaries have gone up by more than 30% compared to last year. He said that 67% of burglaries happen when people go out and forget to close a door or a window. 

He also said that night-time burglaries are not common because families are usually at home then. But winter afternoons are good for burglars because it is dark and they cannot be seen easily. Many houses are empty at that time because people are still at work.

Inspector Saunders said it is a good idea to leave lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when you go on holiday. This can help keep burglars away. He also asked neighbors to watch other houses when people are not home. They should call the police if they see anything strange. 

""We will also tell you how to make your house safe,"" Inspector Saunders said. ""This help costs nothing."""

Before farming, people looked for plants and fruit in the forest to eat. They moved a lot to find food. About 12,000 years ago, in the Middle East, people started to grow food. These people were the first farmers. Farming helped people stay in one place, and their villages became bigger. Some people in the villages could do other jobs, like making clothes, because farmers grew food for everyone. But farming was hard when the weather was bad, and some people did not have enough food. Today, farmers can grow more food, and it travels a long way to our homes.'"

Bollywood is the name of the film industry in Mumbai, India. It makes almost 1,000 films every year. Since its first film in 1913, Bollywood has made over 29,000 films. This is more than the USA, so it is the biggest film industry in the world. Most Indians like to watch films more than anything else in their free time, and ten million people go to the cinema every day. 

Bollywood films often tell love stories, and singing and dancing are important in every film. People outside India also enjoy Indian films. Last year, Bollywood made over $500 million by selling its films to other countries. Indian actors make more films each year than American actors in Hollywood, but they earn less money. This is why most Bollywood films cost about $2 million to make. A Hollywood film usually costs more than $5 million to make.

Most Bollywood actors are young. They work hard but only for a few years. Amitabh Bachchan is one of India's greatest actors. He has been the star of more than 140 films in his almost 40-year acting career."

KET_4,"**THE HISTORY OF THE LONDON POLICE**

A long time ago, in 1700, there were no policemen in London. Only a few old men walked the streets at night to help keep people safe. They did not get paid much money. 

As London grew bigger, it became very dirty, and many people were poor. There were many thieves who stole money, so people stayed at home to be safe. 

In 1750, a man named Henry Fielding paid some people to stop the thieves. They were like policemen and were called 'Bow Street Runners' because they worked near Bow Street. 

Fifty years later, there were 120 Bow Street Runners, but London was still very big and needed more policemen. So, in 1829, the first London Police Force started with 3,000 officers. Most of the men walked, but some rode horses. 

Until 1920, all the police in London were men. Today, London police get paid well, and the few police officers who ride horses get paid even more."

Bob Marvisch has come here for twenty-five years. He says, ""You need light but warm clothes: two pairs of socks, gloves, several thin sweaters, and a snow suit on top. Catching fish is easy."" 

First, you break the ice and make a small hole. Next, you take a fishing line and put some bread on it. Then you put the line through the hole and into the water. You pull the line up when the fish eat the bread. The fish are between ten and twenty centimeters long. Some people like to eat them, but when I catch three or four fish, I prefer chocolate or another snack! Today I caught twenty-five! It is a great sport, and you can meet nice people here!"

Only half of the people who try to climb Kilimanjaro reach the top. This is often because the weather can change quickly. At the start, it can be hot and rainy, but at the top, there is ice and snow, and it can be very cold, below 20 degrees. Climbers need to bring sunglasses and warm clothes!"

I will visit your country next month. I will travel with two friends. We do not know where to stay. Are there any cheap hotels in your town? We want to stay in the center. Can you help us? 

Carlos 

Dear Carlos, 

Hotels in the center are expensive, but I have good news. I talked to my aunt Gloria. She says you can stay at her house. It has more bedrooms than my house! Is that okay for you? 

David'"
KET_59,"**Text: Buildings**

People have always made buildings. We need houses to keep us warm and dry. We build stadiums to watch football games and concerts. We have other buildings, like museums, to keep beautiful things.

Many people work together on a building. The architect decides how the building will look and draws pictures of their ideas. Engineers make sure the building is strong and safe. Then, workers build it carefully.

The Sydney Opera House is a famous building with a beautiful roof. It looks nice from every side, not just the top. The Olympic Stadium in Munich is also famous. It looks like a tent made of glass."
KET_54,"Text: ""Indre, I have a problem and I need your help. Can you go shopping with me tomorrow? My grandmother is turning 80 next month and she is having a party on Saturday. I don't have anything to wear. I have grown a lot, and all my trousers are too short! I want to buy new trousers and maybe some boots. I don't have a lot of money, but I think it will be enough. Do you want to meet me in the morning or afternoon? Let me know. Sarika"""
KET_32,"Text: 'The Cerne Giant

Sherborne and Dorchester are two towns in the south of England. They are close to each other. Between these towns, there are many green hills and fields. On one hill, there is a picture of a very large man. This man is called the Cerne Giant because the village next to him is called Cerne. 

Nobody knows when the Cerne Giant was made, but people think it was a long time ago. You can walk from Cerne to see the picture. If you go on the first of May when the sun comes up, you will see many people from the village dancing around the man on the hill.'"
KET_61,"**Text: Gail Rollins**

Gail Rollins is a great runner from Edinburgh. This summer, she wants to run in the 10,000 metres and maybe the 5,000 metres at the European Championships. In the past, Gail often came second in big races. She always smiled, and people in her city love her for this.

In 2004, everything changed when she ran her first half-marathon, which is a long race. She won and had the fastest time of the year for any British woman runner. 

Gail's husband, Mike Rollins, was also a runner when he was younger. He had to stop racing because he hurt his right leg. He can still run a little and sometimes trains with Gail. But it is not fun for Mike when Gail runs faster than him.

Gail trains hard. She runs long in the morning and fast in the afternoon. She always rests from running on Sundays. Mike says, ""I am with her all the time. Sometimes I ask, 'Are you sure you should eat that?' It is usually cakes, but she can eat almost everything."""
KET_52,"**Text: Piano Players - When They Were Young**

**Ivan Petrov**  
Ivan was born on a farm in Russia. From age twelve to eighteen, he studied in Poland. His first music teacher could not play the piano but taught him and his sister songs from the opera. His mother started to teach him the piano when he was six. When he was ten, he wanted to write music and began his first song.

**Oleg Gagarin**  
Oleg was the youngest of five children. When he was four, his father, who liked to play the piano, taught him some Russian music. At six, he started lessons with a piano teacher in his city. Oleg soon won prizes for his piano playing. At fourteen, he went to a music college in Austria for two years. Then, he returned to Russia.

**Josef Heptmann**  
Josef's father was German and taught music in Poland, where Josef was born. The family moved to Germany when Josef was two. A year later, he started to play the piano. He gave his first concert when he was six. At ten, he gave fifty-two concerts in two months during a trip to England! Josef liked music, but he was also interested in physics and languages. He is busy now, but one day he wants to write his own music."
KET_28,"**Text: Bill Prince-Smith**

Bill Prince-Smith was a farmer, a teacher, and a dentist. He became a writer of children's books when he was 60 years old. Now, thirteen years later, he has written more than 80 books. Every day, he goes to his office to write. In the evening, he gives his work to his wife to read. ""She tells me when she does not like something,"" says Bill. 

Bill has ten grandchildren. They do not live near him, but they read his stories and tell him if they are good or bad. This helps Bill know what young children want to read. 

Bill writes about life in his village and on the farms nearby. His favorite book is his fifth book, called *The Sheepdog*. It is about a farmer and the dog that helps him. ""I have always liked animals,"" says Bill. ""Dogs are very clever; they learn quickly."" 

Last year, they made a film of the book with real animals and actors. The film-makers used new technology to make it look like the animals are speaking. Bill was very happy with the film. ""Sometimes film-makers change books, but they did not change mine, and I love the film."""
KET_35,"**POSTCARDS**

Today, people like to send postcards to friends and family. Postcards often have pictures of beaches, mountains, or castles. You can write a message on the back. Many people send postcards when they are on holiday because they are cheap. The pictures on postcards are often better than their own photos.

The first postcard was sent at the end of the 1800s. It had a picture of a town by the sea. Later, postcards showed news events, like accidents or visits from important people. People liked these postcards because newspapers did not have pictures then."
KET_5,"**Text: Dinosaurs**

No one has ever seen a dinosaur. The last dinosaur died about 60 million years ago. This was a long time before people were on Earth. Nobody knows why they all died. The closest living relatives of dinosaurs are birds. 

Dinosaurs did not all look the same. There were more than 5000 kinds of dinosaurs. Some were very small, but others were very big. The biggest dinosaurs were larger than any other animals that lived on land. 

For example, the Brontosaurus was twenty meters long, and it ate plants. The Tyrannosaurus Rex was not as big, but it was very strong. It had sharp teeth for eating meat. It could also run fast because it had long back legs."
KET_41,"**Bears**

Bears can be dangerous animals. An adult bear is very strong and can hurt a person. Bears are good at climbing trees and can run fast. But they cannot see well. They find food by using their noses.

There are seven types of bears. The biggest is the white polar bear, which is almost three meters tall. There are two types of black bears: one lives in North America, and the other lives in South-East Asia. Not all black bears are black; they can be dark brown or reddish brown.

Many people love the black and white panda bear from China. Not many pandas live in the forest today because it is hard for them to find food."
KET_38,"**CROCODILES**

Crocodiles live in warm places in the world, like Africa, South America, and Northern Australia. They like to stay in slow water, but they can move quickly in water and on land. You can often see many crocodiles together. They eat fish, birds, and small animals. Sometimes, they can eat big animals or even people. There are more than ten kinds of crocodiles. They have very sharp teeth. They can lose their teeth, but they grow new ones. Crocodiles are usually about 3.5 meters long, but some are bigger. They can live a long time. The oldest crocodile in a zoo was 66 years old."
KET_17,"**A HISTORY OF AIR TRAVEL**

In 1783, two French brothers made the first balloon to take people into the sky. One hundred and twenty years later, in 1903, the Wright brothers made the first plane with an engine. They flew it in the United States. In 1918, the US Post Office started the first airmail service. 

Aeroplanes changed a lot in the next thirty years. In the 1950s, aeroplanes became much faster because they had jet engines. In 1976, Concorde was made in the UK and France. It is the fastest passenger plane in the world. It can fly at 2500 kilometres an hour, so the trip from London to New York takes only four hours. 

Today, many people travel by aeroplane, and it is hard to imagine a world without them."
KET_47,"**The Globe Theatre**

Visiting the theatre in London 400 years ago was very different from today. The building was round and had no roof. People got cold and wet if it rained. The queen liked to go to the Globe Theatre by the River Thames to see plays by William Shakespeare. All the actors were men. Visitors ate food, talked to friends, walked around during the show, and some even threw things at the actors! 

Today, you can still visit the Globe Theatre. A new theatre is in the same place by the river. You can watch a Shakespeare play or learn about life in the 1600s."
KET_48,"Text: 'Dear Jeff, I am having a good holiday in Australia. We arrived two weeks ago. The weather was bad and cold. Now the weather is better. We go to the beach every day. This week we are in Sydney. Next week we will go to the Great Barrier Reef. The water is warm, and I love swimming there. The fish are different colors: red, yellow, and purple! Australia is very beautiful. We do not want to go home! See you at the end of September. Sue'"
