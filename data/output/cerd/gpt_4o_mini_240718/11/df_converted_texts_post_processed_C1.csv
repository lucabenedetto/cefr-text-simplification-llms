CPE_15,C2,"'Garbage in, garbage out'**
Charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems like a good idea for the environment and the economy. However, it may not be. One common practice in many developed countries is municipal refuse collection: at regular times, rubbish bags or bins are taken away by a special truck to a local dump. Economists find this practice strange because, in most places, it is free. Households pay for this service through local taxes, but a family that produces a lot of rubbish pays the same as an elderly couple that produces very little. However, the cost of rubbish disposal is not zero. The more rubbish people throw away, the more rubbish collectors and trucks are needed, and the more local authorities have to pay for landfill and dumping fees. This creates a basic economic problem: if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. 
A possible solution is to make households pay for the disposal of their waste. This would encourage them to throw away less and recycle more, assuming local governments provide places to collect recyclable materials. However, as economists Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman discovered, what seems like a logical solution can lead to complicated and sometimes disappointing results. Their research looked at several American towns and cities that have started charging households for rubbish. The most common system is to sell stickers or tags that residents attach to their rubbish bags or cans. Only bags with these labels are picked up during the weekly collection.
In a paper published last year, Fullerton and Kinnaman studied a scheme introduced in July 1992 in Charlottesville, Virginia, a town of about 40,000 people. Residents were charged 80 cents for each tagged bag of rubbish. This may seem like a good use of market forces. However, the authors found that the benefits of the scheme did not cover the costs of printing materials, paying sellers, and the wages of the people running the program. While the number of bags or cans collected fell sharply by 37%, this was mainly due to a behavior called the 'Seattle stomp,' where people crammed more garbage into each container, sometimes jumping on it to fit more in. This method is less effective than using machines at landfill sites. The weight of rubbish collected, which is a better measure of disposal costs than volume, fell by only 14% in Charlottesville. In 25 other Virginian cities without a pricing scheme, the weight of rubbish also fell by 3.5%.
Worse still, some people chose to dump their rubbish illegally instead of paying for collection. Although this is hard to measure, the authors estimate that illegal dumping may account for 30-40% of the reduction in collected rubbish. A positive outcome from this experience was a 15% increase in the weight of materials recycled, suggesting that people preferred to recycle (which is free) rather than pay for rubbish removal. However, this increase in recycling may not be directly related to the fee, as many residents were already part of Charlottesville's voluntary recycling program.
In a more recent study, Fullerton and Kinnaman looked at the economics of rubbish in more detail. One conclusion from this broader study is that pricing does reduce the weight of rubbish, but not significantly. On average, a 10% increase in sticker prices only reduces rubbish quantity by 0.3%. This figure is lower than in other studies covering fewer towns. To significantly reduce rubbish output, people would need to buy less of almost everything. A small tax on garbage is unlikely to make a big difference. If this is true, it is important to consider whether other factors, such as income and education, are just as important as price. For example, in wealthier towns, people tend to throw out more rubbish and have less time for recycling.
Should we conclude that charging households for rubbish is a bad idea? Not necessarily; free disposal is likely too cheap. However, the effects of seemingly simple policies can be complex. Detailed economic models are often needed to understand them, and sometimes the results are not pleasant."
CPE_19,C2,"
Theodore Zeldin explores how our work life might change. Do you feel respected and valued in your job? Success in a career is not enough anymore. Many professions feel they are not appreciated or understood, and even famous individuals often feel unhappy despite their success. Loving your job used to be enough to be part of a lucky few, but now you must consider how your job affects you as a person, your mind, character, and relationships. This question is very important. No matter how skilled you are, if your work makes you boring or unable to connect with others outside your field, then no amount of status or money can make up for that. 
I am trying to find ways for work to focus on personal fulfillment instead of just serving industrial needs. Work should not only create wealth but also provide a meaningful way of living, helping us discover new talents and connect with more people. However, this change will not eliminate unemployment. As more people get educated, they want jobs that are interesting and meaningful. A lifetime of work should be seen as a work of art, with the fulfilled individual at its center. 
Even middle-class jobs, like those of doctors and accountants, are not as appealing as they used to be. Doctors often feel more stressed than their patients, and accountants worry about their profession's ethics. Many architects do not get to use their creativity, and administrators are stuck in their own bureaucracy. Middle managers, who once felt proud of their status, are losing their confidence. Meanwhile, companies and public institutions are getting smaller. Efforts to improve decision-making and rewards have not succeeded in gaining employee commitment. In Britain, only 8% of employees feel their values match those of their organizations.
I have started to investigate different jobs to see how they shape or harm people. I have looked at what humans can achieve in various cultures and how courage can be developed. I have focused on important issues like happiness, love, friendship, and respect. Now, I am looking for better ways to earn a living. Many experts work to increase the profits of companies, but we also need to examine ourselves as human beings and think about the kind of people we want to be around.
How many of us feel truly alive at work? How many of us are like part-time slaves, feeling we have the option to leave our boring jobs but are really trapped by our qualifications and careers? For example, hotel workers make up 10% of the workforce. Many intelligent and lively people endure low pay and long hours because the idea of a hotel has not changed much since the days of the Ritz. A hotel is not just a place for travelers to sleep; it is a small version of the United Nations. People from all over the world meet in hotels, but they often do not interact. Many hotel staff are foreigners eager to learn a new language and culture, yet they have only superficial relationships with guests.
Hotels could be cultural centers, connecting guests with the city and each other. Hotel owners could use the knowledge of their many student employees instead of assigning them only simple tasks. If they paid attention to their staff's true ambitions, they would see many other services hotels could offer. However, they are often limited by accountants who say companies should focus on one main activity to maximize profits. 
It is time to rethink what this means from a human perspective, not just a financial one. For me, work is about relationships. Many people today want more than just obedience at work; they want to express their independence and personality. They should be allowed to design their own jobs and choose their colleagues and customers, within practical limits. This requires the ability to communicate across different professional languages and connect with people who may seem very different at first.
Everyone understands the importance of communication, but true conversation is different. Traditional conversation is not the same as the new kind of conversation that people feel is missing today. This new conversation is more personal and creates a bond of respect between people, allowing for a deeper understanding of each other. It is more than just relaxation; it is a powerful way to establish equality. Every meaningful conversation changes the world, even if just a little."
CPE_24,C2,"'BROADCASTING: The Social Shaping of a Technology'**
The term 'broadcasting' originally referred to the act of spreading seeds widely by hand. This idea is not just about farming; it also represents a hopeful view of modern progress. It suggests planned growth that can lead to a fruitful outcome if conditions are favorable. The metaphor implies that there are central resources available for spreading and reproducing this growth.
We need to explore why a new technology that sends words and images electronically was organized in a way that fits this farming metaphor. Although television is linked to two-way communication methods like the telegraph and telephone, it was designed from the beginning as a centralized 'mass' medium. This means that it transmitted content from a central source to private homes, which matched the social and economic structures of modern societies.
There were attempts to create different forms of television, but these remained just experiments. Two lesser-known alternatives are worth mentioning because they show what television could have been in a different social setting. In the early 1930s, radio enthusiasts in Britain experimented with two-way television as a possible replacement for regular telephones. Popular science magazines like Radio News published articles on how to build television transmitters and receivers, and many amateur experimenters were active across the country. However, in 1938, the British Radio Manufacturers Association established standards for television equipment and channel regulations, which pushed these grassroots innovators out of the picture. This marked the end of a potential counter-cultural development of television as a widely accessible and egalitarian form of communication.
Broadcasting was closely linked to strong economic interests and the fundamental structures of modern societies. Despite the efforts of TV amateurs, television was mainly a medium for public entertainment in the USA during the early 1930s and was seen as a competitor to the film industry. In fact, throughout the 1930s, most people experienced television in public settings, especially in Britain and Germany.
The idea of grassroots or amateur two-way television was unlikely to succeed, while systems based on collective public viewing were operating in several countries during the 1930s. These systems could have posed a greater challenge to the domestic use of television, but this threat did not materialize. Manufacturers recognized the potential for mass sales of home television sets once prices dropped. Given the division between public and private life in modern society, centralized broadcasting to a wide domestic audience was the most effective way to organize the medium.
As working-class people improved their living standards and joined consumer society from the 1920s onward, the dream of the home as a center for entertainment and cultural experiences became a reality for many in Western countries. This trend is now happening globally. There is a clear link between social modernization and the structures of broadcasting. While social and economic changes led to more centralization of power and capital, the breakdown of traditional communities created new lifestyles. People became more mobile, both socially and geographically, which often left them feeling isolated compared to those in more stable early communities.
Centralized broadcasting addressed the need for governments to efficiently inform all citizens and helped create a unifying 'imagined community' of the nation-state. The widespread nature of these processes made broadcasting the dominant form for both radio and television. However, it is important to also consider the positive view of broadcasting as a tool for democracy. During the period between the World Wars, many countries recognized broadcasting as a way to ensure equal access to resources necessary for informed participation in political, social, and cultural life.
Television is evolving, and there is a risk that the term broadcasting may become outdated or insufficient. If this happens, the metaphor will only refer to a specific organization of audio-visual technology during a certain centralized phase of social modernization."
CPE_13,C2,"Clutter**
Sometimes, it feels like no matter how many things you own, you never feel secure. It is normal to want a comfortable home that meets your needs, but there comes a point when the desire to acquire more possessions becomes excessive. Modern advertising is designed to exploit our insecurities. A common message we receive is that if you don’t have certain items, you are somehow less valuable. To see how much advertising influences you, try not to read any billboards the next time you walk down the street. These expensive messages constantly shape our thoughts in persuasive ways, often without us realizing it. We are surrounded by them—on television, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, t-shirts, and the internet—all encouraging us to buy more.
**Caves**
Research institutions and universities around the world have spent years studying caves, focusing mainly on their origins, water systems, and living organisms. Caves are a small but intriguing part of the natural world, sparking our curiosity and desire for knowledge. Because they are natural features, they have been studied for a long time, especially in areas where caves impact our lives. However, visiting many caves requires physical skill, which means that cave research often involves both professional scientists and amateur explorers who visit caves for fun.
**Weather Watch**
Many observant people, using only their senses, laid the groundwork for meteorology, which has evolved since the 17th century into a complex science. Today, satellites and electronic devices provide us with quick weather information, and computers can solve complicated calculations much faster than humans. Meteorological terms can be difficult for non-professionals to understand. However, human experience remains essential in turning data into weather forecasts. Personal observations can still offer valuable insights that help professionals understand the mysteries of the atmosphere."
CPE_16,C2,"**MUSIC AND THEATRE**
Until recently, I believed that opera was mainly theatre. However, after working at a national opera house, I realized that opera is primarily about music, with theatre being secondary. This makes sense, but I come from a theatrical background, where the words and the actors are the most important. In theatre, there is no one directing the action once it starts, and performers and audiences usually share a common language.
At any musical performance, whether in a concert hall or an opera house, there are often many people, like me, who do not have a deep understanding of music. Some may feel embarrassed about their lack of knowledge, while most are simply amazed by the performers' skills. A talented singer or a great string section is easy to admire. Even a decent musician shows the results of years of hard work. Watching top-class music is similar to watching athletes; we know they are doing something we can relate to, but we also see how much better they are than us.
In contrast, theatre audiences have different expectations. They often do not fully appreciate an actor's skill and may not be impressed by a long, difficult speech, even though actors frequently get asked how they memorize their lines. This does not mean that theatre audiences are less demanding than concert-goers; in fact, many are the same people. However, audiences and performers seem to connect more equally in theatre, regardless of how challenging the material is.
The question is whether music can learn from theatre about this relationship. I believe it can, as I have seen how a different approach can enhance the experience for concert-goers. Live music is inherently theatrical, filled with emotion, humor, and intimacy. It can also be unpredictable, engaging the audience's imagination both individually and collectively. 
The traditional ways of presenting music, such as strict dress codes and excessive respect for conductors and soloists, create a clear divide between performers and listeners, which can feel uncomfortable. On the other hand, contemporary music audiences sometimes interrupt performances with applause between movements or after impressive pieces. While this shows appreciation, it can disrupt the overall flow of the work.
Is there a solution? Yes, a lot is being done to attract new audiences to concert halls and opera houses and to break down barriers that make people feel that ""serious"" music is not for them. I remember a remarkable event, the community opera *In Search of Angels*, which took place in various locations within a cathedral and the surrounding town. It was a powerful musical experience where the skills and generosity of the musicians were central, and it changed many audience members' lives, as they were not just there to watch and listen but also to participate.
What I wish for in music is a bit more of the risk and creativity that the best theatre can show. This can come from using unusual or challenging locations that disrupt normal expectations, creating surprising effects for both performers and audiences. While some plays are presented in a conventional way, similar to concerts, I believe that music experiences can and should change.
I can only speak as an enthusiast: I love theatre and spend as much time and money as I can enjoying music. I want both to thrive and for more people to experience the joy I find in being part of the audience."
CPE_21,C2,"**Text:**
**Sand**  
While I appreciate sand's amazing ability to be turned into useful items like glass and concrete, I am not a big fan of it in its natural form. To me, it is mainly an annoying barrier between a seaside parking lot and the water. It blows into your face, gets into your food, and can swallow important items like car keys and coins. When you are wet, it sticks to you like glue and is hard to remove, even with a strong hose. However, the strange thing is that as soon as you step onto a beach towel, get into a car, or walk on a recently cleaned carpet, it falls off you easily. For days after, you find small amounts of it on the floor every time you take off your shoes, and you spread even more when you take off your socks. Sand stays with you longer than many illnesses. So, as far as I’m concerned, you can keep the sand.
**Lock and Key**  
The search for a safe home, privacy, and security has existed since humans first built permanent homes. The simple wooden beam behind the door has changed to an electronic lock that uses a plastic card with many combinations. However, the desire to keep out intruders remains. The appeal of a lock and key is partly psychological. Recently, some companies have tried computerized locking systems, where smart cards control electronic locks. But people do not like them. You might accept them at work, but at home, everyone wants the comfort of using a physical key. Therefore, when one locksmith company created a new electronic system, they made sure to include a real metal key.
**Modern Art**  
I was nervous about visiting the new Tate Modern gallery because, like many people, I find modern art confusing. I know I like some of it, especially furry items, neon light sculptures, and large photographs. Maybe if I knew more about it, I would have stronger opinions. However, you are not supposed to approach it like a school essay. The goal is not to fully understand art, but to let it speak to you. This is a great idea, but it has never worked for me. However, this new gallery has tried to give visitors real insight into the reasons behind the artworks. The first thing I noticed was the labels, which provided context and explained what the art was trying to convey. Instead of staring blankly at the pieces as I used to, these helpful pieces of information allowed me to understand better."
CPE_46,C2,"**Every Picture Tells a Story**
**Adapting Novels for Film**
Turning novels into films often means reducing, condensing, and removing parts of the story. This can be frustrating for writers, but it can also be enlightening. While working on a script, I realized that I could cut much of the dialogue and description from a scene in the novel and still convey the same message. This does not mean that the original dialogue and descriptions were unnecessary. It relates to how each medium engages the audience and the type of repetition each uses. 
In this context, ""redundancy"" refers to the repeated mention of character traits and speech tags like ""he said."" A character's trait only needs to be described once, but reminding the audience helps with understanding. Usually, we can tell who is speaking in a dialogue scene from the content and layout, but speech tags make it easier to read. 
Stage drama, which mainly consists of dialogue, mimics real speech with varying levels of style. In some modern plays, this can go to an extreme, making the dialogue seem almost entirely repetitive, serving only to connect the speakers without clearly communicating anything.
**Watching Movies**
When watching movies, people can feel as if they are part of the film's world. This experience allows them to escape from reality, at least for the duration of the movie. However, once the lights come on, this illusion is quickly broken, and they return to the real world. People often do not feel responsible for the time spent in the film's world, and this unreality can prevent them from taking the film seriously. 
In the past, many people, including our parents and teachers, did not see movies as art but rather as ""mere entertainment."" They enjoyed being entertained but did not value films as an art form.
**The Film Studios**
The Leiper Film Company studios were a collection of many different buildings. The layout was confusing and unclear. There were a few permanent landmarks, like the Script Department, but most of the place consisted of small, similarly furnished rooms used for meetings. These rooms could only be identified by a strange system of letters and numbers, making it difficult to find any specific one.
The studio lacked a clear focus. There were three main entrances, all equally basic, with no clear way to ask for directions. For a stranger, it was very confusing. However, there were not many strangers around, as the organization did not encourage outsiders. It was assumed that employees could navigate the studio without help. Through their combined efforts, romance and adventure would reach audiences everywhere. Couples like Jane and George, or Sally and Dick, could escape their everyday lives for at least three hours, thanks to the studio's work.
**Film-Makers**
It seems that almost everyone wants to make a movie. Bookstores are filled with ""how-to"" books on scriptwriting and film production. Many universities offer courses, and there are competitions that provide equipment like the handheld camera used by Robert Rodriguez to make his film *El Mariachi*, which cost $7,000 and launched him into the spotlight of American independent directors. Rodriguez's dreams came true ahead of schedule. 
He recalls his 23rd birthday in his book about his *Mariachi* experiences, writing: ""Orson Welles made *Citizen Kane* when he was 25. Spielberg made *Jaws* at 26. So I've only got two or three years to make my breakthrough film."" 
This was not always the case. In the past, when studios were in control, filmmakers were expected to take their time to develop their skills. They often worked behind the scenes as editors, writers, or cinematographers, learning the craft by directing low-budget Westerns or short films. John Huston was 35 when he made his first film, *The Maltese Falcon*, and Fred Zinnemann, who directed *High Noon*, found his stride in his forties. Nowadays, without the support of studios or television, aspiring filmmakers often have to go their own way."
CPE_3,C2,"In the past, the council houses were spread across the western side of the city, with many rows of small, worn-down homes made of orange brick or pale white stucco. In the summer, the chemicals from the May and Baker factory, located two miles away, created a strong smell of sulphur that lingered around the doors and gardens. One common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he walked along someone’s front path. I have forgotten much of my early life, but I remember sitting near an upstairs window, looking at the houses as they faded into the distance. 
Later, I have memories of other people—faces I cannot name, my mother ironing towels in a house that I don’t think was ours, and snow falling on the turrets of a large mansion at Earlham. It is not surprising that my mother appears in these early memories. I remember her as a small, precise, and often angry woman, and I never fully understood the reason for her anger, so I could not do anything to make it better. Even as a child, when I went with her to the small shops in Bunnett Square or on longer trips into the city, I sensed something unusual about her personality. She was the most solitary person I have ever known, feeling alone even in a crowded room. 
Her solitude was combined with a strict sense of propriety that was unusual for the West Earlham estate. This sometimes resulted in intense spring-cleaning sessions or strict instructions to ""behave properly."" I found this moral code hard to understand, and even now, I am not sure I fully grasp it. It meant not wandering into neighbors' gardens or damaging their rose bushes while walking down the street; it meant sitting quietly for long periods in a silent dining room, hands folded across my chest, listening to radio programs my mother enjoyed; it meant many rules and restrictions. 
Over time, other figures appeared in these serious early memories. Despite her solitude, my mother had friends. There was Mrs. Buddery, who was obsessed with the Royal Family; Mrs. Winall, who rarely spoke except to agree with others; and Mrs. Laband, who was more lively and not always approved of by the others. Later, I realized how poor their company was; they formed a gloomy group, often talking about bad legs, cold weather, and ungrateful children, a category I often felt I belonged to. Looking back, it felt like a heavy weight made up of the West Earlham houses, my mother, her friends, and the pressure to ""behave properly"" rested on my shoulders, and I felt it was my duty to grow up and free myself from it. 
Growing up in West Earlham followed a strict routine. Until you turned five, you stayed at home and got in your parents' way (I remember long, aimless days when I was about four, playing on a rug in the front room while my mother sat coldly in an armchair). Then, in September after your fifth birthday, you were sent to Avenue Road infants school, half a mile away. The lucky few had mothers with old bikes and child seats—these were unusual contraptions made of cast iron with makeshift safety straps. As far as I remember, my mother left me in the care of other children in the street for this journey. 
If I recall anything from those early years, it is the summer holidays, when I caught glimpses of the world outside West Earlham: a vague old man next door to Mrs. Buddery who told stories about his time in the Merchant Navy; a charity fair held at a house far away on Christchurch Road, where a kind woman offered lemonade and tried to interest me in something called the League of Pity—a kind of junior charity, I think—but my mother dismissed it, saying the organizers were ""only after your money."" My mother often spoke about mercenary motives, and she held politicians in deep contempt. If she thought of the House of Commons, it was as a place where wealthy people opened letters filled with five-pound notes sent by gullible citizens. I may exaggerate and overlook her good qualities while focusing on her flaws, but there was little kindness in my mother; it seemed to have been drained from her. 
To be fair, my mother was aware of her role in my education. Occasionally on Sundays, she would take me—in my ""good clothes""—on the 85 bus to the Norwich Castle Museum. Hand in hand, we would walk through rooms filled with paintings by the Norwich School of Artists. My mother was not completely against this activity and eventually developed some opinions about the art. I remember her stopping in front of a painting of a Roman soldier in full battle gear and saying, ""Well, I wouldn't want to meet him on a dark night!"" This was one of the few times I remember my mother trying to make a joke."
CPE_10,C2,"Philadelphia Avenue**
I walked down the odd-numbered side of Philadelphia Avenue. The evening was getting darker, and the air was humid with a light drizzle that made my walk feel secretive. I knew this side of the street well; I remembered our neighbors, the Matzes and the Pritchards, Han Kieffer's grocery store, and the houses of my first playmates, all girls. Although I didn’t know everyone by name, each house was as familiar to me as the small troughs in the sidewalk that carried rainwater from the roofs to the street, which I often skated or scooted over. 
As the street sloped down, I noticed a slight decline in the social status of the houses: the porches were lower, and the front yards were smaller. Over the years, things changed: wooden porch railings were replaced with wrought iron in a style that reminded me of the South or Spain. In Shillington, houses I remembered as homes had turned into stores, and strangely, some stores, like Pep Conrad's and Han Kieffer's, had become homes again. I wondered how the residents used those open spaces and how they lived with the lingering smells of the goods.
**Bachelor Fads Furniture Designer Rick Gilbert**
Rick Gilbert's apartment used to be a curtain warehouse. It has the typical features of a loft, like exposed brick and large doors that once allowed curtains to be moved from trains on the nearby railway. However, Gilbert did not want a completely open space for both practical and aesthetic reasons. ""In my last place, my living and working areas were mixed. It was hard to relax or start working when everything was in view,"" he said. 
To create a more defined space, he used a large piece of corrugated plastic near the entrance. ""It hides the office, creates a hallway, and leads to the kitchen in the middle of the apartment. I wanted the kitchen to be a neutral space where I could cook for friends or make coffee for clients."" To balance the modern look of his plastic screen and stainless steel kitchen, Gilbert chose light wood for the floors. His apartment is filled with futuristic chairs and sofas, but it also has sentimental furniture from his parents or items he bought at markets.
**Bruce Chatwin**
Bruce Chatwin's life was a mix of adventure and mystery, making him a fascinating writer. His first book, *In Patagonia*, published in 1977, changed travel writing. It reads like a thrilling story, with the charm of romantic fiction and deep insights. However, even in this book, Chatwin mixed facts with fiction; he often changed details to make his stories more interesting or to highlight the deeper meanings of travel. He suggested that through travel, one could uncover histories that seemed to exist just to inspire future explorers.
**Swimming**
During a warm summer rain, I quickly crossed the lawn behind my house and jumped into the pool. As I swam breaststroke, my eyes were just above the water. Each raindrop created a small splash that turned into bubbles. The best moments were when the rain got heavier, drowning out the birdsong, and steam rose from the water as if the pool was reaching up to the sky. 
In the summer of 1996, during one of these heavy rains, I began to think about swimming across Britain. I wanted to follow the rain as it traveled across the land to the sea, escaping the frustration of swimming laps and feeling trapped like a tiger in a cage. Many of us live in a world where everything is labeled and explained, which makes reality feel more visual. This is why walking, cycling, and swimming are rebellious activities. They help us reconnect with the wild and old parts of our world by getting off the main paths and breaking free from the official stories. A swimming journey would allow me to explore the mysterious parts of our world, like dark woods or high mountains."
CPE_67,C2,"'CRYING** 
Charles Darwin believed that crying in humans did not have a clear purpose in evolution. However, he was likely mistaken. Recently, scientists have emphasized the social importance of crying. Psychiatrist John Bowlby pointed out that crying helps create a bond between a mother and her child. Many people think that tears, especially in children, mainly show feelings of helplessness. 
Understanding why adults cry is more complicated. It appears that the sound of crying is less important than the visual message it sends. Crying may have been beneficial for early human groups by helping to build trust and social connections. 
There are many reasons why we cry. We might cry to show sympathy for those facing great injustice. Additionally, we can cry unexpectedly, sometimes feeling embarrassed, when we hear touching music or powerful speeches. We often cry while watching emotional movies, and interestingly, this happens more often when we are with others than when we are alone. The social role of crying seems clear, but research is ongoing.'"
CPE_27,C2,"The Heat is On**
We have all heard about global warming, but how much warmer will the Earth become, and how will it affect our lives? Most people have some understanding of global warming, but few know its consequences. A warmer climate is likely to change the weather in all parts of the world. Since the atmosphere is closely connected to every aspect of our planet, any climate changes will significantly impact plants, animals, water, and soil.
Humans have learned to use natural resources to our advantage, allowing us to produce food, build cities, and support billions of people. Therefore, any changes to these resources must be taken seriously. The challenge we face is understanding how the world will change and what is causing these changes. Over the last century, human actions have significantly increased the levels of certain gases in the atmosphere, which are closely linked to global temperature. These increased levels are likely already affecting the global climate, but our limited knowledge of the global heat balance makes the current and future situations uncertain.
We know that greenhouse gas levels have fluctuated in line with global temperatures over the past 40,000 years, suggesting a strong relationship between the two. Evidence indicates that the Earth's surface has warmed by about 6°C over the last century. Most scientists believe this trend is not entirely natural and is partly due to human pollution. 
A lot of research has been done to predict the conditions resulting from higher global temperatures. Most of this research uses computer programs called general circulation models (GCMs). These models analyze the interaction of temperature, pressure, solar radiation, and other climatic factors to predict climate conditions for the past, present, or future. However, they are simplifications of reality and have many limitations. Their results are only approximate, and they can be slow and expensive to run. 
Despite these challenges, most people agree on one important aspect of climate change: the rate of change will be faster than anything we have experienced before. The predictions from GCMs provide some insight into the world we will live in over the next few generations. Currently, they suggest that the average global surface temperature could increase by 1°C to 3.5°C by the year 2100. They also predict that global sea levels will rise by 15 to 95 cm and that changes in rainfall patterns will occur. Scientists expect extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, floods, and droughts, to become more common in some areas. 
These forecasts highlight the potential impact of climate change on the natural environment and humans. Changes in climate could affect the locations of ecosystems, such as forests and grasslands, the variety of species they contain, and their ability to provide essential benefits to society. This includes food production, water resources, and human settlements. Some effects may be irreversible and likely unfavorable in many regions, but not all impacts will be negative. In fact, some climate change effects may be beneficial. 
For example, in Australia, research has shown that wheat yields have increased by about 0.5 tonnes per hectare since 1952, partly due to climate trends. Warmer temperatures have led to fewer frosts, which has reduced damage to crops. However, many predicted effects of future climate warming are concerning. Even small changes in climate can affect water availability, especially in dry regions or areas already facing shortages. 
The Mediterranean Basin is one example where decreasing rainfall has been observed, particularly in western-central parts. In southern Portugal, rainfall has become more concentrated in autumn and winter, reducing spring totals. Another serious effect of climate change is the impact on glaciers, which will affect ice, vegetation, wildlife habitats, and human structures. There is a strong possibility that Arctic ice will melt completely, making marine transport and oil exploration easier but increasing the risk of icebergs.
Perhaps the most dramatic effect of global warming will be the rise in sea levels. This will occur due to the thermal expansion of oceans and melting ice. With about half of the world's population living in coastal areas, rising sea levels could have severe consequences. Increased flooding and inundation are likely, affecting cities like London, New York, and Tokyo. Many people could lose their homes and livelihoods, leading to millions of environmental refugees. 
The most severe consequences may be faced by small, low-lying island nations, which could disappear entirely if worst-case scenarios occur. This would be devastating not only for the people and cultures of these islands but also for the countries that would need to accommodate those displaced."
CPE_66,C2,"'Mission to Mars Wanted: a middle-aged, married couple for a 501-day round trip to Mars. Applicants must be physically and emotionally strong. This will be the profile of the first Martian astronauts if multi-millionaire Dennis Tito's plans to launch a capsule on 5 January 2018 succeed. The capsule will take the crew to about 160 km above Mars. The spacecraft will use Mars' gravity to return to Earth without using extra fuel, as fuel efficiency is very important. The 2018 deadline is set because the next time Mars and Earth will be aligned for a launch is in 2031. It is a challenging task, but there is a race to develop new technologies. If these technologies are ready in time, the spacecraft might succeed. Even if it never leaves Earth, the efforts to reach these goals will still be valuable for future missions.'"
CPE_44,C2,"**AESTHETICS**
Ironically, the existence of artworks, which is essential for developing aesthetic theory, can actually hinder our understanding of them. This is because artworks are physical objects, like buildings, books, paintings, or statues, that exist outside of human experience. People often think of a work of art as just the object itself, rather than what it does in our experience. This focus on the object can make it harder to understand its true meaning.
Moreover, the perfection and long-standing admiration of some artworks create conventions that block new insights. Once an artwork is considered a classic, it becomes disconnected from the human experiences that led to its creation and the effects it has on our lives. When artistic objects are separated from their origins and their impact on experience, they become isolated, making it difficult to grasp their broader significance, which is what aesthetic theory aims to explore. Art is then seen as separate from other human efforts and achievements.
A key task for anyone writing about the philosophy of fine arts is to reconnect the refined experiences that artworks provide with the everyday events and struggles that everyone recognizes as part of life. Just as mountains are not separate from the earth but are part of it, those studying fine art must also show how artworks relate to ordinary experiences.
If we accept this idea, we may reach a surprising conclusion: to understand artistic products, we must temporarily set them aside and focus on the everyday forces and conditions that we usually do not see as aesthetic. We need to take a detour to reach a theory of art, which is about understanding and insight. For example, while we can enjoy flowers for their beauty and scent without knowing about plants, understanding how they grow requires knowledge of soil, air, water, and sunlight.
To truly grasp aesthetics in its most recognized forms, we must start with raw experiences—those events and scenes that capture our attention and bring us joy. However, many people are so influenced by the idea that art is something separate and special that they might be surprised to learn that they enjoy their everyday activities partly because of their aesthetic qualities. 
Today, the arts that resonate most with the average person are often not seen as traditional art forms. For instance, movies, jazz, comic strips, and even sensational news stories are enjoyed without being classified as art. When art is confined to museums and galleries, people seek enjoyment in their daily lives instead. Many who oppose the museum view of art still hold onto the mistaken belief that separates art from ordinary experiences. The times when art is closely linked to everyday activities are when appreciation for it is strongest."
CPE_22,C2,"Observing Lions**
In popular culture, lions hunting for food are often seen as a remarkable display of teamwork. As the sun sets, a group of stealthy lions emerges from the shadows and surrounds their unsuspecting prey. They appear to be perfect social animals, setting aside minor disagreements to work together for a common goal: their next meal. However, after many years of studying these animals in the wild, we have developed a different perspective. When we began our research in 1978, we wanted to understand why lions hunt together, raise cubs, and scare off rivals with their roars. If we measure an animal's success by how many offspring survive, then cooperation may not always be beneficial. If one animal is too generous, it may end up helping its companions at its own expense. So, why do lions seem to ignore the rules of self-interest? We thought we would solve this question in two to three years, but lions are very good at being inactive. We would add lions to the list of unreactive noble gases like krypton, argon, and neon. Therefore, we needed various research methods to find clues about their behavior. Since wild lions can live up to 18 years, we are only now beginning to understand the answers to our questions.
**Pop Music Review**
The release of Bedrock's third album was a significant moment for a talented band that had previously struggled. ""New Life"" started a movement that changed rock music in this country for the rest of the decade. Gone were the serious themes, dull clothing, and loud guitars of the past; instead, a lighter mix of melodic styles emerged. This album combined social commentary and strong emotions with sounds from fairground organs and brass bands. Humor and irony were prominent, and the singers proudly expressed their backgrounds. The album showed Bedrock as skilled collectors and observers, as well as versatile songwriters. They playfully addressed traditional English themes like sunbathing and Sunday afternoons. However, the album's true strength lay in its deeper, more melancholic tracks like ""So Low,"" a beautiful song loosely based on weather, and ""To the Brink,"" a serious ballad. The beauty of ""New Life"" is its consistently high quality—16 tracks with no filler, making it a standout record in an era of long CDs.
**Extract from an Autobiography**
As a child, I was always intrigued by stories of 'The Sibyl,' the wise women who had great influence in the ancient world. Initially, I only knew of one from a story my mother told me. An old woman from Cumae offered Tarquin, the King of Rome, nine books for 300 gold pieces. When he refused, she burned three of them and offered him six for the same price. After he refused again, she burned three more books. He eventually bought the last three for the full price. I realized there was a deep lesson in this story about salesmanship and life. As an only child, I often felt lonely. I would ask to play with other children, but they would refuse. My mother advised me to do something so interesting that the other kids would want to join me. It worked, and it’s a lesson I’ve never forgotten. When I had the chance to write a travel book, I needed to find a topic that mattered to me. I’m not a keen traveler; I even sent my editor a long list of places I didn’t want to visit. Ultimately, I’m only interested in ruins because I prefer to travel through time in my mind.
**What Happens to Your Manuscript?**
When you submit your manuscript, it will likely join a pile of other submissions waiting to be reviewed, known as the slush pile. The person sorting through these submissions is usually either a junior member of the editorial team (often under 18) or an experienced freelancer who works a few mornings a week. Neither has much power, but they are generally looking for something original. The junior member hopes to make a name for themselves, while the freelancer wants to justify their job. If they find your novel promising, they will pass it to a senior editor, and it may eventually be discussed in an acquisition meeting. The editor will need to justify accepting your novel based on its quality and potential sales, as well as whether you seem like a long-term author. They will also consider how marketable you are, which is important for promoting a new novel. For this reason, publishers often prefer to meet potential authors before making an offer."
CPE_39,C2,"Advertising on Trial**
If you work in an advertising agency, the early 1990s may have been one of the hardest times in your career. The recession was worse than expected, affecting industrialized countries for thirty years. In Britain, in 1991, the economy shrank, interest rates were very high, consumer spending dropped on almost everything except basic needs, over half a million people lost their jobs, and around 75,000 homes were taken back by banks. Every business was impacted, with some industries, like vehicles and construction, seeing a 30% decline. Many people and companies around the world suffered.
Advertising professionals were not the only ones losing jobs during this tough time, but those who remained often felt a lot of pressure. They were seen as responsible for helping their companies make money, which meant they felt closely watched by their colleagues and bosses. Additionally, they were often asked to do more with smaller budgets. They were told that ""less is more."" Despite these challenges, the importance of marketing seemed to grow. Companies began to realize they needed to create products and services that customers actually wanted, rather than just what was easy for them to make. 
In the last ten to fifteen years, many companies have started to take marketing seriously. This has led to more attention on marketing activities, and some brands have begun to market themselves effectively. As a result, the status of marketing professionals has increased, but so has their workload. Marketing is often mistakenly seen as a solution to all problems. Since about half of marketing budgets go to advertising, it is often the advertising teams that are held responsible for results.
The 1980s were a great time for advertising, but the early 1990s brought the worst downturn in a generation. This was partly due to the economic situation, but there were also deeper changes that would not simply go away when the economy improved. The recession caused many clients to rethink their budgets and closely examine the effectiveness of advertising. Without clear evidence of success, many companies began to question the value of their advertising spending. 
During this time, companies wanted better strategies, targeting, creativity, media placement, and overall thinking from their advertising agencies. They aimed to have the best people working on their accounts and to motivate them to produce excellent work. While this situation may not inspire sympathy for the advertising industry, it does mean that many advertising professionals still face the same challenges as their clients: how to achieve more with less.
In addition to the economic issues, other factors have made effective advertising harder to produce. Some of these are direct results of the recession, such as debates over production costs and a reluctance to take risks, which are often essential for good advertising. Other changes, like demographic shifts, the growing power of retailers, changing consumer needs, the rise of sponsorship, and stricter advertising laws, have also played a role. For some companies, advertising in foreign markets has become a new challenge.
These factors have led many advertising professionals to reconsider the saying by Lord Leverhulme: ""Only half my advertising works. The trouble is I don't know which half."" Now, more than ever, there is pressure to increase the effectiveness of advertising. Unfortunately, help for those looking to improve is not readily available. Companies and advertising agencies have been too busy dealing with these challenges to share their experiences. Those who have managed to succeed often want to keep their strategies private. As a result, while conferences and seminars may offer some useful insights, the available books on advertising often do not provide practical guidance. Many of these books treat the advertising process with too much respect, suggesting that the work produced by advertising agencies is always of the highest quality and value, which is not true and does not help the employees responsible for the results."
CPE_18,C2,"**The Lure of the Kitchen**
When I was at university, I decided I wanted to be a chef. This was an unusual choice among my peers. Cooking was not a popular career; it seemed unattractive. Chefs often have tough lives: the work is long, stressful, and poorly paid. However, these factors did not discourage me. I was unhappy at university. The work was difficult, and the social scene felt closed and self-important. Being a chef seemed like the perfect escape from the intellectual and social pretensions of college life. It promised a seriousness and integrity that I felt was missing in my studies.
My desire to cook was not just a reaction to my university experience; it also reflected an artistic ideal. I first realized this when I had a meal at a famous restaurant in London. It was a revelation. I still remember my starter clearly. After that meal, I felt so moved that I wanted to bow down and thank the chef. I felt light and happy for days. This experience sparked a strong desire in me to learn the secrets of this wonderful art. I changed my student life into a preparation for my future in cooking. My history degree became a distraction from my true passion. I learned about cooking by reading cookbooks, exploring markets, and preparing elaborate meals.
**Extract from a Novel**
The school's swimming instructor was a former drill sergeant, small and muscular, with tattooed arms. When I asked him to teach me how to dive, he told me to sit on the edge of the pool, raise my hands above my head, and roll forward, pushing off with my feet. I practiced this until the hour was over. The next time, he had me stand up and dive off the edge. The instructor was strict, and every time I surfaced, he looked at me with disapproval: ""Don't look down, look up!"" ""Keep your legs straight."" ""Point your toes!"" The following week, I went up to the high diving board. It was fixed and slightly bent down at the front. It seemed very high as I stood there, trying to gather my courage. Gradually, the noise faded, and I felt as if I were in a bubble of silence. I waved my arms as I had been taught, tried to look up instead of down, and jumped into the air. For a brief moment, I felt like I was flying. When I hit the water, I fell awkwardly, and my legs were everywhere. The instructor looked at me with disdain and shook his head. But even he could not take away my joy. That’s what they mean by ""free as a bird,"" I thought.
**The Traveller**
For those of us who value a comfortable bed, running water, and the chance to live at least until tomorrow, the idea of a traveller seems strange yet fascinating. These are people who have given in to the tempting call of the unknown. They choose to risk their lives by climbing dangerous mountains, sailing alone on small boats through huge waves, and eating insects if there is nothing else to eat. They can live for months in uncertainty. It is easy to see such people as oddities, and indeed they are, often considered eccentric: hermits, extreme divers, or writers. While their existence is undeniable, the unusual world they inhabit is far from our daily lives, and we can dismiss it as irrelevant. We can shrug and return to our lives with microwaves and answering machines, relieved that our own risks are predictable, like crossing a busy street.
**SAILING**
Jonathan Raban is afraid of the sea, which is probably why he spends so much time on it. He does not claim to be a top sailor, but he is clearly skilled. His main reason for sailing is that, as a writer, he enjoys writing about his sailing experiences. Sailing provides him with exciting stories to tell. Raban's small boat has a device that shows sailors their exact location anywhere on Earth. While he appreciates this tool, he also believes that the invention of the compass was a mistake. He thinks it has created a gap between people and the sea. Since the compass was invented, sailors have focused on it instead of observing the waves and feeling the ocean. The sea, once full of life, has become just a space to navigate. Because his job is simply to stay on course, a sailor can be replaced by an autopilot for long periods. This might be why Raban had time to observe the waves so closely."
CPE_62,C2,"**Holiday Reading**
Summer brings us two great joys: escaping home and reading books. These joys are closely connected. Books can help us feel more at home in the wider world. We can relate our own experiences to those in great books written long ago or in faraway places because there are fewer types of people than there are individuals. In the stories of others, we find our own thoughts, embarrassments, and dramas. Authors can express feelings we thought we were alone in experiencing, using words we might struggle to find. What is shy and confused within us is clearly and confidently expressed by them, especially if the work was created by someone from a different time or place. We feel thankful to these strangers for reminding us of who we are. Through reading and travel, we break free from the dullness of routine. Our eyes are most open during the first few days in a new place, and perhaps also when we read a great book, which reveals things we had previously overlooked. Our minds become like radar, picking up on details we hadn’t noticed before, such as the colors of the sky, the changing expressions on a face, the insincerity of a friend, or a sadness about a situation we didn’t know we could feel sad about.
**Author's Note**
These reflections on travel were published as articles in the Observer newspaper over seven years. I have made some small edits to fit the articles to the page, but otherwise, I have added very little. I corrected a few obvious mistakes, but only if they were minor details I should have gotten right initially. With hindsight, I could have made more improvements, but that would have taken too long. For example, in the second article about China, it seemed likely at the time that the Hong Kong dollar would remain strong. A year later, it fell. If I rewrote the piece to predict this, it would no longer be a report from that moment. Like any traveler in Southeast Asia or elsewhere, I was there at that time, unaware of what would happen next, and focused on understanding what had already occurred. This is the true story of mass air travel: the world opening up to people who have no special qualifications to explore it except the price of a ticket. However, I have never believed that all my fellow travelers were completely unaware. Even a postcard can be written with intention.
**Ecotourism**
If there were awards for tourism phrases that have been misused, ""ecotourism"" would win first prize. The term first appeared in the early 1980s, reflecting a rise in environmental awareness and a realization by tour operators that many travelers wanted to ensure their presence abroad would not harm the environment. It quickly became a popular marketing term for holidays. Today, the ecotourism label includes everything from a two-week tour with remote tribes to a one-hour boat trip through an Australian gorge. Any tour that involves cultural interaction, natural beauty, wildlife, or a bit of adventure is likely to be labeled as ecotourism. While the original intentions behind the movement were good, the lack of regulations and a clear definition left many travelers confused in an ecotourism maze.
**Transylvanian Journey**
I lost the notebook from my journey in Transylvania for 50 years, but I was lucky to find it a few years ago. It has helped me remember that time and write about it, but it hasn’t been as reliable as I hoped. In Transylvania, I found it easier than expected, moving from one welcoming country house to another, often staying for weeks. When I settled down during those long stays, my writing stopped too; since I was keeping a travel journal, I mistakenly thought there was nothing to write about. I was often slow to start writing again when I moved on, and even then, quick notes sometimes replaced longer narratives. Worried that some details might be out of order when I began writing this book, I surrounded these sections with many warnings and hesitations. However, realizing that these pages were not meant to be a guidebook made me feel it didn’t matter much, so I allowed the story to unfold without unnecessary complications."
CPE_49,C2,"Fashion**
Fashion is often thought of as a modern idea that relies on capitalism from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. However, many fashion historians argue that fashion, in terms of style and design, has a long history. They often begin their studies with the growth of trade in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. As societies have become more complex, populations have grown, and new technologies for making various types of clothing and accessories have emerged, the meanings of dress have also become more complex. Therefore, it is hard to determine what any piece of clothing or accessory truly means today. For instance, a man's suit, which is often seen as a symbol of uniformity, can have very different meanings depending on the context and the person interpreting it.
**Writer**
Reports about publishers competing for popular manuscripts can create a misleading picture of life for most novelists. In my experience, which is not exactly filled with best-sellers, there are two main ways to make a living. The smartest writers work in the evenings and have other full-time jobs that will still be there if their book is not quickly published or made into a film. Others, like me, take on various writing jobs, teaching, and occasional workshops to get by. I have heard of a writing job at a chocolate factory, but I have never found anything like that. Somehow, by balancing part-time jobs and using credit cards, and often thanks to the kindness of those mentioned in the Acknowledgements section of books, I manage to write my novel.
**Sudden Fame**
The small venues we performed at across the country were starting to sell out, and we needed extra security to manage the growing number of excited fans. We had to use secret entrances to avoid being overwhelmed by admirers at the village halls and ballrooms where we played. On the few nights we were not working, it was hard to leave the house without being followed by enthusiastic fans. In just a few days, we became celebrities. Our actions were closely watched by our fans, and our management took care of all our needs. Although my shyness never completely disappeared, it was replaced by a strange, naive confidence that only people who are naturally shy and find themselves in similar situations can understand. In short, I felt completely out of my depth emotionally."
CPE_31,C2,"Music - The Challenge Ahead**
Technological advances are changing our lives at work, home, and during our free time. Susan Hallam discusses how these changes affect music in Britain. In the late 20th century, there was a rapid increase in ways to listen to music, such as through radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, videos, and new multimedia techniques. However, this has led to a decline in live music performances and full-time jobs for professional musicians. 
It is clear that access to music will continue to grow, as it meets many human needs. On a national level, no major state event is complete without music. For individuals, music offers many formal and informal activities. A society without music is hard to imagine. The real question is not whether there will be music in the 21st century, but what kind of music it will be and whether people will still feel the need to learn to play instruments. I believe that there will still be a demand for learning instruments. The music industry is a major source of income in Britain, and musical skills will remain important for various professions, especially in media.
Moreover, there is evidence that playing an instrument can help develop skills early on. Research in the USA suggests that listening to or making music positively affects spatial reasoning, which is one measure of intelligence. While these results need further confirmation, studies in Europe show that group music lessons can improve social relationships in schools and help children focus, especially those with behavioral issues. 
Current research is also exploring how playing an instrument might help develop transferable skills. For example, regular practice can lead to good study habits and concentration, while performing in concerts can teach punctuality and organization. For these reasons, there will likely be a continued demand for instrumental teaching in the near future.
What about the long-term future? Will there be a change in focus, and if so, what will it be? I believe two possibilities are likely. First, the types of music people listen to will become more diverse, with new genres combining different styles. Second, technology will play a bigger role in composing and performing music, making it easier for more people to create music without needing advanced technical skills. However, this may also reduce the need for live performances and musicians focused solely on that.
At the same time, more people of all ages will want to participate in making music. These activities will likely be community-based and reflect the musical traditions of those communities. If this vision for the future is to happen, the music profession must prepare. Instrumental teaching will need to change to help more people learn a variety of instruments throughout their lives. This will require adjustments to the instrumental curriculum and how progress is measured, making them relevant to a wider audience.
Training for musicians will be crucial. They will need to inspire and teach learners of all ages, work with diverse groups, and develop skills in communication, social interaction, entrepreneurship, and management for community work. This represents a significant shift from traditional methods and will require a response to demands for public accountability. 
Positively, this change offers an opportunity for everyone involved in music education to showcase the high quality of music teaching available. Finally, we must work to raise the profile of music itself. Music is essential in our lives, but it is often taken for granted. Those in the music profession at all levels need to collaborate to ensure this changes."
CPE_58,C2,"**The Actor's Craft**
Actors sometimes face criticism and scorn. Much of this negativity comes from the actors themselves when they are asked to discuss their work in interviews. Instead of sharing their true feelings, they often resort to tired clichés or gossip. Paul Scofield once wrote to a friend that an actor's work is only alive when performed. He believed that discussing it makes it feel empty and theoretical. Each time an actor performs, they start anew, learning from the characters and the writer. After a play ends, they feel empty until the next performance, and this emptiness is often evident in discussions about acting.
**A Review of Hamlet**
Adrian Lester's portrayal of Hamlet captures the transition from boyhood to manhood with simplicity and confidence. His control over the text and his physical presence elevate him from a promising actor to a leading performer. Lester plays a young man filled with anger, yet he balances this with sharp wit and humor, making his character both intimidating and endearing. His physicality, such as the way his arms hang, suggests a character waiting to be brought to life. Similarly, Handy's portrayal of Horatio conveys a sense of being moved by an inner force.
**What is Acting?**
What does it mean to act? Is it merely copying behavior, or does it create something new? This question lies at the heart of theatre.
**One Director's Approach to Rehearsal**
This director's rehearsal process begins with a technique called ""dropping in."" The stage manager displays the script on a screen while the actors listen quietly. When it’s their turn to speak, they read the first line, reflect on its meaning, and wait for the impulse to speak. For example, if the line is, ""Queuing all night, the rain, do you remember?"" they take a breath and let the thought come to them. They might visualize a memory, like waiting in line for a concert. The director encourages actors to be open and trust that something will happen in the moment.
**The Perfect Theatre**
The ideal theatre should make you feel that your presence matters. Attending a live performance is a special event, and the staff should recognize this. It can feel isolating if the people working at the theatre seem indifferent. The theatre must create a connection between the performers and the audience. Everyone should feel engaged and not distant from the action on stage. The design of the auditorium is crucial; it should suit the human voice and body. If the space is too large, it can diminish the experience. Many theatres built in the late nineteenth century successfully created an intimate atmosphere. I appreciate theatres that show a sense of history, like worn stone steps in a church, which reflect the presence of many people over time. 
When it comes to plays, you cannot please everyone. You cannot predict what the audience will want to see. When you go to the theatre, you hope for something unexpected; otherwise, you might as well stay home."
CPE_37,C2,"**Text:**
**Paul Simon**  
Rock and roll in the 1950s was mainly a music movement for young people, but it also had a significant effect on the middle class and older adults. It opened the door for the next generation of rock stars, who listened to it with admiration, knowing that this unique and exciting sound would be connected to their futures. For Paul Simon and other young people in the US, the best way to hear this new and lively music was through Alan Freed's radio show, Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party. Freed's show was essential listening for many young rock stars. Like the young John Lennon, who was 3,000 miles away in Liverpool, listening to Radio Luxembourg—the only European station playing rock and roll—Paul Simon was captivated by the music from Freed's show. He was getting ready for the next big step for a teenager obsessed with rock and roll: moving from listening to creating his own music.
**Snow**  
No path was visible, but I thought I would be okay if I walked carefully. The wind blew hard from above, pushing me over as I slipped on the icy ground. Suddenly, the snow that looked innocent gave way beneath me. I fell into a hole about four feet deep. The snow had formed a roof over the gap between two rocks, and when it melted, it left only a thin layer that I fell through. I pulled myself out, shaken and scared, wondering what I would have done if the hole had been thirty feet deep. I leaned against a pine tree that was sticking out of the snow to think about my situation. In an hour, I had only gone about half a mile. It was clear that I would have to give up my plan.
**Qualitative Research**  
There are now many books that try to help researchers understand qualitative research. While a lot has been written about how to collect data, these books often do not explain how to analyze that data. There is still much confusion about how researchers analyze their findings. Therefore, we invited various social scientists who have worked on qualitative projects to share the methods they used. The goal was to provide insight into the process of qualitative data analysis, rather than to create a guidebook for new researchers. This task involves making unclear processes clearer. While this may seem easy, we have found it quite challenging. We have allowed our contributors to present their work in different styles, including personal stories and more formal approaches."
CPE_2,C2,"**Screen Learning**
Recently, I saw my six-year-old son eating noodles in a funny way. He was pulling them up with his teeth and pretending to be a dinosaur. ""I'm a little dinosaur,"" he said. He was acting out a scene from a TV show, so I asked him what he remembered about dinosaurs. He didn’t remember much. There is a trend to use the internet and computers for learning, but is learning from a screen effective? One writer shares his experience with an interactive program he tried with his son. The father read the words while the son played with the pictures. The father thought that if his son had spent ten minutes reading a book, he might have learned something. Research shows that learning happens best in environments where there is conversation with teachers or parents. While using new technology to teach children is good, traditional education still plays an important role.
**Hollywood**
By 1918, most of the world’s film-making moved to Hollywood. The local people were not happy, seeing their neighborhood in Los Angeles changed by these newcomers. However, they eventually accepted this change because of the American value of success, measured by box-office earnings. Hollywood can recognize a good film, one that can create stars and make money. In less than a century, Hollywood has transformed from a small village to a town as famous as New York, Rome, or Paris. Physically, it has changed a lot; a hundred years ago, you would walk through orange groves to get to the village store. Yet, in some ways, it still feels like a village, focused mainly on films: how much money they make, who is dating whom, and who is working on which project. Many successful people try to leave Hollywood to live elsewhere, but it remains the main place for anyone important in show business.
**Photography**
Photography was created by artists in the nineteenth century as a new form of art. These artists wanted a lasting record of what they saw, and they achieved this with new technology. The combination of light, lenses, shutters, and light-sensitive surfaces produced images that were more detailed and realistic than what painters could create in weeks or months. This innovation surprised other artists, and at first, they were pleased. However, art critics soon claimed that photography could not be considered art because it relied too much on mechanical processes. Despite this criticism, photographers recognized that they had discovered a new way to express themselves. They used photography like other artists use brushes and pencils—to interpret the world and present their vision of nature and people.
**Book Illustration**
During the black-and-white era of book illustration, it was clear that every children's book needed illustrations. This also applied to many novels for older readers, which saw a decline in print runs. Although children's publishing remained active, it was often low-budget, leading to many average works. However, the best artists always submitted their best work. As a result, the black-and-white collection is a mix of both valuable and less impressive pieces, making it a great place for research and discovery. The true treasures from this period are likely to be displayed again, either through reprints of classic titles or new publications about the artists. There are signs that interest in this period is growing, and we may soon see a publisher create a series of classic children's book illustrations, either as reprints or new editions using the original artwork."
CPE_68,C2,"Blogging: Sharing Our Lives Online**
Not long ago, a website warned about the dangers of public check-ins, which are online updates about where you are. The message was clear: when you say, ""Hey, I'm at this place,"" you are also letting many people know your location, including those you might not want to meet. This reflects a growing understanding that sharing everything online can have negative consequences. 
The internet offers many exciting chances to share our lives with a global audience, leading to dreams of wealth and fame. However, as we dive into this online world, we often share personal stories and photos without thinking about the risks. Eventually, we may feel overwhelmed and lost in this crowded space. 
But there is hope. The path forward was shown to us years ago by early internet users who explored these challenges. In the beginning, they faced many difficulties, losing jobs and friends while navigating the temptations of fame, long before social media existed. These early bloggers experienced what many of us are now facing. It’s important to learn from their experiences.
In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started sharing his life online. At that time, the web was mostly used by graduate students and scientists. Hall saw a chance to share his personal story. He created a detailed online autobiography filled with his thoughts, photos, and art. In January 1996, he began a daily blog, attracting many readers who were fascinated by his boldness in using this new platform. Hall was open about everything; no topic was off-limits. While some might see this as attention-seeking, there was also a unique beauty to his work.
However, one day, visitors to his site found it replaced by a video called Dark Night. Hall shared that he had fallen deeply in love, but when he wrote about it, he was told to choose between his blog and his relationship. He felt that sharing his life online made people distrust him. The blog ended, but the issue remains: sharing online can be wonderful, but if you think it will always attract people to you, you might be disappointed.
In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a young woman in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, a colleague sent her blog link to the company’s vice presidents, including some she had criticized, which led to her losing her job. Researchers call this the ""online distribution effect,"" which describes how people often say things online that they would never say in person. However, our online lives are connected to our real lives, and ignoring this can lead to serious mistakes.
Armstrong's story had a positive outcome. Although she was upset and stopped blogging for a while, she later got married and started a new blog focused on her family. Today, she is a well-known ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her household. Once seen as an example of the risks of sharing too much online, she has now mastered the art of sharing her life wisely. 
What Armstrong teaches us is important: the internet allows us to say anything, but that doesn’t mean we should."
CPE_23,C2,"Enough Sleep?**
Tiredness is often seen as a common problem in modern life. As wealthier and busier countries have developed, sleeplessness and anxiety have also increased. Research in the USA shows that 40 million Americans suffer from chronic sleep issues. Some popular novels in Britain have even featured characters who cannot sleep or have settings in sleep research labs. This growing interest in sleep includes its patterns, its importance, and the problems people face with it. A leading sleep researcher states, ""People need more sleep."" Many people reduce their sleep when they are busy, often waking up early to avoid traffic.
Recently, a sleep researcher conducted an experiment. He allowed participants to sleep for up to 14 hours a night for a month. After three weeks, they settled into an average of eight hours and fifteen minutes of sleep, showing a significant need for sleep that they had been missing.
In Europe, a university sleep research lab in the English Midlands has studied various topics, including how fatigue affects sailors, the impact of airport noise on sleep, and the risks of driving while tired. They recruit participants through student newspapers, offering them £5 an hour and asking them to change their sleep patterns as instructed. Dr. Louise Reyner reassures participants who worry about having electrodes placed on their heads, explaining that the lab focuses on physical aspects of sleep.
In a dark room, there is a motorway simulator with a car facing a large screen. Participants are told to arrive at 2 PM, during the body's natural afternoon slump, after a short night’s sleep or no sleep at all. They drive while answering questions as the projector shows a long road ahead with bright sunlight and warm air. The young men insist they will not fall asleep. Dr. Reyner has recorded one participant trying to stay awake. At first, he sits up straight, but soon he starts to blink more often and his head begins to droop. Eventually, he experiences brief moments of blackout, jerking awake each time. By the second or third time, the car veers off the road. Dr. Reyner suggests that two cups of coffee can help someone stay alert for at least half an hour. She also recommends various products like energy drinks and caffeinated gum, especially for shift workers.
But what else do we know about sleep? It is understood that humans, like other mammals, sleep in a daily cycle. While asleep, we go through four stages, from light sleep to deep sleep. Dreams usually happen during light sleep, and the brain temporarily paralyzes the body to prevent injuries. Beyond this, many ideas about sleep are still theories. Some believe sleep helps repair the body or restore muscles, but it might also happen during relaxed wakefulness, so it is unclear.
Scientists agree that women tend to sleep about half an hour longer than men, and older people generally need less sleep, though the reasons are unknown. When asked about the purpose of sleep, some researchers say, ""Sleep is a way to travel through time safely.""
Historically, sleep patterns have changed. A history professor studied British sleep habits from 1500 to 1850 and found that people went to bed early, woke up after midnight for a while, and then went back to sleep. This time was used for reflection, remembering dreams, or even stealing. The poorest people benefited most from this quiet time, escaping their daily struggles. However, by the 17th century, as artificial light became more common, wealthier people began to adopt the more efficient sleep patterns we have today. The industrial revolution later extended working hours for most people, except in rural areas.
In many non-western cultures, the old sleep patterns still exist. Some people go to bed for a few hours, then wake up again, and the idea of a full night’s sleep does not apply. In certain tribal societies, noises from humans and animals, along with the need to tend to fires and watch for predators, make continuous sleep difficult. It appears that people everywhere are in great need of more sleep."
CPE_60,C2,"""We are talking about big cowboy boots. Really big boots. I stood in my expensive designer cowboy boots on the rocks in the Arizona desert. Money was not a problem. I wore a complete cowboy outfit, and if you have the outfit, you might be a cowboy. But I was not. It wasn't working for me. I squinted into the morning sun, looking at the Arizona mountains, and I had to admit, I did not feel at home. I flew in from Denver just after dawn, thinking I might look like a cowboy coming from the sky. That feeling disappeared when I saw a real cowboy in the luggage area of Phoenix airport. He wore a dirty shirt, needed a shave, and was lifting a worn bag off the conveyor belt when he noticed my new cowboy boots. He raised an eyebrow and walked out without looking back. 
There should be a set of clothes that an ex-racing driver can wear without feeling out of place. Something that allows him to feel comfortable wherever he goes, without feeling like everyone is speaking a different language and moving slowly. I loved being a racing driver and driving racing cars. I am addicted to it, and it is all I know how to do. But I don’t do it anymore. I couldn’t even if I wanted to. I wondered, looking at the rough, red rocks of the mountains, what I should do now. A racing driver should have one or two backup plans for when he stops racing. I thought I had some, but when I tried to reach for them, they vanished. 
How about: an ex-racing driver provides commentary from the trackside? 'We have fifteen former Indy and Formula One drivers ready to be commentators. We’ll call you.' Or: an ex-racing driver partners to sell classic cars? That plan lasted nearly all winter with phone calls, lunches, lawyers, and meetings with bankers. But it was a year when no one was buying old Ferraris, and Honda was changing its dealer list. So, I stepped back before there was nothing left to step back from. 
Being an 'ex' anything is hard. How much do you want to hear about how I was almost the World Champion? No one wants to hear a story that ends with 'almost.' Even if I had been the champion, you would probably only listen for five minutes before getting bored. Last year’s champion is just that—last year. Not that I want sympathy, which is good because I don’t get any. Why should I? I had a good career, made money, and saved enough. But I miss the thrill of getting into that powerful racing car with seven hundred horsepower. Zero to one hundred fifty miles per hour in 4.9 seconds. And yes, I miss the danger of almost crashing every race. I miss the exciting people and the reporters who acted like my words mattered. Being somewhat famous isn’t all bad. Businessmen and politicians liked to tell their friends they knew me. Little boys would sneak under fences to get my autograph. 
Now that I don’t drive anymore, I have a lot of free time. Just last week, the phone rang twice. I have time in the morning and afternoon. Tomorrow looks free too, so much empty time. I looked up at the clear blue sky. No buzzards flying above. Maybe Arizona doesn’t have buzzards. But a couple of small brown birds in a cactus nearby were warning me to leave their nest alone. I never thought the desert had songbirds. It made me realize that a fake cowboy in designer boots has a lot to learn."""
CPE_1,C2,"Vancouver**
In the last ten years, many people from around the world have moved to Vancouver, in western Canada. In the evenings, residents walk through the city streets, and if you join them, you will likely hear different languages being spoken. People come to Vancouver for its mild weather, beautiful location between the ocean and mountains, clean and safe environment, and good educational and job opportunities. Although some locals may complain about the speed of new building developments, it is clear that the new residents and growing tourism have contributed to a vibrant city life. Vancouver was once called 'Terminal City' because it served as a gateway to other places. Although this name is less common now, Vancouver is still a major gateway.
**Putting Pen to Paper**
Journalists like me often struggle with writing letters. Some say this is because we dislike writing for free, but I think it is more about how we aim for the best effect in our work, which makes writing a letter feel different. A true artist, who may rewrite their work many times, does not face this issue. I believe that understanding the impact of their words is a key sign of a real artist. When Shakespeare wrote his famous lines, he likely did not think about how the use of longer words made them powerful and showed his talent.
**Supermarket Opening**
In Britain, the opening of a new supermarket used to be a big event. You could expect a celebrity, like a soap star or a member of the royal family, to cut the ribbon. Now, new supermarkets seem to open every day, and celebrities are no longer needed. Why pay a famous person when anyone can open it for free? Last week, waiting customers didn’t care who opened the new Superbuy store, as long as they were at the front of the line. According to one customer who knew someone working there, the first five men to enter would receive a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women would get a bunch of flowers. This news quickly spread through the crowd, making those at the front feel proud and causing envy among those who arrived later."
CPE_53,C2,"Citizen Kane**
When the film *Citizen Kane* was released in 1941, it created a lot of excitement, but it was not a commercial success. The release was delayed because the distributors were worried about what William Randolph Hearst, the person the film was thought to be about, might do to them. Although it received very positive reviews, it was television that later brought it back into the public eye. This film has inspired many people to become filmmakers, which is impressive since it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles believed that its success came from his lack of knowledge about what he could or could not do; he simply went for it. He also had a talented team, including cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and special-effects expert Linwood Dunn. When Welles and Mankiewicz decided to create a story about a newspaper magnate who was both like and unlike Hearst, Welles realized he had found the perfect role for himself as both director and actor, and he took the opportunity with great enthusiasm.
**Dermot and Carmel**
That morning, Dermot thought Carmel seemed a bit strange. He had mentioned twice that he might be late and that he might stop by the golf club on his way home to talk to someone. Each time, she nodded as if she hadn’t really heard him. “Will you be okay? What are you going to do today?” he asked. She smiled and replied, “It’s funny you ask. I was just thinking I have nothing planned, so I’ll take a walk downtown and look at the shops. I feel like it’s almost wrong to waste the day like this.” Dermot smiled back, saying, “You deserve to enjoy yourself. And if I’m late, I won’t need anything to eat, so don’t worry about it.” “That’s fine,” she said.
**Title Race**
“Tea boy? Do you mind? I’m a mobile lukewarm beverage resource facilitator.” Human nature can be quite funny. A recent study showed that job titles often cause jealousy and problems at work. A survey by a well-known recruitment firm found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees believe that job titles create divisions among coworkers. Surprisingly, 70% of office workers said they would give up a pay raise for a more “motivational” or “professional” job title. If our desire for better titles is so strong that it overcomes our basic need for money, we are in trouble. In the early twenty-first century, no one wants to be called subordinate. The job titles being discussed focus on skills (like specialist or coordinator) but are really just fancy words."
CPE_55,C2,"**The Vienna Assignment**
I was in Vienna to take photographs. This was usually the reason I traveled. Photography was not just my job; it was a big part of my life. The way light fell on different surfaces always inspired me. I believed that a single photograph could capture the essence of a moment, a place, or a person. I often thought that one day, I might take the perfect picture. As long as I had film in my camera, there was always a chance. My rule was simple: finish one roll, load another, and keep looking with open eyes. This had been my approach for a long time.
Once, I got lucky when a photo of a smoke plume from a burning oil well became very popular, and newspapers and magazines around the world wanted it. It was a brief moment of fame, but just luck. They say you create your own luck, both good and bad. After that, I decided to work freelance, which seemed smart, but life had other plans. The mid-nineties were not the series of successes I had hoped for after my photo made the cover of Time magazine. That’s why I found myself in Vienna instead of somewhere more exciting. Still, I was taking photographs and getting paid for it, which didn’t sound too bad.
The assignment came about by chance. I had taken photos for a coffee-table book called *Four Cities in Four Seasons*, which featured London, Paris, Rome, and Vienna. I had received a good commission for capturing my city in different seasons. I had my own unique take on the flowers in Hyde Park and the busy streets of Piccadilly. I also accepted that much of what I created would be ignored since it was just a picture book, not meant to challenge anyone’s views.
After a cold snap over Christmas, I submitted my winter photos of London and learned that the Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, had left his job in Vienna for reasons I wasn’t told. Instead of hiring someone new, they offered me the job. The Austrian publishers liked my work, and I was available, while the French and Italian photographers were not. I was happy to go. Things at home were not good, so a week in snowy Vienna sounded perfect.
They put me up at the Europa hotel in the old city. I had last visited Vienna with my wife for a busy weekend of sightseeing, which was hot and chaotic. I hadn’t taken many photos then. This time, alone in the cold January, I knew it would be different. As soon as I arrived and saw the beautiful light over the snow-covered roofs, I felt excited. I was ready to take great pictures.
On my first day, I didn’t rush to take photos. I rode the trams around the Ringstrasse, getting on and off to experience the city’s atmosphere. The weather was cold and still, like the grand buildings from the old empire. I hadn’t seen what Schussner had captured in the other seasons, and I didn’t want to. This was going to be my Vienna, and I was ready to let it reveal itself to me. 
A photograph captures a moment, but you must wait for the right moment. So, I took my time, observing until I could see clearly. The next morning, I was out at dawn. The fresh snow meant Stephansplatz would be beautifully white and almost empty. I struggled to find a way to photograph the cathedral, which towered high into the grey sky but appeared massive at ground level. I realized I might have to settle for a partial view. In that weather and at that time, it could still be magical. 
Photography has always had a sense of magic. Even the early photographers felt this before they fully understood the chemistry behind it. You can watch a blank sheet of paper turn into a photograph in a dark room. Even when you know how it works, the mystery remains. Perhaps that’s why what happened at Stephansplatz that morning didn’t surprise me in a strange way."
CPE_50,C2,"Kinetic Art**
Exciting news: London's Hayward Gallery has changed into a place of wonder. This transformation is not due to a big-budget show, but rather a unique exploration of a lesser-known part of the last 60 years. A new exhibition looks at the history of kinetic art, which is art that involves movement, throughout the twentieth century. It shows that creating artworks that move on their own or explore the idea of movement has been a consistent, though often overlooked, theme in some of the most interesting creative work of this century. The exhibition features a wonderful collection of paintings, drawings, documents, and films about kinetic art, curated by Guy Brett, who has studied this subject for many years. The artworks are mostly presented without much text, allowing visitors to enjoy discovering connections and insights on their own.
**David Hockney**
David Hockney's art attracts many people who might not usually be interested in art. This could be because his work is figurative and easy to understand, or because it focuses on leisure and escape from daily life. Some people might even be drawn to Hockney's charming personality and his clever comments, making him popular for reasons unrelated to his art. However, this does not mean that his art lacks purpose. Some critics believe Hockney is an overrated artist, but one could argue that his popularity today makes it seem like his work is less significant. Hockney himself is realistic about his abilities and believes it is not fair to judge his work based on an abstract idea of greatness. He does not claim to be a great artist and understands that only future generations can truly judge his importance.
**Window-shopping - an Art Exhibition**
In recent years, I have seen many contemporary art exhibitions, some brilliant and others mediocre. What often frustrates me are shows that seem to push a specific agenda, suggesting a common viewpoint among certain artists. Sometimes this approach works, revealing new trends in seemingly unrelated works. More often, however, it highlights a questionable angle or a forced idea. This led me, as a curator, to create a show that opposes this trend. Along with seven artists, I took over a space in an empty warehouse. 'Window-shopping' was meant to be a collection of individual artworks that connected only by being labeled as art. For example, Sam Cole's knitted cats chased each other on a toy train track, while Matthew Crawley filmed a video camera, opened it, and poked around until it broke, creating flickering images on a monitor. These works did not fit into a specific theme and would not usually be shown together, but they complemented each other in their contrast. I did not make grand statements about contemporary art, but I believe that art is an individual activity where artists set their own rules.
**Art History**
People who enjoy paintings sometimes hesitate to analyze them, fearing it will ruin their enjoyment. Some believe that art historians, who focus on theory rather than practice, overlook the joy of viewing art and the special act of creating it. This idea is similar to thinking that knowing a recipe and cooking method takes away from the taste of a dish. Understanding the importance of enjoyment does not mean we cannot have a deep knowledge of what we are experiencing. In fact, knowing more about an artwork might enhance our pleasure. Additionally, pleasure is complex. How we sense and recognize pleasure is influenced by our history and society. Our preferences for certain characteristics in art are shaped not just by our genes or personalities, but also by the values of the society we live in. While we should not underestimate the importance of instinctive responses to art, the belief that intellectual understanding diminishes enjoyment comes from a past view that saw art as separate from thought."
CPE_25,C2,"Metals**  
Stone Age people may have been interested in metals because they wanted to decorate themselves. While sitting by a river, waiting for fish, one of our early ancestors might have found a shiny yellow stone and picked it up. It felt different from regular stones and was very attractive. This could be how gold became important to early humans. Because gold is easy to shape, it quickly became a popular material. Copper might have also been discovered by chance, and once people realized how useful copper tools were, they actively searched for copper ores and ways to extract the metal. This led to the development of metalworking, which improved the lives of our ancestors.
**St Ives**  
We were quiet as we carried our bags down the narrow, cobbled street that led to the town center, struggling against the strong wind and trying to avoid the cold waves crashing over the walkway. The streets were empty, and all the windows in the waterfront cottages were tightly shut against the storm. We had seen the weather get worse as we arrived in St Ives on a small train. As the dark clouds gathered, visiting Cornwall in the off-season without a car didn’t seem like a good idea anymore. I had convinced my friend to come with me by promising beautiful walks along the Cornish coast and cozy evenings by the fire.
**Computer Modelling**  
Studying the past is challenging because it is gone. The people who lived in times of peace and those who faced hardships are no longer alive. The reasons they settled in certain places or formed families and communities have been forgotten. Archaeology gives us some clues, but we cannot test our ideas with experiments on past cultures. We cannot go back in time to see what happened. However, computer modeling allows us to recreate ancient landscapes and environments and fill them with virtual communities—digital people that have some of the needs and abilities of real humans. We can set rules for them and create social groups. Then, we can change the weather or increase the population and observe how these virtual cultures and their artificial people respond."
CPE_34,C2,"
**Vervet Monkeys**  
Cheney and Seyfarth studied vervet monkeys and observed a dominant male in the group. One day, he saw a strange male nearby in another grove of trees. The stranger wanted to join the group, which could lead to the dominant male losing his position. To keep the stranger away, the dominant male cleverly made an alarm call that vervet monkeys use to warn of a leopard. This made the stranger retreat back into the trees. The dominant male repeated this tactic whenever the stranger approached. However, he made a mistake when he called out the alarm while walking across the open ground himself.
**What Cats Catch**  
In a survey in the village of Felmersham, people recorded what their cats caught over a year. Seventy cats caught over 1,000 prey items. An American professor estimated that this means cats in Britain kill about 100 million birds and small mammals each year. However, this number is misleading. Most cats live in towns and catch fewer animals than those in the survey. The important question is whether these numbers are sustainable. The answer seems to be yes. In winter, many people feed birds, and gardens provide nesting sites, keeping bird populations above natural levels. The survey showed that while cats are significant predators, they are not destroying Britain's bird population.
**Buffalo's Day**  
Buffaloes are very important to the marshmen, and they are treated with care. Each morning, the buffaloes, after sleeping on a platform or near the fire with their owners, slowly leave for the reed beds beyond the water. They take their time, groaning about the tiring day ahead, until the leader finally steps into the water. Once in the water, they seem to forget their purpose and relax, making low sounds of complaint. Their movements away from the house are slow and almost unnoticed, but eventually, they are swimming, barely keeping their noses above the water. They spend the day among the reeds, grazing on green shoots at their eye level.
**Picasso, Pablo**  
In early spring 1940, while in the fishing port of Royan, Picasso painted several still lifes of fish. One painting shows a fishmonger’s slab with a crab and some soles on scales. The fish appear almost alive despite their situation. The painting is complex, with overlapping transparent shapes and delicate colors, creating a calm underwater scene. However, there is tension as the fish seem to be preparing for a fight with the crab. The sharp shapes in the painting, including the scales and a chain around one fish, suggest a sense of danger and hidden violence, giving the artwork a deeper meaning."
CPE_12,C2,"Photography**
Over the last 150 years, photography has been used to capture many aspects of human life. In this relatively short time, photography has improved its ability to record moments in time and space, allowing us to see both large and small details. It has given us images from faraway places, distant parts of the solar system, and the complex social issues of modern life. Photography has become one of the most important ways to express what it means to be human.
However, the idea of recording events visually has a much longer history. The earliest forms of visual recording date back to the Upper Paleolithic period, around 35,000 years ago. We cannot be sure why early cave paintings were created. They may have recorded actual hunting events, served as magic to help with hunting, acted as religious symbols, or simply brightened daily life. Nevertheless, visual images are deeply connected to human culture.
Throughout history, people have questioned how accurate visual images are and what role they play in society. The saying ""seeing is believing"" has always given special importance to visual images. When photography was invented in the mid-1800s, it seemed to promise a truthful visual record. The camera was seen as a tool that worked like the human eye, capturing fixed images that closely resembled what we see. The chemical process used in photography allowed for the capture of what we consider natural images.
At the same time, photography was viewed as a sophisticated cultural achievement, producing images that artists had long tried to create through skill and practice. Ironically, because photography seemed so realistic, it was thought that everyone could easily understand photographs. This led to the idea that photography might be a ""universal language."" For instance, in 1933, photographer August Sander suggested that even the most isolated person could understand a photograph of the sky, whether it showed the sun, moon, or stars.
However, as global communication increased in the late twentieth century, we must consider how well photographs can cross cultural differences. Is photography limited by cultural norms like any other form of communication, such as language? Has our familiarity with photographs made us overlook the complex ways they convey vivid impressions of reality? Photography is often seen as providing convincing evidence, making it seem like a clear reflection of our environment. It is common for someone to show a photograph and say, ""This is my grandson.""
Since its invention in 1839, photography and the attitudes towards it have changed significantly. This change may be partly due to photography moving into what we might call ""mythic time."" Its original role as a record-keeper has evolved, and photographs, once closely tied to the photographer and subject, have become historical documents. These images often reveal as much about the people and society that created them as they do about their subjects.
I aim to show that the camera is not just a silent recorder of events. Photography does not merely reflect culture; it can also inspire social and political change. For example, it is hard to imagine the cultural shifts of the Italian Renaissance without recognizing how the development of perspective changed visual representation. Similarly, photography has played a significant role in shaping the media culture of our time, while also bringing the harsh realities of the world into our everyday lives."
CPE_26,C2,"**How to Write Poetry**
Teaching people how to write poetry can be tricky. It requires creativity, but one wrong move can lead to confusion. I won’t pretend to know everything, so I will say this: for beginners, nothing replaces reading a lot, writing often, and letting your imagination flow freely, as long as it doesn’t become chaotic. Some people need a stable life to write poetry, while others find comfort in writing through their struggles. Some writers follow a schedule, while others wait for inspiration to strike. All approaches are valid, as long as they don’t follow strict rules. The key is to find your unique voice, nurture it, and let it grow. Eventually, it will be strong enough to stand on its own.
**The Short Story**
In a short story, it’s important not to overcrowd it with too many characters or long descriptions. Flashbacks should be brief and only used when necessary to clarify something. One effective way to use flashbacks is through a character’s memory, which can help move the story forward at a critical moment, but it should never slow down the action. Dialogue is often more effective than many new writers realize. Two characters talking can show different perspectives much faster than explaining everything from one viewpoint. This keeps the reader engaged and avoids unnecessary words. Overwriting can ruin a short story, but being brief doesn’t mean it should feel like a summary. Conflict and action should be just as strong in a short story as in a novel, but the skill lies in making every word count in a limited space.
**Screenplays**
Anyone who knows how to play chess can understand how to write a screenplay. Most chess players make mistakes along the way. We may not know everything, but we know enough to play. We can often see a few moves ahead, and we feel good about that. As we learn more about chess, we realize that it’s more about long-term strategy than short-term moves. We start to see the game as a whole, not just a series of individual moves. We notice patterns, called gambits, and recognize different phases of the game, like openings, middle games, and end games. The more we play chess, the more we understand its complexities, just like in screenplay writing.
**Looking at Writing**
Humans naturally want to communicate, as seen in the chatter of young children; however, no child instinctively knows how to bake, brew, or write. Charles Darwin noted that language is a natural human instinct, but writing is not. Language exists in all societies, both past and present. While languages change, they do not necessarily improve; modern English is not better than the languages spoken by ancient tribes. All healthy children learn to speak without formal lessons. When children are together without a common language, they create their own. In contrast, writing systems have been created only a few times in history, starting in complex societies and evolving over time. Until recently, most children did not learn to read or write, and even today, many struggle. A group of children is unlikely to invent an alphabet, just as they wouldn’t invent a car engine. Children are naturally good at hearing sounds, but learning to read and write is a skill that takes time and effort. We need to understand how writing works, how children learn, and how to connect the two."
CPE_8,C2,"""I have never started a novel with more uncertainty. If I call it a novel, it is only because I don’t know what else to call it. I have little story to tell and I do not end with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave my reader hanging. This book is about my memories of a man I met only occasionally, and I do not know much about what happened to him in between our meetings. I could invent details to make my story more complete, but I do not want to do that. I just want to write down what I know. To avoid embarrassing living people, I have given the characters in this story names I made up, and I have taken care to ensure that no one can recognize them. The man I am writing about is not famous. He may never be. When his life ends, he might leave no more trace of his existence than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the water's surface. If my book is read at all, it will be read for its own interest. However, it is possible that his way of life and the unique qualities of his character may influence others, so that long after he is gone, people may realize that a remarkable person lived in this time. Then it will be clear who I am writing about, and those who want to know a bit about his early life may find something useful in this book. I believe my book, despite its limitations, will be a helpful source of information for my friend’s biographers. I do not claim that the conversations I recorded are exact. I never took notes of what was said, but I remember well what concerns me. Although I have put these conversations in my own words, I believe they accurately reflect what was said. I mentioned earlier that I have invented nothing, but I have taken the liberty that historians take to create speeches for the characters that I did not hear. I did this to make the scenes more lively and believable, as they would be less effective if simply told. I want to be read, and I think I am justified in making my book engaging. The thoughtful reader will easily see where I have used this technique and can choose to ignore it. Another reason I feel nervous about this work is that the people I write about come from a different culture. It is hard to truly know people, and I believe you can only really know your own countrymen. People are shaped by their surroundings: the place they were born, the home they grew up in, the games they played, the food they ate, the schools they attended, the sports they followed, and the poets they read. All these experiences shape who they are, and you cannot understand them just by hearing about them; you must live them. You can only know them if you are one of them. Because you cannot fully understand people from a different nation except through observation, it is challenging to give them authenticity in a book. I have never tried to write about anyone but my own countrymen, and if I have done so in short stories, it is because you can treat characters more briefly in those. You give the reader general ideas and let them fill in the details. In this book, I do not claim that my characters see themselves as they truly are; they are seen, like my main character, through my own perspective."""
CPE_4,C2,"**POETRY RECITALS**
At any time in history, the literary world can seem confusing to those living in it. It is only later that people can see clear patterns and important figures in literature. Right now, there is a complex mix of poetic styles, types of poetry, and different opinions on how poetry should be presented, criticized, and taught. 
The current debate in contemporary poetry mainly involves two groups: serious 'literary' poets, who write poems meant to be read on the page, and 'popular' performing poets, who prefer to share their work with an audience. However, this division is not strict. Over the past twenty years, public poetry readings have become more common in various forms. Small literary groups in towns hold readings in community centers or members' homes; schools and colleges invite poets to speak to students; and arts festivals often feature poetry readings by well-known authors.
The effects of these events, where poets often have to perform in public, are varied and uncertain. For 'pop' poets, whose work is designed for live audiences, public performance is beneficial. Their poems are usually simple in form and content, making them easy to understand in one hearing. However, the weaknesses in their thought and technique may become clear when read on the page.
On the other hand, poets who are dedicated to their craft and aim to continue the best traditions of poetry—compressing deep feelings, thoughts, and creativity into a small space—may not be appreciated by audiences who are hearing their work for the first time. The risk is that these poets might choose to read only their simplest work to connect quickly with the audience, which may not represent their true style.
Attending poetry readings cannot replace reading poetry on the page, but it can be enjoyable and educational. Hearing good poets read their work, even if they are not great speakers, helps the audience understand where to place emphasis. It is best if the audience has the text in front of them or knows the poems beforehand.
The main reason for popular poetry recitals, sometimes mixed with music (like jazz), is to help audiences enjoy poetry and see it as an art form for everyone, not just a select few."
CPE_30,C2,"**Oral History**  
Historians increasingly use oral evidence, but this approach has challenges. It is overly simplistic to think that a person's testimony is a clear reflection of their past experiences. In an interview, both the interviewer and the interviewee influence each other. The historian chooses who to interview and what topics to discuss. Even if the historian only listens, their presence can change how the informant remembers and shares their past. The final account is shaped by the historian's social position and their understanding of history, which may be communicated to the informant. Therefore, historians must acknowledge their role in creating new evidence. The challenges continue even after the historian leaves. The informant's memories are not direct connections to the past; they can be influenced by other sources, like the media. Memories may also be colored by nostalgia or feelings of loss from childhood, which can distort the original experiences. Listeners may find the emotions in the testimony convincing, but these feelings might come from later experiences rather than the time being discussed.
**Animal Science**  
There are two main approaches to animal science: the physiological approach and the whole animal approach. Physiologists focus on how the body functions, including how nerves, muscles, and senses work together to create complex behaviors. Those who take the whole animal approach study the behavior of animals in their natural state and the factors that influence this behavior. Within this approach, there are psychologists and ethologists. Psychologists often work in labs studying a limited number of species, like rats and pigeons, while ethologists study animals in the wild and their natural behaviors. Although these distinctions still exist, there is now a blending of the two fields. Physiologists often claim that their methods are more fundamental. However, understanding how nerve cells work does not eliminate the need to study behavior at a broader level. Behavior has its own structure and units that must be considered. Trying to explain a bird's nest-building behavior by only looking at individual nerve cells would be like trying to read a book with a microscope.
**The Social Sciences**  
Students studying social sciences for the first time face a dual challenge. They need to learn both the content of their new subject and the methods used to study it. This means they must understand not only the knowledge and research findings in textbooks but also the methods used to gather and organize this knowledge. These two aspects are closely connected. While we all have experience with social life, social sciences go beyond common sense. Each discipline focuses on specific aspects of social life, uses particular research methods, and has its own set of concepts. These basic ideas form the logical foundation of the subject, allowing social scientists to move beyond everyday understanding and differentiate one discipline from another.
**Classical Architecture**  
In the classical world of Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building structures. According to the Roman architect Vitruvius, architecture involves Order, Arrangement, Proportion, Symmetry, Propriety, and Distribution. He also provides Greek equivalents for some of these terms, likely based on earlier Greek sources that are now lost. While utility and function are not part of his initial definition, Vitruvius later discusses the best forms and arrangements for different types of buildings. At the start, the focus is on the artistic aspect of architecture. The origins of classical architecture are complex, with a long history of simple structures, like huts, in Greece and Italy that did not meet Vitruvius' artistic standards. Although these early structures may seem basic, they contributed important elements that influenced later architectural designs. Essentially, despite its elaborate appearance, the classical temple is rooted in the simplicity of a single-roomed hut."
CPE_7,C2,"The two sisters kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for a while. She would drive around the gardens and the railway line, jumping over a small bridge with all four wheels in the air, which was Lily's only mistake. After that, they would pass the gasworks, where there was a strong smell of sulphur. Chen, however, found it funny that his wife was driving without him knowing. ""So you can really drive, Lily? Well done!"" he said. Mui thought men were strange. Her brother-in-law should have been upset, but instead, he was excited and made plans with Lily for a trip. They decided to go on a Monday at the start of next month, the quietest day of the week, leaving early in the morning and returning by midday to avoid losing customers. In the meantime, Lily would practice driving. Despite her doubts, Mui bought a road map and got a ten percent discount, which impressed Chen, but Lily felt a bit insulted by Mui's lack of trust in her navigation skills.
Within an hour of leaving home, they were looking at the English Channel. Lily drove very well. Even Mui, who was in the back seat ready to give directions, had to admit this. On the road, Lily overtook a couple of slow cars with great skill, making Mui hold back her protests. Chen even applauded her. After passing the gasworks in the seaside town, they drove smoothly along the empty promenade. Lily parked in a small street off the seafront, where there were many empty parking spaces. She was unsure about the road markings and preferred to pay for parking rather than risk being towed or getting a ticket. Would this show Mui that she was being careful? 
On the way down, Lily noticed her sister's worried face in the driving mirror. She thought it might be best not to add to Mui's worries. Lily locked all the van doors and checked each one carefully. ""Don't worry,"" Chen joked. ""No one will want that old thing."" The sisters were annoyed. Lily accused Chen of being ungrateful, and Mui scolded him for being too quick to judge by appearances. Surprised, Chen took Man Kee ahead of the sisters to look at the grey sea. He lifted his son onto the railing and held him close. Man Kee was warm and responsive, placing his tiny hand on his father's sleeve. In that moment, Chen decided to raise his son his way. He wanted Man Kee to have a good education and to grow up owning many restaurants, learning all about the business along the way. The gloomy sea made Chen feel thoughtful as he planned Man Kee's future.
There was a trail of smoke on the horizon, and then, sparkling in the morning sun, he saw a ship. Chen put a coin in a telescope and tried to find the ship. At first, he couldn't see it, but then he spotted it—a large, rusty tramp steamer. He lifted Man Kee to the eyepiece. ""Do you see the ship, Son?"" he asked gently. ""It’s a special little ship for people like us. It may be small and old, but that’s just what strangers see. We know better, don’t we, Son? It will take us back home when we are done here. It will take you to your homeland, which you have never seen."" Chen kissed the top of Man Kee's head. Behind them, Lily and Mui were watching. Lily put her arm around Chen's shoulders. ""The little old ship,"" Chen said. ""Let your mother see, Son."" Man Kee didn’t want to let go of the telescope, and when he finally did, the whirring stopped, leaving Lily with just a blurry circle of light. By the time Chen found another coin, the ship had disappeared over the horizon, and Lily was left watching seagulls searching for food in the water."
CPE_43,C2,"**THE WELL**
I had read that if you dig a deep enough hole, you could see the stars on a clear day. I convinced you to help me with my plan. You watched, eyes wide, as I pulled up the well bucket, steadied it on the wall, and then climbed in. I told you to let me down. I didn’t think about how heavy the bucket was or that you might not be strong enough to hold it. You held the handle, trying to help as I pushed the bucket off the side of the well. As soon as it was free, I fell. You screamed and tried to stop it, but then you let go. I fell into the well and hit my head. At that moment, I didn’t realize I had achieved part of my plan. I saw strange lights, like the stars I usually saw in cartoons when a character got hurt. At first, I was dazed, then scared, then relieved, and finally angry at you for letting me fall and worried about what Mother would say. You called down to check if I was okay. I opened my mouth to shout, but then I heard panic in your voice, and I couldn’t speak. I lay still, just able to see you through my eyelashes. You disappeared, calling for help. I waited a moment, then climbed back up and pulled myself over the edge, landing on the courtyard stones. I heard alarmed voices coming from the castle's main door. I ran the other way, down to the passage leading to the moat bridge, and hid in the shadows. Mother and Father appeared with you and old Arthur; Mother was screaming, waving her hands. Father shouted for Arthur to pull on the winch handle. You stood back, looking pale and shocked. I was hidden in the shadows, feeling a rush of excitement. Then I noticed the drops of water I had left from the well to where I stood. I looked in horror at the dark spots of dirty water on the dry stones. At my feet, the water had formed a small pool. I looked back into the courtyard, where Father was shining a flashlight down into the well. The drops sparkled in the sunlight. I couldn’t believe no one had seen them. Mother was now screaming loudly, a sound I had never heard before. It shook me deeply. What should I do? I had gotten back at you, but what now? This had quickly become more serious than I expected, turning from a fun prank into something that would lead to serious punishment, likely for me. I regretted not thinking this through. In just a few minutes, my clever plan had turned into a disaster. Suddenly, a new idea came to me, like a lifeline to a drowning person. I gathered my courage and left my hiding place, staggering out and blinking. I called out softly, one hand on my forehead, then yelled louder when no one heard me. I stumbled a bit further and then fell dramatically on the stones. Sitting up, comforted by my crying mother, I sighed and said, ""Oh dear,"" smiling bravely. I claimed that I had found a secret tunnel from the bottom of the well to the moat, and crawled through it until I got out, climbed up the bridge, and walked through the passageway. I thought I was almost getting away with it until Father squatted in front of me. He made me repeat my story. I hesitated. His eyes narrowed. Thinking I was covering up a mistake, I said the secret passage had collapsed after me; there was no point in sending someone to look for it. I insisted the well was dangerous and that I had barely escaped with my life. Looking into my father's eyes felt like looking into a dark tunnel with no light at the end. It seemed like he was seeing me for the first time, and I was seeing how my lies would look to me when I was his age. My words got stuck in my throat. ""Don't be ridiculous, boy,"" he said, sounding more contemptuous than I thought possible. He stood up and walked away. Arthur looked down at me, his expression sad and troubled. He seemed to want to shake his head, not because I had a scary adventure and was unfairly disbelieved by my father, but because he could see through my sad lie and worried about my character and future. His pity felt like a harsh rebuke, confirming that this was the mature judgment of my actions and my father's, not something I could ignore. It affected me deeply."
CPE_51,C2,"**REMOVAL DAY**
Now that her children are grown, Susan, who is a widow, must leave her family home. The van had 'Removers of Distinction' written on it, and indeed, everything that made the house special was being taken away. Fred, the removal man, with his large fingers, carefully handled the fragile items, while his team was not as gentle. The house was beautiful, a four-story building overlooking a small harbor. The memories of her children growing up there lingered in the air, like dust. When they first bought the house, her son Robert, who was five at the time, had asked, ""Mum, how do you get a house home?"" It was easy to miss the little boy he used to be; now he was here, helping, especially making sure she didn’t forget about the piano. Francesca, her daughter, was also helping, insisting that only she could take care of the fine Steinway piano.
Fred commented, ""She doesn’t look like she’s going to cry."" Susan asked, ""Do people cry?"" Fred replied, ""You’d be surprised. They seem happy while packing, but then they cry in an empty room. They’re fine once they get to the new place; it’s just hard to see everything taken apart."" Susan understood that feeling. If it were up to her, she would have warned the movers about the piano before accepting their estimate. Robert insisted it was the movers' responsibility to notice any issues. The piano stood alone in the upstairs sitting room, the best room in the house. They would move it last.
Sitting on the bottom stair, with all the chairs gone, she remembered the day they moved in. Today felt like that day played in reverse—the piano had been the first thing brought in, and it got stuck on the stairs. The removal team struggled for nearly two hours, trying to get it up the stairs while little Robert watched in awe, and Francesca cried, ""We can’t live in a house without a piano!"" They had to find a way to get it inside, and Peter, her late husband, had solved the problem. The piano was left in the garden while the other furniture was moved in. The next day, a builder was hired to remove the first-floor window. A crane was borrowed from the quay below, and the piano was carefully lifted through the window while the children cheered with joy. However, it cost so much that it took months before they could afford to have it tuned.
""That’s that,"" Peter had said. ""That’s there forever."" But forever is a long time. The children were too busy to visit on weekends, and Susan found it harder to move around the house. The thought of the stairs interrupted her memories. The banister rails were still not perfectly aligned; she should have warned the movers about that. But now it was too late. Any moment now, they would discover it. She looked around, feeling dazed and anxious. ""Are you all right?"" Fred asked. ""Just the piano left, and then we’ll be on our way."" She stepped away from the stair, her heart racing. Robert and Francesca appeared in the hallway to watch. ""No tears then?"" Fred asked casually. Truthfully, she was close to tears. It was strange how moving things made them feel so important. Chairs, cups, and countless items that seemed unimportant while they were in place now felt full of emotion, begging to be cared for. She felt she might cry at any moment.
Just then, the piano appeared, being carefully brought down the stairs by Fred and another mover. ""Easy does it!"" Fred called out as they carried it smoothly out the front door and set it down behind the van. Robert was the first to laugh, and soon they were all laughing, relieved that it was over. They leaned against each other, gasping for breath and laughing uncontrollably. ""What’s the joke?"" Fred asked, but his question only made them laugh more. So, as they walked down the path for the last time, the only tears Susan shed were tears of laughter."
CPE_11,C2,"Online Literary Criticism for Everyone**
**Do-it-yourself literary criticism: Is it just harmless fun?**
From the beginning, one of the main ideas behind the Internet was open access. In theory, anyone could publish their thoughts or share music online. However, in the early days, some technical skills were needed. Still, there was one area that became truly accessible to everyone: literary criticism. By visiting Amazon.com, the first popular online bookstore, anyone could try writing book reviews. 
Amazon's approach to book reviews was simple: anyone could share their opinion and give a book up to five stars. Each book had its own page, and when a reader wrote a new review, it appeared automatically. This allowed Amazon to fill its site with free reviews, and potential buyers could see what other readers thought, rather than just relying on publisher descriptions or professional critics.
Other online bookstores, which also had physical stores, offered similar features. However, Amazon was the largest, controlling over 80% of the online market. This meant it had the most customers and received the most reviews, but it also faced many issues. With thousands of reviews submitted each day, it was impossible to check them all. Instead, a team of editors looked for reviews that followed the company's rules. For example, single-word reviews or personal attacks on authors were not allowed. Reviews that revealed the ending or referenced other reviews were also banned. However, since reviewers could remain anonymous, inappropriate reviews were only removed if Amazon's editors noticed them. This created opportunities for mischief.
For instance, there was nothing stopping authors from writing positive reviews of their own books. One author, Lev Grossman, was upset by the negative reviews of his first novel, so he wrote several anonymous positive reviews to balance things out. His trick worked until he wrote an article about it, and then the fake reviews were removed.
Authors had a way to share their thoughts too, by clicking a link that said, ""I am the Author, and I wish to comment on my book."" Most authors used this feature to encourage readers to buy and enjoy their books. Some even shared their email addresses for direct communication. However, while Amazon checked these messages, it did not verify that they were really from the authors. This was different for well-known authors. A lesser-known writer once submitted a comment pretending to be famous author John Updike, claiming to be an ""over-hyped middlebrow author."" Unsurprisingly, it was removed as a fake.
The real drama began with reader reviews, not author comments. When James McElroy's book, *We've Got Spirit*, about a small-town cheerleading team, was published, it received good reviews from the mainstream press. However, many people mentioned in the book felt hurt, and they used Amazon to express their anger. Many critical reviews appeared but disappeared a few days later. Despite this, Amazon saw the large number of people writing and reading reviews as good for business. 
Amazon wanted reviews to be a place to discuss books, not just a chat room. Therefore, they paid special attention to bestselling books to ensure all reviews followed the rules. This meant that silly reviews were more likely to appear on pages for less popular books. For example, *The Story about Ping*, a classic children's book about a duck, inspired some humorous reviews because ""ping"" is also a term used in Internet technology. One long review compared the book's plot to Internet architecture, claiming it provided a ""good overview"" of networking concepts. However, such silliness was rare.
Most reader reviews on Amazon were taken very seriously. Overall, these reviews gave a surprisingly accurate idea of whether a product was worth buying. The writer George Orwell once said that reviewing too many books meant constantly pretending to have feelings about books he didn’t care about. This makes the open access to writing reviews a positive development."
CPE_14,C2,"Art in Modern Times**
In recent years, especially over the last two hundred years, we often think that every artist must go against the art of their time. Art is celebrated for being unique, revolutionary, and sometimes shocking. We enjoy admiring artists whose work was not valued a hundred years ago. However, when it comes to contemporary art, we often hesitate and claim that some artists have gone too far, suggesting that their work is no longer art. The media often expresses these views for us, and we tend to agree because we expect art to always be new and puzzling. This expectation makes us overlook the old themes, methods, and qualities that are still present in today’s art. We want artists to be different from us, with special talents and energy that break free from traditional norms. In the past, people commissioned artists for specific purposes, and art was part of everyday life. Today, we leave artists to work on their own and often get frustrated if they try to connect with us.
**Picture This**
I will describe a situation and then ask an important question about it. I hope it makes sense. Here’s the situation: An artist picks a piece of text from an art book. The text talks about the variety of pictures and asks, “What are they all about?” It then concludes, “There is no end to the different kinds of pictures.” This language seems childish, and it reflects simple thinking. But stay with me. After choosing his text, the artist asks someone to prepare a canvas for him and then to take it to a sign painter. He instructs the sign painter to write the chosen text on the canvas in a simple way, without any fancy designs. The sign painter follows these instructions and writes the text in plain black letters on a white canvas. My important question is: Is this finished piece a painting?
**Underground Encounters**
At the Mercury Gallery in London until June 26, there is an unspoken rule for painters: once you find a successful style, you should stick to it. Collectors expect artists to keep producing similar work, and if they try something new, it often leads to disappointment among the public. I’m not sure why this is the case. Gallery owners prefer safe choices, and perhaps art buyers feel more secure with familiar styles. However, some artists break this pattern and succeed. Picasso and Hockney are two well-known examples. Eric Rimmington is another artist who is now trying something different, and it will be interesting to see if he succeeds. His new exhibition replaces the still lifes that made him famous with paintings inspired by the London Underground. Rimmington finds a unique charm in railways. His sketches from the 1980s of Kings Cross Station led him to explore what happens underground. These sketches have become the basis for ""Underground Encounters,"" an exhibition of 40 paintings and drawings that capture the fascinating world beneath the city, designed for people in transit.
**Extract from a Novel**
I have come to this island with a few books. I’m not sure why I use the word “escape.” The villagers joke that only a sick person would choose such a remote place to recover. So, I have come here to heal myself, if you want to see it that way. Besides an old peasant who comes daily on her mule to clean my house, I am quite alone. I feel neither happy nor sad; I am suspended in a mix of memories. I mentioned the uselessness of art but did not speak about its comforts. The comfort of my work, both mental and emotional, lies in the fact that only in the quiet moments of a painter or writer can reality be reshaped and shown in a meaningful way. Our everyday actions are like a rough covering that hides the true beauty underneath. For us artists, art offers a joyful way to deal with the pain or struggles we face in daily life. This allows us not to escape our fate, as ordinary people might try to do, but to realize its true potential through imagination. Otherwise, why should we hurt one another?"
CPE_63,C2,"**Family Business**
""Look, this isn't good!"" said my Dad. We were in the car heading back to London. My father, with my brother Maurice beside him, had just picked me up and my trunk from the fancy girls' school I attended. He had also just been to Parent's Day, where I received the Latin prize and the award for the best end-of-school exams. He had a long talk with my headteacher, and now we were on our way home for the holidays.
""What isn't?"" I asked, though I had a feeling I knew what he was thinking because he was unusually quiet. Normally, he talked a lot. ""You can't fool me. You'll do what you want now,"" he said. ""With all those certificates, I heard you will get a scholarship to Oxford."" 
""So?"" I replied, trying to act tough. ""Mightn't that be useful?"" 
""I also understand,"" he continued, and I knew a confrontation was coming, ""that you want to be a barrister. A barrister!"" My father knew a lot about barristers and the law. 
""I just said that,"" I replied. ""I couldn't think of anything else!"" 
""And apparently,"" he went on, ""you have the right personality - you can quickly understand complex information, you are good at speaking, and you enjoy performing."" 
""I don't know about that,"" I said. ""All I know is what I see on TV."" 
""Regardless,"" he said, gathering himself, ""I feel like your heart won't be in the family business. Obviously, you'll go to Oxford University, and after that, I can't see you wanting to join us."" 
The problem was that, like many children of family businesses, I felt trapped by my family's expectations. I could see many career options, and I wanted to explore them. At the same time, I didn't want to upset my father. I wasn't as scared of him as Maurice was - I was the favorite - but I still found him intimidating. 
""It's too soon to know,"" I said weakly. 
""I tell you, you're not going to want to join us,"" said my father, who often turned out to be right about such things. ""It's a shame because you have the talent - the intelligence, the courage, the vision."" 
""There's still Maurice,"" I said, feeling down. My father scoffed. We both knew Maurice disliked the business. 
""Anyway,"" I continued, ""you could always use me as a consultant."" My mother had passed away when I was young, and my father had raised me and Maurice. Maurice was two years younger than me, and since he was motherless, I had taken care of him from an early age. It wasn't hard; I loved Maurice. 
Because the business was successful, we lived comfortably - in a big house in London, attended nice schools, wore good clothes, and enjoyed parties, theaters, and operas. My father knew many people - politicians, actors, businessmen - and our home was full of interesting conversations. 
""I tell you what,"" my father continued. ""You can help us during the holidays until you leave Oxford, and then if you decide to leave us, you can. It will give you some pocket money and really help me."" 
""Okay,"" I said, relieved to avoid immediate choices and especially the sadness my father would feel if I disagreed with him. This was how he controlled us. 
So it happened. In my last term at school and during university breaks, I helped out, never more than twice a year, and always with the easier tasks. I became one of the top students, with a small house, a nice white car, designer clothes, and a black dress from Paris that I planned to wear for my final exams. 
In my last term, my father came to see me and took me to a village for a meal and a chat. There were only a few weeks left. My tutor predicted I would get a First Class degree in Law, and I knew that if I focused and organized my thoughts, he might be right. I felt ready, confident, and focused. 
But then my father told me that in about a week, he needed me to do one last important task for him, the biggest project the family business had ever attempted, and he promised it would be worth my while. 
""But Dad,"" I protested, ""I have my final exams coming up, and I need to focus on that. It's really important that I do well, and I don't want to think about anything else right now."" 
I could tell that my father couldn't understand the pressure I was under (or maybe he was jealous of my life away from him), and he would see my refusal as a betrayal in his time of need. As he explained the task, I saw more clearly than ever his determination - the clarity and resourcefulness with which he approached his work, his energy, and his self-control. In his way, he was a genius, and I respected that in him. It made my own plans seem less important. 
""All right,"" I said. ""I'll do it."""
CPE_56,C2,"Simon Costello realized that buying the house in Pembroke Square was a mistake within a year of moving in with Lois. A possession that requires strict budgeting is often not worth having at all. At the time, however, it seemed like a sensible and desirable choice. He had been successful in his work, and cases were coming in regularly. Lois returned to her job at the advertising agency just two months after giving birth to their twins and received a raise that brought her salary to thirty-five thousand. She had strongly pushed for the move, and Simon had not resisted her arguments, which seemed convincing at the time: their flat was not suitable for a family, they needed more space, a garden, and separate accommodation for an au pair. These needs could have been met in a suburb or a less trendy part of London, but Lois wanted more than just extra space. Mornington Mansions was not a suitable address for a rising barrister and a successful businesswoman. Even saying the name made her feel that it lowered her social and economic status. Lois decided that one of them should save money by using public transport, and since her firm was on the other side of London, Simon had to be the one to cut costs. The crowded tube ride became a frustrating thirty minutes of brooding over his dissatisfaction. He remembered his grandfather's house in Hampstead, the smell of dinner, and his grandmother's insistence that the tired breadwinner should be given peace and comfort after a long day in court. She had been a supportive 'lawyer's wife', active in legal causes and present at all lawyer events, seemingly happy in her role. But that world was gone. Lois had made it clear before they married that her career was just as important as his. This was a modern marriage, and both their jobs were crucial for their lifestyle. Their whole way of living depended on two incomes. Now, what they had worked hard to achieve was at risk because of Venetia, who had come to their office in a bad mood. Something had upset her, and she confronted Simon with intense anger. He cursed himself for not leaving his room earlier; if he had, the confrontation might not have happened, and she could have had time to think things over. He remembered her angry accusations clearly. ""I defended Brian Cartwright today. He told me that when you were his lawyer four years ago, you knew he had bribed three jurors before the trial. You did nothing. Is that true?"" ""He's lying. That's not true."" ""He also said he gave shares in his company to your fiancée before the trial. Is that true?"" ""I tell you, he's lying. None of it is true."" His denial felt instinctive, like raising an arm to block a blow, but it sounded unconvincing even to him. He felt guilty, and the cold horror on his face was replaced by a hot flush, bringing back memories of being punished in school. He looked into her eyes and saw her contempt. If only he had been warned. He now knew what he should have said: ""Cartwright told me after the trial, but I didn't believe him. I still don't believe him. That man will say anything to make himself look important."" Instead, he had told a more direct and dangerous lie, and she knew it was a lie. But why was she so angry? What did his past actions have to do with her? Who had made Venetia the judge of their legal practice? Was her own conscience so clear? Was she right to threaten his career? He wasn't sure what she could do or how far she would go, but if this rumor spread, it could ruin him."
CPE_36,C2,"'I chose this place to live because I thought I would be anonymous among people who didn’t mind if their rented houses were falling apart or if their gardens were messy. I was wrong. The shopkeepers, who are living their real lives, soon start to recognize you, even if you don’t know them. The beautiful roses from next door remind me that gardens were once cared for. Usually, I stay inside to forget about the summer outside, but tonight, I am watching the swifts flying between the trees and roofs. I have trimmed the rosemary and lemon balm to make space for a chair, and my arms are tingling from the scratches. It is a small London garden, where plants must grow tall or spread out to survive. 
“Been doing some clearing, I see,” says my upstairs neighbor, Jaz, leaning out of her window. She has written several unpublished manuscripts, and I sometimes have to pretend to know about them as an English teacher. I have her latest manuscript with me now. “How’s the work going, Jaz?” I ask. “For goodness sake. In no other job do people ask you about your work so many times a day,” she replies, her voice trailing off before she continues, “I have something to drink in the fridge. I’ll bring it down.” I don’t want Jaz in the garden, and I realize it looks messy and sad. The only way to access this garden is through my flat, and Jaz is knocking on my door. 
“So, you’re on holiday now, you lucky person,” she says, sitting in shorts and a tank top on the chair while I drop a cushion onto what used to be a small lawn. “Cheers,” she says, acting young. “I should’ve gone into teaching – a writer doesn’t have holidays. But you know what they say, those who can, do; those who can’t, teach.” And then there are those who can do neither. “So, what are your plans for the holidays?” All my worries about the end of the school year come rushing back. Empty days. Hot sidewalks covered in melting gum. The walk to the shops and back. The little park with its fountain, and loneliness sitting beside me on the bench. 
“Actually, I’m going to Stonebridge tomorrow. I need to ask if you could feed the cats.” My heart races as I say this. “Of course I will,” Jaz replies, knowing she will be around. “Where will you stay? A fancy bed and breakfast?” “No, I’ll be staying with my oldest friend, Ruby, at the Rising Sun. We’ve known each other since we were eight.” This isn’t true, but I often deal with fiction. “Going back to your roots. So what do you think of my work so far?” My silence makes Jaz ask about her manuscript, The Cruelty of Red Vans, which is half-read on my desk. I like the title and tell her so. I can see how red vans could be cruel, always bringing gifts to other houses and returning her manuscripts in silly bags. 
Something makes me speak honestly for once. “Let me give you a little tip,” I say. “What?” she asks, looking offended. “Try writing about nice people for a change, people who want to be good: a little less self-centeredness, a bit more fiction…” “Teachers!” Jaz replies, like a rebellious student about to take back a poorly graded paper. “I keep a journal, I have for years, where I write something good, no matter how small, about each day.” My words sound as old-fashioned as my dress. “Keep a journal! Nice people! Get a life, Ann.” Oh, I have a life. I have my work, and I go out sometimes and read on the tube. When we finally go inside, my calm kitchen gives me a moment of comfort, but suddenly I remember my school geography teacher, Miss Tarrantine, who was about my age now, closing one eye in a strange wink as she told us, “I’ve had my moments.” We nearly died laughing.'"
CPE_6,C2,"**Heritage**
Heritage is important because it connects people and communities to their past. We often feel connected to our personal heritage, knowing about our grandparents and hearing stories about their lives. However, there is also a broader need to understand our history to help us shape our individual and national futures. Heritage represents a desire for continuity; knowing about the past helps us feel secure about the future. Just as we inherit our genes, we also inherit a culture passed down through generations. There may be parts of our national heritage that we do not like, but it is still a part of us, and it is comforting to feel connected to something larger. Heritage teaches us a lot and is essential for our well-being, influencing everything from traditions to material culture. Traditionally, we learned about the past through stories and legends from our ancestors. However, in modern Western society, many of these oral traditions have been lost due to the breakdown of communities and families. Now, we often rely on places and historical buildings to understand our past. It is crucial to preserve and restore these connections as a tribute to our ancestors' identities.
**The Fens**
Some time ago, I started writing a novel called *Waterland*, where the landscape of a region in England known as the Fens became very important. After the book was published, people often asked why I, a Londoner with no personal ties to the area, chose to write about it. The simple answer is that I found the Fens interesting because they seemed like a flat and empty backdrop for my story. However, I soon realized that the Fens are not flat or empty at all. They are uniquely English yet also strangely captivating. It is surprising that in the heart of England, there is a place that many English people find unfamiliar, especially since many other distinct areas of Britain have become part of the national culture. The Fens are both empty and full, cultivated yet wild, seemingly simple but deeply mysterious. My own research while writing was not extensive; I have never visited Wisbech or Prickwillow. As a fiction writer, I prefer to imagine worlds rather than seek strict evidence. However, trying to ""imagine"" the Fens has its own logic, as shown in Edward Storey's scholarly work, which suggests that the Fens are not just a landscape but also a state of mind.
**Museums**
Museums need to make their collections easy to access. In the past, this meant simply putting items in display cases with long labels that were hard for the average person to understand. Today, accessibility should involve more than that. Displays can be engaging and use creative techniques to attract visitors and evoke emotions. However, museums should be about more than just displays; they should reach out to the widest community possible. For example, some museums provide loan boxes of objects for teachers, and recently, similar materials have been made available for elderly people with memory loss. Museums focus on real artefacts and specimens, not replicas. They exist to provide an authentic experience, showcasing items that have historical significance. This authenticity is what sets them apart from heritage centers, theme parks, books, and digital media. Museums that embrace this challenge and offer exciting displays and outreach programs will find that their competitors in ""virtual history"" can actually help create a desire for the real experiences that only museums can provide.
**Architecture and Environment**
The desire to preserve things is not new, but changes in our towns happen so quickly and on such a large scale that they affect most of us. This can make some people very protective of what they want to preserve, while others may think more deeply about the nature of our towns and their future. It can be argued that people who have lived through significant events, like world wars, are more inclined to value preservation than previous generations, as anything that represents stability becomes important. If there is a psychological need for preservation, planners must consider it. Change is not necessarily bad if we learn how to manage it. Physical changes in our towns reflect social changes, such as population growth, welfare, and our needs."
CPE_33,C2,"Einstein**
If you stop someone on the street and ask them to name a scientist, they will likely say Albert Einstein. His image is often used to sell products that seem smart, like computers and encyclopedias. Most people know little about what Einstein actually did, except that he created some complex theories called 'relativity', which are known for being hard to understand and for making strange predictions that go against common experience. Einstein was part of a major change in scientific thought, a revolution that led to the development of modern science in the twentieth century. Physicists and mathematicians were trying to create a new, clearer description of the universe by studying how matter and natural forces interact. Einstein made significant contributions by rethinking the basics: time, space, matter, and energy. Earlier ideas were based on Isaac Newton's view of a universe where stars and planets moved in a fixed space and time. Einstein changed this idea, saying that time and space are not fixed but relative.
**Young Readers**
As children, Lydia and I often distrusted any book that won awards because we thought it would be boring. Our mother disapproved of our attitude, while our father would give us small coins as rewards to encourage us to read better books. He sometimes included a few good books in our Christmas and birthday gifts, marked with a note saying, 'This Book is NOT Literature'. Although we often dismissed his choices as 'boys' books', he did introduce us to some shorter works of good fiction and, once, to a famous collection of poetry.
**Language**
Jacob Grimm wrote in 1851, 'The origin of human language is truly secret and marvellous.' This mystery has led to many strange ideas. For example, Charles Caller suggested in 1928 that early humans made sounds like ""meuh"" when they sensed danger. This sound is sad. The early human who traveled through dangerous lands made desperate noises, and some words have kept a trace of this, like 'malaria', which means ""fever"", or the Latin word 'mors', which means ""death"". Many people avoided discussing the origin of language, thinking it was a topic for odd theories, but recently, the study of how language began and evolved has become very important. Language likely developed in East Africa about 100,000 years ago. Initially, speech was mainly used for friendly communication and was a key tool in struggles for power. Sharing information was probably not the main purpose of early language, which goes against the ideas of philosopher John Locke, who described language as a 'great conduit' for sharing knowledge."
CPE_20,C2,"Writing Reviews**
Frank Kermode discusses the art of writing reviews from the perspective of someone who practices it. Most reviews are created and shared in ways that limit their lifespan. They often have strict deadlines and length restrictions, and once published, they are only relevant for a short time—usually a day, a week, or at most a month. The temporary nature of reviews often affects how they are viewed. Many people, including writers, believe that reviewing is not a desirable job and is often done out of necessity, such as needing money or because writers cannot spend all their time on a novel or serious book.
However, writing reviews is a skilled and complex task. Writing a concise review of six to eight hundred words for a newspaper is different from writing a detailed review of six to eight thousand words for an international journal. The length of the review is not the only factor to consider. Reviewers must think about their audience, which can range from casual readers to those deeply interested in the subject.
A good reviewer needs to have knowledge about various topics and must write in a way that is clear and enjoyable for intelligent readers. It is common for reviewers to also write other types of work. For example, American novelist John Updike, who is not particularly fond of criticism, still writes reviews between his novel projects. He collects all his reviews, no matter how short, into books with modest titles. 
Some might think that less prominent writers should accept the temporary nature of their reviews, but it is understandable if they want their work to have some lasting value, especially if they feel their best writing is found in reviews. I share this sentiment about my own work. My main focus has been academic writing, and my serious books are typically academic in nature, which is what professors are expected to produce.
In the English-speaking world, there is no strict separation between reviewing and literary study, unlike in some other cultures. It is common for the same individuals to engage in both activities. The days when academics criticized their peers for writing reviews are mostly over. Complaints from non-professors about professors taking opportunities away from them are also less frequent, partly because there are more reviewing opportunities now, and partly because the rewards are often minimal.
I believe this situation benefits both readers and professors. Readers can trust that reviewers have some expertise, and for professors, reviewing helps maintain their sanity. It also serves as a reminder that they should communicate clearly with non-professors. While they may feel the need to use complex language among themselves, they must ensure they are understandable when addressing a broader audience. Ultimately, reviewing is a secondary activity; it is something that can only be done well if one is also engaged in other work effectively."
CPE_40,C2,"Ralph unlocked the door to his apartment and, as he stepped into the dark, still hallway, he felt a brief sense of ownership that still surprised him after three years of living there. When he first bought the flat, he would come home excited and curious, wondering what had happened while he was away. The flat felt like a welcoming place, a space where he could focus without distractions. He thought he should worry about possible intruders or broken pipes, but his flat always seemed to be waiting for him, either looking independent or neglected, depending on how tidy he had left it.
Over time, he began to see it as an extension of himself, a place where his thoughts and feelings spilled out. He grew frustrated with its inability to change. There were always a few letters piled up by the door and the answering machine sometimes blinked with messages when he returned. He was thankful that his windows were intact and that nothing had been stolen, though he often wondered what the flat would look like if something bad happened.
From his dull office on the third floor, Ralph looked forward to his quiet evenings at home. After leaving the busy office and starting his bus ride home, he realized he didn’t want to be alone anymore, even though he often thought he did. Sitting at his desk, he craved solitude and time to himself, but once he escaped, he felt empty and lost. He suspected that the work he did, which didn’t suit him, had changed him, moving him away from who he thought he was.
He would read or listen to music at night, but he began to wonder for whom or what he was doing these things. His sense of direction in life had faded, and his thoughts would come and go without making sense. He remembered a time when he felt more in control, when he might have recognized his own worth and found a way out of his situation. But he had been so eager to find something that he had followed the first opportunity that came his way, as if it was meant to be.
After university, he had tried to make a plan for a better life, but when he looked for ambition, he only found a quiet wish to get by. He applied for jobs he had heard about from friends, trailing behind them as they rushed toward their goals, unable to see how he could find happiness in his work. He went to one job interview, grateful for the chance, but didn’t think to evaluate the job itself—a vague editorial position at a local free newspaper. After a pleasant conversation with Neil, his future boss, he didn’t consider the long-term implications of the job. Neil offered him the position on the spot, saying he was the only graduate who had applied, which Ralph took as a compliment at the time."
CPE_45,C2,"**Goat Racing**
I was about to see goat racing on Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. I pushed my way through ice-cream vans, large crowds, food stalls, and loud music. Although everyone was moving towards the racecourse, I tried to find a good spot to watch. An area was blocked off to create a course for the goats. It wasn’t as fancy as regular racecourses, but the idea was similar: spectators lined both sides of a stretch of ground where the goats would run. Keeping a few selected goats in line was not easy, especially since goats are known for eating almost anything they find.
**Canoe Trip**
As the day ended, I began to worry about the night ahead. The canoe was too wet to sleep in, there was nowhere to stop, and we hadn’t seen any villages or huts since early morning. In the dim moonlight, we could barely see the cliffs. Our torch batteries were dying, so we replaced them, but the new ones didn’t work. Clearly, we wouldn’t be able to find a place to camp. A few miles later, Lesley shouted that she saw a distant flickering light, and we felt hopeful. However, the light turned out to be moonlight reflecting on the waves. Soon, we could hear the loud sound of rushing water, but we couldn’t see what was happening. Time seemed to stop as we continued on.
**How to be Presentation Perfect**
I am not naturally good at making presentations, but as managing director, I often need to present to my colleagues and major shareholders. How can I improve my presentation skills and confidence? You are not alone. Giving a presentation requires different skills than running a company, yet many senior executives are expected to be good at it. If you want to convince your audience, you must believe in what you are saying. Show your belief through the passion and enthusiasm you bring to your presentation. This means you need to prepare well. Test your ideas beforehand and ask colleagues to help identify the tough questions your audience might ask. You should also create a positive atmosphere from the start. Begin with something everyone can relate to and gradually lead to the conclusion you want to reach."
CPE_64,C2,"
Some activities cannot be rushed; they take the time they need. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you are impatient with mayonnaise and add the oil too quickly, it will curdle. If you pull on a tangled fishing line in frustration, the knot will only get tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some functions happen very quickly, while others take seconds, minutes, hours, days, or even years. Some tasks can be sped up, like solving crossword puzzles or doing math in your head. However, others cannot be rushed, and if you try, they may fail, like the mayonnaise or the fishing line.
The idea of ""Think fast; we need results"" can sometimes be as unhelpful as trying to shorten a night's sleep. We learn, think, and understand in various ways, and these different modes of thinking work at different speeds and are suited for different tasks. There are sayings like ""He who hesitates is lost"" and ""Look before you leap,"" and both have truth in them.
Generally, the mind has three different processing speeds. The first is faster than thought. Some situations require an immediate, instinctive reaction. For example, when my motorbike skidded on a wet road in London, my body and brain quickly coordinated movements to keep me safe, and only afterward did my conscious mind catch up. A concert pianist or an Olympic fencer also does not have time to think about their next move. This quick physical intelligence can be called our ""wits.""
Next is thought itself, which involves reasoning, weighing options, and solving problems. A mechanic figuring out why an engine won’t start, a scientist interpreting an experiment, or a student working on an assignment are all using this logical thinking, often referred to as ""intellect."" People who excel at these tasks are often called ""bright"" or ""clever.""
Finally, there is a slower mental process that is less focused and more relaxed. In this mode, we reflect or daydream. When we are at the beach, listening to the waves, or just on the edge of sleep, we are in a different mental state than when we are planning a meal or writing a letter. This slower, seemingly aimless way of thinking is just as valuable as the faster types. Allowing the mind to wander is not a luxury; it is essential, especially when life gets busy. We need both the ""tortoise mind"" and the ""hare brain.""
Some everyday problems are better approached with a slow mind. Certain mysteries can only be understood with a relaxed attitude. Recent studies show that patient, less deliberate thinking is especially good for understanding complex situations. Deliberate thinking works well for clear problems. For example, deciding where to go on holiday may have obvious factors. But when the situation is unclear or complex, we need the tortoise mind. 
If the issue is how to manage a difficult team at work or whether to change careers, it may be wiser to sit and think rather than rush for answers. This type of intelligence is linked to creativity and wisdom. Poets have long recognized the limits of conscious thinking and have tried to nurture these slower ways of knowing. Philosophers have discussed the parts of the mind that go beyond conscious thought. Recently, scientists have begun to study these slower, less deliberate ways of knowing. The field of cognitive science is showing that the unconscious mind can accomplish many interesting and important tasks if given time. It can recognize patterns that conscious thought cannot see, make sense of complex situations, and solve difficult problems more effectively than quick thinking."
CPE_29,C2,"Surviving in a Foreign Land**
I have been welcomed warmly. It’s a friendly and well-equipped base camp in a very isolated area. At any time, there are about forty people—scientists, students, weather experts, satellite trackers—in a close community where everyone helps out. My basic French is just enough to communicate, but not to have casual conversations. I miss the subtleties of the language, and my phrasebook is not helpful at breakfast. This isn’t a practical problem for me, but at first, I struggled with self-confidence. I found myself a bit anxious about mealtimes. I would hesitate, worried about which table to choose, scared of the silence that followed when I spoke, and feeling anxious in a way I haven’t felt since my early school days. I still smile awkwardly or feel nervous when people talk to me. I think this occasional sadness is not about missing company or communication; it’s because I’ve lost the social confidence that my ability to talk easily has always given me.
**Elliot**
When I first met Elliot, I was just a young author like many others, and he didn’t pay much attention to me. He always remembered faces, though, and when I saw him here and there, he would shake my hand politely but didn’t seem interested in getting to know me better. If I saw him at the opera, for example, he would often ignore me if he was with someone important. But then I had a surprising success as a playwright, and I noticed that Elliot started to look at me more warmly. One day, I got a note from him inviting me to lunch, and I thought he was testing me. After that, since my success brought me many new friends, I began to see him more often.
**Alfred Hitchcock**
The film director Alfred Hitchcock always said that he didn’t care about the story of his films or the acting, but he did care about the visuals and the sound. For Hitchcock, it wasn’t a message that moved the audience, nor was it a great performance; he believed that people respond to pure film, regardless of their cultural background. So, if a film is made well in terms of its emotional effect, the Japanese audience should react at the same time as the Indian audience. Hitchcock’s self-assessment was always clear and logical; he was a reasonable man and a brilliant craftsman who enjoyed hearing an audience react. He didn’t focus on speculation, abstract ideas, or intellectual references, and his view of his own characters was straightforward. He concentrated on film—pure film—and the most objective, measurable beauty of what a film can do to an audience."
CPE_57,C2,"Amateur Astronomy**
Many things have changed in astronomy over the last fifty years. Until about thirty years ago, there were not many charts and catalogues available. Telescopes were limited, and there were few books on practical astronomy. Today, there is a wide variety of telescopes and equipment available for everyone. Electronic calculators and computers have changed how almanacs and charts are made, and they have made it easier to analyze observations and publish results. This could be seen as the golden age of amateur astronomy. However, a lot has also been lost. Now, you may have to travel 80 kilometers to find a dark sky, which was easier to find in urban areas fifty years ago. Daytime skies are now often filled with airplane trails that can last for hours and spread out into clouds, making it hard to observe the sun and stars at night.
**Too Much Choice**
Society is becoming overwhelmed by choices. There are too many things to do, too many options, and too many opportunities. In today’s economy, the desire for new products and services has become an addiction, and technology speeds up the pace of change. The constant noise and the flood of new goods and services create more choices. Just as a new product is released, another one is ready to launch. This can be overwhelming and tiring, leading to a feeling of disconnection from life. While choice is celebrated in the new economy, having more choices can lead to more stress, less time, and more complexity. As a result, people are looking for 'simplexity'—the simple things that bring meaning in a complicated world. However, simplifying life is not easy in a time of excess. There are more basic brands of detergent and breakfast cereals than we need, and more software updates and plans than we can keep track of.
**McAndrews Hotel**
Every summer, we spend two weeks at McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. This is a family tradition started by my grandmother, and it has become very important to us. Nothing is allowed to disrupt this ritual. We are a specific type of guest at McAndrews: old-fashioned and perhaps a bit snobbish. I dislike the bad manners and rudeness of shop assistants that some people see as equality; I do not appreciate the overly friendly behavior of waiters who seem to struggle to keep from being too familiar. I know the names of most of the other guests—like me, they have been coming here since childhood—but I can be sure that when I see them in the hotel, we will only exchange polite greetings. This respect for dignity and personal space is hard to find in commercial places today."
CPE_9,C2,"**Text:**
**Othello**  
The move of a remarkable production of Shakespeare's play *Othello* from Stratford to London gives me a chance to correct an unfair review I wrote when the show first opened last spring. At that time, I said that Ray Fearon was too young for the title role and I criticized his acting. I still believe it changes the tragedy to ignore the age difference between Othello and Desdemona, but I take back my comments about Mr. Fearon's outstanding performance. The entire cast is excellent. Memorable scenes include the one where Cassio's competitive games with other young officers become dangerous, and the moment when Iago starts to lose control and struggles to regain it. I challenge anyone not to be moved to tears during the scene where Emilia helps Desdemona get ready for bed. The pace and tension throughout the play are fantastic. Do not miss this production.
**Lake Vostok**  
In the center of Antarctica, there is nothing alive. On the edges of the continent, there are many penguins, seals, and birds. But in the vast white area in the middle, life cannot survive. However, there is a large hidden body of freshwater called Lake Vostok, which is under nearly 4 kilometers of ice, directly beneath the coldest place on Earth. The water has been cut off from air and sunlight for up to 25 million years. Biologists are eager to explore its mysterious depths and find out what strange organisms might be there. Geologists and glaciologists are also interested. For two years, researchers around the world have been planning ways to uncover the lake's secrets, and if they succeed, we will soon see a lot of discoveries about Lake Vostok.
**Scientists**  
Last week, I heard something interesting on the radio. A group of scientists is discussing what motivates them to be scientists; the phrase ""because it's there"" comes to mind. We all know it is the long-standing quest for knowledge, the wish to understand everything from atoms to black holes. But these scientists want to know why we have this desire for knowledge and why science cannot explain this desire. I think it is more important to know if what we scientists are doing is right, rather than getting stuck in debates about the purpose of it all. I believe the key issue is not why we pursue science, but to understand that science is a tool, and we should decide how, where, when, and why to use it."

**Food**  
Our relationship with food is very basic and fulfilling. Many people who enjoy cooking buy cookbooks like this one. However, we often think that cooking is only worth it for special occasions or complicated dishes. This is not true. By simply chopping some carrots, a leek, celery, and herbs and boiling them in water, you can make a delicious soup. This is much more satisfying than buying a pre-packaged soup. Instead of purchasing a sweet chocolate mousse filled with preservatives, you can quickly make a tasty dessert that both adults and children will enjoy. Cooking is also a way to show care and love by sharing your own creations, no matter how simple. Sharing food symbolizes our basic human needs, which is why we celebrate events like birthdays and anniversaries around tables. No one would choose to have takeout for a wedding or anniversary party, nor would many people want to discuss a business deal over canned soup.
**In the Elevator**  
This morning, Alistair tried to tidy up his office, but papers were still everywhere. Tax forms were overflowing from drawers and boxes, waiting for a day when he felt like organizing them. He also had a lot of paperwork from owning an apartment building. The many books and journals were only near the new bookshelves. As the elevator took him closer to his floor, he knew Mallory would arrive on time for their meeting. She would knock on his office door exactly on the hour. She was very punctual and neat. How would she react to the mess? She might think someone had broken in. He could walk in behind her and pretend to be shocked. Mrs. Wilson, his cleaning lady, had come while he was trying to clear some space on the floor. When he peeked out of his office as she was unlocking his apartment, he smiled at her, hoping for a good response. But her expression was cold. She seemed to think there was no way she would go into his messy office, which was not her responsibility. He knew Mrs. Wilson saw him as someone from a different world, not part of her familiar Brooklyn neighborhood.
**KAREN**  
Karen had a simple wish: not to be like her mother. This desire led her to create her own story, one of strength and difference. In her story, there were important moments, like when she was twelve and her brother accidentally hit her in the eye with a golf club. At first, she thought she would go blind, but the bone protected her, as the doctor later confirmed. The club had missed her eye, and she only needed a few stitches that healed over time. When she opened her eyes in the doctor's office and saw her mother there, complaining about both miracles and small mercies, she felt she was saved for a reason.
**Miss Fogerty**  
Miss Fogerty was hurrying back to her work across the wet grass of the village green. She felt both excited and sad about what she had just seen. It is always thrilling to be the first to know something important, especially in a small community, where her life was usually quiet. However, she was deeply saddened by Dr. Bailey's condition. He had been her doctor for many years, and she appreciated his care during her yearly throat problems, which were her only health issues. Miss Fogerty valued his ability to make patients feel like there was always enough time to talk and that he genuinely wanted to hear about their worries. This quality made him very loved in the village. He was always willing to share his time, knowledge, and humor, and in return, he received great loyalty and affection from the community."
CPE_59,C2,"**Joanna's Lessons**
Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist. So why has she decided to write books for young children learning the piano? Even someone who cannot hear music well would be moved by her performances. Watching her play the piano, quickly moving her hands across the keys, is like seeing a musician push their abilities to the limit. However, at a recent concert for children, even her amazing skills were not enough to impress one small boy. Like the other kids, he had seen her play many different styles of music from her large collection, including classical, jazz, and blues. He watched as she did something surprising, reaching inside the piano to pluck the strings, which usually excites children. But when she asked if anyone had questions, he simply asked, ""Can you play Match of the Day?"" Many experienced musicians would be caught off guard by such a request, but for Joanna, it was funny. She realized that until she played that tune, the boy did not think she was a real pianist. Of course, she played it and likely remembered this moment for her next children's concert.
Joanna is unique among top concert pianists because she cares about how young children learn to play. She has just published her own beginner piano book for children called *Joanna MacGregor's Piano World*. She accomplished this despite her busy schedule, which includes many festivals and collaborations with young composers. She also runs her own recording label, Sound Circus, and loves to suggest new projects whenever she meets other artists. So why take on the extra work of writing a book? ""People who know me are surprised,"" she says. ""But I believe the first lessons are very important. The music world often focuses on the most talented children, but most people enjoy music in a more everyday way. I find that much more interesting!""
In writing her first three books, Joanna draws from her own experiences. From ages 18 to 25, before she became a concert pianist, she taught many beginners. Most importantly, she grew up in a home where her mother taught piano, and many children came to learn. ""I was not part of a system that only focused on exceptional talent. I grew up believing that music should be available to everyone, no matter their skill level."" Just as everyone should learn to swim or speak a little French, she believes everyone should have the chance to learn the piano. Some children are naturally talented and progress quickly, while others take their time and may give up. This can happen at any stage. Some find the beginning too hard, while others feel pressure to perform like the talented children they see on television.
""I worry that some people use music, like sports, to push their children to achieve, instead of just enjoying it. Children often quit because they feel they cannot meet their parents' expectations."" When asked if she thinks poorly of other piano teaching methods or books, she replies, ""I am hesitant to criticize others."" She acknowledges that her colorful and engaging books are not the only ones available to help beginners enjoy learning. To attract young learners, she includes stories in her books and CDs. The challenge at this early stage is to make learning fun. From the first lesson, there are musical accompaniments for teachers or parents to play along with the child. For those whose parents do not play the piano, the accompaniments are available on the CDs.
Learning should be enjoyable, Joanna insists. ""You must let children improvise and encourage them to explore the entire keyboard."" As they progress, they need to be encouraged to read music instead of just playing by ear. Joanna understands this struggle because she relied on her ear when she was young. However, she believes that practice is the most important factor in learning. How can children be motivated to play a piece more than once? She admits that she did not practice seriously until she attended the Royal Academy of Music, where she began to build a challenging repertoire that required dedication. Now, she loves practicing. She spends about eight hours a day on it, which she considers essential to her musical life, even more than performing. ""I have great sympathy for those who find it hard. People do not talk about this enough."" 
The key, whether practicing for twenty minutes or five hours, is to have a clear goal, she says. Other tips include rewarding yourself by playing through a piece, even if there are mistakes, and mixing difficult pieces with easier ones."
CPE_54,C2,"Writing by Hand and on Screen**
Dr. Johnson believed that ""what is written without effort is usually read without pleasure."" This means that good writing often requires hard work. When I look back at my handwritten school essays, I notice they had very few corrections. Today, I would rewrite them many times. I think this is because writing by hand was physically challenging. The slow pace of writing helped me think carefully. In contrast, typing on a computer can lead to careless mistakes. Many writers find that the time spent fixing early drafts on a computer is about the same as the time spent on handwritten work. 
Also, emails, unlike handwritten letters, often lack emotional depth. However, they have revived the art of love letters, with millions of these messages now being sent instead of just casual chats. At least these emails are written in a form of English and grammar. But words on a screen can feel dull. Writers may not realize the impact of their words and often exaggerate their meaning. Words typed quickly can lack the care and personality of handwriting.
**The CD**
I put down my cup and went to look at the CD. The case was disappointing, but the shiny disc inside looked interesting. ""Wonderful little things, aren't they?"" Mr. Warriston said as he entered the room. I agreed, carefully handing the disc to him. ""It's amazing they can fit seventy minutes of music on these,"" he continued, bending down to the hi-fi. He turned it on, and lights lit up. He pressed a button, and a small drawer opened. He placed the disc inside, pressed the button again, and the tray slid back in. ""Some people say they sound sterile, but I think they..."" 
""Do you have to turn them over, like records?"" I asked. 
""What? No,"" Mr. Warriston replied, standing up. ""You only play one side."" 
""Why?"" I asked. He looked confused and then thoughtful. ""You know, I have no idea. I don't see why you couldn't make both sides playable and double the capacity..."" He stared at the machine. ""You could have two lasers, or just turn it over by hand... hmm."" He smiled at me. ""Yes, good point."" He nodded toward my wooden chair. ""Anyway, come on, let's get you sitting in the best spot for the stereo effect, okay?"" I smiled, happy to have asked a technical question that Mr. Warriston couldn't answer.
**Books vs. Electronic Text**
In comparing books and electronic text, the author Malcolm Bradbury made a good point when he said that if matches had been invented after cigarette lighters, we would have admired the improvement. Many people excited about new technology claim that electronic text is as important as the invention of printing and that it is almost complete. They forget that changes in how we think take generations, and this view is a form of egotism, believing that our generation is at a crucial moment in history. 
For example, a book from 1979 predicted that ""the 1980s will see the book as we know it begin to fade away."" So far, this has not happened. Reading long texts on a screen is often unpleasant, so most people avoid it. Additionally, the way information is organized on computers encourages people to skim through texts. Supporters of technology argue that this quick reading leads to new forms of storytelling. However, many books have never been read from start to finish, such as religious texts, dictionaries, and poetry collections. What is new is not the way electronic text branches out, but that computers do not encourage the deep thinking that comes from reading something completely.
**The Office**
Charles walked through the office door and into a perfectly organized space. The carpet was clear of the paper mess that had covered it when it was first laid down, and the dark wooden desk looked just as he remembered from the Sotheby's auction five weeks ago. Neat file holders were being placed in their proper drawers. Twelve years of trade journals filled the shelves on one wall. Kathleen struggled to close the filing cabinet and then turned to him. ""You have to use computers, Charles. This is just too much."" 
""Hello, Kathleen. Oh, this is amazing,"" he said, admiring the room and its antique furniture. He was not thinking about a computer or any other machine in it, not even a pencil sharpener. ""Simply amazing,"" he said, avoiding the topic of computers. Over the two years he had known her, they had discussed this many times. She could never understand why he resisted technology when he was skilled with computers and had even published an important paper on computer-based giftedness. She had inspired that paper. Through the keyboard, she could explore any software and create something new that could do amazing things."
CPE_32,C2,"""You don’t take sugar, do you?"" shouted his secretary, not really asking but stating a fact. She had been making Lancelot coffee for many months. Her excuse for forgetting was that he wasn’t usually supposed to be there. However, he was now there all the time, having realized that staying away only caused more problems. He thought about how he had gone from being a valued advisor, meeting authors and playwrights over lunch, to a stressed worker trying to avoid disasters, with no place to park when he arrived at work.
""This came,"" she yelled, waving a manila folder before placing it in front of him. ""From that guy in Los Angeles. You said you wanted to see it."" A label read: ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert."" Below that, it said ""An Expanded Synopsis."" Lancelot did not want to see the word ""synopsis."" He preferred to see a label that said ""A First Draft."" He had already seen a synopsis of this book and did not want to see another one, even if it was revised. Ian Cuthbert had received a large advance for this book when Lancelot had bought the company. Ian was one of several old friends Lancelot had mistakenly commissioned books from. Ian was a clear example that someone with a difficult personality often becomes even harder to manage when given a chance.
Lancelot skipped the introduction he had read many times and looked at the synopsis. He recognized almost every phrase. He closed the folder and pushed it aside. Clearly, at this rate, Ian's manuscript would never arrive. The synopsis lacked the brilliance Ian was known for, and beneath its playful tone, it felt empty of real ideas. Lancelot remembered stories of a famous author whose last book was published incomplete after his death, written chapter by chapter, with payments made one at a time. In that case, the payments were small parts of an advance that had never been given. Ian's advance had been huge, breaking the usual rule that authors must deliver a manuscript before getting paid.
Lancelot, who had studied modern languages at Oxford, remembered when Ian Cuthbert was seen as a great talent in Cambridge, a place full of promise. Ian's peers aimed to take over British theatre, and they succeeded quickly. But Ian seemed lazy compared to them. He wore his overcoat like a cape and spoke about what a famous French writer had said as if he had been there. Yet, for some reason, Ian's creative talent remained hidden. While less talented people succeeded, Ian withdrew further. At the peak of his influence, he was already known to be very difficult to work with. Officially appointed to edit a major arts magazine, he was like a general stuck on the beach with too many resources but no action. The magazine used up the budget for many issues without being published.
Similarly, his renewed contract with a fashion magazine led to stories about his high pay, which was increased in hopes of getting him to produce more, and then even more in hopes of getting him to produce anything. At editorial meetings, where famous photographers were always present, Ian criticized others' ideas harshly. Ten years later, he could hardly be counted on to show up for his own funeral. Lancelot was close to admitting that ""A World History of the Short"" had been a mistake from the start."
CPE_65,C2,"'England's Breakfast Revolution
Health experts agree that a good breakfast is very important. However, in history, breakfast is a relatively new concept in England. There are few mentions of breakfast in medieval literature. There are some references to travelers eating a meal at dawn before long journeys and to sick people having breakfast for health reasons, but most people did not eat breakfast unless they were kings or nobles. 
In the sixteenth century, breakfast started to become common for everyone. Some writers believe this change happened because food became more available. However, they may not have considered other important social changes. For instance, new work patterns meant that more people had jobs with set hours, often starting very early in the morning. As a result, having a meal in the morning became necessary and was no longer just for the wealthy.'"
CPE_61,C2,"**Photography**  
When a photographer takes a picture, they choose visual information based on their technical skills, personal views, and experiences, along with social and cultural norms. In this book, we will explore how these factors influence the style, content, and expression of a photograph, as well as how viewers perceive and respond to these images. For instance, a casual newspaper reader may have an understanding of the photographs printed on the page. However, instead of accepting the photograph as it is, we might ask if it truly captured the scene as it appeared at that moment. Alternatively, does it express the photographer's perspective? Is the exact moment captured particularly important, or should the photograph be seen as a symbol representing a situation in the world?
**More than a Game**  
For me, sport has always been more than just a game. The most successful athletes have strong self-belief. To succeed in sports, you need to focus completely. There is only one way to be the best, and you must set aside everything else. Sports can be harsh, and no one will do the work for you. It’s a matter of survival. Sports have taught me discipline and determination, but they also show the value of teamwork. My sport allows me to excel individually, yet it is still a team effort, and I must balance both aspects. This is similar to life – you can achieve as an individual, but you must remember the people around you. Sports have given me a lot, not just financially. They have opened doors for me and broadened my perspective, allowing me to see things around the world that many others will not. However, you also have to sacrifice a lot for these rewards.
**Tuning In**  
Some experiences are so vivid that they create clear memories. For me, such a moment happened one night in California many years ago when I lay awake, listening to the beautiful song of a mockingbird from a hidden spot in one of the tall trees in the neighborhood. I do not have insomnia; it was the bird's amazing singing that kept me awake. As I listened to its complex melodies, I found myself in an unexpected artistic experience. To understand the bird's patterns, I drew on my knowledge of jazz and Indian classical music. The bird made me feel as if I was enjoying a stunning improvisational performance. I reacted with groans and cheers as one surprising musical variation followed another through the open window until I finally fell asleep."
CPE_52,C2,"
""People have always had strong feelings about birds, whether they love, fear, or admire them. But what does this say about us? Paul Evans reports. 
In a greenhouse, a little brown bird called a wren is bumping against the glass. This bird is often seen as a sign of something important. Is it trying to send a message from a mysterious world, or is it just a bird trapped inside? Depending on how you look at it, both ideas could be true. 
Wrens have been part of British culture for a long time. In medieval times, people believed that the direction in which wrens flew could predict their luck. Today, images of wrens can still be found in many British homes, even if the old beliefs have faded. The wren still holds a special place in our hearts. A place without wrens feels empty and sad. 
This connection to birds comes from a time when people relied more on nature for survival. They developed a way of understanding the significance of other creatures. However, these meanings can change over time. For example, the red kite was once admired in London for taking bread from children. But soon, it was seen as a pest and nearly disappeared from many areas. Now, red kites are valued again and are being protected and reintroduced to help them thrive.
Our bond with birds goes back to our early human history. The first birdwatchers were likely very aware of bird behavior because it helped them survive by warning them of danger or bad weather. Birds also connected them to their dreams. When we wonder why birds matter to us, we are also exploring what it means to be human. The ideas of flight, song, and freedom reflect our own identity in relation to nature.
Some people might think these feelings are outdated, but they are still part of who we are. Losing this connection would be painful. That is why, in recent years, birds have become symbols of environmental change. In Britain, conservationists are worried about 30 endangered bird species. This is not just about losing interesting birds; it also represents a significant cultural loss. 
Birds carry a lot of cultural meaning. For instance, the skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing represent different kinds of love and magic. Anyone familiar with the poems of Shelley, Shakespeare, or Robert Graves would feel sad about losing these birds. However, the loss of other birds that are not mentioned in literature is often overlooked.
Folklore is very important. The stories and legends that have survived over time create a strong connection to their subjects, more so than scientific terms. This connection evokes feelings that are often hidden beneath the surface of modern life. Whether we watch wildlife documentaries or observe birds in our gardens, the joy we feel cannot be fully explained by science. Birds engage us in ways that are difficult to express, and the stories we tell about them help us understand their significance.
The wren in the greenhouse connects the present with a distant past, holding onto its song and moving into the future—a mystery that keeps me curious."""
CPE_28,C2,"**Maps**
The purpose of a map is to visually show the relationships between points and features on the earth's surface. These relationships are based on distance and direction. In ancient times, distance was often described in terms of time, such as ""a few hours' walk"" or ""a day's journey by river."" These descriptions provided more information about how easy it was to travel through local areas rather than the actual distance. Direction was also important, but for most travelers, the main questions were ""Where do I go from here?"" and ""How far away is it?"" Therefore, precise direction was not always crucial. For a long time, written itineraries were as popular as maps. Even today, some maps, like those showing train systems, do not always represent true directions. 
Landmarks along a route were initially marked by signs, which could be realistic or symbolic, and their size indicated their importance. The conventions used in maps varied based on their purpose and location, so understanding these conventions is essential when studying early maps. The history of map-making, or cartography, is mainly about improving the accuracy of distance and direction and expanding the content of maps. 
To achieve this, cartography has incorporated knowledge from other sciences. For instance, instead of determining direction by observing shadows or stars, people began using the magnetic compass and developed tools to measure angles accurately. The application of astronomy and exploration helped map the known world. Astronomers later discovered that the earth is not a perfect sphere but slightly flattened at the poles, leading to further improvements in mapping large areas.
Over time, the needs of map users changed. Travelers and merchants were no longer the only users of maps. Soldiers, especially after the introduction of artillery, required accurate representations of the land's features. This need for precision led to the invention of contour lines. Other users, like archaeologists, historians, and modern geographers, also had specific mapping needs. To meet these demands, today’s cartographers have developed methods to map various distributions, such as geological layers, climate zones, and land use.
The current recognition of the map's value in many scientific fields has sparked a modern revival of cartography. However, it is important to note that the development of cartography has not been a smooth or continuous process. There have been times of decline or stagnation, followed by periods of rapid progress, where old ideas coexisted with new ones. Cartographers have often understood the theoretical basis for advancements but had to wait for better tools to implement their ideas. Since copying old maps is the easiest way to create a new one, and because map publishers have sometimes resisted change, maps should not be taken at face value as evidence of current knowledge and techniques.
The many thousands of maps we have today are the result of significant human effort and thought. They provide an invaluable record for those studying human history. This aspect makes the study of historical cartography both fascinating and educational."
CPE_35,C2,"
I was taken into a young man's living room, which was a calm and cultured space surrounded by a messy collection of rooms where the less ambitious family members lived. Moving from the kitchen to his room felt like going from economy to business class. This room had the largest collection of records I had ever seen, the first stereo record player I had encountered, and the surprising fact that a teenager had spent money on Georgian wine glasses, pictures, and furniture. His name was Andrew Lloyd Webber. He had received a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford, to study history, and he had nine months before starting, during which he wanted to become England's version of the composer Richard Rodgers. My own dreams were just as unrealistic; I wanted to be a pop star for the usual reasons: women, money, and fame. The difference between Andrew and me was that my dreams were not life or death, although they might have felt that way if I had failed. So, when Andrew suggested that I try to become a famous lyricist like Oscar Hammerstein, I was open to the idea. This was partly because, within ten minutes of meeting him, he played me three of his own tunes, and I could tell he was very talented. As he confidently played selections from the many shows he had created at school, I was reminded of the best show albums from my parents' collection. He needed a new lyricist for the outside world. I didn’t have much to impress him with, except for my praise for his music and a seven-inch single of a song I had written that had recently been recorded by an unknown pop group. We said we would meet again and write something together. I was still more interested in pop charts than in West End theatre, but I told myself on the bus back to my flat that I had just met someone with rare talent and determination, and I would be foolish to miss the chance to work with someone who was likely to succeed in musical theatre soon. Even if we didn’t succeed in challenging the top musical composers, we could try to compete with the Beatles and Rolling Stones later in the summer. The Everly Brothers had just made a comeback and would need new material. 
The next day, back at my desk in the office where I was training to be a lawyer, the excitement I had felt about a life in show business with Andrew Lloyd Webber had faded a bit. I would still look at small ads in Melody Maker for groups needing a singer and write a few more simple songs that wouldn’t show off my limited singing ability. However, it was likely that I would finish my exams and become a respectable lawyer by the time I was twenty-five. By then, I would probably have outgrown pop music, as my father had predicted I would by twenty-one. This worried me—if he was right, I only had a few more months to enjoy it. But for now, I felt I had nothing to lose by seeing Andrew again. It would be fun to go to a musical with him and write lyrics that imitated musical lyricists instead of pop stars. Andrew was an interesting person who talked about Good Food Guides and Victorian architecture and supported the Leyton Orient football team. I wasn’t sure about the idea for a musical he had been working on for the past year, but in 1965, I was rarely sure about anything. His talent was undeniable, and he claimed to have all the right contacts. I soon found myself back in his living room. The idea was about the life of Dr. Thomas Barnardo, a nineteenth-century philanthropist who started the orphanages that carry his name. His story was important, but it didn’t really inspire me. The hero seemed too perfect, at least in Andrew's version, and the idea felt unoriginal, too similar to Lionel Bart's hit show, Oliver. However, Andrew's strong belief in his music's brilliance was contagious and somewhat justified. What did I know about musicals? As David Land, who would later be my agent for over twenty-five years, often said, if there is a demand for one hamburger bar on the block, there is room for two. We could be the second hamburger joint. I began working with great enthusiasm, especially on the funny songs. Andrew explained the plot, played me the tunes, and often gave me the titles, most of which had likely been thought up by his former school friend. I even skipped a day at the law office, pretending to be sick, to write my first set of theatrical lyrics. I didn’t realize it that day, but I had changed my career."
CPE_5,C2,"**Text:**
**Language**  
You and I are part of a species with a unique ability: we can influence each other's thoughts with great accuracy. Language is so deeply connected to human life that it is hard to imagine living without it. If you see two or more people together anywhere in the world, they will likely start talking to each other. When there is no one to talk to, people often speak to themselves, their pets, or even their plants. I like to think of language as an 'instinct.' This means that people know how to communicate in a way similar to how spiders know how to spin webs. Web-spinning was not created by a brilliant spider and does not require special education or skills in building.
**Climate and Weather**  
Climate and weather, which are mainly influenced by the air around us, greatly impact the lives and locations of animals and plants. Climate can strongly shape the appearance of landscapes. For instance, warm and wet conditions throughout the year allow tropical jungles to grow, which are rich in different species. In contrast, cold and windy areas can only support a limited variety of life. The daily weather patterns that contribute to the overall climate are caused by large air masses rising and mixing, as the atmosphere is always in motion. Some of this movement is because the layer of gases sits on a spinning Earth. Since air is light, it does not move at the same speed as the Earth and tends to lag behind. However, a more significant cause of air movement is the sun.
**Coffee**  
As a barista, my job included serving drinks, but more importantly, I was responsible for making coffee. In Lygon Street, Melbourne, a restaurant's success can depend on its coffee quality. I underwent several days of intense training in coffee-making, where I learned more than I ever wanted to know about cleaning and maintaining the restaurant's shiny espresso machine. I also learned the key principles for making the perfect rich, frothy cappuccino. By the end of the first week, I realized that making a good cup of coffee was not as simple as it seemed, and I feared I would be assigned to less important tasks again. Fortunately, my boss was patient. ""Making coffee is both an art and a science,"" he said, ""and you need time to develop the skill."""
CPE_41,C2,"**Art on TV**
Why does television often struggle with programs about visual arts? Painting and sculpture are perfect subjects for the camera, which can show an entire artwork and then zoom in on the details. However, there are few TV series that successfully capture both the enjoyment and complexity of viewing art. A good example of this issue is Robert Hughes's eight-part series on American art, *American Visions*. Hughes is a trusted critic with a strong personality, and he has nearly eight hours to introduce British viewers to an art movement that British galleries have largely overlooked. I expected the series to focus on famous artworks, but instead, it explored how American history and culture are reflected in its art and architecture.
**Dealing in Metals**
For 20 years, I worked as an international metals dealer and gained a reputation as a speculator. The metals market is less regulated than other markets. With some luck, a willingness to take risks, and a good understanding of the market, it is possible to make a lot of money. Risk-taking is a normal part of this industry. This adventurous culture fits well with a free-market global economy. However, the free-trade economists who believed that the market would keep the prices of scarce metals stable have found the opposite is true. More minerals are being extracted, and the cost of raw materials is going down. When considering inflation, the prices of most metals are about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to investigate claims made against one of the multinational companies that benefit from these low-cost raw materials.
**Extract from a Holiday Brochure**
Abaco and its offshore cays are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas, which stretch from Florida past the Tropic of Cancer to Cuba. Each island has its own character and offers something unique. The best way to explore the islands and cays of Abaco is by boat. If a boat is not included with your accommodation, don’t worry. There are many ferries and water taxis available. You can also rent boats if you prefer to explore on your own. Sailing is the most popular way to get around here. Abaco is known as 'The Sailing Capital of the World' for good reason. The calm, protected waters are also perfect for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The cays and their beaches stretch for 200 miles like a string of pearls. Gems can be found not only at sea; at night, the lights of the restaurants and cafes in Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay sparkle beautifully."
CPE_69,C2,"Build Your Own Bamboo Bike at the UK’s First Workshop**
Join a course at the Bamboo Bike Club, led by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan, where you can create your own custom bamboo bike frame and enjoy a fun weekend of bike-building. It’s Saturday morning in Hackney Wick, east London, and the Bamboo Bike Club is busy with activity. This is the only bamboo bike-building course in Britain.
Bamboo is becoming a popular material for bike construction. Companies like Calfee Design from California and Bamboo Bikes from Yorkshire have brought back this method, which dates back to 1894. However, many cyclists find ready-made bamboo frames too expensive, costing around $2,995 or £1,868. This high price motivated James and Ian to spend years working in a shed in Brecon, Wales, to create a bamboo bike business that is affordable for average cyclists. They wanted to share the joy of making something unique and sustainable, rather than just selling bike frames.
The Bamboo Bike Club is more of a community than a traditional business. James works on wind turbines, and Ian is a civil engineer. They run monthly courses where participants can build their own bikes at a reasonable price. 
On the first day of the course, James and Ian teach how to choose strong bamboo and create sturdy joints. Participants start by assembling the front triangle of the bike using 40 mm diameter bamboo, followed by the thinner parts for the seat and chain assembly. Alloy tubes are added for the handlebars and other parts that need extra strength. This process can be challenging, especially for those who are not experienced with DIY projects. However, James and Ian are there to help, checking every cut and joint, and stepping in if someone struggles.
The chance to build your own bike is a big draw for many participants, most of whom are engineers. Ian reassures everyone that mistakes are normal, and it’s easy to try again with new pieces of bamboo. Each piece has been checked for quality, allowing participants to choose the look of their bike: plain bamboo, black, or mottled.
On Sunday, the focus shifts to building the lugs, which are the joints of the bike. Participants wrap hemp bindings around the joints and use epoxy resin to create a strong bond. After adding a waterproof coating, the bike is ready for wheels, brakes, gears, and personal touches. James and Ian claim that their bamboo bikes are just as strong as metal ones. Ian has used his bike for over a year on a 16-mile commute, and James has tested his bike off-road for three months without breaking it.
While bamboo bikes may not look as polished as professional frames, they are unique. James and Ian emphasize that individuality is important. Personally, I think bamboo bikes are best for relaxed rides rather than racing. I choose a 'Classic English' frame for a comfortable ride. 
I test James’s bike, and it feels light and smooth, thanks to bamboo’s ability to absorb vibrations. James believes the workshops are most rewarding when the bikes are being ridden. They are light and fun to ride, and the price is less than £500."

**Self-Help Books**  
Diane Reverend was an editor at Random House in New York when she first saw a manuscript by an unknown pop psychologist, Dr. John Gray. ""I took one look at the title and knew it would be a bestseller,"" she says, laughing, and she was right. Dr. Gray is now a multimillionaire, and Diane Reverend has her own company. Dr. Gray's small book on improving communication between men and women is a symbol of a large and growing self-help industry that claims to meet many of Americans' desires for self-improvement. This industry also creates new desires and supports the entire New York publishing world. In Britain, the genre can fill shelves with books that are often silly and dramatic, but there are worse ones. For every self-help book published, thousands are rejected for being too similar or too specialized. This is a small mercy. As a new type of powerful editor searches for the next big hit, writing style is often ignored. Marketability is the main focus. ""How marketable is the author? What's the 'hook'? Is it universal enough?"" Ms. Reverend lists the important questions and admits, ""If someone comes to me with a catchy title, that's two-thirds of the battle won. You know you can reach people.""
**Autobiographies**  
There must be an unspoken agreement between an autobiographer and the reader that the truth is being shared. This agreement is often not fully kept. There are many reasons why a writer might not tell the whole truth. They may have thoughts or actions they feel are too shameful to share. They might also think some details are not important enough to include. There are also more complex reasons for breaking this agreement. The autobiographer might believe that the ultimate goal of their work, which is to reveal the truth about themselves, can be better achieved by inventing stories that express the truth more clearly than sticking strictly to the facts. Alternatively, they may decide from the start not to follow this agreement. They might label their book an autobiography just to create a sense of trust in the reader, which helps them in their storytelling. Some readers may finish the book thinking they have read a true story, when in fact, they have read fiction. This can happen without any intention to deceive.
**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**  
Students of detective stories say that this genre reflects the conflicts of society in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The detective story is essentially a metaphor. The crime symbolizes a basic human desire, like lust or greed, and its solution represents the return of the individual to society, calming their lawless impulses so that society can function smoothly again. In Hammett's unique version, society returns to its previous state, but that state is shown to be corrupt and false. The hunter and the hunted in Hammett's stories are two sides of the same character. The private detective and his target understand each other and, in a strange way, are comfortable with one another. The private detective belongs to both worlds. From the criminal's perspective, he is too honest, and from the law's perspective, he is too shady. He is both a criminal and a competitor. The private detective's mission is sometimes influenced by his sense of guilt, and sometimes his desire for punishment is heightened by his worry about this confusion.
**Science Writing**  
Today’s leading scientific essayist is Stephen Jay Gould. To discuss his writing and hear his advice, I met him in an unfamiliar setting: the Grand Hotel, where he was staying while promoting his new book. Neither of us felt very comfortable there. Regarding writing in such a pretentious environment, Gould said, ""I couldn't do it; Trollope might, but he understood the culture. Knowing the culture is essential for being a successful writer. Science, for example, is its own world. Therefore, only scientists can effectively present it. If you don’t belong to the community and don’t understand its rules, you are at a disadvantage from the start."" One of Gould's principles is: never write down to the reader. ""Make no concessions,"" he says. ""You can simplify the language but must never dilute the ideas. Above all, you cannot simplify the argument. Once readers feel they are being talked down to, your piece is finished."""
CPE_17,C2,"Air-conditioning**
At Cannons Gym, a popular spot for City of London workers during lunch, the air feels very cold. To cope with this summer's high temperatures, the gym has used a lot of air-conditioning. At quiet times, it can feel like being in the Arctic. This shows how the modern world often misuses air-conditioning. It has become a common part of our lives, symbolizing humanity's ability to control the climate. However, many air-conditioned buildings could use other cooling methods. They could use natural light and ventilation, and have thicker walls that keep heat out during the day and release it at night. These ideas may seem simple, but they can be very effective and would greatly reduce the need for air-conditioning.
**Sundials**
It is interesting that as we enter a new millennium, there is a growing interest in sundials, which measure time based on the sun's position. A hundred years ago, sundials were essential for keeping time accurately. As clocks and watches improved, sundials became less important and were seen mainly as garden decorations. Now, they are being appreciated again. David Harber, a maker of sundials, believes their charm comes from their connection to the planets. He says there is a magical moment when a sundial starts to work. They are calm and beautiful objects that remind us of our place in the universe.
**Paint Your Own China**
My idea of china-painting came from a visit to an arts and crafts show where serious-looking older women showed how to paint delicate flowers on teacups with skillful brushstrokes. It was fascinating to watch, as each stroke created a perfect petal or leaf. Their hands were steady, and the paint never smudged. I thought these women must have practiced for years or had a special talent. I wondered what kind of people would join a china-painting class. Would beginners have a natural talent? However, the atmosphere in the class was friendly and relaxed. Everyone was there to enjoy themselves, and even the teacher did not want to paint flowers on teacups as quickly as I had remembered."
CPE_47,C2,"The Wrong Country**
Uncle chose a package holiday for them at a good price: a flight from Gatwick Airport, twelve nights in Venice, the beautiful city, at the Pensione Concordia. When Keith and Dawne went to the travel agency to book, the clerk told them that the other travelers were a school group from the south coast, all learning Italian. But something went wrong. Either at the travel agency, the check-in desk, or in a computer, a small mistake happened. Dawne and Keith ended up in a hotel called the Edelweiss, in Room 212, somewhere in Switzerland.
At Gatwick, they gave their tickets to a girl in a yellow-and-red uniform. She called them by name, checked their tickets, and said everything was fine. An hour later, they were surprised to hear older people on the plane speaking with accents from the North of England. Keith thought there must have been a cancellation, or maybe the Italian class was on another plane. They ordered drinks, and then more drinks. 
When they landed, a stout woman with glasses said, ""The coach will take us on. Stay together now."" There was no mention of an overnight stop in the brochure, but when the coach arrived at its destination, Keith realized that this was clearly an unexpected stop. As they got off the coach close to midnight, tired and dirty from travel, they did not question their right to the beds they were offered. But the next morning, when they found out they were being offered the beds for their entire holiday, they became worried.
""We have the lake and the water birds,"" the receptionist smiled and explained. ""And we can take the steamer to Interlaken."" 
""An error has been made,"" Keith said calmly, aware of his wife's anxious breathing beside him. ""We were supposed to be in Venice, at the Pensione Concordia."" 
""I do not know that name, sir. This is Switzerland,"" the receptionist replied. 
""A coach is supposed to take us on. An official said so on the plane. She was here last night,"" Keith insisted. 
""Your group is booked for twelve nights in the Edelweiss Hotel. If you have changed your minds—"" 
""We haven't changed our minds. There has been a mistake."" The receptionist shook his head, saying he did not know about any mistake. 
""The man who made the booking,"" Dawne interrupted, ""was bald, with glasses and a moustache."" She named the travel agency in London. 
""Is there a problem?"" a woman said, smiling at Keith. She was the stout woman he had seen talking to the girl at Gatwick. On the plane, she had walked up and down the aisle, smiling at people. 
""My name is Franks,"" she said. ""I'm married to the man with the bad leg."" 
""Are you in charge, Mrs. Franks?"" Dawne asked. ""We are in the wrong hotel."" Again, she gave the name of the travel agency and described the bald clerk, mentioning his glasses and moustache. 
Keith interrupted, ""It seems we got into the wrong group. We reported to the Your-Kind-of-Holiday girl and left it to her."" 
""We should have known when they weren't from Dover,"" Dawne added. ""We heard them talking about Darlington."" 
Keith made an impatient sound, wishing she would let him speak. ""We noticed you at Gatwick,"" he said. ""We knew you were in charge."" 
""And I noticed you. I counted you, although you probably didn't see me. Let me explain. There are many places Your-Kind-of-Holiday sends its clients, with different holidays at different prices. There are villa holidays for adventurous people under thirty-five, treks to Turkey, and treks for singles to the Himalayas."" 
""What I am trying to say is that all tickets and labels look similar, yellow with two red bands."" Mrs. Franks suddenly laughed. ""So if you just followed others with the yellow-and-red label, you might think you could end up in a wildlife park! But of course,"" she added kindly, ""that couldn't happen."" 
""We're not supposed to be in Switzerland,"" Keith insisted. 
""Well, let's see,"" Mrs. Franks said unexpectedly, and then she walked away, leaving them standing. The receptionist was no longer at the desk, and they could hear typing. 
""She seems quite nice,"" Dawne whispered. Keith was not listening. He tried to remember everything that had happened: giving the tickets to the girl, waiting, and then the girl leading them to the plane, and the pilot welcoming them aboard. 
""Nice to have some young people along,"" an elderly man said, interrupting Keith's thoughts. ""Nottage is the name."" His wife was with him, and they both looked like they were in their eighties. She said they had slept very well, thanks to the lakeside air. 
""That's nice,"" Dawne said. Keith walked out of the reception area, and Dawne followed him. Outside the hotel, they did not say that there was an irony in what had happened. On their first holiday since their honeymoon, they had ended up in a package tour with older people when the whole point of the holiday was to escape the needs and demands of the elderly. Uncle had said so himself when they tried to persuade him to join them."

American business leaders are looking to the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a model for good management. Eluned Price reports.
Most people in Britain know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and have a general idea of his achievements. However, America has only recently discovered him. The Wall Street Journal described Shackleton as ""an Antarctic explorer whose feats went largely unnoticed for most of the 20th century,"" which is an exaggeration. Now, Americans are making up for lost time with great enthusiasm. Biographies and stories about the voyage of the Endurance are being produced quickly; the American Museum of Natural History is organizing a major exhibition, and Columbia Tristar is making a film about Shackleton's life.
Some American managers have also adopted Shackleton as a role model. His supporters share stories of his actions with admiration, drawing lessons in leadership and communication from his experiences. They even refer to each other as ""speaking Shackleton."" The determined and resourceful Shackleton, with his reindeer sleeping bag and blubber stove, has become a symbol for modern management consultants.
Jim MacGregor, the managing partner of Abernathy MacGregor Frank in New York, chose Shackleton as a role model years ago. His firm focuses on communication during mergers, acquisitions, and corporate crises. For example, they handle situations like ""this firm's plant exploded"" or ""half the workforce has to be laid off."" While it may be hard to see how Shackleton's experience of surviving in extreme cold relates to managing a financial crisis, MacGregor believes Shackleton is a great model for management because of his leadership and communication skills. Shackleton had clear values and was at his best when he and his team had a lot at stake, including their lives.
One of Shackleton's most interesting decisions was to turn back when he was only 97 miles from the South Pole. This decision showed his commitment to the safety of his men. In a crisis, people want to know who is in charge. While many managers today may avoid responsibility, Shackleton was willing to take charge. His 1914 expedition became legendary when his ship, the Endurance, was trapped in ice for nine months and eventually sank. When the ship went down, Shackleton told his men, ""We should all eventually reach safety if you do your best and trust me."" From the accounts and diaries kept during the expedition, it is clear that Shackleton was always in control.
""Shackleton thought everything through, planned for every situation, kept his men informed, and asked for their opinions,"" says MacGregor. ""He was flexible, willing to change plans when necessary. We have developed effective principles based on Shackleton's example. Clients can relate to his story without feeling criticized.""
Shackleton believed that an explorer needs optimism, endurance, and patience. ""One of the hardest things to do in difficult times is to be patient, especially in America, where there is a strong desire to fix problems quickly,"" says MacGregor. ""If you invest in bonds and guess wrong about interest rates, you should hold on and wait to get your money back. Selling too soon would result in a big loss. Also, don't hesitate to change your plans if they are not working. If a new product is failing, don't keep selling it.""
Shackleton led by example. On the return journey from the Endurance, he noticed Hurley, the expedition photographer, without gloves. He insisted that Hurley wear his gloves, saying he would throw them overboard if he didn't. Someone else remembered Shackleton doing something similar with a biscuit when they were near starvation on the 1905 expedition: ""He said he would leave it in the snow. Millions of pounds couldn't have bought that biscuit.""
As Caroline Alexander, author of *Endurance*, the human account of that expedition, says: ""The public's interest in heroic efforts is growing. Shackleton shows that there is little heroism in today's world. Everything else fades away, and he stands out as a true embodiment of the ideals we long for today."""
