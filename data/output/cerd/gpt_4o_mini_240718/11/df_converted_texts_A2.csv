**Garbage in, garbage out**

Charging families for each bag of rubbish they throw away seems like a good idea for the environment and for money. But it might not be. In many developed countries, people have similar ways of dealing with rubbish. One common way is that local governments collect rubbish at regular times. Rubbish bags or bins are taken away by special trucks to a dump. 

To economists, this system is strange because in many places, it is free. Families pay for this service through local taxes, but a family that throws away four bags of rubbish each week pays the same as an elderly couple that throws away one bag. However, the cost of getting rid of rubbish is not zero. The more rubbish people throw away, the more trucks and workers are needed, and the more local governments have to pay to dump the rubbish. 

If rubbish disposal is free, people will throw away too much rubbish. A simple solution is to make families pay for the cost of throwing away their waste. This would encourage them to throw away less and recycle more, if local governments provide places to recycle. 

But two American economists, Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman, found that this simple idea can have complicated and sometimes disappointing results. They studied several American towns that started charging families for their rubbish. The most common way was to sell stickers or tags that families had to put on their rubbish bags. Only bags with these tags were picked up each week. 

In a study published last year, Fullerton and Kinnaman looked at a program started in July 1992 in Charlottesville, Virginia, a town with about 40,000 people. Residents had to pay 80 cents for each tagged bag of rubbish. This seems like a good use of market forces. However, the authors found that the benefits of the program did not cover the costs of printing tags, paying sellers, and paying workers. 

True, the number of bags thrown away fell by 37%. But this was mostly because people crammed more rubbish into each bag, a behavior called the ""Seattle stomp."" Instead of buying more tags, people jumped on their bags to fit more rubbish inside. This is not as effective as machines at dumps. The weight of rubbish collected fell by only 14% in Charlottesville. In 25 other Virginia cities without a pricing program, the weight fell by 3.5% anyway. 

Worse, some people started to dump their rubbish illegally instead of paying for collection. The authors guess that illegal dumping may account for 30-40% of the reduction in collected rubbish. 

One positive result was a 15% increase in recycling, which suggests that people chose to recycle (which is free) instead of paying to throw away their rubbish. But many people were already recycling in Charlottesville before the program started. 

In a more recent study, Fullerton and Kinnaman looked at rubbish in more detail. They found that charging for rubbish does reduce the amount thrown away, but not by much. On average, a 10% increase in sticker prices only cuts rubbish by 0.3%. This is less than in other studies. To throw away a lot less rubbish, people would need to buy less of everything. A small tax on rubbish is unlikely to make a big difference. 

If this is true, we should think about whether other things, like income and education, are just as important as price. In richer towns, for example, people throw away more rubbish than in poorer towns and have less time to recycle. 

Should we say that charging families for rubbish is a bad idea? Not really; free disposal is probably too cheap. But the effects of simple policies can be complicated. We often need complex economic models to understand them. Sometimes, the results are not very good.

CPE_19,"**Simplified Text:**

Theodore Zeldin talks about how our work life could change. Do you feel respected and appreciated at your job? Success in a career is not enough anymore. Many people feel that their work is not valued or understood. Even famous people can feel unhappy despite their success. Loving your job used to be enough to make you special, but now you need to think about how your job affects you as a person, your mind, character, and relationships. This is an important question. If your skills make you boring and you cannot talk to others outside your job, then no amount of money or status will make you happy.

I want to find out how work can help us feel fulfilled and not just be a way to make money. Work should help us live better lives, discover new talents, and meet different people. However, this does not mean that unemployment will disappear. As more people get educated, they want jobs that are interesting and meaningful.

Even jobs that used to be respected, like doctors and architects, can be stressful and unfulfilling. Many workers feel unhappy in their jobs. In Britain, only 8% of workers feel that their values match those of their companies. I am studying different jobs to see how they affect people. I want to understand happiness, love, friendship, and respect in our work lives.

Many people feel like they are not truly alive at work. They may have the choice to leave their jobs, but they feel stuck because of their qualifications and careers. For example, many hotel workers are smart and capable but work long hours for low pay and little respect. Hotels could be more than just places to sleep; they could be cultural centers where people from different countries meet and connect.

Hotel staff often have little chance to use their skills and knowledge. If hotels listened to their workers' dreams, they could offer more services. But many hotels focus only on making money. It is time to think about work in a new way, focusing on people, not just profits. 

For me, work is about relationships. Many people want to have more control over their jobs and choose their colleagues. This means they need to learn to communicate well with others. Good communication is important, but it is different from real conversation. Real conversation creates a bond of respect and can change how we see each other. Every time we have a meaningful conversation, we make the world a little better. 

**Questions:**

1. What does Theodore Zeldin think about success in a career?
2. Why is it important to think about how work affects us as people?
3. What do many hotel workers feel about their jobs?
4. How can hotels become more than just places to sleep?
5. What does Zeldin believe is important for work relationships?"
CPE_24,"**Text: 'BROADCASTING: The Social Shaping of a Technology'**

'Broadcasting' originally meant to spread seeds widely by hand. This idea is not just about farming; it also represents hope for growth and success. The idea suggests that there are resources available to help spread information and ideas. 

We need to understand why a new technology that sends words and pictures electronically was set up in a way that fits this farming idea. Television is connected to other forms of communication, like the telegraph and the telephone. However, from the beginning, it was seen as a centralised 'mass' medium. This means that it sent information from one central place to many homes. This way of broadcasting matched the social and economic structures of modern societies.

There were some attempts to create different ways of using television. In the early 1930s, radio enthusiasts in Britain tried to make two-way television, which could replace regular telephones. Many science magazines, like Radio News, published articles on how to build television equipment. However, in 1938, big companies agreed on standards for television that pushed these amateur efforts aside. This was a missed opportunity for a different kind of television that could have been more equal and community-based.

In the early 1930s, television was mostly used for public shows in the USA and was seen as a competitor to the film industry. Many people watched television in public places, especially in Britain and Germany. The idea of amateur two-way television was not successful, but public viewing was common in several countries during the 1930s. 

Manufacturers wanted to sell more home television sets, so they focused on broadcasting to many homes. As working-class people improved their living standards from the 1920s, the dream of having entertainment at home became real for many people in Western countries. This is now happening worldwide.

There is a clear link between social changes and how broadcasting is organized. As societies modernized, they became more centralized, and traditional communities broke apart. People became more mobile, which made them feel more isolated compared to earlier communities. Centralized broadcasting helped governments share important information with all citizens and created a sense of community in the nation-state.

Broadcasting became the main way to share information through radio and television. However, there is also a positive view of broadcasting as a way to support democracy. Between the World Wars, many countries saw broadcasting as a way to ensure everyone had access to important information for participating in society.

Television is changing, and the term broadcasting may not fit well anymore. In the future, this idea may only refer to a specific way of using audio-visual technology during a certain time of social change."
CPE_13,"**Text: Clutter**

Sometimes, it feels like no matter how many things you own, you never feel safe. It is normal to want a home that meets your needs, but sometimes we want too many things. Modern advertising is made to play on our fears. The message is often, ""If you don’t have this, you are not good enough."" 

To see how much advertising affects you, try not to look at any billboards the next time you walk down the street. We see many ads on TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, t-shirts, and the internet. All of these tell us to buy more things.

**Caves**

Many researchers and universities around the world study caves. They look at where caves come from, how water moves in them, and what lives in them. Caves are a small but interesting part of nature. They make us curious and have been studied for a long time, especially in places where caves affect our lives. 

However, visiting many caves requires physical strength, so cave research is often done by both scientists and people who visit caves for fun.

**Weather Watch**

Many people have watched the weather for a long time without any tools. This helped create the science of meteorology, which has become very advanced since the 17th century. Now, satellites and electronic tools give us a lot of weather information quickly. Computers can solve complex math problems much faster than people can.

Meteorology uses many difficult words that are hard to understand. But human experience is still very important for making weather forecasts. What people observe can help scientists understand the weather better."
CPE_16,"**MUSIC AND THEATRE**

Not long ago, I thought that opera was mainly theatre. Now, I think differently. After working at a national opera house, I learned that music is the most important part of opera. This is how it should be. I come from the world of theatre, where the words and the actors are very important. In theatre, there is no one directing the action once it starts, and the performers and the audience usually speak the same language.

At any music performance, whether in a concert hall or an opera house, there are many people who, like me, do not know much about music. Some of them may feel embarrassed about what they don’t know. Most people are amazed by the skill of the performers. A great singer or a good musician shows us the results of many years of hard work. Watching top-class music is like watching a sports match. We know athletes are doing something similar to what we do when we run for a bus, but we see how much better they are.

Theatre audiences have different expectations. They often do not understand how skilled an actor is and may not be very impressed when an actor finishes a long speech. They often ask, “How do you learn all those lines?” This does not mean that theatre audiences are less demanding than music audiences; many of them are the same people. It may mean that audiences and performers are more equal in theatre than in music.

Does music need to learn from theatre? I think yes. I have seen how a different approach can make the experience of concert-goers better. Live music is very theatrical, full of feelings, and can be surprising. The rules that still exist in music, like strict dress codes and showing too much respect to conductors and soloists, make a big difference between players and listeners. This can feel uncomfortable.

On the other hand, when music audiences clap between songs or after a great performance, it can be a nice way to show appreciation, but it can also interrupt the flow of the music. 

Is there a solution? Yes, a lot is being done. Many people are working to bring new audiences to concert halls and opera houses and to make them feel that “serious” music is for everyone. I remember a special event called In Search of Angels, which took place in a cathedral and then moved into the town. It was a wonderful musical experience, and many audience members were not just there to watch and listen but also to take part.

I wish music could be more like the exciting and bold theatre. Sometimes this can happen in unusual places, where expectations are changed. This can create surprising effects for both performers and audiences. People may have to give up some comforts, like a good sound or warmth, but theatre audiences have learned to be brave and follow artists into unexpected spaces.

I know that most plays are performed in a usual way, not very different from concerts. However, I believe that we can and should change how we experience music. I am just a fan: I love theatre and spend a lot of time and money enjoying music. I want both to succeed and for more people to enjoy being part of the audience."

**Sand**  
I admire how sand can be changed into useful things like glass and concrete, but I do not like it when it is just sand. To me, sand is a problem. It is a barrier between a parking lot and the sea. It blows in your face, gets into your food, and can hide important things like car keys and coins. When you are wet, sand sticks to you and is hard to remove, even with a strong hose. But, when you step onto a beach towel, get into a car, or walk on a clean carpet, the sand falls off you. For days, you find sand on the floor when you take off your shoes, and more sand comes out when you take off your socks. Sand stays with you longer than some illnesses. I do not want sand around me.

**Lock and Key**  
People have always wanted a safe home. The old way to lock a door was with a rope, but now we have electronic locks that use plastic cards. However, people still like to use a real key to lock their doors. Even when companies make new electronic locks, they still include a metal key because people want to feel safe at home.

**Modern Art**  
I was nervous to visit the new Tate Modern gallery because I do not understand modern art. I like some of it, especially furry things, neon lights, and big photos. I think if I knew more about art, I would have more opinions. The important thing is not to understand art perfectly, but to let it speak to you. This gallery tries to help visitors understand the art better. The first thing I noticed was the labels that explain what the art is about. These labels helped me understand the art instead of just looking at it without knowing."
CPE_46,"**Every Picture Tells a Story**

**Adapting Novels for Film**

When a book is made into a movie, many parts of the story are often cut or changed. This can be hard for the writer, but it can also help them see things in a new way. While writing a script, I noticed that I could remove a lot of the dialogue and descriptions from the book and still tell the same story. This does not mean that the original words were not important. It is about how each type of story (books and movies) asks the audience to pay attention in different ways. 

In a book, some details about characters are repeated to help readers remember them. For example, we might see the same character trait mentioned more than once. In a movie, we can often tell who is speaking by looking at the scene, but using names like ""he said"" can make it easier to follow. 

**Watching Movies**

When we watch movies, we can feel like we are part of the story. It is a special experience that takes us away from our everyday lives, at least for the time the movie lasts. But when the movie ends and the lights come on, we are back in the real world. Some people think that watching movies is just for fun and not real art. Many of our parents and teachers felt this way. They enjoyed movies but did not see them as something important.

**The Film Studios**

The Leiper Film Company studios were made up of many different buildings. It was hard to find your way around because the layout was confusing. There were a few important places, like the Script Department, but most of the rooms looked the same. There were three main entrances, but none of them helped you find your way easily. Most people who worked there knew how to get around, but it was difficult for visitors. 

Because of the hard work of the people at the studio, stories of love and adventure could be shared with audiences. Couples like Jane and George, or Sally and Dick, could escape their everyday problems for a few hours while watching a movie.

**Film-Makers**

Many people want to make movies. Bookstores have many books about how to write scripts and make films. Universities offer classes on this topic. There are even contests where you can win a camera to make your own movie. Robert Rodriguez made a famous film called El Mariachi for only $7,000, and it helped him become a well-known director. He wrote about how he felt he needed to make his big movie soon, just like famous directors did when they were young.

In the past, it took longer for film-makers to start making movies. They often worked in other jobs first, like editing or writing. For example, John Huston was 35 when he made his first film, and Fred Zinnemann was in his forties. But now, many new film-makers have to find their own way without the help of big studios or television."
CPE_3,"**Simplified Text:**

In the past, the council houses were all over the western side of the city. They were rows of small, old houses made of orange brick or white plaster. In summer, the smell from a factory nearby filled the air, and a paperboy often looked disgusted as he walked to deliver papers. I have forgotten most of my early life, but I remember sitting by an upstairs window and looking at the houses in the distance. I also remember my mother, who was small, precise, and often angry. I never understood why she was angry, so I could not make her feel better.

Even as a child, I noticed that my mother was very lonely. She felt alone even in a room full of people. She had strict rules about how to behave, which I did not understand. For example, we were not allowed to walk into our neighbors' gardens or disturb their flowers. We had to sit quietly at the dining table, listening to the radio shows my mother liked. There were many rules like this.

My mother had a few friends. There was Mrs. Buddery, who loved the Royal Family, Mrs. Winall, who rarely spoke, and Mrs. Laband, who was more lively. I later realized that they were not very good company. They often talked about their problems, like bad legs and cold weather, and I sometimes felt like I was one of the problems.

Looking back, it felt like a heavy weight was on my shoulders, and I needed to grow up quickly to escape it. Growing up in West Earlham was very structured. Until you were five, you stayed at home. I remember long days playing on a rug while my mother sat in a chair, looking cold. After turning five, you went to Avenue Road infants school, which was half a mile away. Some lucky kids had mothers with bikes, but my mother usually let other kids take care of me on the way.

If I remember anything from those early years, it is the summer holidays. I saw a little of the world outside West Earlham. There was an old man next door who told stories about his time at sea. Once, there was a charity event where a kind woman gave out lemonade and tried to get me to join a group for helping others. But my mother dismissed it, saying they just wanted money. She often talked about how people were only after money, and she did not like politicians at all.

My mother was not completely unaware of her role in my education. Sometimes, she took me to the Norwich Castle Museum on the bus. We would look at paintings together. My mother did not mind this, and she even started to have opinions about the art. I remember one time she saw a painting of a Roman soldier and joked, ""Well, I wouldn't like to meet him on a dark night!"" This was a rare moment of humor from her.

CPE_10,"**Text: Philadelphia Avenue**

I walked down Philadelphia Avenue on the odd-numbered side. It was getting dark, and the air felt thick and damp. I knew this side of the street very well. Our neighbors were the Matzes and the Pritchards, and there was Han Kieffer's grocery store. The Krings and the Pottses lived nearby, and they were my first friends, all girls. 

The houses on this street were different, even if I didn’t know everyone’s name. I remembered the small channels in the cement that carried rain from the roofs to the street. I used to skate and ride my scooter over them. As the street went down, the houses seemed to get simpler. The porches were lower, and the front yards were smaller. 

Over the years, things changed. Wooden porch railings were replaced with iron ones. In Shillington, some houses I remembered as homes became stores, and some stores, like Pep Conrad's and Han Kieffer's, became homes again. I wondered how people lived in those spaces and how they dealt with the smells of the old stores.

**Bachelor Fads Furniture Designer Rick Gilbert**

Rick Gilbert lives in a flat that used to be a curtain warehouse. It has big doors and exposed brick walls. But Rick did not want his flat to be completely open. He said it was hard to work when everything was in view. So, he used a big piece of plastic to create a hallway and hide his office. 

He wanted the kitchen to be a place where he could cook for friends or make coffee for clients. To make the flat feel warmer, he put light wood on the floors. He has modern chairs and sofas, but he also has some old furniture from his parents or from markets.

**Bruce Chatwin**

Bruce Chatwin was a writer who loved to travel. His life was full of secrets and stories. He wrote a famous book called *In Patagonia* in 1977. This book changed travel writing. It was exciting and imaginative. Chatwin sometimes changed facts to make his stories better. He believed that traveling could help people discover new histories and adventures.

**Swimming**

One summer day, it rained heavily. I ran across the lawn behind my house and jumped into the pool. I swam back and forth, watching the raindrops splash like little fountains. The best moments were when the rain got stronger, and the sound of birds disappeared. 

During this summer in 1996, I thought about swimming across Britain. I wanted to follow the rain to the sea and escape the feeling of going in circles, like a tiger in a cage. Many places today are marked and labeled, which makes them feel less real. Walking, cycling, and swimming help us feel the wildness of nature. A swimming journey would let me explore the mysterious parts of our world."
CPE_67,"**Text: 'CRYING**

Charles Darwin thought that crying did not have a clear purpose in human evolution. He was likely wrong. Recently, scientists have shown that crying is important for social reasons. Psychiatrist John Bowlby explained that crying helps create a bond between a mother and her child. Many people believe that tears, especially in children, show feelings of helplessness. 

However, it is harder to understand why adults cry. The sound of crying is not as important as what we see when someone cries. In early human groups, crying may have helped people trust each other and feel connected. 

People cry for many reasons. We might cry to show sympathy for someone who is suffering. Sometimes, we cry without meaning to, like when we hear beautiful music or moving speeches. We may also cry when watching a sad movie, and this happens more often when we are with others than when we are alone. The social reasons for crying are clear, but research is still ongoing.'"
CPE_27,"**Text: The Heat is On**

We have all heard about global warming, but how much warmer will the Earth get, and how will it change our lives? Most people know a little about global warming, but many are not sure what will happen because of it. A warmer climate will likely change the weather everywhere in the world. Since the atmosphere affects everything on our planet, any changes in the climate will also affect plants, animals, water, and soil.

Humans have learned to use natural resources to help us grow food, build cities, and support billions of people. Any changes to these resources are very important. The problem is that we do not know exactly how the world will change or what is causing these changes. Over the last 100 years, human actions have increased the amount of certain gases in the atmosphere, which are connected to global temperature. These gases are likely affecting the climate, but we do not fully understand how.

We know that the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has changed with global temperatures over the last 40,000 years. This shows that they are related. Evidence suggests that our planet has warmed by about 6°C over the past century. Most scientists believe this warming is not just natural and is partly caused by human pollution.

Many scientists are trying to predict what will happen because of higher global temperatures. They use special computer programs called general circulation models (GCMs). These programs help scientists understand how temperature, pressure, sunlight, and other factors interact to predict climate conditions. However, these models are not perfect and can be slow and expensive to use. We do not fully understand all the processes in the climate system, but we know it is complex.

Despite these challenges, most people agree that climate change will happen faster than we have seen before. The predictions from GCMs help us understand what the world will be like in the future. They suggest that by the year 2100, the average global temperature could rise by 1°C to 3.5°C, and sea levels could rise by 15 to 95 cm. We may also see more extreme weather, like heatwaves, floods, and droughts.

These changes will affect the environment and humans. Climate change can change where forests and grasslands are located, the types of species in these areas, and their ability to provide resources we need, like food and water. Some effects may be harmful, but not all changes will be bad. For example, in Australia, warmer temperatures have helped increase wheat production.

However, many predicted effects of climate change are concerning. Small changes in climate can affect water availability, especially in dry areas. The Mediterranean region is already seeing less rainfall in some places. In southern Portugal, for example, rain is now falling more in autumn and winter, with less in spring.

Another problem is that glaciers are changing. This will affect ice in the Arctic and other areas, which will impact plants, animals, and human structures. The most visible effect of global warming will be rising sea levels. Warmer water takes up more space, and melting ice adds to this. Since many people live in coastal areas, rising sea levels could lead to serious problems, like flooding in cities such as London, New York, and Tokyo. Many people could lose their homes and jobs, creating millions of environmental refugees.

The worst effects will likely be felt by small island nations, which could disappear if sea levels rise too much. This would be devastating for the people and cultures of these islands, as well as for the countries that would have to help those who are displaced."

CPE_44,"**AESTHETICS**

Art is important, but sometimes it is hard to understand. This is because we often think of art only as things we can see, like buildings, books, paintings, or statues. However, the real meaning of art comes from how we experience it. When we only focus on the art itself, we can miss its true significance.

Some artworks are very famous and admired. Because of this, people may forget the human experiences that created them. When art is seen as separate from life, it becomes difficult to understand its meaning. Art should not be isolated; it should connect with our everyday experiences.

To understand art better, we need to look at it in a different way. We should think about the normal things in life that help us appreciate art. For example, we can enjoy flowers without knowing much about plants. But if we want to understand how flowers grow, we need to learn about soil, air, water, and sunlight.

Many people enjoy things like movies, music, and comics, but they do not always think of these as art. When art is only seen in museums, people may forget to enjoy the art in their daily lives. It is important to remember that art is connected to our everyday experiences. When art is linked to the things we do every day, we can appreciate it more."
CPE_22,"**Text: Observing Lions**

Lions are often seen as amazing hunters. In the evening, a group of lions quietly comes out of the shadows to catch their food. They seem to work well together to hunt and take care of their young. However, after many years of watching lions in the wild, we have learned that their behavior is not always as perfect as it seems. 

When we started our research in 1978, we wanted to understand why lions hunt together, raise their cubs, and scare away other animals with their loud roars. We thought that working together would help them survive better. But if one lion helps too much, it might not get enough food for itself. So, why do lions work together? We thought we would find the answer in a few years, but lions are very good at resting. 

It has taken us a long time to learn about their behavior. Since wild lions can live up to 18 years, we are only now starting to understand their actions.

**Pop Music Review**

The release of Bedrock's third album was an important moment for the band. The album, called *New Life*, changed rock music in this country for many years. It moved away from the serious and heavy music of the past and introduced a lighter and more fun style. 

The songs mixed social comments with strong feelings and included sounds from fairground organs and brass bands. The band used humor and showed their true voices. They wrote songs about everyday things like sunbathing and relaxing on Sundays. But the best songs had deep feelings, like ""So Low,"" which was a beautiful song about weather, and ""To the Brink,"" a serious ballad. 

*New Life* is special because it has 16 great songs with no bad ones, which is rare for long albums.

**Extract from an Autobiography**

As a child, I was always interested in stories about 'The Sibyl,' wise women from ancient times. I first heard about one from my mother. An old woman from Cumae offered King Tarquin of Rome nine books for 300 gold pieces. He said no, so she burned three books and offered him six for the same price. He still said no, so she burned three more. Finally, he bought the last three for 300 gold pieces. I learned a valuable lesson from this story about selling and life.

I was often lonely as an only child. I wanted to play with other kids, but they would not let me. My mother told me to do something interesting so they would want to join me. It worked, and I have never forgotten that lesson.

When I had the chance to write a travel book, I looked for something that mattered to me. I don’t like to travel much, so I sent my editor a long list of places I did not want to go. I prefer to explore ruins because I enjoy traveling through time in my mind.

**What Happens to Your Manuscript?**

When you send your manuscript, it will likely go into a pile of other manuscripts waiting to be read. This pile is called the slush pile. Usually, a junior editor or an experienced editor will look at it. They want to find something new and interesting. If they like your novel, they will show it to a senior editor. 

The senior editor will need to explain why your novel is good and if it can sell well. They will also think about whether you, as an author, can be successful in the future. Publishers often want to meet authors before making an offer."
CPE_39,"**Text: Advertising Challenges**

If you work in advertising, the early 1990s were very hard years. There was a big recession, which means that many businesses were not doing well. This recession lasted a long time and was worse than expected. In Britain, in 1991, the economy shrank, interest rates were very high, and many people lost their jobs. More than half a million people were unemployed, and many homes were taken back by banks because people could not pay their mortgages. All businesses were affected, especially the car and building industries, which saw a drop of 30%.

People in advertising were not the only ones losing their jobs, but those who kept their jobs felt a lot of pressure. They were expected to help their companies make money, but they had to do this with smaller budgets. They were told to do more with less money. At the same time, companies started to realize that they needed to make products that customers wanted, not just what was easy for them to make. This idea became more important in the last ten to fifteen years.

Because of this, marketing became more important in companies. More people in management learned about marketing, and some brands started to market themselves better. This made marketing professionals more respected, but it also made their jobs harder. Many people thought that marketing could solve all problems, but this was not true. About half of marketing budgets were spent on advertising, so advertising people felt a lot of responsibility.

In the 1980s, advertising was very successful, but in the early 1990s, it faced many challenges. The bad economy made companies cut their advertising budgets and think more carefully about how much they were spending. Many companies were not sure if advertising was worth the money. They wanted to know what they were getting for their investment.

Client companies wanted better advertising strategies, better targeting, better creativity, and better media placement. They wanted the best people from advertising agencies to work for them and to be motivated to create great work. While this situation is tough for advertising professionals, it also means they have to find ways to do more with less.

There are many reasons why creating effective advertising is difficult. Some of these reasons are because of the recession, like high production costs and the fear of taking risks. Other reasons are changes in society, like the power of retailers, changing consumer needs, and new laws about advertising. Some companies also face the challenge of advertising in other countries.

Because of the economic situation and these changes, advertising professionals need to find out what works in advertising. They remember the saying, ""Only half of my advertising works. The trouble is I don't know which half."" Now, there is more pressure to make sure that advertising is effective.

Unfortunately, help for those who want to improve their advertising is not easy to find. Companies and advertising agencies are too busy dealing with these problems to share their experiences. Those who have succeeded often keep their success a secret. This means that while some events may provide useful information, many books about advertising do not help much. They often make it seem like all advertising work is of high quality, which is not true. This does not help the employees who are responsible for advertising in their companies."
CPE_18,"**The Lure of the Kitchen**

When I was in university, I wanted to be a chef. This was not a common choice among my friends. Most people wanted different jobs. Cooking seemed like a hard job. Chefs work long hours, feel a lot of pressure, do simple tasks, and do not earn much money. But I did not let this stop me. I was not happy at university. The work was difficult, and the social life was not good. Being a chef seemed like a good escape from my student life. It promised a serious and honest way of living that I did not find in college.

My wish to cook was not just because I was unhappy. I also loved the beauty of cooking. I first felt this when I ate at a famous restaurant in London. The meal was amazing. I remember my first dish very well. After that meal, I wanted to learn all the secrets of cooking. I changed my student life to prepare for becoming a chef. My history degree felt unimportant, and I learned about cooking by reading cookbooks, visiting markets, and making special meals.

**Extract from a Novel**

The swimming instructor at my school was a small, strong man with tattoos. When I asked him to teach me how to dive, he told me to sit on the edge of the pool, put my hands above my head, and roll forward, pushing off with my feet. I practiced this until the hour was over. The next time, he had me stand up and dive off the edge. He was strict, and every time I came up from the water, he looked at me with dislike and said, ""Don't look down, look up!"" ""Keep your legs straight."" ""Point your toes!"" 

The next week, I went to the high diving board. It was very high, and I felt scared. I tried to gather my courage. Slowly, I could not hear anything and felt like I was in a quiet bubble. I waved my arms like I had been taught, looked up, and jumped. For a moment, I felt like I was flying. When I hit the water, I fell awkwardly, and my legs were everywhere. The instructor looked at me with disappointment, but I still felt very happy. I thought, ""This is what they mean by 'free as a bird.'""

**The Traveller**

For people who care about having a comfortable bed, running water, and living safely, the traveller seems strange and interesting. These are people who choose to take risks. They climb dangerous mountains, sail alone on rough seas, eat insects if they have to, and can live for months in unknown places. It is easy to think of them as odd or different. They seem to live in a world far from ours, and we can ignore them, happy to return to our lives with microwaves and phones. We feel safe knowing the risks we face are predictable, like crossing a busy street.

**Sailing**

Jonathan Raban is afraid of the sea, which is probably why he spends so much time on it. He does not say he is a world-class sailor, but he is good enough. He sails because he is a writer and wants to write about sailing. Sailing gives him stories to tell. Raban's small boat has a device that tells sailors their exact location anywhere in the world. He likes this tool, but he also believes that using a compass was a mistake. He thinks it changed how people connect with the sea. Now, sailors look at the compass instead of studying the waves and feeling the ocean. The sea, which used to be full of life, is now just a space to cross. Because of this, a sailor can use an autopilot for long times. This is why Raban has time to watch the waves carefully."
CPE_62,"**Holiday Reading**

Summer gives us two great joys: leaving home and reading books. These joys are connected. Books can help us feel at home in the world. We can relate our own experiences to those in great books from the past or from faraway places. In other people's books, we find our own thoughts and feelings. Authors can express what we feel but in a clearer way. What we feel shy about is clearly written in their words. We feel thankful to these authors for reminding us of who we are.

When we read and travel, we escape our daily routines. Our eyes are wide open when we first arrive in a new place. This is also true when we read a great book, which shows us things we might have missed before. Our minds become more aware of the world around us. We notice the colors of the sky, the expressions on people's faces, and feelings we didn’t know we had.

**Author's Note**

These thoughts about travel were published as articles in the Observer newspaper over seven years. I have made some small changes to fit the articles better, but not much else. I corrected a few mistakes, but only if they were small details. If I rewrote the articles to predict future events, they would not be true to the moment I wrote them. Like any traveler, I was there, not knowing what would happen next, just trying to understand what had already happened. This is the story of modern travel: the world opening up to people who can afford a ticket. But I believe my fellow travelers were not completely unaware. Even a postcard can have a purpose.

**Ecotourism**

If there were awards for tourism phrases that have been misused, ""ecotourism"" would win first prize. This term started in the early 1980s when people became more aware of the environment. Tour operators realized that many travelers wanted to make sure their trips did not harm the places they visited. The term quickly became popular. Now, ""ecotourism"" can mean anything from living with remote tribes for two weeks to a one-hour boat trip in Australia. Any tour that includes cultural experiences, beautiful nature, wildlife, or a bit of adventure is likely called ecotourism. The original idea was good, but without clear rules, many travelers became confused about what ecotourism really means.

**Transylvanian Journey**

I lost my notebook about my trip to Transylvania for 50 years, but I found it again a few years ago. It helped me remember that time, but it was not perfect. In Transylvania, I had a much easier time than I expected, staying in friendly country houses for weeks. When I stayed in one place for a long time, I stopped writing because I thought there was nothing to record. I was slow to start writing again when I moved on, and sometimes I only wrote short notes instead of full stories. I worried that some details might be out of order when I began writing this book, so I added many warnings. But then I realized that these pages were not a guidebook, so I let the story flow without too many worries."
CPE_49,"**Text: Fashion and Writing**

**Fashion**  
Fashion is often thought of as something new, but it has a long history. Many experts say that fashion started to grow in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries when trade became more important. As societies grew and changed, more types of clothing were made, and the meanings of what we wear became more complex. Today, it is hard to know what a piece of clothing really means. For example, a man's suit can mean different things to different people.

**Writing**  
Stories in newspapers about famous authors can give a wrong idea about what life is like for most writers. Many writers, like me, do not have best-selling books. We often have to work other jobs to pay the bills. Some writers work in the evenings and have full-time jobs. Others, like me, do different small jobs, such as teaching and writing articles. I have heard of a writing job at a chocolate factory, but I have never found one. Still, by balancing part-time jobs and using credit cards, and with help from friends, I manage to write my novel.

**Sudden Fame**  
When we started performing at small places, they began to fill up with fans. We had to use secret doors to avoid being overwhelmed by excited girls. On our days off, it was hard to go outside without being followed by fans. In just a few days, we became famous. Our fans watched our every move, and our management took care of us. Even though I was still shy, I felt a strange new confidence that many shy people understand. In short, I felt very out of my comfort zone."
CPE_31,"**Text: Music - The Future of Music**

Technology is changing our lives at work, home, and in our free time. Susan Hallam talks about how this affects music in Britain. In the late 20th century, there were many new ways to listen to music, like radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, and videos. However, there were fewer live music performances and fewer jobs for professional musicians.

More people can access music now, and this is likely to continue because music meets many human needs. Music is important for national events and for personal activities. A world without music is hard to imagine. The question is not if there will be music in the 21st century, but what kind of music it will be and if people will still want to learn to play instruments.

I believe that people will still want to learn instruments. The music industry is a big part of the economy in Britain, and musical skills are important for many jobs, especially in media. Playing an instrument can also help young people develop important skills. Research in the USA shows that making music can improve thinking skills. Studies in Europe suggest that group music lessons can help children with social skills and concentration.

Current research is looking at how playing an instrument can help people learn other skills. For example, practicing regularly can help with good study habits, and playing in concerts can teach punctuality and organization. Because of this, there will likely be a continued need for music lessons in the near future.

What about the future? There are two likely changes. First, people will listen to more types of music, and new styles will mix together. Second, technology will be used more to create and perform music. This will make it easier for people to compose music, but it may also mean fewer live performances.

More people of all ages will want to make music together in their communities, reflecting their local musical traditions. To prepare for this future, music education needs to change. We need to help more people learn different instruments throughout their lives. This means music lessons will need to adapt to be relevant for more people.

Musicians will need to be trained to inspire and teach learners of all ages. They will also need skills to work with different groups and to communicate well. This is a big change from traditional music teaching, and it will require accountability to the public. 

Finally, we need to raise awareness of the importance of music in our lives. Music is essential, but it is often taken for granted. Everyone in the music profession should work together to make sure this changes."
CPE_58,"**The Actor's Craft**

Sometimes, people do not respect actors. This is often because actors talk about their work in interviews. Instead of sharing deep thoughts, they often use boring phrases or gossip. The actor Paul Scofield once wrote to a friend that acting is best when it is performed, not when it is talked about. He said that acting has no strict rules, except that the audience should hear the actor. Each time an actor performs, they start fresh and learn about their character and the story. After a play ends, the actor feels empty until the next performance. This emptiness shows when people talk about acting.

**A Review of Hamlet**

Adrian Lester plays Hamlet in a way that shows he is between being a boy and a man. His performance is simple but strong. He controls his body and emotions well, showing both anger and humor. This makes his character both scary and lovable. You can see how he waits to act, and his friend Horatio also seems to be moved by something inside him. 

**What is Acting?**

What does it mean to act? Is it copying real behavior or creating something new? This is a big question in theater.

**One Director's Approach to Rehearsal**

One director has a special way to start rehearsals called ""dropping in."" The stage manager shows the script on a screen. The actors listen quietly to understand the words. When it is their turn to speak, they look at the screen, think about the words, and wait for the right moment to talk. For example, if the line is about waiting in the rain, they might remember a time they waited in line. They should not plan too much but trust that something will happen when they act.

**The Perfect Theatre**

A perfect theater makes you feel important. Going to a live performance should feel special. The staff should care about the audience. The audience should feel close to the actors and be able to hear and see them well. The size of the theater is important too. If the theater is too big, it can feel wrong because acting is about people. Many theaters built in the late 1800s were good because they made the audience feel connected to the stage. 

When you go to the theater, you want to see something surprising and new. If not, you might as well stay home."
CPE_37,"**Text:**

**Paul Simon**  
Rock and roll in the 1950s was mainly for young people, but it was also very important for older people and the middle class. It helped create new rock stars who were inspired by this exciting music. For Paul Simon and many other young people in the US, the best way to hear this new music was through Alan Freed's radio show, called Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party. This show was very popular and many future rock stars listened to it. Like John Lennon, who was far away in Liverpool, Paul Simon loved the music from Freed's show. He was excited to move from just listening to music to making his own.

**Snow**  
I could not see a path, but I thought I would be okay if I was careful. The wind was strong and pushed me over as I walked on the slippery ice. Suddenly, the snow under me broke, and I fell into a hole that was about four feet deep. The snow had covered a gap between two rocks, and I fell through the thin layer of snow. I climbed out, feeling scared and shaken, and I wondered what would have happened if the hole had been much deeper. I sat against a pine tree that was sticking out of the snow to think about what to do next. In one hour, I had only walked half a mile. It was clear that I had to change my plan.

**Qualitative Research**  
There are many books that help researchers understand qualitative research. While there is a lot of information about collecting data, many books do not explain how to analyze that data. This can be confusing for researchers. To help, we asked different social scientists who have done qualitative research to talk about how they analyze their data. The goal was to share their experiences and make the process clearer, not to create a guidebook. This task is not easy, so we let our contributors share their work in different ways, including personal stories and more formal writing."
CPE_2,"**Simplified Text: Screen Learning**

A few days ago, I saw my six-year-old son eating noodles in a funny way. He was pulling them up with his teeth and pretending to be a dinosaur. ""I'm a little dinosaur,"" he said. He was acting out a scene from a TV show. I asked him what he remembered about dinosaurs, but he didn’t remember much. 

Many people think that learning on a screen is good, but is it really? One writer talked about using an interactive program with his son. The father read the words while the son played with the pictures. The father thought that if his son had spent ten minutes reading a book, he might have learned something. Research shows that learning happens best when there is talking with teachers or parents. We can use new technology to teach our children, but traditional education is still very important.

**Hollywood**

By 1918, most of the world’s movie-making was in Hollywood. People living there did not like this change. They thought their quiet area was being taken over by new people. But in the end, they accepted it because success is important in America. Success is measured by how much money a film makes. 

Hollywood knows a good film when it sees one. In less than a hundred years, Hollywood has changed from a small village to a famous town, like New York or Paris. It has changed a lot; a hundred years ago, you would walk through orange trees to get to the store. But in some ways, it is still a small village, with people mostly talking about films: how much money they made, who is dating whom, and who is working on what project. Many successful people try to live somewhere else but still work in Hollywood. It is the place where many people in show business want to be.

**Photography**

Photography was created by artists in the 1800s. They wanted to make a lasting record of what they saw. The new tools they used made pictures that were clearer and more detailed than paintings. This surprised other artists. Some art critics said photography could not be art because it depended on machines. 

But photographers believed they had found a new way to express themselves. They used photography like other artists use paint and pencils to show their view of the world.

**Book Illustration**

In the past, every children's book had illustrations. This also included novels for older children, but fewer were published over time. There was a lot of activity in children's publishing, but it was often low-budget, which led to some average work. However, the best artists always did their best work. 

The collection of black-and-white illustrations is a mix of good and not-so-good work. It is a great place for research and finding interesting things. The best illustrations will be shown to the public again, either through new books or exhibitions. There are signs that this is starting to happen, and soon, a publisher will likely create a series of classic children's book illustrations from this time."
CPE_68,"**Text: Blogging: Sharing with the World**

Some time ago, a website talked about the risks of telling everyone where you are online. The website said that when you say, ""Hey, I'm at this place,"" you are also telling many people about your location. Some of these people might not be the ones you want to meet. This shows that sharing a lot online can have problems.

The internet gives us many chances to share our lives with a big audience. We can share our stories, photos, and feelings. But sometimes, we realize that sharing too much can be dangerous, and we can feel lost. This can be sad, but we should not give up. There are lessons from people who used the internet before us.

In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started sharing his life online. At that time, the internet was mostly used by students and scientists. Hall wanted to share his experiences. He created a blog where he wrote about everything in his life. In January 1996, he began posting every day, and many people started to read his blog. Hall was open about his life, and he wrote about any topic.

One day, visitors to Hall's blog found that his homepage was gone. Instead, there was a video called Dark Night. In this video, Hall explained that he had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it, he was told to choose between his blog and his relationship. He felt that sharing his life online made people not trust him. The blog ended, but the problem of sharing online still exists.

In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a young woman in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job. One day, a colleague sent her blog link to the bosses at her company, including some she had made fun of. Because of this, she lost her job. 

Experts say this is called the ""online distribution effect."" This means that people often say things online that they would never say in person. But our online lives are connected to our real lives. If we forget this, we can make big mistakes.

Armstrong's story had a happy ending. After being upset and stopping her blog for a while, she got married and started blogging again about her family. Now, she is popular among ""mommy bloggers,"" and her writing helps her family. She learned an important lesson: the internet lets us say anything, but that doesn’t mean we should."
CPE_23,"**Text: Enough Sleep?**

Many people today feel tired. In rich and busy countries, not getting enough sleep and feeling anxious are common problems. In the USA, research shows that 40 million people have trouble sleeping. Some popular books in Britain have characters who cannot sleep or are about sleep research. 

A sleep expert says, ""People need more sleep."" When people are busy, they sleep less. They wake up early to avoid traffic. One researcher did an experiment. He let people sleep for up to 14 hours a night for a month. After three weeks, they started to sleep about eight hours a night. This shows they needed more sleep.

In Europe, a sleep research lab at a university studies how tiredness affects people. They have looked at how tired sailors are, how noise at airports affects sleep, and how tired drivers can be dangerous. They find volunteers by advertising in student newspapers. Volunteers are paid £5 an hour and follow sleep instructions.

Dr. Louise Reyner helps the volunteers feel comfortable. Some are worried because they wear electrodes on their heads. They think the researchers can see their dreams. But the researchers are more interested in how the body works. 

In a dark room, there is a driving simulator. Volunteers come at 2 PM, a time when people often feel sleepy, especially if they did not sleep well. They drive while answering questions. The road ahead looks endless, and the sun is bright. The young men say they will not fall asleep. Dr. Reyner has a video of one man trying hard to stay awake. At first, he sits up straight, but then he starts to blink more and more. Soon, he nods off, and the car goes off the road. 

Dr. Reyner says that drinking coffee can help. Two cups can make someone a safe driver for half an hour. She suggests energy drinks and chewing gum with caffeine for people who work at night. 

Scientists know that humans sleep in cycles. When we sleep, we go through four stages, from light sleep to deep sleep. We usually dream during light sleep. Our brains stop our bodies from moving to keep us safe. 

Scientists are sure that women sleep about half an hour longer than men, and older people need less sleep, but they do not know why. Some researchers say sleep helps us travel through time safely. 

In the past, people had different sleep patterns. A history professor studied British life from 1500 to 1850. He found that people went to bed early, woke up after midnight, stayed awake for a while, and then went back to sleep. This time was good for thinking and remembering dreams. Poor people enjoyed this quiet time away from their busy days. 

By the 17th century, with more artificial light, rich people started to sleep in a more efficient way. The industrial revolution made people work longer hours in lighted buildings. 

In some non-western cultures, people still do not have strict bedtimes. They sleep for a few hours, then wake up again. The idea of sleeping all night is not the same for everyone. In some tribal societies, noises and the need to watch for danger make it hard to sleep continuously. It seems that people everywhere need more sleep."
CPE_60,"**Simplified Text:**

I am talking about big cowboy boots. Really big boots. I stood in my expensive cowboy boots on the rocks in the Arizona desert. I wore a full cowboy outfit, but I was not a cowboy. I looked at the Arizona mountains and realized I did not belong there. I flew in from Denver early in the morning. I thought I looked like a cowboy, but that feeling went away when I saw a real cowboy at the Phoenix airport. He was wearing a dirty shirt and carrying a bag. He looked at my new cowboy boots and then walked away.

I used to be a racing driver, and I loved it. I was addicted to racing cars. But now, I do not race anymore. I wondered what I should do now. A racing driver should have other jobs ready for when he stops racing. I thought I had some ideas, but they did not work out. I thought about being a commentator for races, but there were many other drivers who wanted that job. I also tried to sell classic cars, but that did not work either because nobody was buying them.

Being an ""ex"" anything is hard. Nobody wants to hear about how I almost became the World Champion. Even if I had won, people would only listen for a short time. Last year’s champion is not important anymore. I do not want sympathy, but I miss racing. I miss the feeling of driving a fast car. I could go from zero to one hundred and fifty miles per hour in just a few seconds. I also miss the excitement and the people who cared about what I said. 

Now that I do not race, I have a lot of free time. Last week, my phone rang twice, but I have so much empty time. I looked up at the blue sky. There were no buzzards flying above me. I saw some small brown birds in a cactus nearby. They seemed to be telling me to leave their nest alone. I never thought the desert had songbirds. I realized that a fake cowboy in fancy boots still has a lot to learn. 

**Questions:**

1. What type of boots is the narrator wearing?
2. Where did the narrator fly in from?
3. What did the narrator think about being a cowboy?
4. What job did the narrator think about doing after racing?
5. How did the narrator feel about being an ""ex"" racing driver?
6. What did the narrator miss about racing?"
CPE_1,"**Text: Vancouver**

In the last ten years, many people from all over the world have moved to Vancouver, in western Canada. In the evening, residents walk around the city, and if you join them, you will probably hear different languages. People come to Vancouver for its nice weather, beautiful views of the ocean and mountains, clean and safe places, and good schools and jobs. Some people may complain about how fast new buildings are being built, but the new people and tourism have helped the city grow. 

People used to call Vancouver 'Terminal City' because it was a place where many journeys began. Now, Vancouver is more of a gateway than ever.

**Putting Pen to Paper**

Journalists like me are not good at writing letters. Some say this is because we do not like to write for free, but I think it is more about how we work. In our jobs, we try to make our writing very good, so we find it hard to write a simple letter. A true artist, who writes without thinking too much about the effect, does not have this problem. I believe that understanding the power of words is what makes a real artist. When Shakespeare wrote his famous lines, he did not think about what made them great.

**Supermarket Opening**

Opening a new supermarket used to be a big event in Britain. A famous person, like a soap star or a member of the royal family, would come to cut the ribbon. Now, new supermarkets open every day, and famous people are not needed anymore. Last week, people waiting to enter the new Superbuy store did not care who opened it, as long as they were first in line. A customer said that the first five men to enter would get a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women would get flowers. This news spread quickly, making those at the front feel proud and those who arrived late feel jealous."
CPE_53,"**Text: Citizen Kane**

The film *Citizen Kane* came out in 1941. There was a lot of excitement about it, but it was not a big success at first. People were worried about how William Randolph Hearst, who the film was about, would react. It was later shown on television that made more people notice it. Many people say this film inspired them to become filmmakers. This is surprising because it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles said that the film did well because he did not know what he could or could not do. He just made the film the way he wanted. He had a great team, including cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and special-effects expert Linwood Dunn. When Welles and Mankiewicz decided to tell the story of a newspaper owner who was like Hearst, Welles knew he had a great chance to show his skills as a director and actor.

**Dermot and Carmel**

Dermot thought Carmel was acting a bit strange that morning. He had told her twice that he might be late and that he might stop at the golf club on his way home. He wanted to talk to someone, and that was a good place to do it. Carmel nodded her head but seemed like she did not really hear him. ""Will you be okay? What are you going to do today?"" he asked. She smiled and said, ""Funny you ask. I was just thinking I have nothing to do today, so I will walk downtown and look at the shops. I feel like it is almost wrong to waste the day."" Dermot smiled back and said, ""You should enjoy yourself. If I am late, I won’t want anything to eat, so don’t worry about it."" ""No, that’s fine,"" she replied.

**Title Race**

""Tea boy? Do you mind? I am a mobile lukewarm beverage resource facilitator."" 

A recent study shows that job titles can cause problems at work. A survey found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees think job titles create divisions among workers. Most surprisingly, 70% of office workers said they would give up a pay rise for a better job title. This shows that people care a lot about how they are called at work. In the early twenty-first century, no one wants to be called ""subordinate."" The job titles focus on skills (like specialist or coordinator) but are really just fancy words."
CPE_55,"**The Vienna Assignment**

I was in Vienna to take photographs. This was usually why I traveled. Taking pictures was not just my job; it was my passion. I loved how light fell on different surfaces. A single photograph could show the beauty of a place, a city, or a person. I always hoped to take the perfect picture. As long as I had film in my camera, I could keep trying. I had a simple rule: finish one roll of film, load another, and keep looking for great shots.

Once, I took a picture of smoke from a burning oil well. It became very popular, and many newspapers wanted to use it. It was a lucky moment, but they say you create your own luck. After that, I decided to work freelance. I thought it was a smart choice, but life had other plans. The mid-nineties were not as successful as I had hoped. That’s why I was in Vienna instead of a more exciting place. But I was still taking photographs, and I was getting paid for it. That felt good.

My assignment in Vienna happened by chance. I had taken pictures in London for a book called *Four Cities in Four Seasons*. I had a good time capturing the beauty of London in different seasons. After I finished my London photos, I learned that the Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, had left his job in Vienna. Instead of hiring someone new, they asked me to take his place. The publishers liked my work, and I was available. I was happy to go because things were not good at home.

I stayed at the Europa hotel in the old city. I had visited Vienna before with my wife, but it was a busy trip, and I didn’t take many photos. This time, I was alone in January, and I knew it would be different. When I arrived, I was excited to see the beautiful city covered in snow. I was ready to take great pictures.

On my first day, I didn’t take any photos. I rode the trams around the Ringstrasse, enjoying the city’s atmosphere. The weather was cold, but it added to the beauty of the old buildings. I wanted to create my own version of Vienna, not copy what Rudi had done. I needed to wait for the right moment to take my photos.

The next morning, I woke up early. The snow from the night before made Stephansplatz look beautiful and quiet. I wanted to capture the cathedral, but it was hard to fit it all in one shot. The tall spire reached into the sky, while the base was very large. I knew I would have to focus on part of it. The weather was magical, and photography has always felt magical to me. 

In the past, people were amazed by how photographs were made. You could watch a blank piece of paper turn into a picture in a dark room. Even when you understand how it works, it still feels mysterious. Maybe that’s why what happened at Stephansplatz that morning didn’t surprise me."

**Kinetic Art**

Great news! The Hayward Gallery in London has changed into a wonderful place. This change is not because of a big, expensive show, but because of a special exhibition about kinetic art. Kinetic art is art that involves movement. This exhibition shows the history of kinetic art over the last 60 years. It shows that making art that moves or shows movement has been an important part of art in the twentieth century. 

The exhibition has many paintings, drawings, documents, and films about kinetic art. The curator, Guy Brett, has studied this topic for a long time. There are not many texts explaining the art, so visitors can enjoy looking and discovering things on their own.

David Hockney is an artist whose work many people like. Some people enjoy his art because it is easy to understand. His art often shows leisure activities and gives a break from everyday life. Some people might even like Hockney because of his fun personality and humor, not just his art. 

Some critics think Hockney is not a great artist. However, others believe he is popular because people today do not always accept artists who are very popular. Hockney knows his own limits and does not think it is important to be called a great artist. He believes that only time will tell how important his work really is.

**Window-shopping - An Art Exhibition**

In recent years, I have seen many contemporary art exhibitions. Some are great, and some are not so good. I often feel frustrated when exhibitions seem to push a certain idea or message. Sometimes this works, and we learn about new trends in art. But often, it feels forced or not genuine.

As a curator, I wanted to create a different kind of show. I worked with seven artists in an empty warehouse. The exhibition was called ""Window-shopping."" It was a collection of individual artworks that were connected only because they were all art. 

For example, Sam Cole made knitted cats that chased each other on a toy train track. In contrast, Matthew Crawley filmed a video of him opening a camera and breaking it. These artworks do not fit into a specific theme, but they can still be shown together. They do not get in each other’s way and can actually help each other stand out.

**Art History**

Many people who enjoy paintings are afraid to think too much about them. They worry that analyzing art will ruin their enjoyment. Some art historians focus more on theory than on the experience of looking at art. This can take away the pleasure of seeing and creating art.

Understanding art does not mean we cannot enjoy it. In fact, knowing more about what we are looking at can make it more enjoyable. Our feelings about art are also influenced by the society we live in. What we like in art is not just about our personal taste but also about the values of our culture. 

While it is important to enjoy art, the idea that thinking about art takes away from enjoyment is an old belief. Art can be both enjoyable and something we think about deeply."
CPE_25,"**Text: Metals**

Long ago, people in the Stone Age became interested in metals. While sitting by a river, one of our early ancestors might have found a shiny yellow stone. This stone was not like other stones; it was beautiful. This is how gold may have come into the lives of early humans. Gold is soft and easy to shape, so it quickly became very popular. 

Copper may have also been found by chance. When people saw how useful copper tools were, they began to look for copper and ways to get it from the ground. This is how metalworking started and helped our ancestors live better lives.

**St Ives**

We walked slowly down a narrow, cobbled street to the town center, carrying our heavy bags. The strong wind made it hard to walk, and we tried to avoid the cold waves that crashed over the walkway. The streets were empty, and all the windows in the houses by the water were closed tight. 

We had seen the weather get worse as we arrived in St Ives on a small train. The dark clouds made visiting Cornwall in the off-season seem like a bad idea. I had convinced my friend to come with me by promising beautiful walks along the coast and warm evenings by the fire.

**Computer Modelling**

Studying the past is difficult because it is gone. The people who lived in times of peace and times of trouble are no longer here. We cannot know exactly why they moved or how they lived. Archaeology gives us some clues, but we cannot test our ideas on people from the past. 

However, we can use computer modelling to recreate old landscapes and environments. We can create virtual communities that act like real people. We can set rules and make social groups. Then, we can change things, like the amount of rain or the number of people, and see how these digital people react."

**Vervet Monkeys**  
Cheney and Seyfarth studied vervet monkeys. One day, the dominant male monkey saw a strange male monkey nearby. The strange monkey wanted to join their group. If he did, the dominant male might lose his place. To keep the stranger away, the dominant male made an alarm call that sounds like a warning for a leopard. The strange monkey ran back to the trees. This happened many times. But then, the dominant male made a mistake. He called out the alarm while walking across the open ground. 

**What Cats Catch**  
In a small village in England called Felmersham, people counted what their cats caught. Over one year, seventy cats caught more than 1,000 animals. A professor in America thought that all the cats in Britain might kill 100 million birds and small animals each year! But this number is not realistic. Most cats live in towns and catch fewer animals than the cats in this village. The important question is: can the bird population survive? The answer seems to be yes. In winter, many people feed birds, and there are many places for birds to nest. The survey showed that cats do catch many animals, but they are not destroying the bird population in Britain.

**Buffalo's Day**  
Buffaloes are very important to the marshmen, and they take care of them. Every morning, the buffaloes leave their sleeping places slowly. They make sad sounds as they walk to the reed beds. They stand at the edge for a long time, tired, until the leader moves forward and goes into the water. Once in the water, they seem to forget what they were doing and relax. They move slowly away from the house and swim, looking tired. They spend the day in the reeds, eating green plants.

**Picasso, Pablo**  
In 1940, Picasso painted pictures of fish while he was in a fishing town called Royan. One painting shows a fishmonger’s table with a crab and some soles. The fish look alive. The painting is hard to read because Picasso used a flat pattern with overlapping shapes. The light colors make it look calm, like underwater. But there is a feeling of danger because the fish seem to be fighting the crab. The sharp shapes in the painting add to this feeling of tension."
CPE_12,"**Text: Photography**

For the last 150 years, photography has been used to capture many parts of human life. In this short time, photography has improved a lot. It helps us see moments that pass quickly and shows us both big and small things. Photography gives us images from faraway places, different parts of space, and the problems of modern life. It is an important way to express what it means to be human.

However, people have been making pictures for much longer. The first pictures were made about 35,000 years ago in caves. We are not sure why these early paintings were made. They might show real hunting events, help with hunting, be religious symbols, or just be for decoration. But pictures have always been a part of human culture.

Throughout history, people have asked how accurate pictures are and what they mean in society. Many believe that ""seeing is believing,"" which gives pictures special importance. When photography was invented in the mid-1800s, it seemed to promise a true visual record of life. The camera works like the human eye and can create fixed images that look very real.

The ability to capture images was seen as a great achievement. It was thought that everyone could understand photographs easily. For example, in 1933, photographer August Sander said that even a very isolated person could understand a photo of the sky. But as global communication grew in the late 20th century, we began to question if everyone really understands photographs the same way.

Photography is often seen as a clear way to show reality. People often show photos to say, ""This is my grandson."" Since photography was invented in 1839, the way people use and think about it has changed a lot. At first, photography was a way to keep records, but now it is more than that. Photos can tell us about the people and society that made them.

I want to show that the camera is not just a tool that records events. Photography can also inspire social and political change. For example, the changes in art during the Italian Renaissance were connected to new ways of seeing. Similarly, photography has played a big role in creating the media culture we have today, while also showing the difficult realities of the world."
CPE_26,"**How to Write Poetry**

Writing poetry can be fun, but it can also be tricky. It is important to read a lot and write often. This helps you use your imagination. Some people need to feel safe before they can write a poem, while others write to feel better when they are sad. Some people write poems on a schedule, while others wait for a good idea to come to them. All of these ways are okay as long as you find your own style. 

**The Short Story**

In a short story, it is important not to have too many characters or long descriptions. Flashbacks should be short and only used when they help the story. A memory from the main character can help move the story forward, but it should not slow it down. Dialogue, or conversations between characters, is very helpful. It can show different sides of a story quickly and keep the reader interested. A short story should have conflict and action, just like a novel, but every word must count.

**Screenplays**

Writing a screenplay for a film is like playing chess. When you play chess, you make moves without knowing exactly what will happen next. You learn to see the whole game, not just one move at a time. The more you play, the better you understand the game. In screenplay writing, the same is true. The more you write, the more you see how to create a good story.

**Looking at Writing**

People naturally learn to speak, but writing is different. Charles Darwin said that language is a human instinct, but writing is not. All children learn to speak without lessons, but writing systems were created only in a few places in history. Many children today still find it hard to read and write. Writing is something that needs to be taught, while speaking comes naturally. We need to understand how writing works and how to help children learn it."
CPE_8,"**Simplified Text:**

I have never started a book with so much doubt. If I call it a book, it is only because I don’t know what else to call it. I don’t have a big story to tell, and I don’t end with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave my reader wondering. This book is about my memories of a man I met only a few times, and I don’t know much about what happened to him in between. I could make up stories to fill in the gaps and make it more complete, but I don’t want to do that. I just want to write what I know.

To protect the people who are still alive, I have given the characters in this story names that I made up, and I have tried to make sure no one can recognize them. The man I am writing about is not famous. He may never be famous. When his life ends, he might leave no sign that he was ever here, like a stone thrown into a river. If my book is read, it will be read for its own interest. 

But maybe the way he lives and his special character will influence others, and long after he is gone, people will realize that he was a remarkable person. Then it will be clear who I am writing about, and those who want to know a little about his early life may find something useful in my book. I think my book will help my friend’s future biographers. 

I do not say that the conversations I wrote down are exact. I never took notes of what was said, but I remember well what matters to me. Even though I have put these conversations in my own words, I believe they show what was really said. I mentioned before that I have not made anything up, but I have taken the same freedom that historians take. I have put words in the mouths of the people in my story that I did not hear. I did this to make the scenes more lively and interesting. I want people to read my book, and I think it is okay to do what I can to make it enjoyable. 

A smart reader will see where I have done this, and they can choose to ignore it. Another reason I feel nervous about this work is that the people I write about are from a different culture. It is hard to know people, and I don’t think you can really know anyone except your own countrymen. People are shaped by where they were born, the places they grew up, the games they played, the food they ate, the schools they went to, the sports they liked, and the poems they read. These things make them who they are, and you can only know them if you have lived through those experiences. 

Because you cannot truly know people from another country except by watching them, it is hard to make them believable in a book. I have never tried to write about anyone but my own countrymen, and if I have done so in short stories, it is because you can write about characters more simply there. You give the reader some hints and let them imagine the details. In this book, I do not say that my characters see themselves the same way; they are seen through my own eyes."
CPE_4,"**POETRY RECITALS**

At any time in history, people may find the world of literature confusing. However, later on, it is easier to see the important writers and styles. Right now, there are many different types of poetry and many ways to write and share it. There are also different opinions about what a poet should do in society.

Today, there is a debate between two groups of poets. One group is made up of serious writers who want their poems to be read on the page. The other group is made up of popular poets who like to perform their poems for an audience. These two groups do not always agree. 

In the last twenty years, public poetry readings have become more common. Small literary groups in towns hold readings in village halls or homes. Schools and colleges invite poets to read to students. Arts festivals also have poetry readings by famous poets. 

For popular poets, performing their work is very important. Their poems are often simple and easy to understand, so people can enjoy them right away. However, serious poets, who work hard to create deep and meaningful poetry, may not be appreciated by audiences who are hearing their work for the first time. 

The problem is that serious poets might only read their easiest poems to connect with the audience. But listening to poetry readings cannot replace reading poetry on the page. It can be fun and helpful to hear poets read their work, even if they are not great speakers. It is best if the audience has the text in front of them or knows the poems beforehand.

One good reason for popular poetry readings, sometimes mixed with music, is that they help people enjoy poetry. This way, audiences can see poetry as something for everyone, not just for a few special people."
CPE_30,"**Oral History**  
Historians often use oral evidence, which means they listen to people's stories about the past. However, this can be difficult. When someone shares their memories, their feelings and the person asking questions can change the story. The historian chooses who to talk to and what to ask about. Even if the historian just listens, their presence can change how the person remembers things. The memories shared can also be influenced by other things, like what people see in the media or how they feel about their past. Sometimes, people remember things with a sense of nostalgia, thinking that the past was better than it really was. 

**Animal Science**  
There are two main ways to study animal science: the physiological approach and the whole animal approach. Physiologists study how the body works, like how nerves and muscles help animals behave. The whole animal approach looks at how animals behave in their natural environment. There are two types of researchers in this area: psychologists and ethologists. Psychologists often study a few types of animals, like rats and pigeons, in labs. Ethologists study animals in the wild and how they behave naturally. Both types of research are important, and they are starting to work together more. Understanding behavior is important, and we cannot just look at how nerve cells work; we also need to study the behavior itself.

**The Social Sciences**  
When students start studying social sciences, they have to learn two things at once. They need to understand the subject and also learn how to study it. This means they must know the facts and research, as well as the methods used to gather this information. Social sciences are about people and society, but they go beyond what we think is common sense. Each social science looks at different parts of social life and uses its own methods and ideas. These ideas help researchers understand society better and make each discipline unique.

**Classical Architecture**  
In Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building structures. The Roman architect Vitruvius said that architecture includes order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, propriety, and distribution. He did not mention utility or function at first, but he later talked about how to design buildings for different purposes. The beginnings of classical architecture are complex. Before classical times, there were simple huts in Greece and Italy that did not meet Vitruvius' artistic standards. However, these simple structures were important and influenced later architectural designs. In essence, a classical temple is like a simple hut."

The two sisters kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for a while. Lily would drive around the gardens and the railway, going over a small bridge with all four wheels in the air. This was Lily's only mistake. After that, they would go by the gasworks, which smelled bad. Chen was actually happy about what his wife was doing. ""So you can really drive, Lily? Well done!"" he said. Mui thought men were strange. Chen should have been upset, but he was excited to make plans with Lily for a trip. They decided to go on a Monday at the start of next month. This was the quietest day of the week, so they would leave early in the morning and come back by noon. This way, they would not lose any customers. Lily would practice driving around the gardens. Mui, even though she was worried, bought a road map. She got a ten percent discount, which made Chen happy, but Lily felt a bit insulted because Mui did not trust her to find the way.

After an hour of driving, they were looking at the English Channel. Lily drove very well. Even Mui, who was sitting in the back and ready to give directions, had to agree. On the road, Lily passed a couple of slow cars with great skill. Chen even clapped for her. After passing the gasworks and the lagoon with small boats, they drove smoothly along the empty seaside road. Lily parked in a small street near the sea that had many empty spaces. She was not sure about the road signs and preferred to pay for parking instead of risking a ticket. 

Lily often looked at her sister's worried face in the mirror. She thought it was better not to worry Mui about things that might not happen. Lily locked all the van doors and checked each one carefully. ""Don't worry,"" Chen joked. ""No one will want that old van."" The sisters were not happy with this. Lily told her husband he was ungrateful. Mui scolded him for being too proud. Surprised, Chen took Man Kee to look at the grey sea. He held his son close. Man Kee was warm and soft. He put his tiny hand on his father's sleeve. At that moment, Chen decided to raise his son his way. He wanted Man Kee to learn about numbers and grow up to own many restaurants.

The dark sea made Chen feel thoughtful as he planned for Man Kee's future. He saw smoke on the horizon and then a ship shining in the morning sun. Chen put a coin in a telescope and tried to find the ship. At first, he could not see it, but then he found it. It was a big, old, rusty ship. Chen lifted Man Kee to the telescope. ""Do you see the ship, Son?"" he asked softly. ""It is a special ship for people like us. It is small and old, but we know it will take us back home when we are done here. It will take you to your homeland, Son, which you have never seen."" Chen kissed Man Kee's head. 

Lily and Mui were behind them. Lily put her arm around Chen's shoulders. ""The little old ship,"" said Chen. ""Let your mother see, Son."" Man Kee did not want to let go of the telescope. When he finally did, the telescope stopped working, and all Lily could see was a blurry white light. By the time Chen found another coin, the ship was gone, and Lily could only see seagulls flying around."
CPE_43,"**THE WELL**

I read somewhere that if you dig a deep enough hole, you can see the stars when it is clear. I asked you to help me with my idea. You watched with wide eyes as I pulled up the well bucket, steadied it on the wall, and then climbed in. I told you to let me down. I didn’t think about how heavy the bucket was or that you might not be strong enough to hold it. You held the handle while I pushed the bucket off the wall. I fell into the well. I hit my head. At first, I saw strange lights. Later, I remembered how cartoon characters see stars when they get hit on the head. At that moment, I felt confused, then scared, then relieved, and finally angry at you for letting me fall. I was also worried about what my mother would say. 

You called down to me, asking if I was okay. I opened my mouth to shout, but then I heard panic in your voice, and I couldn’t speak. I lay still, watching you through my eyelashes. You ran away to get help. I waited a moment, then climbed back up and pulled myself over the edge. I landed on the courtyard stones. I heard loud voices from the castle door. I ran away to hide in the shadows by the moat bridge. 

Mother and Father came with you and old Arthur. Mother was screaming and waving her hands. Father shouted for Arthur to pull on the winch handle. You looked pale and shocked. I was hidden in the shadows, feeling excited. Then I saw the drops of water I had left from the well to where I stood. I looked in horror at the dark spots on the dry stones. At my feet, the water had made a small pool. I looked back into the courtyard, where Father was shining a flashlight into the well. The drops sparkled in the sunlight. I couldn’t believe no one had seen them. Mother was screaming loudly now, a sound I had never heard before. It scared me. 

What should I do? I had played a trick on you, but now it was serious. It went from a fun idea to something that could get me in big trouble. I was angry with myself for not thinking this through. I needed a plan. I gathered my courage and came out of hiding, staggering and blinking. I called out softly, then yelled louder when no one heard me. I stumbled a bit and then fell on the stones. 

Sitting up, I felt comforted in my mother’s arms. I said, “Phew” and “Oh dear,” and smiled bravely. I told them I had found a secret tunnel from the bottom of the well to the moat, and I crawled and swam until I got out. I thought I was almost getting away with it until Father came to me. He asked me to repeat my story. I did, but I hesitated. His eyes narrowed. I said the secret passage had fallen in after me, and it was too dangerous to look for it. I said I had barely escaped with my life. 

When I looked into my father’s eyes, it felt like looking into a dark tunnel. It was as if he was seeing me for the first time. My words got stuck in my throat. “Don’t be ridiculous, boy,” he said, sounding very disappointed. He stood up and walked away. Arthur looked at me with a sad expression, shaking his head. He could see through my lie and worried about me. His pity hurt me more than my father’s words. It made me realize how serious my actions were."
CPE_51,"**REMOVAL DAY**

Susan is a widow with grown children. She is leaving her family home. A van with the words ""Removers of Distinction"" is taking her things away. Fred, the removal man, is carefully packing her belongings. The house is beautiful, with four floors and a view of a small harbor. Susan remembers the years she spent there with her children. 

When they bought the house, her son Robert, who was five years old, asked, ""Mum, how do you get a house home?"" Now, Robert is helping her move, and he is making sure she doesn’t talk about the piano. Francesca, her daughter, is also helping. She is very bossy and wants to take care of the piano, which is a Steinway.

Fred notices that Susan is not crying. He tells her that some people cry when they see their things being taken away. Susan understands why. She thinks she should have told the movers about the piano before they started. Robert said it was the movers' job to see the problem.

The piano is in the best room of the house. They will move it last. Sitting on the stairs, Susan remembers the day they moved in. The piano was the first thing they brought in, but it got stuck on the stairs. The movers worked hard for two hours to get it inside. Robert watched with excitement, while Francesca cried, ""We can't live in a house without a piano!"" 

Peter, Susan's late husband, helped solve the problem. They left the piano outside while they moved in the other furniture. The next day, a builder took out a window, and they used a crane to lift the piano inside. The children were so happy to see it. It cost a lot of money, and they could not afford to tune it for months.

Now, the children are busy and do not come home often. Susan finds it hard to move around the house. She thinks about the stairs and remembers that the banister was not fixed perfectly. She should have told the movers about it, but it is too late now. 

Fred asks if she is okay. He tells her that the piano is the last thing to move. Susan feels nervous. Robert and Francesca come to watch. Fred talks to her, and she feels like crying. Moving her things makes her feel sad. 

Just then, the piano comes down the stairs. Fred is in front, and another mover is behind. They carefully bring it outside. Robert laughs first, and soon they are all laughing together, happy that it is over. As they walk down the path for the last time, Susan only sheds tears of laughter."
CPE_11,"**Text: Online Literary Criticism for Everyone**

**Do-it-yourself literary criticism: Is it just fun?**

From the beginning, one important idea of the Internet was that everyone could share their thoughts. In theory, anyone could publish their ideas or create a music channel online. But in the early years, you needed some technical skills to do this. 

One area that opened up to many people was book reviews. By visiting Amazon.com, the first popular online bookstore, anyone could write a book review. Amazon allowed anyone to share their opinion about a book and give it a rating of up to five stars. This was a great idea because it let readers see what others thought about a book, not just what the publisher said or what professional critics wrote.

Amazon had many customers and received a lot of reviews. However, this also led to some problems. Many reviews were submitted every day, and it was hard for Amazon to check them all. A team of editors looked at the reviews to make sure they followed the rules. For example, one-word reviews or personal attacks on authors were not allowed. Reviews that gave away the ending or used bad language were also not accepted. But since reviewers could remain anonymous, some people wrote fake reviews. 

For instance, a writer named Lev Grossman was upset by the bad reviews of his first book. To fix this, he wrote some good reviews under a fake name. His trick worked until he wrote an article about it, and then Amazon removed the fake reviews. 

Authors could also comment on their own books by clicking a link. Most authors wrote friendly messages asking readers to buy and enjoy their books. Some even shared their email addresses for readers to contact them. However, Amazon did not always check if the comments were really from the authors, except for famous writers.

The real excitement came from readers, not writers. When James McElroy's book about a cheerleading team was published, it received good reviews from the press. But some people mentioned in the book were angry and wrote many negative reviews on Amazon. These reviews disappeared after a few days. Despite this, Amazon thought it was good that so many people were writing reviews.

Amazon wanted to keep the reviews focused on the books, so they paid special attention to popular books. This meant that silly reviews were more likely to be found on pages for less-known books. For example, a classic children's book called The Story about Ping inspired funny reviews because ""ping"" is also a computer term. One long review compared the book's story to how the Internet works.

Most reviews on Amazon were serious, and they helped other readers decide if a book was worth buying. The writer George Orwell once said that reviewing too many books was hard because you had to pretend to feel something about books you didn’t care about. This is why making it easy for everyone to write reviews is a good thing."
CPE_14,"**Text: Art in Modern Times**

In modern times, especially in the last two hundred years, people often think that every artist must go against the art of their time. Art is often praised for being unique, new, and sometimes shocking. We feel good when we admire artists whose work was not appreciated in the past. But when we look at art today, we sometimes say that an artist has gone too far and that their work is not really art. The media often say this for us, and we agree because we expect art to always be new and different. We forget that today’s art also has old themes and methods.

In the past, people asked artists to create art for specific reasons, and art was part of everyday life. Now, we let artists work alone and sometimes get upset if they try to connect with us.

**Picture This**

I will describe a situation and then ask an important question. An artist picks a piece of text from an art book. The text talks about different kinds of pictures and asks, ""What are they all about?"" It then says, ""There is no end to the number of different kinds of pictures."" This sounds simple, but stay with me. 

The artist then asks someone to make a canvas for him. He tells the person to stretch and prepare the canvas and then take it to a sign painter. He asks the sign painter to write the text on the canvas in simple black letters without making it fancy. The sign painter does this. So, my important question is: is this finished work a painting?

**Underground Encounters**

At the Mercury Gallery in London until June 26, there is a rule that successful painters should stick to one style. Collectors want artists to keep making the same type of art, and if they try something new, people often feel disappointed. I am not sure why this is. Gallery owners like safe choices, and maybe art buyers want the comfort of familiar styles. 

Some artists, like Picasso and Hockney, have successfully tried new things. Eric Rimmington is another artist who is now trying something different. He is changing from painting still lifes to painting scenes from the London Underground. He finds railways interesting. His new show, called Underground Encounters, has 40 paintings and drawings that show the unique beauty of this underground world.

**Extract from a Novel**

I have come to this island with a few books. I do not know why I say ""escape."" The villagers joke that only a sick person would choose such a quiet place to live. I am here to heal myself. Besides an old woman who comes from the village to clean my house, I am alone. I feel neither happy nor sad; I feel like I am floating in my memories.

I talked about the uselessness of art but did not say anything true about how it comforts us. The comfort of my work as an artist is that in the quiet moments, I can change reality and show its true meaning. Our everyday actions often hide the deeper meaning of life. For artists, art helps us deal with the pain of daily life and fulfill our true potential through imagination. Otherwise, why should we hurt each other?"
CPE_63,"**Family Business**

""Look here, it's no good!"" said my Dad. We were in the car on the way back to London. My father, with my brother Maurice, had just picked me up from the nice girls' school I attended. He had also just been to Parent's Day, where I received a Latin prize and a prize for doing well in my exams. He had a long talk with my headteacher, and now we were going home for the holidays.

""What isn't?"" I asked, but I already knew what he was thinking because he was quiet. My father usually talked a lot. ""You can't fool me. You'll do what you want now,"" he said. ""With all those certificates, I heard you will get a scholarship to Oxford.""

""So?"" I replied, trying to act brave. ""Mightn't that be useful?""

""I also heard,"" he continued, and I knew he was going to confront me, ""that you want to be a barrister. A barrister!"" My father knew a lot about barristers and the law. ""I just said that,"" I explained. ""I couldn't think of anything else to say!""

""And apparently,"" he went on, ""you have the right personality. You can understand a lot of information quickly, you are good at talking, and you like performing.""

""I don't know about that,"" I said. ""I only know what I see on TV.""

""Be that as it may,"" he said, trying to stay calm, ""I feel like your heart is not in the family business. You will go to Oxford University, and after that, I can't see you wanting to join us.""

The problem was that, like many children in family businesses, I felt trapped by what my family expected. I saw many jobs I could do, and I wanted to explore them. But I also didn't want to upset my father. I wasn't as scared of him as Maurice was - I was his favorite - but I still found him intimidating.

""It's too soon to know,"" I said weakly.

""I tell you, you're not going to want to join us,"" my father said, who often turned out to be right about these things. ""It's a pity because you have the skills - the brains, the nerves, the vision.""

""There's still Maurice,"" I said, feeling down. My father scoffed. We both knew Maurice didn't like the business.

""Anyway,"" I added, ""you could always use me as a consultant."" My mother had died when I was young, and my father raised me and Maurice. Maurice was two years younger than me, and I took care of him because he didn't have a mother. I loved Maurice, and because the business was successful, we lived well - in a big house in London, went to nice schools, wore good clothes, and enjoyed parties and shows. My father knew many interesting people, and our house was always lively.

""I tell you what,"" my father continued. ""You can help us during the holidays until you leave Oxford, and then if you want to leave, you can. It will give you some pocket money and help me.""

""OK,"" I said, happy to avoid making choices right now, especially since my father would be upset if I disagreed with him. This was how he controlled us.

So, it happened. In my last term at school and during university breaks, I helped out, but only a couple of times a year and always with easier tasks. I became one of the smarter students, with a small house, a nice car, designer clothes, and a black dress from Paris for my final exams.

In my last term, my father came to see me and took me to a village for a meal and a chat. There were only a few weeks left. My tutor said I would get a First Class degree in Law, and I knew if I focused, he might be right. I felt ready and confident. But then my father told me that he needed me to do one last important job for the family business, and it would be worth my time.

""But Dad,"" I protested, ""I have my final exams coming up, and I need to focus on that. It's really important, and I don't want to think about anything else right now.""

I could tell my father didn't understand how much pressure I was under, and he would see my refusal as a betrayal. As he explained the job, I saw how determined he was, how clear and resourceful he was in his work. He was a kind of genius, and I respected that in him. It made my own plans seem less important.

""All right,"" I said. ""I'll do it."""

Simon Costello realized that buying the house in Pembroke Square was a mistake within a year of moving in with Lois. It was a big expense that they could not really afford. At first, it seemed like a good idea. Simon had been doing well at work, and Lois had returned to her job after having twins. She even got a raise, making her salary thirty-five thousand. Lois wanted to move because their flat was too small for a family. They needed more space, a garden, and a place for an au pair. They could have found a bigger home in a less expensive area, but Lois wanted to live in a nice place. 

Lois decided that one of them should take public transport to save money. Since her job was far away, Simon had to take the tube. The crowded ride made him feel unhappy and jealous. He thought about his grandfather's house, where he felt safe and cared for as a child. His grandmother always made sure his grandfather had peace after a long day at work. 

Lois had made it clear that her job was just as important as Simon's. They both needed to work to pay for their house and lifestyle. Now, they were worried about Venetia, who seemed angry when she came to their office. She had confronted Simon about something serious. 

Venetia said that a man named Brian Cartwright claimed Simon knew he had bribed jurors in a past case. Simon denied it, but he felt guilty. He remembered feeling scared when he was a child and had done something wrong. He looked into Venetia's eyes and saw that she did not believe him. 

He wished he had said something different to defend himself. He thought about how he should have explained that Cartwright was lying. But instead, he had told a dangerous lie, and Venetia knew it. He wondered why she was so angry and if she had the right to judge him. He was scared that if people heard about this, it could ruin his career."
CPE_36,"**Simplified Text:**

I chose this place to live because I thought I could be alone. I believed that people here would not care if the houses looked old and broken. I was wrong. People in the shops soon start to recognize you, even if you don’t know them. The beautiful roses from next door remind me that gardens used to be loved. Usually, I stay inside to forget about summer, but tonight I am watching the swifts flying between the trees and roofs. I have cut back some plants to make space for a chair, and my arms are stinging from scratches. It is a small garden in London, where plants have to grow tall to survive.

“Been doing some cleaning, I see,” says my upstairs neighbor, Jaz. She leans out of her window. Jaz is a writer, and I sometimes help her with her work because I am an English teacher. I have her latest story with me now. “How’s the work going, Jaz?” I ask. “Oh, in no other job do people ask you about your work so many times a day,” she replies. Then she says, “I have something to drink in the fridge. I’ll bring it down.” I don’t want Jaz in the garden, and I see that it looks messy. Jaz knocks on my door. “So, you’re on holiday now, lucky you.” She sits in the chair while I put a cushion on the ground where there used to be grass. “Cheers,” she says, thinking she is young. “I should have become a teacher – writers don’t have holidays. But you know what they say, those who can, do, and those who can’t, teach.” 

“What are your plans for the holidays?” she asks. I feel worried about the empty days ahead. “Actually, I’m going to Stonebridge tomorrow. Can you feed my cats?” I ask. My heart races as I speak. “Of course I will,” Jaz says, knowing she will be around. “Where will you stay? A nice bed and breakfast?” she asks. “No, I’ll stay with my oldest friend, Ruby, at the Rising Sun. We’ve known each other since we were eight.” This isn’t true, but I often deal with stories. 

“Going back to your roots. What do you think of my story?” Jaz asks about her manuscript, The Cruelty of Red Vans, which I have not read much of. I like the title and tell her so. I can see how red vans could be cruel, always bringing gifts to other houses. I decide to be honest. “Let me give you a little tip,” I say. “What?” she asks, surprised. “Try writing about nice people for a change, people who want to be good.” “Teachers!” Jaz says, acting like a schoolgirl who doesn’t want to listen. “I keep a journal where I write something good about each day,” I say. My words sound a bit silly. “Keep a journal! Nice people! Get a life, Ann.” Oh, I have a life. I work, go out sometimes, and read on the tube. 

When we go inside, my calm kitchen makes me feel better. Then I suddenly remember my old geography teacher, Miss Tarrantine, who was about my age now. She used to wink at us and say, “I’ve had my moments.” We almost laughed.

CPE_6,"**Heritage**

Heritage means the connection people have with their past. We often feel connected to our personal heritage because we know about our grandparents and have heard stories about their lives. It is important to learn about our past to understand our future. Heritage helps us feel secure about where we come from and gives us a place in history. Just like we inherit our genes, we also inherit a culture that has been passed down through generations. There may be parts of our national heritage that we do not like, but it is still a part of us, and it feels good to belong to something. Heritage teaches us many things and is important for our well-being. It influences our customs and culture. In the past, we learned about our heritage through stories from our ancestors. However, in modern society, many of these stories have been lost. Now, we can learn about our past through places and buildings. It is very important to protect these links to honor our ancestors.

**The Fens**

Some time ago, I started writing a novel called *Waterland*. I did not know then that the Fens, a part of England, would be very important in my story. People often ask me why I, a person from London, chose to write about a place I do not know well. I chose the Fens because they seemed simple and empty, a good setting for my book. But I learned that the Fens are not flat or empty. They are very English but also strange and different. It is surprising that there is a place in the middle of England that many people find unusual, especially since many other areas of Britain have become part of the country's culture. The Fens are both empty and full, both farmed and wild, and they seem open but are also mysterious. I have not visited places like Wisbech or Prickwillow, but as a writer, I enjoy creating imagined worlds. I prefer to guess about the Fens rather than find proof. This way of imagining the Fens is special because, as shown in Edward Storey's book, the Fens are not just a landscape but also a way of thinking.

**Museums**

Museums need to make their collections easy to see and understand. In the past, this meant putting items in display cases with long labels that were hard to read. Now, museums should do more than this. They can create interesting displays that catch visitors' attention and make them feel something. Museums should also reach out to the community. For example, they can provide boxes of objects for teachers to use in classrooms, and some museums now offer similar materials for elderly people who are losing their memory. Museums focus on real items from history, not copies. They help people connect with authentic objects that had meaning in the past. This is what makes museums special and different from heritage centers, theme parks, books, and CDs. Museums that create exciting displays and programs will find that their competition in ""virtual history"" can actually help them by making people want to see real history.

**Architecture and Environment**

The desire to keep things safe is not new, but changes in our towns happen quickly and affect many people. This can make some people want to preserve everything and encourage others to think more about our towns and their future. People who have lived through big events, like world wars, may want to preserve things more than others because stability is important to them. If there is a need to preserve, planners should consider it. Change is not bad if we learn how to manage it. Changes in our towns reflect changes in society, such as our population, welfare, and needs."
CPE_33,"**Text: Einstein**

If you stop anyone in the street and ask them to name a scientist, they will probably say Albert Einstein. His face is used to sell many products, like computers and books. Most people do not know much about what Einstein did, except that he created some famous theories called 'relativity'. These theories are known for being hard to understand and for making strange predictions that do not match our everyday experiences.

Einstein was part of a big change in science. Scientists were trying to understand the universe better by studying how matter and natural forces work together. Einstein made important contributions by looking at basic ideas: time, space, matter, and energy. Before him, people followed Isaac Newton's ideas, which said that stars and planets moved in a fixed space and time. Einstein changed this idea, saying that time and space are not fixed but can change.

**Young Readers**

When we were children, Lydia and I did not trust any book that won a prize because we thought it would be boring. Our mother did not like this and often showed her disapproval. But our father would give us small coins for each chapter we read to encourage us to read better books. He would also give us some special books as gifts, marked with 'This Book is NOT Literature'. We thought many of his books were for boys, but he did help us read some good stories and even a famous book of poems.

**Language**

Jacob Grimm wrote in 1851, ""The origin of human language is a secret and wonderful thing."" This secret has led to many strange ideas. In 1928, Charles Caller said that early humans made sounds like ""meuh"" when they were scared. This sound is sad. Early humans who lived in dangerous places made desperate sounds, and some words today still remind us of their fears, like ""malaria,"" which means ""fever,"" and the Latin word ""mors,"" which means ""death.""

Many people avoided talking about how language started because they thought it was silly. But now, studying the origin and evolution of language is very important. Language likely began in East Africa about 100,000 years ago. At first, people used speech for friendly communication, and it was also important in struggles for power. Sharing information was probably not the main reason for language at first, which is different from what philosopher John Locke said, who thought language was mainly for sharing knowledge."
CPE_20,"**Text: Writing Reviews**

Frank Kermode talks about how to write reviews. Most reviews are written quickly and do not last long. They have deadlines and strict rules about how long they can be. When they are published, they are only in the newspaper for a short time – maybe a day, a week, or at most a month. Because of this, many people think that writing reviews is not very important. Some believe that people only write reviews because they need money. Others think it is because they cannot spend all their time on a book or a serious project.

However, writing reviews is a skilled job. It is different to write a short review of 600 to 800 words for a newspaper than to write a longer review of 6,000 to 8,000 words for a journal. A review in a weekly magazine is usually about 1,500 words and has challenges from both short and long reviews. 

A reviewer must think about who will read their work. Some readers just want a quick summary, while others want a detailed review. Reviewers also need to know a lot about different topics and write in a way that is easy for smart people to understand and enjoy. Most reviewers also write other things besides reviews.

The American writer John Updike does not think much of criticism, but he still writes reviews between writing his novels. He collects all his reviews, even the short ones, into books with humble titles. Some people think that less famous writers should accept that their reviews will not last long, but they also want their work to be remembered, especially if they think some of their best writing is in those reviews.

I feel this way about my own writing. I mostly write academic books, which are the kind of work professors are expected to do. In English-speaking countries, it is common for the same people to write both reviews and academic studies. The time when other academics criticized professors for writing reviews is over. Now, there are many reviews, and almost everyone can write one. This is good for readers because they can trust that the reviewer knows what they are talking about. It is also good for professors because it helps them stay connected to the public. 

Professors need to remember to write in a way that non-professors can understand. When they talk to each other, they might use complicated language, but they should communicate clearly with others. In conclusion, writing reviews is important, but it is usually a secondary job. You can only write good reviews if you are also doing something else well."
CPE_40,"Text: 

Ralph unlocked the door to his apartment. When he entered the dark hall, he felt a quick feeling of ownership. Even after three years, this feeling sometimes came back when he returned home alone at the end of the day. When he first bought the flat, he would come home excited and curious, wondering what had happened while he was away. The flat felt like a welcome place for him, a space where he could be himself. 

He thought he should worry about intruders or broken pipes, but his flat always seemed to wait for him, looking either clean or messy, depending on how he had left it. Over time, he began to see it as a part of himself, a place where his thoughts and feelings overflowed. He became frustrated that it could not change. 

There were always some letters by the door and the answering machine would sometimes blink when he got home. He was thankful that his windows were not broken and that nothing had been stolen. He often looked forward to his quiet evenings at home after a long day at his office. 

On the bus ride home, he felt more like himself again and did not want to be alone anymore. At his desk, he wanted to be alone with his things, but when he got home, he felt empty. He suspected that his job, which he did not like, was changing him and taking him away from who he really was. 

He would read or listen to music at night, but he started to wonder why he did these things. His thoughts became unclear, and he felt lost. He remembered a time when he felt stronger and believed he could change his life. But he had been so eager to find something that he followed the first opportunity that came his way. 

After university, he tried to make a plan for a better life, but he only wanted to survive. He applied for jobs that his friends talked about, following them as they moved forward. He went to one job interview and did not think much about the job itself. He was happy to have a nice conversation with Neil, his boss, and did not think about the long meetings that would follow. Neil offered him the job right away, saying he was the only graduate who had applied, which Ralph took as a compliment at the time."
CPE_45,"**Goat Racing**

I was about to see goat racing. It was Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. I was moving through ice-cream vans, many people, food stalls, and loud music. Even though everyone was going to the racecourse, I pushed my way through the crowds to find a good spot. An area was blocked off to make a course for the goats. It was not like a big racecourse, but people were standing on both sides of the ground where the goats would run. They were trying to keep a few special goats in order. This was not easy because goats are known to eat almost anything.

**Canoe Trip**

As the day ended, I started to think about the night, and I felt scared. The canoe was too wet to sleep in, there was nowhere to stop, and we had not seen any villages or huts since early morning. In the dim moonlight, we used our flashlight to see the cliffs. The flashlight batteries were low, so we changed them, but the new ones did not work. We could not find a place to camp. A little later, Lesley said she saw a distant light, and we felt hopeful. But the light was just the moon shining on the waves. Soon, we heard the loud sound of rushing water, but we could not see what was happening. Time seemed to stop, and we kept moving.

**How to Be Presentation Perfect**

I am not good at making presentations, but as the managing director, I have to present to my colleagues and to important shareholders. How can I get better at presenting and feel more confident? You are not alone. Making a presentation is different from running a company, but many leaders need to be good at it. If you want to convince your audience, you must believe in what you are saying. Show your belief with passion and enthusiasm. This means you need to prepare well. Test your ideas before the presentation. Ask your colleagues what tough questions the audience might ask. You also need to create a positive atmosphere from the start. Begin with something everyone can relate to and then move towards your main point."
CPE_64,"**Simplified Text:**

Some activities cannot be rushed. They take the time they need. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you are impatient with mayonnaise and add the oil too quickly, it will not turn out right. If you pull hard on a tangled fishing line, the knot will get tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some things happen very quickly, while others take seconds, minutes, hours, days, or even years. Some things can be done faster, like solving puzzles or doing math. But other things cannot be rushed. If you try to hurry them, they may not work, like the mayonnaise or the fishing line.

Sometimes, we need to think quickly, but this can be a bad idea. We learn and think in different ways, and these ways work at different speeds. There are three main speeds of thinking. The first is faster than normal thought. Some situations need a quick reaction. For example, if my motorbike skids on a wet road, my body knows what to do right away. This quick thinking is called our ""wits.""

The second speed is normal thinking. This is when we figure things out, weigh options, and solve problems. A mechanic fixing a car or a student working on homework uses this kind of thinking. We often call this ""intellect."" People who are good at this are called ""clever.""

The third speed is slower and more relaxed. This is when we think about things in a more dreamy or playful way. For example, when we sit by the sea and listen to the waves, we are in a different mental state than when we are planning something. This slow thinking is just as important as fast thinking. We need time to think slowly, especially when life gets busy.

Some problems are better solved with a slow mind. Recent studies show that slow thinking helps us understand complicated situations. Fast thinking works well for simple problems. But when we are unsure about what to do, we need to take our time. For example, if we are trying to manage a difficult group at work, it may be better to think carefully rather than rush for answers.

This slow thinking is connected to creativity and wisdom. Poets and philosophers have always understood that slow thinking has its own value. Scientists are now studying these slower ways of thinking. They find that the unconscious mind can do many important tasks if given enough time. It can learn patterns that our normal thinking cannot see and solve complex problems better than quick thinking. 

**Questions:**

1. What happens if you add oil to mayonnaise too quickly?
2. What are the three speeds of thinking mentioned in the text?
3. Why is slow thinking important?
4. How can slow thinking help with difficult problems?
5. What do poets and philosophers understand about slow thinking?"
CPE_29,"**Text: Surviving in a Foreign Land**

I have been welcomed warmly. It is a friendly place in a very isolated area. There are about forty people here - scientists, students, weather experts, and satellite trackers. We all work together as a close community. My school French is just enough to communicate, but not enough to have fun conversations. I miss the small details in the language, and my phrasebook does not help me at breakfast. This is not a big problem, but at first, I felt unsure of myself. I was a little scared of mealtimes. I would wait and worry about which table to choose. I felt nervous when I spoke, and I felt anxious like I did in the first weeks of school. I still smile awkwardly or feel scared when people talk to me. I think this feeling is not about missing people or communication, but because I have lost the confidence I used to have when I could talk easily.

**Elliot**

When I first met Elliot, I was a young author, and he did not notice me. He remembered faces, and when I saw him, he would shake my hand politely, but he did not want to be friends. If I saw him at the opera with an important person, he would not see me. But then I became a successful playwright, and I noticed that Elliot started to be friendlier. One day, he sent me a note asking me to lunch. I thought he was testing me. After that, I had many new friends, and I began to see him more often.

**Alfred Hitchcock**

The film director Alfred Hitchcock said he did not care about the story of his films or the acting. He cared about the pictures and the music. For Hitchcock, it was not the message or the acting that moved the audience. He believed that people react to the film itself, no matter where they come from. So, if a film is made well, the audience in Japan should scream at the same time as the audience in India. Hitchcock was very clear and logical about his work. He was a genius who liked to hear the audience scream. He did not think about deep ideas or complex meanings. He focused on the film and how it could affect the audience."
CPE_57,"**Text: Amateur Astronomy**

Many things have changed in astronomy in the last 50 years. Until about 30 years ago, there were not many charts and catalogues. Telescopes were not very good, and there were few books about practical astronomy. Today, there are many types of telescopes and equipment available. Electronic calculators and computers have made it easier to create charts and analyze observations. This is a great time for amateur astronomy. 

However, some things have also been lost. Now, you may have to travel 80 km to find a dark sky, which was easier to find in cities 50 years ago. During the day, the sky is often filled with airplane trails that can last for hours and make it hard to see the sun and stars at night.

**Too Much Choice**

Today, there are too many choices in life. There are many things to do and many products to buy. People want the newest things, and technology makes this happen faster. New products come out all the time, and it can be overwhelming. More choices can lead to more stress and less time. Because of this, many people are looking for ""simplexity"" - simple things that make life meaningful in a complicated world. But it is not easy to simplify life when there are so many options. There are more brands of detergent and breakfast cereals than we need, and many software updates and plans to choose from.

**McAndrews Hotel**

Every summer, we spend two weeks at McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. This is a family tradition started by my grandmother, and it is very important to us. Nothing can change this tradition. The guests at McAndrews are old-fashioned and maybe a little snobbish. I do not like the bad manners of shop assistants today. I do not enjoy the friendly behavior of waiters who seem to want to be too familiar. 

I know the names of many guests because they have been coming here since they were children, like me. When I see them in the hotel, we only say a polite hello. This respect for privacy is hard to find in hotels today."
CPE_9,"**Text: Othello**

A great production of Shakespeare's play Othello has moved from Stratford to London. I want to say sorry for a bad review I wrote when the show first opened last spring. I said that Ray Fearon was too young to play Othello, and I was wrong about his acting. I still believe that Othello and Desdemona should have a bigger age difference, but I take back my words about Mr. Fearon's amazing performance. The whole cast is wonderful. 

Some memorable scenes include when Cassio plays competitive games with other young officers, and things get out of control. Another important moment is when Iago starts to lose control and struggles to keep himself together. The scene where Emilia helps Desdemona get ready for bed is very emotional. The pace and tension in the play are great. Do not miss this show!

**Lake Vostok**

In Antarctica, there is very little life. On the edges of the continent, there are many penguins, seals, and birds. But in the middle, on the big white plateau, there is no life. However, there is a large hidden lake called Lake Vostok under almost 4 kilometers of ice. This lake is under the coldest place on earth. The water has been cut off from air and sunlight for up to 25 million years. Scientists are excited to explore this lake and find out what strange life might be there. 

For two years, researchers from around the world have been trying to learn the secrets of the lake. If they succeed, we will see many discoveries about Lake Vostok in the next few years.

**Scientists**

Last week, I heard something interesting on the radio. Some scientists are thinking about why they want to be scientists. We all know that they want to learn about everything, from tiny atoms to big black holes. But these scientists want to understand why we want to know these things and why science cannot explain this desire. 

I believe it is more important to know if what scientists do is right, rather than argue about why we want to know. The key point is that science is a tool, and we should decide how, when, and why to use it."

**Food**  
Food is very important and makes us happy. Many people who like cooking buy cookbooks. Sometimes, we think cooking is only for special occasions or fancy dishes, but that is not true. You can make a tasty soup by putting chopped carrots, a leek, celery, and some herbs in water. This is better than buying soup in a packet or a can. Instead of buying a sweet chocolate dessert full of chemicals, you can make a delicious treat in just five minutes that everyone will enjoy. Cooking is also a way to show care and love. Sharing food is important for our happiness, which is why we celebrate special events like birthdays and anniversaries with food. No one would want to have fast food at a wedding or anniversary party!

**In the Elevator**  
This morning, Alistair tried to clean his office, but there were still papers everywhere. Tax forms were sticking out of drawers and boxes, waiting for him to organize them. He also had a lot of papers because he owned an apartment building. As the elevator took him to his floor, he knew Mallory would be on time for their meeting. She always arrived exactly on time. He wondered how she would feel about the mess. She might think someone had made a mess in his office. He could pretend to be surprised when he walked in after her. His cleaning lady, Mrs. Wilson, had come while he was trying to clean the floor. He smiled at her, hoping she would help. But she looked at him with a hard expression and went into his apartment, which was her job to clean. He knew she thought he was different from her, like he was from another place far away.

**Karen**  
Karen wanted to be different from her mother. This made her create her own story, a story of strength. One important moment in her life was when she was twelve years old. Her brother accidentally hit her in the eye with a golf club. At first, she thought she would go blind. But the doctor later told her that her bone had protected her. She only needed a few stitches. When she opened her eyes in the doctor's office and saw her mother, who was talking about miracles, she felt that she was saved for a reason.

**Miss Fogerty**  
Miss Fogerty was walking quickly across the wet grass in the village. She felt both excited and sad about what she had just seen. It is always thrilling to be the first to know something important in a small town, and Miss Fogerty's life was usually quiet. But she was very sad about Dr. Bailey's health. He had been her doctor for many years, and she appreciated how he cared for her when she had throat problems. She thought his best quality was that he always made time for his patients and listened to their worries. This is why the villagers loved him so much. He always gave his time, knowledge, and humor to help others, and in return, he received their loyalty and affection."
CPE_59,"**Joanna's Lessons**

Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist. She plays music for many people. But she also writes books for young children who want to learn the piano. Joanna plays the piano very well. She can play many different styles of music, like classical, jazz, and blues. At a concert for kids, one boy asked her, ""Can you play Match of the Day?"" This surprised her, but she thought it was funny. She knew that for him, she had to play that song to be a real pianist.

Joanna cares a lot about how children learn to play the piano. She has written a book called *Joanna MacGregor's Piano World* for beginners. Even though she is very busy with concerts and other projects, she wanted to help children learn music. She believes that the first lessons are very important. Many people think only about the best musicians, but Joanna thinks everyone should enjoy music, no matter their skill level.

When she was younger, Joanna taught many children how to play the piano. She remembers how much fun it was to play music with them. She wants all children to have the chance to learn the piano, just like they can learn to swim or speak a little French. Some kids learn quickly, but others take more time and sometimes give up. Joanna worries that some parents push their children too hard to be perfect, which can make them stop enjoying music.

Joanna's books are colorful and fun. She includes stories and music on CDs to make learning easier for kids. She believes that learning should be fun. Children should be able to play freely and try new things on the piano. As they learn, they also need to practice reading music. Joanna understands that this can be hard, but she thinks practice is very important.

She did not practice a lot until she went to music school, but now she loves to practice. She spends many hours each day playing the piano. Joanna wants to help children who find it hard to practice. She says it is important to know what you want to do before you start practicing. She also suggests playing through a piece of music, even if there are mistakes, and mixing easy songs with harder ones."
CPE_54,"**Simplified Text: Writing by Hand and on Screen**

Dr. Johnson said, ""What is written without effort is usually read without pleasure."" This means that good writing is hard to do. When I look at my old school essays, I see that I did not cross out many words. Today, I would change my writing many times. I think this is because writing by hand is hard. Writing slowly helps me think better. When I write by hand, I take care with my words. 

Using a computer is easy, but it can make writing messy. Many writers spend a lot of time fixing their work on a computer, just like they would if they wrote by hand. Also, emails are not as personal as handwritten letters. Many people now send love letters by email, which is good. At least they are writing in English and using some grammar. But words on a screen can feel boring. People often do not think carefully about their words when they write quickly on a computer. 

One day, I put down my cup and looked at a CD. The case was not nice, but the shiny disc inside looked interesting. ""Wonderful little things, aren't they?"" Mr. Warriston said when he came back. I agreed and gave him the disc. ""It's amazing that they can fit seventy minutes of music on these,"" he said, turning on the music player. Lights turned on, and he opened a small drawer. He put the disc inside and closed it. ""Some people say they sound cold, but I think they..."" I asked, ""Do you have to turn them over like records?"" ""No,"" he said. ""You only play one side."" I wondered why. He thought for a moment and said, ""I don't know. You could make both sides playable."" He smiled at me. ""Good point."" He then told me to sit in the best place to hear the music.

**Books versus Electronic Text**

Malcolm Bradbury said that if matches were invented after cigarette lighters, we would think they were amazing. Many people say that electronic text is as important as the invention of printing. They think it will change everything. But it takes a long time for people to change how they think. In 1979, a book said that books would slowly disappear in the 1980s. This was wrong. 

Reading long texts on a screen is not enjoyable, so many people do not do it. Computers make it easy to read only parts of a text. Some people say this is good because it creates new ways to tell stories. But many books have always been read in parts, like religious texts and dictionaries. The problem is that computers do not help people read everything from start to finish.

**The Office**

Charles walked into the office and saw everything was neat. The carpet was clean, and the desk was dark wood, just like he remembered. Files were in their right places, and twelve years of trade journals filled the shelves. Kathleen was trying to close a filing cabinet and then looked at him. ""You have to use computers, Charles. This is too much,"" she said. 

""Hello, Kathleen. This is amazing,"" he replied, admiring the room. He did not want to think about computers. They had talked about this many times. She did not understand why he did not want to use technology, even though he was good with computers and had written an important paper about them. She could use any software and make it do new things."
CPE_32,"Text: ""You don’t take sugar, do you?"" shouted his secretary. She was not really asking; she was stating a fact because she had been making coffee for Lancelot for many months. She forgot sometimes because he was not usually supposed to be there. But now, he was there all the time. He realized that if he stayed away, things would get very busy. 

He thought about how he had changed from a valued helper, meeting authors and playwrights for lunch, to someone who was always rushing to fix problems and had nowhere to park when he got to work. 

""This came,"" she yelled, waving a folder before putting it in front of him. ""From that guy in Los Angeles. You wanted to see it."" The label said: ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert."" Under that, it said ""An Expanded Synopsis."" Lancelot did not want to see the word ""synopsis."" He wanted to see ""A First Draft."" He had already seen a synopsis of this book and did not want to see another one, even if it was changed. 

Ian Cuthbert had received a lot of money for this book when Lancelot bought the company. Ian was one of Lancelot's old friends, and he was a good example of how some people do not change their behavior, even when they should. Lancelot skipped the introduction he had read many times and looked at the synopsis. He recognized almost every phrase. He closed the folder and pushed it aside. It was clear that Ian's manuscript would not be ready soon. 

The synopsis was not as brilliant as people said Ian was. It had a cheerful tone, but it felt empty. Lancelot remembered a famous author who had published an incomplete book after he died. That author had been paid little by little for each chapter. But Ian had received a lot of money upfront, which was not how things usually worked. 

Lancelot remembered when Ian was a promising talent in Cambridge. Ian's friends wanted to take over British theater, and they did. But Ian seemed lazy compared to them. He wore his coat like a cape and talked about famous writers as if he had met them. For some reason, Ian's creative talent stayed hidden. While others became successful, Ian stayed away from the spotlight. 

At the height of his influence, Ian was hard to work with. He was supposed to edit a magazine about the arts, but it never got published. His contract with a fashion magazine was renewed three times, but he still did not produce much. At meetings, he was sarcastic and critical of others' ideas. Ten years later, he could hardly be counted on to show up for anything. Lancelot was starting to think that ""A World History of the Short"" had been a mistake from the beginning."
CPE_65,"**Text: England's Breakfast Revolution**

A good breakfast is very important, according to health experts. However, breakfast is a new idea in England. In medieval times, people did not often write about breakfast. Some travelers ate a meal at dawn before long journeys, and sick people had breakfast for health reasons. But most people did not eat breakfast unless they were kings or nobles.

In the sixteenth century, breakfast became more common. Some writers say this happened because food was easier to get. But there were also big changes in society. For example, more people had jobs with set hours. Many of these jobs started very early in the morning. So, eating breakfast became necessary for everyone, not just for rich people."
CPE_61,"**Text: Photography and Sport**

**Photography**  
When a photographer takes a picture, they choose what to show based on their skills, personal views, and experiences. They also think about social and cultural ideas. In this book, we will see how these things affect the style and meaning of a photograph. We will also look at how people see and react to these images. For example, when someone reads a newspaper, they usually understand the photos without thinking too much. But we can ask if the photo really shows what happened at that time. Does it show the photographer's opinion? Is the exact moment important, or does the photo represent something bigger in the world?

**Sport**  
For me, sport is more than just a game. The best athletes believe in themselves completely. To be the best, you need to focus and put everything else aside. Sport is tough, and no one will do it for you. You either succeed or fail. Sport has taught me discipline and determination, but it also shows the importance of teamwork. My sport lets me shine as an individual, but it is also a team game, and I must balance both. It is like life – you can do well alone, but you must remember others around you. Sport has given me a lot, not just money. It has opened doors for me and shown me things in the world that many people will never see. But you also have to give up a lot to get these rewards.

**A Special Memory**  
Some experiences stay in our memory very clearly. For me, one special moment happened one night in California many years ago. I was awake, listening to a mockingbird singing from a tree in my neighborhood. I was not awake because of insomnia; I was awake because the bird's beautiful song kept me up. As I listened to its melodies, I felt like I was in a special musical world. To understand the bird's song, I thought about my experiences with jazz and Indian classical music. The bird made me feel like I was hearing an amazing live performance. I cheered and groaned as the bird sang different tunes through my open window, until I finally fell asleep."
CPE_52,"**Simplified Text:**

People have always had strong feelings about birds. Some love them, some fear them, and some even worship them. But what does this say about us? 

In a greenhouse, a little brown bird called a wren is bumping against the glass. Is it trying to tell us something, or is it just lost? Depending on how you see it, both ideas could be true. 

Wrens have been part of British culture for a long time. In the past, people believed that the way wrens flew could tell them about their luck. Today, we still see images of wrens in homes across Britain. Even if old beliefs about them are not as strong now, people still care about wrens. A place without wrens feels sad. 

This connection to birds comes from a time when people relied on nature for survival. They learned to understand the importance of different animals. Over time, ideas about birds have changed. 

For example, the red kite bird was once seen as a helpful bird in London, taking food from children. But later, people thought of them as pests, and they almost disappeared. Now, red kites are protected again and are important for conservation efforts in Britain. 

Our interest in birds goes back to early humans. They watched birds to know about danger, weather, and food. Birds also connected them to their dreams. When we think about why birds matter to us, we also think about who we are. Birds can fly, sing, and seem free, which makes us admire them. 

Some people think our feelings for birds are old and not important now. But these feelings are still part of us, and losing them would be hard. That is why birds are now seen as signs of environmental change. In Britain, 30 bird species are in danger, which is sad because it means losing not just birds but also part of our culture. 

Certain birds, like the skylark and turtle dove, represent love and magic in stories and poems. Losing these birds makes us feel sad, but we often ignore the loss of other birds that are not in stories. 

Folklore, which includes stories and legends about birds, is very important. These stories connect us to birds in a way that scientific facts do not. They help us feel emotions that are often hidden in our busy lives. 

Whether we watch birds on TV or in our gardens, the joy we feel cannot be fully explained by science. Birds are fascinating in ways we do not always understand. The wren in the greenhouse connects our present with a long history, and its song makes us think about the future."
CPE_28,"**Text: Maps**

A map shows the locations of places and features on the earth. It helps us understand how far things are from each other and in which direction to go. In the past, people often measured distance by time, like saying ""it takes so many hours to walk"" or ""a day's journey by river."" This way of measuring was more about how easy it was to travel than the actual distance.

Direction is also important, but for most travelers, the main questions were ""Where do I go from here?"" and ""How far away is it?"" Because of this, written directions were often used instead of maps. Even today, some maps, like those for trains, do not always show true directions.

In the past, important landmarks were shown on maps with signs that varied in size to show how important they were. Different maps used different styles based on their purpose and location. To understand old maps, it is important to know the style used.

The history of making maps, called cartography, shows how we have become better at measuring distance and direction. Over time, people used science to help make maps. For example, instead of using shadows or stars to find direction, they started using a compass. They also learned that the earth is not a perfect sphere, which helped improve maps.

As time went on, more people started using maps, not just travelers and merchants. Soldiers needed accurate maps for battles, especially after new weapons were invented. This led to the creation of contour maps, which show the shape of the land. Other people, like archaeologists and historians, also needed maps for their work.

Today, mapmakers create maps for many different uses, like showing land use or climate. The importance of maps in many fields has led to a new interest in cartography. 

It is important to remember that the development of maps has not always been smooth. There have been times of slow progress and times of quick change. Sometimes, old ideas stayed alongside new ones. Mapmakers often had good ideas but had to wait for better tools to use them. Because it is easy to copy old maps, some map publishers have been slow to accept new ideas. 

Therefore, we should not always trust maps as the best evidence of what we know today. The many maps we have now are the result of a lot of hard work and thought. They are valuable records for studying human history, which makes learning about old maps very interesting."
CPE_35,"**Simplified Text:**

I met a young man named Andrew Lloyd Webber in his nice room. It was much better than the messy rooms where his family lived. Andrew had a lot of records, the first stereo record player I had ever seen, and even expensive wine glasses. He was a student at Magdalen College, Oxford, studying history. He wanted to be a famous composer like Richard Rodgers. I also had big dreams; I wanted to be a pop star for reasons like money and fame. 

When Andrew asked me to try to be a famous lyricist like Oscar Hammerstein, I agreed. He played me some of his music, and I could tell he was very talented. He needed someone to write lyrics for his songs. I didn’t have much to show him, except for a song I had written that a small band recorded. We promised to meet again and write something together. 

I was still more interested in pop music than in theater, but I knew Andrew was special. I thought it would be exciting to work with him. The next day, back at my office where I was training to be a lawyer, I felt less sure about my future in music. I thought I would probably become a lawyer by the time I was twenty-five, as my father expected. This worried me because I wanted to enjoy pop music for longer. 

I decided to see Andrew again. He was interesting and talked about food and architecture. He had an idea for a musical about Dr. Thomas Barnardo, a man who helped orphans. I thought the story was good but not very exciting. However, Andrew believed in his music, and I wanted to help him. 

I started to write funny songs for the musical. Andrew told me the story and played the music. I even skipped work one day to write lyrics. I didn’t know it then, but I was starting a new career."

**Language**  
You and I are part of a special group of living things. We can share our thoughts and feelings with each other using language. Language is very important in our lives, and it is hard to think of life without it. If you see two or more people together anywhere in the world, they will probably be talking. When people are alone, they often talk to themselves, their pets, or even their plants. I like to think of language as a natural skill. This means that people know how to talk, just like spiders know how to make webs. Spiders do not learn to make webs from someone else; they just know how to do it.

**Climate and Weather**  
Climate and weather are made by the air around us, and they greatly affect animals and plants. Climate can change how a place looks. For example, warm and wet weather all year allows tropical jungles to grow, which have many different kinds of plants and animals. In cold and windy places, there are only a few living things. The daily weather changes that create the climate happen because of big air movements. The air is always moving because the Earth spins. The sun also causes a lot of this air movement.

**Coffee**  
As a barista, my job was to serve drinks, but I also had to make coffee. In Lygon Street, Melbourne, a restaurant's success can depend on its coffee. I had several days of training to learn how to make coffee and clean the espresso machine. I learned how to make a good cappuccino. By the end of the week, I realized that making good coffee was harder than it seemed, and I thought I might have to do simpler tasks again. Luckily, my boss was patient. He told me, ""Making coffee is both an art and a science, and you need time to learn it."""
CPE_41,"**Text: Art on TV**

Why does television often have problems with programs about art? Painting and sculpture are good subjects for TV because the camera can show the whole artwork and then zoom in to see the details. However, there are not many TV series that show the joy and complexity of looking at art. 

A good example of this is Robert Hughes's series called *American Visions*. Hughes is a trusted critic with a strong personality, and he had almost eight hours to introduce British viewers to American art, which British galleries often ignore. I thought the series would focus on famous artworks. Instead, it was about how American history and culture are shown in its art and buildings.

**Dealing in Metals**

For 20 years, I worked as a dealer in metals and became known as a speculator. The metals market has fewer rules than other markets. With some luck, a willingness to take risks, and a good understanding of the market, it is possible to make a lot of money. Taking risks is part of this business. This adventurous culture fits well with a free-market economy. 

However, the free-trade economists who said the market would keep the prices of rare metals high have found that the opposite is true. More minerals are being taken from the ground, and the prices of raw materials are going down. If we consider inflation, the prices of most metals are about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to look into claims against a big company that benefits from these cheap raw materials.

**Extract from a Holiday Brochure**

Abaco and its small islands are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas, which stretch from Florida to Cuba. Each island has its own character and something special to offer. To get around the islands of Abaco, you need a boat. If a boat is not included with your room, don’t worry. There are many ferries and water taxis. You can also rent a boat if you want to explore on your own. 

Sailing is the most popular way to travel here. Abaco is called 'The Sailing Capital of the World' for a good reason. The calm waters are also great for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The islands and their beaches stretch for 200 miles like a string of pearls. At night, the lights of the restaurants and cafes in Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay shine brightly."

You can build your own bike at the Bamboo Bike Club in the UK. This workshop is run by two engineers, James Marr and Ian McMillan. You will get a custom bike frame designed by a computer and have a fun weekend building your bike.

It is Saturday morning in Hackney Wick, east London. The Bamboo Bike Club is the only place in Britain where you can build a bamboo bike. I went to see what was happening. There is a lot of energy and fun in the workshop. Bamboo is becoming popular for making bikes. Companies like Calfee Design and Bamboo Bikes have been making bamboo bikes since 1894. But many cyclists find bamboo bikes too expensive. A ready-made bamboo frame can cost about $2,995 or £1,868.

James and Ian wanted to make bamboo bikes that everyone could afford. They spent years working in a shed in Brecon, Wales, to create a business. They wanted to share the joy of making something special and sustainable. Now, the Bamboo Bike Club is more about community than business. James works on wind turbines, and Ian is a civil engineer. They run monthly courses where you can build your own bike frame at a good price.

On the first day of the course, James and Ian teach how to choose strong bamboo and how to make strong joints. They help you glue the bamboo tubes together to make the bike frame. They also use metal tubes for parts that need to be strong, like the handlebars and wheel forks. This can be hard for someone who is not good at DIY. But James and Ian are there to help. They check every cut and joint to make sure everything is right. If you make a mistake, it’s okay. You can just try again with a new piece of bamboo.

On Sunday, you spend time building the lugs, which are the parts that connect the frame. You wrap the joints with hemp and glue them to make them strong. After adding a waterproof coating, your bike is ready for wheels, brakes, and other parts. James and Ian say their bamboo bikes are as strong as metal bikes. Ian has used his bike for over a year, and James has tested his bike off-road for three months.

The bamboo bikes may not look as perfect as metal bikes, but they are unique. James and Ian believe that these bikes are meant for a relaxed ride, not for racing. I chose a 'Classic English' frame for a smooth ride. When I tried James's bike, it felt light and smooth, even on bumpy roads. James says the best part is riding the bike. The bamboo bikes are fun to ride and cost less than £500."

Diane Reverend was an editor at Random House in New York when she first saw a book by a new pop psychologist, Dr. John Gray. ""I knew it would be a bestseller,"" she says, and she was right. Dr. Gray is now very rich, and Diane has her own company. Dr. Gray's small book helps men and women communicate better. This book is very popular and is part of a big self-help industry in America. This industry tries to help people improve their lives, but it also creates many new problems. In Britain, people see that many self-help books are not very good, but many are published anyway. For every self-help book that is published, many others are not accepted because they are too similar or too specific. Editors are looking for the next big hit, and they care more about how well a book can sell than how well it is written. Diane says, ""If someone has a catchy title, that is a big part of the success.""

**Autobiographies**  
When someone writes an autobiography, there is an agreement between the writer and the reader that the truth will be told. However, this agreement is often not kept. Writers may leave out things they feel are too shameful or not important. Sometimes, writers think that telling a story in a different way can show the truth better than just telling the facts. They may call their book an autobiography to make readers believe it is true, even if it is not. This can happen without any bad intentions.

**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**  
People who study detective stories say that this type of story shows the problems of society in the late 1800s and early 1900s. In a detective story, a crime represents a human desire, like greed. Solving the crime helps society return to normal. In Hammett's stories, society is shown to be corrupt. The detective and the criminal understand each other and are connected in a strange way. The detective is part of both the law and the crime world. Sometimes, he feels guilty about this connection, and sometimes it makes him more determined to catch the criminal.

**Science Writing**  
Stephen Jay Gould is a famous science writer. I met him at the Grand Hotel while he was promoting his new book. He said that writing in a fancy place like this is hard. He believes that only scientists can write well about science because they understand it best. He says, ""Never write down to the reader."" You can make the language easier, but you must keep the main ideas clear. If readers feel that you are talking down to them, they will not enjoy your writing."

At Cannons Gym, a popular place for City of London workers, it is very cold inside. To handle the hot summer, the gym uses a lot of air-conditioning. Sometimes, when it is quiet, the gym feels like it is in the Arctic. This shows how people often use air-conditioning too much. It is now a common part of work and fun, showing how we can control the temperature. However, many buildings with air-conditioning could use other ways to stay cool. They could use sunlight and fresh air, and have thicker walls that keep heat out during the day and let it go at night. These ideas are simple but can really help and would reduce the need for air-conditioning.

**Sundials**

It is interesting that as we start a new millennium, more people are interested in sundials. Sundials are tools that tell time by the sun's position. A hundred years ago, they were very important for keeping time. But as clocks and watches became better, sundials were seen as just garden decorations. Now, people are looking at them again. David Harber, who makes sundials, thinks they are special because they connect us to the planets. He says there is a magical moment when a sundial starts to work. They are calm and beautiful objects that remind us of our place in the universe.

**Paint Your Own China**

My idea of china-painting came from a visit to an arts and crafts show. There, serious-looking older women showed how to paint flowers on a teacup with careful brushstrokes. It was amazing to watch because each stroke made a perfect petal or leaf. Their hands were steady, and the paint never smudged. I thought these women must have practiced for many years or had a special talent. Because of this, I wondered what kind of people would join a china-painting class. Would beginners be good at it? But when I went to the class, it was not scary at all. Everyone was there to have fun, and even the teacher did not want to paint like the women I had seen before."

Uncle chose a holiday for Keith and Dawne. It was a good price: a flight from Gatwick Airport, twelve nights in Venice, in a hotel called Pensione Concordia. When they went to the travel agency to book the trip, the clerk told them that other people in the group were students from the south coast, all learning Italian. But something went wrong. They ended up in a hotel called the Edelweiss, in Room 212, in Switzerland.

At Gatwick, they gave their tickets to a girl in a yellow-and-red uniform. She checked their tickets and said everything was fine. An hour later, they were surprised to hear older people on the plane speaking with accents from the North of England. Keith thought there must have been a cancellation or that the Italian class was on another plane. They ordered drinks on the flight.

When they landed, a woman with glasses told them to stay together. The brochure did not say anything about an overnight stop, but when they arrived, Keith realized that was what it was. It was close to midnight, and they were tired, so they did not question the beds they were given. But the next morning, they found out they were supposed to stay in the hotel for their whole holiday, and they became worried.

""We have the lake and the water birds,"" the receptionist said with a smile. ""You can take a boat to Interlaken."" 

Keith told the man, ""There has been a mistake. We were meant to be in Venice, in the Pensione Concordia."" 

""I do not know that hotel. This is Switzerland,"" the receptionist replied. 

""A coach is supposed to take us on. An official said so on the plane,"" Keith insisted. 

""Your group is booked for twelve nights in the Edelweiss Hotel. If you have changed your minds..."" 

""We haven't changed our minds. There has been a mistake,"" Keith said firmly. 

The receptionist shook his head. He did not know about any mistake. Dawne then said, ""The man who made the booking was bald, with glasses and a moustache."" She gave the name of the travel agency in London. 

""Is there a problem?"" a woman said, smiling at Keith. She was the same woman he had seen at Gatwick. 

""My name is Franks,"" she said. ""I am married to the man with the bad leg."" 

""Are you in charge, Mrs. Franks?"" Dawne asked. ""We are in the wrong hotel."" 

Mrs. Franks smiled and gave the name of the travel agency again. Keith interrupted, ""We got into the wrong group. We told the Your-Kind-of-Holiday girl and left it to her."" 

""We should have known when they weren't from Dover,"" Dawne added. ""We heard them talking about Darlington."" 

Keith was annoyed and wanted Dawne to stop talking. ""We noticed you at Gatwick,"" he said. ""We knew you were in charge."" 

""I counted you, but you did not see me,"" Mrs. Franks said. ""Let me explain. Your-Kind-of-Holiday sends clients to many places. There are different holidays at different prices."" 

""All tickets and labels look the same, yellow with two red bands,"" she continued. ""If you followed other people with the yellow-and-red label, you might think you could end up anywhere!"" 

""But we are not meant to be in Switzerland,"" Keith insisted. 

""Let’s see,"" Mrs. Franks said and then walked away, leaving them standing there. The receptionist was gone, and they could hear typing. 

""She seems nice,"" Dawne whispered. Keith was not listening. He thought about everything that had happened: giving the tickets, waiting, and then getting on the plane. 

""Nice to have some young people along,"" an old man said. He and his wife looked very old. They said they had the best sleep because of the lakeside air. 

""That’s nice,"" Dawne said. Keith walked out of the hotel, and Dawne followed him. They did not say anything about the funny situation they were in. On their first holiday since their honeymoon, they had ended up on a tour with older people when they wanted to escape from them. Uncle had said this when they tried to get him to come with them."
CPE_48,"**Text: 'HE WAS A PEOPLE PERSON'**

American business leaders are looking to the explorer Ernest Shackleton as a good example of management. Eluned Price reports.

Most people in Britain know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and what he did. In America, people are just starting to learn about him. The Wall Street Journal called Shackleton ""an Antarctic explorer whose achievements went mostly unnoticed for most of the 20th century,"" but this is not completely true. Now, Americans are very interested in him. Many books and stories about Shackleton's journey on the Endurance are being made. The American Museum of Natural History is planning a big exhibition, and a film about Shackleton's life is also in the works.

Some American managers see Shackleton as a role model. They tell stories about his actions and find lessons in his leadership and communication skills. They even use the phrase ""speaking Shackleton"" to describe their conversations. Shackleton, known for his determination and resourcefulness, has become a model for modern management.

Jim MacGregor, a partner at a New York firm, has looked up to Shackleton for many years. His firm focuses on communication during business changes and crises. For example, they help when a factory has an accident or when many workers must be let go. MacGregor believes that even if a company handles a crisis well, it can still hurt itself by communicating poorly. He says, ""Shackleton is a model for management because he was a great leader and communicator. He knew what was important, especially when lives were at stake.""

One important decision Shackleton made was to turn back when he was only 97 miles from the South Pole. This choice showed his commitment to his men’s safety. In a crisis, people want to know who is in charge. While many managers today avoid responsibility, Shackleton was ready to take charge. His 1914 expedition became famous. His ship, the Endurance, was trapped in ice for nine months and eventually sank. When the ship went down, Shackleton told his men, ""We should all reach safety if you do your best and trust me."" 

From the diaries of that time, it is clear that Shackleton was always in control. MacGregor says, ""Shackleton thought everything through, planned for every situation, kept his men informed, and asked for their opinions. He was flexible and willing to change plans if needed."" 

Shackleton believed that an explorer needs optimism, strength, and patience. MacGregor adds, ""One of the hardest things to do in tough times is to wait, especially in America, where people want quick solutions. If you invest money and make a mistake, it is better to wait and get your money back than to sell and lose a lot. Also, don’t be afraid to change your plans if they are not working.""

Shackleton led by example. On the way back from the Endurance, he saw Hurley, the expedition photographer, without gloves. He gave Hurley his own gloves, saying he would throw them overboard if Hurley did not wear them. Someone else remembered Shackleton doing something similar with a biscuit when they were very hungry on an earlier expedition. He said he would leave the biscuit in the snow because it was so valuable.

As Caroline Alexander, the author of *Endurance*, says: ""People want to hear stories of heroism. Shackleton shows that there is not much heroism today. He stands out as a true example of the ideals we long for."""
CAE_15,"**Simplified Text: 'Finding Food in Madagascar'**

In the forests of Madagascar, there is a special animal called the aye-aye. The aye-aye is a primate, and it has a way of finding food that is similar to a woodpecker. Both the aye-aye and the woodpecker look for insects in wood. The woodpecker uses its beak to make holes in the wood and its long tongue to get the insects. The aye-aye uses its sharp teeth to make holes and its long third finger to reach inside and get the insects.

Scientists have studied how aye-ayes find insects. Dr. Carl Erickson from Duke University studied two male aye-ayes named Nosferatu and Poe, and a female named Samantha with her baby, Annabelle. He wanted to see if they could find insects by looking for signs, like holes in the wood where insects might be.

Dr. Erickson gave the aye-ayes logs with holes. Some holes had food inside, and some were empty. The aye-ayes went straight to the holes with food. They did not need to see the holes to find the mealworms. They might have used their sense of smell or sound, but tests showed they did not need these either. They could find food even when the smell was blocked or when the mealworms were quiet.

Dr. Erickson found that the aye-ayes could feel the empty spaces in the wood. When they look for food, they tap the wood with their long finger and listen carefully. They might be using a method called echo-location, which means they listen for sounds that bounce back to them. They can also hear insects moving inside the wood.

Some people think that the aye-aye acts like a woodpecker in Madagascar, but there are also birds like the Sickle-billed and Nuthatch Vangas that look for insects in wood. So, the aye-aye is not the only one doing this job.

The aye-aye is interesting because it has features of both woodpeckers and bats. It also acts like a squirrel. Its teeth keep growing like a squirrel's teeth, and it has been seen in the wild opening nuts and eating the inside with its long finger."

Many of us have pictures of our grandparents, but how many of us know what their lives were like when they were young? We might have some old diaries or family stories, but they often do not tell us everything. And what will our grandchildren know about us? We want to write things down, but we often forget to do it. We might leave videos instead of photos, but videos are not the same as real life.

Hannah Renier has a solution. She writes life stories for other people. She makes a book that has at least 20,000 words and can have pictures too. She focuses on ordinary people, not famous ones. The idea started when she talked to her family and saw that many stories from the past were being lost. 

""When I began, I did not take it very seriously,"" she says. ""But after meeting people who have interesting lives, I changed my mind. Many people say they do it for their children or for future generations, but they also enjoy it themselves.""

People feel safe to share their stories with her. A 62-year-old man said, ""I was honest. I talked about my divorce, and it still hurts."" He wrote his story for his family, but he has not let his children read it yet. He thinks some details might hurt them. He wants them to read it only after he is gone.

Hannah has noticed that many people are affected by their childhood. ""Many people repeat the same mistakes they made when they were young,"" she says. ""They often marry people their parents liked or choose partners to rebel against their parents."" 

Many people still feel sad about things that happened with their parents many years ago. They try to impress parents who were never happy with them. Some people even want to say, ""I can't stand my mother.""

Hannah listens to people without judging them. ""I am not here to be nosy,"" she says. ""Sometimes people tell me things and then wonder if I should write them down. I usually do, and they can change it later if they want."" Most people want to be honest about their lives.

Hannah's work is not about showing off. She believes that life is moving quickly, and we are forgetting our past. Writing these stories helps people connect with their family history. 

Each book takes about 30 hours of interviews. Hannah uses these talks to write the life story, changing the order of events if needed. She can create everything for the book except the binding, which has gold lettering. People can choose the color and title of their book. 

The final product is well-organized and looks good. Each book costs nearly £3,000, and extra copies cost £25 each. Hannah gets about 10 requests each week, but the price stops many people from buying. ""I thought more people would want this service,"" she says. ""But the people I have worked with are often wealthy and like to read certain magazines."""

The Museum of Classical Archaeology has many copies of Greek and Roman sculptures. There are over six hundred pieces in total. It is important to know that none of the sculptures are real. All the sculptures are copies made from the originals, mostly in the late 1800s and early 1900s. The Museum is in a special building with good natural light. The plaster copies have many benefits: sculptures that were once together but are now in different museums can be seen together again. You can see almost all the famous Greek and Roman sculptures in one afternoon.

There are over 400,000 air photographs in this collection, taken by university staff over the last 45 years. The university has its own aircraft at Cambridge Airport and takes photographs all over Great Britain. The photographs are interesting because they show the landscape and how it has changed from prehistoric times to now. There is a small display in the entrance hall, and the library staff can help with questions. You cannot borrow the photographs, but you can buy copies. These copies are made to order and usually take about a month.

**E. Cambridge Medieval Brass Rubbing Centre**  
The Cambridge Brass Rubbing Centre is one of the oldest and most unique tourist attractions in the world. Visitors can have fun making wall hangings by rubbing over one of more than a hundred different brass plates from the tombs of medieval knights and ladies. The centre makes resin copies, called facsimiles, to protect the originals and make brass rubbing easy for everyone. The brass plates were used as memorials and spread from Germany to other parts of medieval Europe. Many beautiful brasses were destroyed during revolutions, but most of the remaining ones are in Britain, and you can see many examples at the Cambridge Centre."

**A. The Theatre Director**  
I have had a strange personal life, but I have been lucky to have 35 years with small children, and I have loved every moment. This morning, I fed the baby, and that is what being a father means to me. I feel very lucky with my children. We all enjoy the same things: opera, theatre, books, and music. This brings us close, especially now that they are older and I am more like a friend than a father. I do not believe in hitting children. I have slapped my children when I was angry, but I do not think it is right. I may not have been the best father, but I have always tried to be there for them. I am here if they need me, but I do not want to make them feel guilty if they do not call me. My parents did that to me, and I would never do that to my children.

**B. The Advertising Executive**  
I was young when my children were born, only about 25 years old. I found the responsibilities hard at first, but they also kept me young. As they became teenagers, they showed me new things like music and fashion. This helped me in my job. I missed some important events when they were young, like their first concerts and sports days, and I feel sad about that. But now, I can take them on holidays to nice places like the south of France. They get along well with my friends and come to parties and events with me, which is nice.

**C. The Politician**  
My first child was born just before I started my political career. My wife and I promised to spend time with our children, but as I became more involved in politics, it became harder to find time. I only accept weekend meetings if my kids can come with me. This way, they can see what I do when I am not with them, and they do not feel like I am disappearing. I have noticed that more politicians are bringing their kids to work. Maybe we all want to include our children in our lives more.

**D. The Writer**  
My first marriage ended when my daughters, Kate and Bonnie, were young, so I had to think more about being a father. I tried hard to stay close to my children. My ex-wife and I even lived next to each other for a while so they could visit easily, but I think that confused them. Kate has said I was always there for her, but I am not sure I was a good father. I was around a lot, but I treated my kids like adults too soon. Kate said we were too relaxed as parents. I think I should have had more rules. I regret that now. I still worry about my older daughters just as much as my youngest.

**E. The TV Presenter**  
I was ready for kids when I turned 30. I met my wife, and we had a nice home, so we thought, ""Why not have a child instead of just buying new things?"" Having my daughter, Betty, has helped me understand who I am. It feels special to have a child, but it also makes you just one of many parents. Sometimes I feel frustrated, but when I see her smile, all my irritation goes away. A baby's smile is the best way to make you feel better."

CAE_46,"**Text: 'Flying in Weightlessness'**

Journalist Tom Mumford joins students who are testing their ideas in weightlessness. The plane looked like a normal aircraft from the outside. The pilot told the students that it was built in 1964 and was a Boeing KC-135, which is based on the Boeing 707. But inside, it was very different. The inside was a long white tunnel with few windows and lights on the padded walls. Most of the seats were taken out, except for a few at the back where the 13 students from Europe and America sat. They had worked hard for 12 months to win a place on this special flight. 

The European Space Agency gave them a challenge to create interesting experiments to do in weightlessness. The students with the best ideas got to go on this amazing flight, which felt like a big roller-coaster ride. For the next two hours, the plane would go up and down, creating moments of weightlessness. 

When the pilot cut the engines at 3,000 meters, the plane went higher for a moment before falling back down. During the few seconds of weightlessness, the students felt like they were floating. The plane took off smoothly, but everything changed when the pilot made the plane climb steeply. The engines roared, and the students felt the pressure in their heads. Then, the engines stopped, and they experienced weightlessness. 

For 20 seconds, they floated in the air, feeling like they were on a trampoline. They could not tell which way was up or down. After 10 seconds of falling, the pilot pulled the plane back up. Gravity returned, and some students landed hard on the floor. 

They had 30 curves to complete, giving them 10 minutes of weightlessness for their experiments. The Dutch students studied their robotic cat, Leonardo, to see how cats always land on their feet. They released their device, and one student managed to turn it over. 

A German team studied how metal joins are affected by weightlessness, which is important for building future space stations. Another team from Utah State University worked on making solar sails from thin films in microgravity. They believe these sails could help satellites use the sun's energy like a yacht uses wind. 

After two hours of flying, the students felt excited, not sick. One student said, ""It was an unforgettable experience. I wanted to be an astronaut before, but now I want it even more."""

**With the Trees, I Planted My Stake in New Zealand**

**JONATHON PORRITT TALKS TO DANNY DANZIGER**

Jonathon Porritt is the author of *Seeing Green - The Politics of Ecology*.

I had a strange time in my life when I didn’t have any summers. I went to New Zealand every summer, which is winter there. So, I had nine winters in a row, which was great because I like winter. My parents had an idea to buy a small piece of land for my brother, sister, and me to take care of. My mother said, “If you plant trees on it, you can have it.” The idea was that we would always have a connection to New Zealand, which is nice because my father grew up there. They found a piece of land about 20 miles north of Auckland in a place called Rangitoupuni. The land is not very good, but it is good for planting trees.

I have always liked land. I spent a year in Australia working on farms, so I was excited about planting trees. I started planting in 1968, and by the end of 1972, my brother, sister, and I had planted the whole 70 acres. In New Zealand in 1968, it rained a lot during that winter. It is funny to think of it as a happy time because it rained almost every day we were planting. I don’t think I have ever been so wet and cold for so long.

Every morning was a challenge. I had to get ready for planting. I would come out of the Land Rover warm and dry, but the rain would be falling. My clothes were still wet from the day before, and my boots were soaked. I had to tie my shoelaces, which were slippery. “My mind started to think about many strange things and ideas about life.”

In that first year, I had a helper who was good at planting trees. This was helpful because I had never planted trees seriously before. You wear a planting bag around your neck and fill it with trees. When the bag is full, it is heavy, but when it gets lighter, it is easier to work. The hardest part was getting the lines straight. You decide how far apart to plant the trees, then you line up three poles to help you. Once you are in line, you plant all the way down the line, then turn around and come back.

I enjoy hard work, and it made me fit. After a while, you can plant trees almost automatically. You get used to a rhythm and use the least number of movements to dig a hole. This rhythm is important in many farming jobs. You learn to take the tree out of the bag, dig a hole, put it in the ground, stamp it down, and move on. 

Mentally, it is interesting. My mind starts to think about many things, including nature and our place in it. A lot of my thoughts about the natural world began during those days. I have been back to New Zealand four times since then and watched the trees grow. It is satisfying to see them grow because I planted them. I always worry when I read news about strong winds or droughts in New Zealand. Such news makes me feel anxious. However, everything worked out well, and those trees are now 20 years old and healthy.

I should add that I took a break from teaching and went back in 1984 for three months. I went alone and wrote my first book, *Seeing Green*. There is a small cabin on the tree farm with just a bed, a table, and a chair. In the mornings, I wrote; in the afternoons, I pruned the trees; and in the evenings, I did research. My connection to that area is still very strong. It is the place I feel most connected to in terms of the bond between people and the earth."
CAE_10,"**Text: 'CARING FOR BADGER CUBS'**

""What now?"" was my first thought when one of my helpers brought a cardboard box to me. My husband Derek and I have an open farm in Somerset. We take care of orphaned animals. But the noise from the box was strange, so I looked inside. There were three small grey badger cubs, each about eight inches long. Their soft coats were like velvet, and their milky eyes looked up at me from their black-and-white striped heads. I had never seen badger cubs before. Most badger cubs are born between January and March and live underground. If they lose their mother, they often die from hunger. 

These three cubs were found by builders. While they were working, their machines accidentally broke into the badger's home. The mother was found dead, and her babies were still trying to drink from her. I could see the cubs were healthy but cold and whimpering. After removing the fleas, I took them into the farmhouse kitchen and placed them beside the stove to keep warm. There were two girls named Primrose and Bluebell, and a boy named Willow. At first, I used a syringe to feed them, but I had to wipe them with a warm cloth first to make them feel like their mother was licking them. This helped them go to the bathroom. For the first few days, I fed them every four hours. After a week, they learned to drink from a bottle and started to move around, even if it was a bit shaky. They were happy together with a warm pad as a substitute for their mother.

Three weeks later, I noticed that Willow seemed tired, but he was still eating. This was a warning sign. I should have acted quickly, but I didn’t realize how serious it was. The next morning, I found him dead. The vet said he died from a lung infection. When feeding animals with a bottle, it is important not to let them drink too fast, or they can get liquid in their lungs. In Willow's case, this caused an infection that was hard to treat, even with medicine.

Feeling sad about Willow, I continued to care for the other two cubs. Then, six days later, a local farmer came to see me. He had found another male cub, alone and cold. He knew the mother would not come back. This new cub, named Willow II, joined us. He was about two weeks younger than the girls. I soon found out that he was very hard to feed. I had to move the bottle around and squeeze it to get him to drink. After ten minutes, he would finally latch on as if he hadn’t eaten all day.

By the end of April, the girls were eating creamed rice and anything else I gave them. Willow II was happy to stop using the bottle but had trouble eating without making a mess. I finally gave him a sausage, which he slowly learned to eat. After a week of sausages, he was ready for more food. At almost five months old, they were all eating cereals for breakfast, meat and vegetables for lunch, and fruit, nuts, cheese, hard-boiled eggs, and sunflower seeds in the evening. Badgers usually eat 60% earthworms, plus beetles, baby rabbits, mice, and plants. My badgers were doing well, especially since it was a hot summer and finding food was hard.

By August, the cubs started to be active at night. We often walked through the orchard, and they would chase each other and play. I learned to avoid their playful bites, but Derek sometimes got caught and had colorful reactions. During these late-night walks, I saw other badgers in our field. They were looking for food because their homes were disturbed. Badgers are very protective of their territory and can be dangerous to others. We were warned that they might come into our badger pen and harm the cubs, so we covered the gate to keep them safe.

The local press took pictures of me walking the badgers, and many people wanted to help build a home for them on our farm. With advice from others, we designed a new home for the badgers. Our son Daniel drew the plans, and we built a sett with tunnels and a special gate. It had three rooms, one bigger than the others, with a glass side so people could see inside. As we built it, the badgers explored the new home before going on their walks. They became excited about climbing through the tunnels and making their beds. The building cost more than we expected, but a local bus company helped pay for it, and local businesses donated materials. Everyone wanted the badgers to have a home.

One evening, the badgers finally moved in. After watching them for a while, we left them to settle. Half an hour later, I checked on them and saw three badgers curled up in their chambers, sound asleep. Now, I don’t walk with them as often because they don’t wake up until midnight. We see Primrose only sometimes because she has joined another sett, but Bluebell and Willow II still come to say hello before running off into the night. This is their home now, and they are happy here."
CAE_67,"**Text: In Search of True North - The Man Behind Halley's Comet**

Dr. Toby Clark is a researcher at the British Geological Survey. He wants to follow the journey of Sir Edmund Halley, who studied compass variations. Anjana Ahuja reports.

Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is famous for the comet named after him. However, one of his important achievements was to study the ""variations of the compass."" These variations are now called ""declination,"" which is the angle between magnetic north and true north. Sailors needed to know this to correct their compasses and navigate the oceans.

Halley was one of only two men in England paid to do scientific research at that time. He sailed to the Cape Verde Islands to study declination in the North and South Atlantic. His first trip ended early because of problems with the crew, but he tried again. This time, he traveled to Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, Newfoundland, and back to England. In 1701, he published a chart showing the variations of the compass in the Western and Southern Oceans. This chart helped sailors for over a hundred years until changes in the Earth's magnetic field made it less accurate.

Dr. Clark wants to celebrate the 300th anniversary of Halley's trip by retracing his route. He needs to raise £70,000 before he can start. Sir Vivian Fuchs, who led the first expedition across Antarctica, is helping him.

Dr. Clark became interested in Halley while he was at Halley Station in Antarctica. He read about Halley's life and said, ""Halley led a remarkable life. He was a respected scientist and led expeditions. He was not just an astronomer; he also studied geophysics."" Halley created a diving bell and helped Sir Isaac Newton with his famous book, Principia Mathematica.

Dr. Clark believes that retracing Halley's journey will give him the recognition he deserves. His expedition, called ""In the Wake of the Paramore,"" will also have scientific value. He will take measurements like Halley did, but with better tools. These measurements are important because the Earth's magnetic field is always changing.

Dr. Clark explains, ""It is common to measure the size of the magnetic field but not the direction. You need to know true north to measure the direction. On our expedition, we can use satellites to find that."" The British Geological Survey and the United States Navy will provide instruments for the trip. A Danish satellite will also take similar measurements, and Dr. Clark hopes his work will help fill in any gaps in the data.

Halley's journey was significant because it was the first scientific expedition at sea. He was the first civilian to be appointed as a naval captain for this purpose. 

Does Dr. Clark have the right experience for this journey? He spent two years in Antarctica and worked at the British Geological Survey. He has already sailed 13,000 kilometers from Rio de Janeiro to England. He plans to complete the expedition in four stages with different crews.

Does he share Halley's passion? He says, ""I am ready to give up my life for eight months to do this. Some people might think I'm obsessed, but I want to have a good reason to sail across the Atlantic again. Halley and his amazing life have given me a real sense of purpose."""

**POWER DRESSING**

Every summer, peacocks walk freely in Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire. They show their beautiful tail feathers to the hens. This behavior makes people think about a question that Charles Darwin wondered about: how can birds have such fancy feathers in a world where survival is tough? 

Darwin believed that animals change over time through evolution, not by special creation. He said that the strongest animals survive and have babies. But he thought that the peacock's tail was not useful for survival. So, he suggested another idea called ""sexual selection."" This means that female birds choose males based on their beauty.

Darwin's friend, Alfred Russel Wallace, had a different idea. He thought that if peahens liked the males with the most beautiful tails, there must be another reason for this choice. The tail might show that the male is healthy and strong, even if humans cannot see it.

Now, 100 years later, scientists are still studying this question. At Whipsnade, there are 200 peacocks that live like wild birds but are used to people. Marion Petrie and her team want to find out two things: Do peahens really choose the males with the most beautiful tails? And do these males have other good qualities, or is it just about looks?

The male peacocks show off their tails in groups, and the hens compare them. Observations show that the hens prefer the males with the most eye spots on their tails. These males attract more mates. However, it is still unclear if these males are better in other ways.

William Hamilton from Oxford University suggested that male birds with beautiful feathers might be healthier and have fewer parasites. There is some evidence for this in other bird species. But Dr. Petrie and her team have not yet been able to check the health of the peacocks at Whipsnade.

This year, Dr. Petrie is studying the babies of attractive and unattractive male peacocks. She wants to see if the babies of the attractive males grow faster and are healthier. If they are, it would support Wallace's idea that females choose males for good reasons.

There is also an interesting idea from the mathematician R A Fisher. He suggested that if a female chooses a male with a slightly better tail, her sons will have long tails, and her daughters will like long tails. This could lead to more males with long tails over time. This idea shows that females might choose beauty for its own sake, just as Darwin thought.

**Questions:**

1. Where do the peacocks live?
2. What do the peacocks show to the hens?
3. What did Darwin believe about how animals change over time?

CAE_66,"**THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS**

Tom Cunliffe says that the best boat design should mix old and new ideas. He did this with his own boat, 'The Westerman'. This week, the Summer Boat Show in London is full of beautiful yachts with new technology. Most of these boats come from a big change in boat design that happened 25 years ago. In contrast, my boat is quietly resting in a tidal creek on the south coast. It was designed last year, but it looks like it is 100 years old. You might think that I am a romantic person, but I am not sure about that. 

My boat uses the best parts of old boat design, but modern technology has also helped a lot. However, it is important to say that new technology can sometimes keep sailors away from the real life at sea. This is often what they wanted to find when they went sailing. I do not think sailors should go back to facing all the difficulties of the past. I believe it is important for my boats to have a coal stove for warmth and comfortable places to sleep. But why go sailing if every sail works by itself? Sometimes, dealing with sails that flap in the wind is part of being a sailor.

Why should we change our steering positions from a safe place at the back of the boat to a less safe spot in the middle? This change makes the cabin feel like a big ship, with a bed bigger than the one at home. For me, a boat should be a boat, not a house on the water. When I bought my first boat, Hirta, to sail around Britain for a TV race, the previous owner said it had all the comforts but no luxury. I learned that he was right. Hirta had heavy sails, no running water, no electricity, no fridge, no central heating, and no electronics, especially for navigation. Yet, she was the easiest boat I have ever sailed.

However, classic boats like Hirta need a lot of care. When I hurt my back, I knew I had to stop sailing her. I looked for a younger boat but could not find one, so I decided to build a new boat from scratch. The Westerman has never let me down. The designer, Nigel Irens, and his assistant, Ed Burnett, are good with computer design, but Irens first drew this boat on a paper napkin. Later, he used a computer to make the design better. We worked together to improve the design until it was perfect.

The finished boat has crossed the North Atlantic and won four out of her first six races. She looks timeless, moves beautifully in the sea, and has a peaceful atmosphere inside. This is because she was designed only as a sailing boat, without thinking about furniture. This is the best way to design a boat. In her calmness, she shows that you do not need to follow trends to be happy, and that sometimes it is good to learn from the past. Made from wood treated with special glue, she does not take in water. So, she has the advantages of a fiberglass boat but looks, feels, and sails like a real boat."

On the first day, I did nothing and slept a lot. From the second day, I started to join classes like yoga and body conditioning. The teachers are very well trained. I felt more flexible as the week went on. They offer many treatments, like aromatherapy, seaweed baths, manicures, and pedicures. The facial treatment lasts an hour and makes you feel great. The staff in the treatment rooms were very friendly and professional. The atmosphere is full of energy. Henlow is planning to make big changes this year, including a swimming pool and a Light Diet Room. You can also ride bicycles around the grounds. If you want to relax, you can read a magazine or take a quiet walk in the garden. During my stay, I felt happier and had a better appetite. I left feeling wonderful and full of energy. I want to visit again. This is a perfect place for busy women. Save Room 5 for me!

**B. SHRUBLAND HALL**  
The calm and relaxing feeling of this big house was clear as soon as I walked into the reception area. The Hall has a beautiful library, a nice conservatory, and lots of space, so you can be alone if you want. When you arrive, everyone gets a medical check-up, which includes checking your weight and blood pressure. They called us patients, which felt strange because I am healthy. However, I was happy that they found a shoulder problem and helped me with it in group workshops and private sessions. Each person gets a special diet to follow. I lost weight without starving, but I was still hungry and got a headache on the second day. My daily menu included grapefruit and honey for breakfast, salads for lunch, and fruit, yogurt, and hot broth for dinner. If you are not on a diet, you can eat in the main dining hall, where the food is tasty. You can have a massage or water therapy every other day. All extra treatments are reasonably priced.

**C. CAREYS MANOR**  
Careys is not a health farm, but it is a nice old manor with cozy log fires and a big lounge. If you are counting calories, you might want to skip the gourmet food. The French chef makes rich sauces and creamy desserts. Luckily, the hotel has a gym and a soft-water pool, so I could exercise after eating. There is a spa bath, steam room, sauna, and treatment rooms. A big attraction is the sports injury clinic. I got advice on an old shoulder injury. The physiotherapist suggested good posture and exercises. Careys is comfortable and luxurious, but also relaxed. If you want to explore, there is beautiful countryside around.  
*Beverly D'Silva*

**D. CLIVEDEN**  
Cliveden is a grand country home and a five-star hotel that treats guests like royalty. It offers health and beauty treatments, a gym, saunas, a swimming pool, tennis, horse riding, and more. There are beautiful walks and gardens around the 376-acre estate. Waldo's is a famous restaurant with amazing food. It took me a long time to read the dinner menu because there were so many choices. The meal was wonderful, especially the sticky-toffee pudding with banana ice cream. I went to bed very happy! The next morning, I spent some time in the gym to burn off some calories. In the Pavilion, I enjoyed a facial and an aromatherapy massage. Cliveden has many fitness and beauty treatments if you want them, before enjoying a meal at Waldo's.  
*Kay Letch*

**E. SPRINGS HYDRO**  
The best and worst thing about Springs Hydro is the carrot cake. It is the best because it is the most delicious I have ever tasted. It is the worst because it has 360 calories, which is a lot if you want to lose weight. You have been warned! The second best thing is the wonderful aromatherapy massage. I chose relaxing oils and fell asleep during the massage. I had the best sleep in years. The place is modern and well-organized, with great facilities and comfortable rooms. There are many therapists and beauty rooms, so it is easy to book treatments. They offer many services, from manicures to deep-cleansing facials. The guests are a mix of people, from football teams to mothers and daughters. I would love to take a break here every month.

CAE_22,"**NATURAL TALENTS**

In the last seven million years, humans have not changed much from chimpanzees. We are still more than 98% similar to them. This means that the differences between humans and animals are very new. Our ability to create art and other things we think are special to humans comes from just a small part of our genes. 

Studies of animal behavior show that many traits we thought were only human are also found in animals. For example, both humans and wild chimpanzees use tools. Chimpanzees use sticks to eat and as weapons, while sea otters use rocks to open clams. Monkeys also have a simple form of language with different sounds for 'leopard', 'eagle', and 'snake'. This means that there are not many clear differences between humans and animals, except for art.

If human art comes from special genes, it is strange that our ancestors did not create art for almost seven million years. The first forms of art might have been wood carvings or body painting, but we cannot find them because they do not last long. The first clear evidence of human art comes from the Cro-Magnons, around 35,000 years ago, with cave paintings, statues, necklaces, and musical instruments.

Some people say that human art is different from animal art in three ways: human art is not useful, it is made for beauty, and it is learned rather than instinctive. Let's look at these points.

First, Oscar Wilde said, ""All art is quite useless."" This means that human art does not help us survive or pass on our genes, unlike many animal behaviors. Some human art does communicate ideas, but this is not the same as passing on genes. Birdsong, on the other hand, helps birds defend their territory or attract a mate, which helps them pass on their genes. So, by this idea, human art does seem different.

The second point is that human art is made for beauty. We cannot ask birds if they enjoy their songs, but they mostly sing during the breeding season, so they might not sing just for beauty. Again, this makes human art seem unique.

The third point is that human art is learned. Each human group has its own art styles that people learn. For example, songs in Tokyo are different from songs in Paris. But these styles are not in our genes. People from different countries can learn each other's songs. In contrast, some birds are born knowing how to sing their species' song, even if they have never heard it before.

Human art changes quickly. For example, people can tell that a painting from the 20th century is different from the Mona Lisa. Even experts can often tell who painted a work and when it was made. However, two chimpanzees named Congo and Betsy also created paintings that some people might mistake for human art. Congo made many paintings in one day and was upset when his pencil was taken away. They even had an art show in London in 1957, and many of their paintings sold.

These chimpanzee paintings show that the line between human art and animal behavior is not so clear. Like human art, the chimpanzee paintings were not made for practical reasons; they were created for the enjoyment of the painter. Some might argue that human art is different because it is often made to communicate with others, while the chimpanzees did not care about sharing their art. However, some famous human art was also made just for the artist's own pleasure."
CAE_39,"**Text: An Amazing Adventure**

The Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last unexplored places on Earth. It is also very dangerous. Charles Blackmore crossed it and lived to tell his story. There are not many big adventures left and not many heroes. Children's stories used to have brave explorers with sunburnt skin and eyes looking far into the distance. Today, you do not find such people in stories or in real life. Or so I thought until I met Charles Blackmore.

Blackmore's big adventure was leading a group across the Taklamakan Desert. Its name means ""once entered, you never come out,"" but local people call it the Desert of Death. He remembered the dangers and excitement of that amazing journey while at home with his family. The team he led had four Britons (one was a doctor), an American photographer, four Chinese experts, 30 camels, and six camel handlers. It turned out that the camel handlers had never worked with camels before; they were long-distance truck drivers. This misunderstanding could have been very dangerous for everyone.

This mixed group set out to cross 1,200 kilometers of the desert. Charles Blackmore wrote a fascinating story about their journey. At that time, he was about to leave the Army after 14 happy years. He started the expedition for fun, to find something new in his life. ""I thought I would spend my whole life in the Army. I was offered a promotion, but I wanted to see who I really was outside of that. It was a big risk. My wife, Tina, was very worried that I wouldn't come back because nobody had ever done that route before; we went into it without knowing what would happen. In the end, it took 59 days to cross from west to east, and the desert was very good to us.""

Anyone reading his amazing story will wonder why he said the desert was ""kind."" The team faced many hardships: sickness, extreme temperatures, severe thirst, and losing some of their water. ""But,"" Blackmore explains, ""when we were very tired and the camels had not had water for seven days, we found some. We did not have the famous sandstorms of the Taklamakan. And we did not feel the freezing cold that could have stopped us. We were always fighting against problems. The fine sand got into everything, especially our blisters and wounds. The high dunes were hard to climb for us and for the heavy camels, which sometimes fell over onto us.""

""What pushed me on more than anything else was the need to survive. We had no backup plan. Our budget and time did not allow for one. No planes flew over us. Once we got into the sandhills, we were completely alone. I knew I had the mental strength for the trip, but I was scared about my physical ability. I remember the first day -- we sat at the edge of the desert, and it was so hot that it was hard to breathe. I thought, 'We have to do it now!' At that moment, I was very scared.""

If it was hard at the beginning, how did they feel at the end? ""When you've walked for 1,000 kilometers, you are not going to give up. You have gone through so much; you have so much behind you. We were very thin but strong despite being tired. My body was fit, and my legs were strong. I could walk over anything.""

In the middle of the book, Blackmore described lying in the desert, looking at the full moon, and thinking of his family. How did he feel about what they must have gone through? ""Inside me, there is someone trying to find peace. When I have doubts about myself now, I think back to the desert and remember that we managed to do that. I feel prouder of that expedition than of anything else I have done. But when I think of my life, I think of my family and the happiness we share. Compared to that, the desert does not measure up.""

Has Charles Blackmore found peace? ""I long for the challenge and the open spaces. We felt good because we had a purpose. Now, I find it hard to be part of the sameness of modern life."""

Susan Harr decides to unplug her gadgets and enjoy doing things by hand. Many people love technology because it gives us useful tools that make life easier. However, Susan feels that we are too dependent on technology. She had a bad experience with her broken word processor, which cost her a lot of money to fix. This made her think that gadgets are often not worth it.

Little by little, Susan has stopped using some of her household gadgets. She wonders if technology really gives us more time. Does it just make us buy more gadgets? When her broken machine started making strange noises, she left it outside. Now, she enjoys taking her time to sew by hand instead of using a noisy machine. 

There are some gadgets she still likes, like her washing machine, but she found joy in giving up others. For example, they returned their rented color TV and went back to a small black-and-white one. This change helped them spend more time walking their dog, reading, and talking with each other. 

Susan used to think she needed her sewing machine, but now she sews by hand. She enjoys listening to the radio or talking with family while she sews. She feels relaxed and happy doing this. She used to think that sewing by hand was hard work, but now she finds it satisfying and calming. 

Now, she takes her time with chores like washing dishes and thinks about what gadgets she really needs. She wonders if they could live without their freezer, microwave, or electric lights. 

**Questions:**

1. Why did Susan decide to unplug her gadgets?

Charles Hurst is a cabinet-maker who makes beautiful furniture. Joanna Watt meets him. When I arrive at his workshop in East London, he shakes my hand quickly and says, ""Well, fire away then!"" He seems busy, and his workshop is full of furniture pieces and wooden boards in many colors. Hurst has been making furniture for ten years and has a good reputation. He has many orders and does not need to advertise. People know that if they want a good cupboard, table, or bookcase, Hurst is the right person.

It is not hard to find a furniture-maker, but it is harder to find one who makes high-quality furniture. Hurst says, ""There are few real cabinet-makers now. Many people call themselves furniture-makers."" He is often disappointed by the quality of some modern furniture. He does not like cheap, mass-produced furniture and those who make low-quality pieces. Hurst wants to make perfect furniture, and this is part of his success.

Hurst is confident in his skills. He says, ""I have a huge natural ability. I have always been good at making things."" He learned by asking questions and practicing. Most of his work comes from private clients. Some clients come back to him many times. He enjoys making furniture for their whole house. However, he finds it frustrating when clients do not know what they want.

Hurst is also kind and praises others when they deserve it. He says, ""There are people far better than me."" He is critical of those who take too long to make one piece of furniture and of students who try to make their work look fashionable. He believes furniture should be useful, not just a statement.

Hurst is confident but not pretentious. As I leave, he says, ""After all, I am only making furniture.""

CAE_49,"**Text: Three Theories About Sleep**

People spend about one-third of their lives sleeping. This shows that sleep is very important. But, scientists do not agree on why we need to sleep. There are three main ideas.

The first idea says that sleep helps our bodies stay healthy. When we sleep, our bodies fix any damage from the day and get ready for the next day.

The second idea is about learning. This idea says that sleep helps us understand and remember what we learned during the day. Without sleep, it is hard to learn new things.

The third idea is about energy. This idea says that we need to sleep to recharge our energy. When we sleep, we get ready for the next day and have enough energy to do our activities."
CAE_31,"**ECCENTRICS**

An eccentric is someone who acts differently from most people. They do not follow the usual rules of their society. This makes us think, ""What is normal?"" Many of us have our own strange habits. For example, someone might love to enter contests in newspapers, collect beer mats, or write letters to the editor about many topics. Being eccentric shows our individuality.

Inside us, there is often a struggle between two feelings. One feeling is to be ourselves, called individualism. The other feeling is to fit in with others, called conformity. Most people want to be accepted and liked, so they often choose to fit in rather than stand out.

People with unusual hobbies or strong opinions often find each other. They create clubs, hold meetings, and organize events to talk about what they enjoy or their problems. They want to be with others who understand them, even if others think their interests are strange. Being in a group can make us feel safe.

Many of us feel a push and pull between wanting to be ourselves and wanting to fit in. Even when we follow the crowd, we might not like it if someone points it out. For example, a man at a bar might say, ""I say what I think,"" to show he is different. 

Anyone can choose to be more individual. Some people become very successful by being themselves. Bob Dylan, a famous American singer, said, ""When you feel what you are doing and go after it, you will surprise many people."" But being different on purpose, like a pop star wearing strange clothes for attention, is not true eccentricity. 

True eccentrics do not try to be odd; they just are. They do not care much about what others think. They act based on who they are. This makes eccentrics different from other people who want to impress others or escape from society. Eccentrics live their lives happily, without worrying about what others think."
CAE_58,"**Simplified Text: Natural Books**

We asked four naturalists to share the wildlife book that has influenced them the most.

**A. Geoffrey Lean**  
It was easy for me to choose the author. As an environmental journalist, I have met many important people in this field. One of the most important is Barbara Ward. She is a small, frail woman, but her ideas about the environment are very strong. She has combined her experiences from different environmental movements into her own important ideas. When I was a young journalist, she helped me understand many things. Choosing her book was harder. It could have been ""Only One Earth"" or ""Progress for a Small Planet."" But I think her most important book is ""The Home of Man."" This book talks about the fast growth of cities in the world and important themes she cared about. It is a strong call for what we now call ""sustainable human development."" I have read many books since, but none are as good as this one.

**B. Linda Bennett**  
When I read ""Signals for Survival"" by Niko Tinbergen, I can hear the calls of herring gulls and remember the smell of the guano in the sun. This book explains very well, with words and pictures, how animals communicate. If you read ""Signals for Survival"" and then watch a gull colony, you will see how their chaos turns into a smart social structure. You can see which birds are partners and where their boundaries are. Niko Tinbergen was a great behaviorist who wanted to share his findings with everyone. He worked with talented wildlife artist Eric Ennion to create this book, which is interesting for anyone who loves wildlife. Ennion's paintings show how one gull is aggressive and how another shows peace. This is the art of a true naturalist.

**C. Lee Durrell**  
The book that has influenced me the most is ""My Family and Other Animals"" by Gerald Durrell. This book not only led me to a wonderful husband but also to a great career in conservation. It made me love the natural world. I was doing research on animal sounds in Madagascar when I first read this book. I had been there for two years and was feeling discouraged, but when I opened the book, everything became brighter. It shows animals, people, joy, and beauty all together—a small world worth saving. Some people say humans are bad because of the harm we have done to other species. But I remember Gerald as a boy in the book, seeing all living things as a family that is connected. This is an important idea for everyone to understand.

**D. Bruce Pearson**  
I found ""The Shell Bird Book"" by James Fisher in my school library soon after it was published in 1966. I was immediately attracted to it, especially to the 48 colorful bird pictures by Eric Ennion. These images caught my attention. I already had other bird books and had spent holidays learning to identify birds. They inspired me to start sketching what I saw. But ""The Shell Bird Book"" had so much more. It included beautiful paintings, chapters on bird migration, the history of birds in Britain, and even a chapter on birds in music, literature, and art. This book helped me appreciate birds and nature in a broader way. It showed me that my emotional and creative feelings about nature are just as important as scientific ones. Since art was my stronger subject, I began to see new opportunities for myself."
CAE_37,"**Text: DO REVIEWS SELL BOOKS?**

We asked five British publishers about how book reviews affect sales. Here is what they said.

**Publisher A**  
Reviews are very important for publishers. They look at reviews first in newspapers. A study showed that many people buy a book because of reviews, more than because of ads or word of mouth. Authors feel differently about reviews. Both authors and publishers feel bad when there are no reviews. However, publishers think that even bad reviews can help sell books because they make readers curious. Publishers like reviews that match their own feelings about a book since they are often the first readers.

**Publisher B**  
Publishers and newspapers both care about book reviews, but they want different things. Newspapers want to entertain their readers, while publishers want their books to be reviewed, especially in a good way. Book reviews are better now than 40 years ago, but many paperback books still do not get enough attention. Publishers need reviews to help readers find out about books and authors. Good reviews from trusted sources can really help sell books.

**Publisher C**  
Reviews are very important for publishing. Many of the books we publish are not by famous authors, so we rely on reviews to help sell them. Good reviews are often more valuable than ads because they show that the review is honest. Publishers say they want big reviews, but the real effect of reviews on sales is hard to understand. Good reviews can help a book and its author become very popular, but they need help from other things like recommendations and good marketing.

**Publisher D**  
The relationship between publishing and reviewing in Britain is complicated. In the United States, a review in the New York Times can make or break a book. In Britain, bookshops often do not pay much attention to reviews. Sometimes, it takes many years of good reviews for people to notice a good writer. Some books that get bad reviews still sell very well. It is hard to predict what will happen. Non-fiction books allow reviewers to talk more about the subject than the book itself.

**Publisher E**  
All publishers and writers want great reviews. But do they really help sell books? I once published a biography that got excellent reviews, but it did not sell well because people thought they could learn everything from the reviews. The name of the reviewer can matter. Thirty years ago, if certain reviewers liked a book, people would listen. Now, sometimes it is the unexpected reviewer or a clever review that makes people want to buy the book."
CAE_2,"**Text: WEATHERVANE MAKER**

Making weathervanes is an old skill that started in ancient Egypt. Today, Graham Smith continues this craft in his workshop. He is one of the few people in the country who makes weathervanes by hand. Graham creates unique designs based on what his customers want. 

""A lot of my customers are women buying gifts for their husbands,"" he says. ""They want something special that shows the man's job or hobbies."" This is different from the usual cockerel design, which is the most common type of weathervane. The first weathervane Graham made was not a cockerel; it was a witch on a broomstick. His friends liked it and asked him to make weathervanes for them. 

Graham decided to start a weathervane business. He had trained as a precision engineer and worked in that field for 15 years. Then, he and his wife, Liz, changed their roles. She went to work, and he stayed home to take care of their children and grow the business. This was five years ago, and he is happy with his choice. ""My old job was not creative, but this work is exciting and artistic,"" he says. ""I really enjoy designing.""

Graham has now created over 100 original designs. He pays close attention to detail and always asks for the customer's approval before cutting the design. He also keeps many traditional designs in stock because they are still popular. ""People like handmade items,"" Graham says. ""They want something a little different.""

Graham does not plan to grow his business because he wants to keep it as a rural craft. ""I have found my place in the market. People love unique items, and I enjoy seeing a simple shape turn into something beautiful,"" he explains. ""For many years, weathervanes have helped people understand the weather by showing changes in wind direction."" 

Now, more people are moving to the countryside, and they want to add special touches to their homes. This has helped crafts like his. Graham is getting busier and sends weathervanes to customers all over the world, especially in America and Denmark. ""The price depends on how detailed the design is,"" he says. His latest request was for a curly-coated dog. No matter the occasion, Graham can create a special gift."

Before it was published, *The Horse Whisperer* was the most talked-about book of the year. It is the first novel by British writer Nicholas Evans, and it made him a lot of money. He shares his story about his inspiration and success.

At the start of the year, Nicholas Evans was having a hard time. A film project he had worked on for months fell apart suddenly. He was worried because he had not earned money for two years, and he needed to pay his bank. A smart person in his situation would have found a job. He could have gone back to working in television. But instead, he made a surprising choice. He bought a ticket to America and traveled for three months to research his first novel.

Nicholas had an idea for the story for a while. He got the idea from a farrier he met while visiting a friend. The farrier told him about a calm horse that suddenly became wild. The owners were very worried until they heard about a gypsy who could talk to the horse and change its behavior in a few hours. These special people were called ""horse whisperers."" Nicholas was inspired and started to learn more about this topic. He wanted to write a movie script because he was a filmmaker. But after his film project failed, he decided to write a book instead.

During the spring, he drove around the US, visiting ranches and learning about horses and the people who work with them. He said, ""It was a strange time. I was watching people, but I felt alone and worried about my life. I had tried for ten years to succeed as a filmmaker, and now I was in debt and worried about my family.""

By the end of August, he returned home and had written the first half of the book. He was still worried about money and needed to know if he should continue. He showed his work to a friend who was a literary agent. The friend said it was ""fine"" and thought Nicholas could get $30,000 for the book. Nicholas needed more money to pay off his debts. He had spent seven months on *The Horse Whisperer* and still had two months of work left.

In October, he sent the first two hundred pages of the book and a summary to seven UK publishers. Soon, his agent called to say that he had turned down the first offer of $75,000. Nicholas was shocked. His agent felt something good was going to happen. 

Within a week, the book was sold to two publishers for record amounts: £550,000 in the UK and $3.15 million in the US. Nicholas and his team could not believe it. They had not even sent the book to New York, and they did not know how it got there. Major film studios also wanted the book. Nicholas's agent in the UK worked with an agent in the US, and they offered $3 million for the movie rights. Nicholas was amazed.

One night in October, four famous filmmakers called him to ask for the chance to pay $3 million for his unfinished novel. Nicholas told me this story while we drank coffee on his porch at home. He said he turned down an offer to write the movie script for *The Horse Whisperer*. He felt it was like a fairy tale, and he did not want to ruin it. Writing for movies is hard work, and he did not want to become just an employee. He wanted to stay involved but keep some distance.

The success of his novel also brought new support for his old film project, but he was not sure if he wanted to make it anymore. He said, ""I think I would be foolish not to write another novel."""

Bobby Fischer is trying to come back to chess. He is not as young as he used to be. Chess is now a game for younger players. After 20 years away from the game, Bobby Fischer is playing against his old rival, Boris Spassky. Bobby won the first game, and it was a great game. But he is now 49 years old, not in good shape, and not used to playing. Boris Spassky is also older.

Chess has changed a lot in the last 20 years. Bobby Fischer helped make chess popular, and now there are many professional players. Today, the main goal for chess players is to win. In international chess, a player needs to be strong mentally and physically. The game is very intense. Players use a chess clock to make sure they finish their moves in time. If they do not, they lose the game. Now, games can last longer, and players often do not take breaks. This makes it harder for older players.

In the last 30 years, every new world champion has been younger than the last. Most of the top ten players in the world are under 30 years old. The way chess is played has also changed. Many players prepare before their matches. Computers help players study many chess games and find weaknesses in their opponents. In one recent match, players had teams of helpers to find mistakes in each other's games. 

Today, there are more great chess players than ever before. Many grandmasters compete for small prizes around the world. A single game can last up to eight hours, and players must stay focused. If they lose concentration, they can lose the game. The chess clock adds to the pressure. At the end of a game, players often rush to make their moves. They have only a few seconds to finish, which can be very stressful.

Winning a game feels great, but one win is not enough to win a tournament. Chess tournaments usually last 9 to 11 days, with games every day. World championship matches can be even harder. For example, a match in 1984 between Anatoli Karpov and Gary Kasparov had to stop after several months because both players were too tired. Karpov lost a lot of weight during the match.

Can Bobby Fischer still be the best? He once said, ""All I want to do is play chess."" This makes his long break from chess surprising. If he is back for the money, he will earn a lot. No matter what happens in his match with Spassky, they will both make millions of dollars. But if Bobby wants to prove he is still the best player, the result could be very sad for him."

A. Nick Grosso is a playwright in his early 30s. He has written three plays that many people liked. Now, he is turning his first play, Peaches, into a movie script. He says, ""It is low budget, but I don’t know how low. It will not be over £30 million, but it could be £30."" Nick is very talented, but the surprising thing is that before he wrote Peaches, he had never been to a play or read one. He says, ""When I wrote the play, I never thought it would be performed. It is set in a car. I probably wouldn’t do that now because I know it is hard to do."" He left school at 16 but returned a year later. After finishing A-levels, he joined the Young People's Theatre. He realized he wanted to write for actors because he wanted people to hear his writing. He says, ""I was finally with people who thought like me. It was the first time I enjoyed learning.""

B. Simon Pegg is a 28-year-old comedian. He studied drama at Bristol University. Now, he is writing a comedy series for TV and just finished a tough tour with comedian Steve Coogan. He has always worked hard. Even in Bristol, he practiced his comedy in clubs. Simon remembers, ""University was very theoretical. I realized I didn’t want to be a serious actor; I liked comedy more. People think comedy is the hardest job, but it isn’t. If you have courage and good material, it is great to make people laugh."" He has worked with the comedy group Funny Business, but his best work has been with Steve Coogan. Simon says, ""He saw my show, and I was a big fan of his. He probably saw me copying him.""

C. Ciaran McMenamin is 24 years old. He became famous when he danced in the show The Young Person's Guide To Becoming A Rock Star. People liked his performance, and now he can choose what work he wants to do. He says, ""It has been a great chance for me. I can pick what I want, which is what I always wanted."" Ciaran started acting in school and then joined the Ulster Youth Theatre for four years. He laughs, ""I used acting to avoid homework. But then I decided I wanted to do it seriously because I was good at it."" Now, he waits for praise, but he thinks about fame. He says, ""When you are 18, you think you will love the photos and interviews, but you realize it is not why you act. It is about getting respect for good work.""

D. Neil Taylor is 25 years old and the lead singer of the pop band Matrix. They just signed a deal for three albums. Neil and his bandmate, Rick Brown, are expected to be very popular when their single, Chimera, comes out. Neil says, ""The record company thinks good sales are very different from what I think. They want a big hit, but I just want two people to buy it."" Neil has worked hard for his success. He left school at 16 and tried to get into music for eight years. He says, ""It is funny how things happen. I was tired of doing small gigs and was about to give up when I met Rick Brown, who had connections in the music industry. It was a great time for me.""

E. Stephen Richards is a 27-year-old poet and author. He has won many awards and is well-known in the poetry world. He has been touring and giving readings for six years. His first novel, Hidden, will be published in March. He says, ""It is a story about obsessive love. It was a strong idea that I could not write as a poem."" Stephen loved creative writing in school but later lost interest in education. He decided not to go to university but later realized he should after getting bored with a job. He published his first book, a children's book, in 1992. He says, ""My parents did not expect me to be a writer; they thought I would just read."" With his poetry being praised, he is now trying to write novels. He explains, ""Poetry has a structure, but novels can be longer and have more mistakes. My goal is to write good work and not just produce a lot of it."""

CAE_53,"**Volunteer Tourism**

Four writers talk about international volunteer work.

A. It is hard to say that volunteer work helps development a lot. Volunteer tourists can help build homes or schools, but they usually pay a lot of money to do this work. If this money was given directly to a local community, it could pay for more help than one volunteer can give. This is especially true for gap years, where volunteers often do not need special skills or experience. Many studies ask if gap year volunteering is really about helping others or if young people want to improve their own careers. However, these projects can help people learn to act kindly towards those who have less.

B. Volunteering can help people understand each other better, solve problems, and take part in global issues through community organizations. It can also help build international friendships. In this way, everyone can benefit, both the volunteers and the communities they help. But if only rich people can volunteer, it may help them in their careers but not help the communities that need it most. Volunteers will continue to gain from these experiences while using the communities to improve their own lives.

C. Sometimes, international volunteering can be seen as a way for rich people to help themselves while pretending to help others. It can also be a way to provide real help for development. At its best, volunteering can help both the volunteers and the organizations they work with, while also sharing skills and experiences with communities that are developing. Most importantly, volunteering can help people understand and care about the unfair power differences and the deep causes of poverty and injustice.

D. Volunteer tourism fits well with the idea of helping others. These small efforts to ""make a difference"" can seem good, especially when people are tired of big governments and businesses. However, this can also ignore the need for real government and turn development into simple acts of charity. While volunteering can be a good thing, when it is presented as a way to create sustainable development, it can show a misunderstanding of the real issues of poverty and inequality in the world."
CAE_55,"**Text: Sound the Alarm**

Stuart Harris reports

Many people listen to the radio in the morning. Most of us need something to help us get out of bed. This is why we have clock radios. But how do you choose a good one?

A group of us, including the inventor Tom Granger and broadcaster Paul Bridges, tested five clock radios that are available now. One model has a 'dual alarm function'. This means you can set two different wake-up times, one for work days and one for weekends. But who really needs two alarms? This model costs about the same as another one we tested, but it has a cassette player. You can listen to your favorite tapes to fall asleep and wake up to music instead of news. We all thought the radio quality was very good, but the clock radio is very big, like a rugby ball. Paul Bridges said, ""Any clock radio I buy must leave space on my bedside table for my keys, wallet, glasses, and phone. I always book a wake-up call just in case the alarm does not go off.""

This model was voted the best-looking and the overall winner. Paul Bridges said he was ""in love with it,"" but the clock he tested kept getting stuck at 16:00. I liked the digital display with its nice grey numbers on a soft green background. The snooze button is wide, so you can tap it easily with your eyes closed. However, the buttons felt nice to touch, and I ended up pressing them too much, which made it hard to understand the instruction booklet. The clock has a backup battery, so you do not have to reset it if the power goes out. We all liked this feature. But we found it hard to set up, even though it made us feel cool when we finally did it.

Tom Granger thought this model, which has a built-in lamp, looked cheap. He said, ""You have to pull the light out to make it work, which makes me question the quality."" He had to read the instructions twice to get it to work because the clock kept changing from 12:00 to 02:00. The light was hard to position; it only shines on the clock, which is already lit. Paul Bridges thought the lamp idea was funny but agreed that the radio was hard to tune. The buzzer sounded like a submarine alarm and made me want to throw it across the room. Interestingly, this model is the third most popular on the market. It is bright and colorful, which appealed to Tom Granger and me. Tom said, ""I would choose this one because it stands out.""

The traditional design of the controls made it the only one we could set up without reading the instructions. Unfortunately, the alarm can be 20 minutes early or late. The manual says, ""The alarm may sound about 10 minutes earlier or later than the set time."" Paul Bridges laughed at this idea and said this model was ""very difficult to use"" and ""completely useless.""

The simplest and cheapest model we tested was liked by Tom Granger because it was small and had old-fashioned dial tuning. He said, ""It's easier to set up. With modern buttons, you are never sure if you pressed everything correctly."" He agreed that companies had to improve radio quality because of button tuning. I thought the tuning was not very good, and Paul Bridges agreed, but we both thought the radio quality was fine. The buzzer on this model worked well; it got me out of bed in just two beeps!"
CAE_50,"**Text: Hedgehogs**

A hedgehog is a small animal with sharp spines on its body. Hedgehogs live in many parts of the world, but they are not found in America or Australia. All hedgehogs can roll into a tight ball when they are in danger. This helps protect them because their spines point outwards. How well this works depends on how many spines the hedgehog has. Some hedgehogs that live in the desert have fewer spines. They may try to run away from danger instead of rolling up. 

Hedgehogs are mostly active at night and sleep during the day. They often sleep under bushes or in holes in the ground. All hedgehogs can hibernate, but not all of them do. Some hedgehogs stay awake all year if the conditions are good."

It is hard to be good at any sport, even for men, but women have to work even harder. Training and competitions take a lot of time, so they have to make sacrifices. Despite this, they are overcoming challenges and breaking records. Here, we talk to some amazing British sportswomen who are reaching their goals.

A. **Jill, 27, Skier**  
""I love to ski and feel great when I jump and land well, but it can be scary. Sometimes I don’t feel well or the weather is bad, but I keep going. I train for ten months each year, so I miss a lot of time with friends. There are six men and three women on the British team, and we all compete together.""

B. **Caroline, 22, Cyclist**  
""Two years ago, I borrowed a bike for a charity race and won! I was surprised because I had never cycled before. Now, I earn good money as a professional cyclist. I train for at least four hours every day, plus I do some stretching, swimming, and running. My boyfriend is also a cyclist, so he understands how much time it takes.""

C. **Annabel, 26, Rower**  
""Rowing is hard for girls because not many schools offer it. Most girls start when they are 19 or 20, which makes it harder to compete internationally. Coaches often change, so it can be difficult for the women’s team. But I enjoy it and like being fit, plus I have a good social life.""

D. **Ffyona, 24, Long Distance Walker**  
""When I was 13, I dreamed of walking around the world. I didn’t know how big it was! Walking across Australia was very painful. I walked 50 miles a day with little sleep and many blisters. But I set a record! Some people think women are more likely to fail, so it is harder to get sponsors.""

E. **Lisa, 26, Saloon Car Racer**  
""Some men are very competitive when driving. When I do well, they often ignore me. Being a woman in racing has its challenges. Men try to beat me, and I have had many accidents. It is hard to earn money, and what I do earn goes back into racing. More women are starting to race now, which is great!""

F. **Alison, 28, Triathlete**  
""I wake up at 5:30 three mornings a week to swim. I need to sleep on Tuesday and Thursday mornings. In the evenings, I cycle or run. Sometimes I feel tired at work! Racing is tough, but I feel happier when I stay fit. Men and women usually compete together, but the media often focuses more on men’s events. The prize money for women is not as good, but we are working to change that."""

The day I met Picasso

Richard Cork remembers the day he met Picasso when he was 18 years old. He was a student traveling around Europe and Morocco in an old van. One day, he ran out of money and found a job painting boats. He often drew pictures and had a sketchbook with him.

One day, Richard saw Picasso sitting at a table in a restaurant in Cannes. Picasso was famous and usually stayed away from people. Richard was surprised to see him there with his wife, Jacqueline, and some friends. He was nervous but asked Picasso for his signature. To his surprise, Picasso agreed and wrote his name on Richard's paper. Then, he drew some lines on the page, which might have looked like clouds or waves.

Richard thanked Picasso and tried to talk to him. Since Picasso did not speak much English, an American woman at the table helped translate. She called Picasso ""the Maestro."" Richard told Picasso that he loved art and admired his work.

After a while, Richard went back to his boat and showed his friend the signature. His friend said, ""Is that all? Go back and talk to him more!"" So, Richard took his sketchbook and returned to Picasso's table. He did not ask if he could draw Picasso's portrait because he was afraid of being refused. Instead, he just started to draw.

When Picasso saw Richard drawing, he made funny faces to distract him. Richard wanted to stop, but he felt challenged to keep going. Finally, Picasso relaxed and let Richard study him. Richard noticed how strong and young Picasso looked, even though he was almost 84 years old. Picasso had bright, dark eyes that were very interesting to look at.

The American woman told Richard that Picasso wanted to see his drawing. Richard felt shy and said it was not good enough. But Picasso insisted, and when Richard showed him the drawing, Picasso nodded in approval. Then, to Richard's surprise, Picasso took the crayon and quickly drew a picture of Richard. 

Picasso's drawing was very different from Richard's. He made Richard look funny and lively. Richard thanked Picasso and asked him to sign the drawing. The American woman said that Picasso said he already gave Richard his signature. Richard felt lucky to have met Picasso and to have received his attention."
CAE_12,"**Text: Shopping Tricks**

Have you ever gone into a store and bought more than you planned? Here are some tricks that shops use to make you spend more money.

A. **Freshness First**  
Supermarkets know that people like fresh food. They often put fruits and vegetables at the entrance of the store. They might also have a bakery that makes the smell of fresh bread fill the store. The color green is often used in stores because it makes people think of fresh food. Most of what supermarkets sell, like frozen food and cleaning products, is not fresh.

B. **Smart Displays**  
Where products are placed in the store is very important. Supermarkets use computers to find out where shoppers look the most. They put the most expensive items in these places. Items at eye level are more likely to be bought. Special bins with discounts attract people who love a good deal. Sometimes, stores place items that go well together near each other, like ice cream and toppings.

C. **Hiding Essentials**  
Supermarkets often place basic items like bread and sugar far from the entrance. This way, shoppers pass by other tempting items. Stores may also put popular products far away, hoping that loyal customers will look for them and see other items they might want to buy.

D. **Less is More**  
Some chain stores have changed how they show their products. For example, Next stores display fewer items to make them look special. Even though their clothes are made in large amounts, good store design helps them sell better.

E. **Total Costs Matter**  
Shoppers often care more about the total cost of their shopping than the price of each item. Supermarkets mix cheap items with more expensive ones. They sometimes sell basic items at a loss to attract customers. They can get lower prices by buying in large amounts or by giving products good display space.

F. **Price Tags**  
In chain stores, shoppers usually buy fewer items and pay more attention to prices. For example, pricing a blouse at £14.99 instead of £15 can make a difference. This also helps reduce theft because staff must ring up sales to give change.

G. **Lighting**  
Both supermarkets and chain stores think carefully about lighting. Chain stores try to use natural light so shoppers can see colors well. Supermarkets use special lights to make fresh fruits and vegetables look better.

H. **Store Layout**  
Many chain stores use different carpets to guide shoppers. One pattern shows the way through the store, and another shows sales areas. This helps shoppers move along paths called the ""Yellow Brick Road."" Some shoppers, however, do not want to leave these paths.

I. **In-Store Ads**  
When you enter a supermarket, you see big pictures of delicious food. In some U.S. supermarkets, shopping carts have screens that show ads for products while you shop. These ads are meant to catch the attention of shoppers and can increase sales a lot."
CAE_26,"**Text: Sea, Ice & Rock**

Chris Bonnington (58) is famous for climbing Mount Everest in 1985. He has also created new climbing routes in Britain and the Alps and has written many books, like *Quest for Adventure* and *Everest the Hard Way*. Robin Knox-Johnston (53) started his career at sea in the Merchant Navy. In 1968-9, he was the first person to sail around the world alone in his yacht, Sunhaili. He set a record by sailing from New York to the Lizard in just 10 days. 

Chris and Robin worked together to sail and climb in Greenland, and they wrote a book about their trip called *Sea, Ice and Rock*. In 1979, Chris was working on *Quest for Adventure*, a study of adventure after the war. He called Robin for an interview, and Robin invited him to join him for a sail. Chris could teach Robin some climbing skills, and Robin could teach Chris about sailing. It was Chris's first time on a yacht. 

They sailed for a while and then stopped. Robin's wife and daughter stayed on the boat while Chris and Robin paddled to the shore to practice climbing. The climb was hard, but Chris was impressed by how steady Robin was. When they reached a big drop, Chris asked Robin if he had ever climbed before. Robin had not, so Chris showed him how to do it. Robin asked if he could go down the way he used ropes on his boat. Chris wanted him to use his legs, but Robin lowered himself down safely. 

During their trip to Skye, Chris and Robin became good friends. Robin suggested they combine their skills for a trip to Greenland, which was a big step from their Skye trip. Chris admired Robin as a leader. Normally, the captain makes all the decisions, but Robin asked everyone for their opinions first. Most of the time, people did not give advice, but it felt good to be part of the decision-making. 

Chris found sailing boring and hard. He liked the excitement of problems at sea, but he did not like being on the ocean for many days. Chris preferred land and was not very handy. Robin, on the other hand, loved sailing and enjoyed fixing things on the boat. Chris sometimes felt useless because Robin did not really need him. The crew was also very close together: six people on a small yacht meant for four. On a mountain, you can get away from each other.

When they reached Greenland, Chris had to lead the climbing expedition. He felt nervous about Robin's safety. If Robin fell, he could pull Chris down too. Chris did not expect climbing the Cathedral, Greenland's highest mountain, to be so hard. Robin was not a natural climber, which made his efforts even more impressive. The first time they tried to reach the top, they climbed for 24 hours. On the way down, they were so tired that they almost fell asleep on steep slopes, 1,500 feet above the ground. Robin trusted Chris completely and just followed him. When it became too hard, Chris knew they had to turn back, and Robin accepted it. 

Robin was also worried about their boat and whether it would be okay in the ice. Still, he wanted to try climbing the mountain again. The only time they had a problem was on the way home. They took turns watching the boat. Chris was supposed to wake up at 4 am for his turn, but Robin did not wake him. Robin thought he could do it alone. Chris felt that Robin did not trust him, and he told him so. Robin quickly reassured Chris that he was wrong to think that. 

While they enjoyed the trip to Skye, they did not really know each other until the end of the Greenland expedition. Chris found that Robin was a kind and sensitive person, even if he seemed tough on the outside."
CAE_8,"**A History of the Apple**

Apples have been around for a very long time. They come in many colors, shapes, and sizes. But today, we might lose some of the different kinds of apples we have.

**Prehistoric Times (8,000 BC)**  
People have eaten apples since ancient times. In Britain, they threw away apple seeds. About 10,000 years ago, people found apple remains near lakes in Switzerland and Italy. In Switzerland and near the Caucasus mountains, ancient people stored wild apples for winter. These apples were small and different from the apples we eat today.

**Norman Times (1000 AD)**  
The French learned how to grow fruit from the Romans. This knowledge included making cider. The Romans brought some apple types to Britain, but many did not grow well there. After the Normans came, they brought new apple types. British monks also worked to create new kinds of apples. Most apples we have today come from these old varieties.

**Medieval Times (1200)**  
In the thirteenth century, several apple types became popular in Britain. The Old English Pearmain was a main dessert apple until the 1700s. The Costard was a cooking apple sold in markets. But bad weather and diseases made it hard to grow apples, so more apples were brought in from other places. In the sixteenth century, King Henry VIII sent a man named Richard Harris to France to learn about growing apples. Harris returned with many new apple types, including the famous Pippins.

**Settlers and Apples (1750)**  
By the seventeenth century, apples were very popular in Britain. When people moved to Canada, Australia, the US, South Africa, and New Zealand, they took apples with them. Captain Bligh took apples to Australia, and the Pilgrim Fathers took them to America. A famous apple planter in North America was John Chapman, known as 'Johnny Appleseed'. He planted many apple trees and was loved by the Native Americans.

**Modern Apples (1850)**  
In Iowa, a farmer named Jesse Hiatt found a new apple tree and named the apple 'Hawkey'. At a fruit show, a judge tasted it and said it was 'Delicious'. This apple became very popular. Another famous apple, the Granny Smith, was found in Australia by Maria Anne Smith. She discovered a small tree growing from old fruit and grew the first green apples, which became famous.

**Uniformity in Apples (1950)**  
Today, apples are grown all over the world, but most come from just a few types. These apples are often chosen for their looks or how well they travel, not for their taste. Many old apple types are disappearing. In the UK, some gardeners keep old varieties alive, but in the US, many apples from 100 years ago are gone. People want more types of apples. We need to care about keeping different kinds of apples and other foods for everyone."

Richard Nerurkar is a long-distance runner from Britain. He is one of the best 10,000-metre runners in his country. He visits a training camp in Kenya, which is ten miles south of the equator. There is a mountain path that starts from a quiet road in Nairobi. This path leads to Mount Kenya, the highest mountain in Kenya. This beautiful and quiet place is called Nanyuk. For three years, it has been my place for training in the winter. But I had never trained with Kenyan runners before. 

On my fourth trip to Kenya, I decided to change this. I ran in my first race in Kenya and stayed at the national team training camp. This is where the best Kenyan runners prepare for the World Cross-Country Team Championships. I was invited by the national team coach after I finished fifth in the World Championship 10,000 meters race. It was a great chance for me. 

Training at high altitude helps runners make more red blood cells, which helps them carry oxygen better. This is one reason why many Kenyan runners are successful. My first race in Africa was also special because it was the first international cross-country race in Africa. There were 41 runners who finished before me, and almost all of them were Kenyan. I felt I did okay in the race!

I think Kenyan runners are successful for more reasons than just the high altitude. They have a simple and relaxed way of running. They enjoy competing and have a simple diet. But how do they train? I learned about their training at the camp. 

The national team training camp is at St Mark's College, which is 6,200 feet up Mount Kenya. The camp is basic, and the athletes live with regular students in shared rooms. Their daily routine includes three workouts: a morning run, interval training in the middle of the day, and a steady run in the late afternoon. The day starts at six in the morning. We would meet with the coaches before the morning run. They told us to run easy because we had a hard day ahead. 

Each day, we ran about 40 kilometers, which is close to a marathon distance. On Sundays, we only ran 20 kilometers, which was a nice break. Life at the camp was simple. We washed our faces and brushed our teeth before breakfast. Breakfast was tea, bread, and boiled eggs in a small dining area. Lunch and dinner were similar: ugali (a maize dish), stew, cabbage or spinach, and tea. After running, we would drive to a stream to wash off in the evening.

By the time I left the camp, I understood more about why Kenyan runners are successful. Their success is not just because of their genes or where they come from. I think the simple life in the mountains, their hard training, and their love for running are the real reasons why Kenya is so good at distance running. 

**Questions:**

1. Who is Richard Nerurkar?
2. Where is the training camp located?
3. What is the name of the highest mountain in Kenya?
4. How many kilometers do the runners run each day?
5. What do they eat for breakfast at the camp?"

**The Problems of Mass Marketing**

Almost everyone knows that advertising is not doing well. It is not just because of the recession. Advertising started to decline in 1989, before the recession really began. The problems with advertising are serious and happen all over the world. The sad truth is that advertising has not kept up with changes in the economy. Advertisers think about large groups of people, but as more brands and media appear, the target audiences have become smaller and more specific. Even big brand campaigns should focus on smaller groups, but they usually do not.

Think about your own shopping. When you go to a supermarket, you might buy 30, 40, or even 50 items. Most of these items are not from advertised brands. You might buy a few well-known brands, but you will not buy many different brands in a year. For example, you may only buy about 400 different brands in a year, even though there are many more brands advertised.

According to Media Register, there are about 32,500 branded goods and services advertised. If we look at the 9,500 brands that Media Register lists, the average person only buys about 400 of them. This means that about 96% of advertising does not lead to sales. When you watch TV, count how many ads are for brands you buy. Most people find that only about 6% of the ads are for brands they will buy.

Many people think they are different and that they do not pay attention to advertising. But the truth is, most people do not buy most of the brands they see in ads. There is always waste in advertising because not everyone who sees an ad will buy the product. However, advertising can still be effective. It needs to reach many people to find the few who will respond. 

Even with smart targeting, advertisers cannot know exactly who will buy their products. This is different from selling face-to-face, where a salesperson can connect with every customer they talk to. If advertisers knew exactly who would respond, they would not need to use mass media at all.

For any advertising campaign, getting just 2% of the adult population to buy a product is considered very successful. The best way to reach people may still be through mass media, but advertising needs to be more focused than ever to be effective again."

**Solar Survivor: Charles Clover Visits a Green Home**

Charles Clover goes inside a very eco-friendly home in Southwell, Nottinghamshire. This place has some surprises. First, it has Southwell Minster, a little-known ancient cathedral. Writers who care about the environment like it because of the 'green' men figures carved by craftsmen in the thirteenth century.

The second surprise is the 'autonomous house,' which is the greenest home in Britain. It was designed and built by Robert and Brenda Vale. They use rainwater for washing and drinking, recycle their waste into compost for the garden, and heat their home with waste heat from their appliances and their own body heat, along with that of their three teenage children and two cats, Edison and Faraday. 

You might not notice the house at first. It looks traditional with a clay tile roof and is located 300 yards from the Minster. It was built to match the orange brick of the town's old buildings and was approved by planners, even in a conservation area. When you ring the solar-powered doorbell, it is very quiet inside. The house is well-insulated, with special windows that keep out noise. 

When you enter and take off your shoes (as Robert asks), it feels very calm. On a sunny summer day, the windows are closed, and the conservatory warms the air before it goes into the house. Robert opens clever ventilation shafts and windows to let in fresh air. The house is designed to keep out drafts, and even the cats have their own small door.

The Vales, who teach architecture at Nottingham University, cared about the environment long before it became popular. They wrote a book about green architecture in the 1970s called *The Autonomous House*. They wanted to create a building that did not produce carbon dioxide. They also decided to not use mains water. They built special toilets, put rainwater tanks in the cellar, and used copper gutters to keep the drinking water clean. They filter the water before using it. Water from washing goes into the garden, and they do not have a dishwasher because they think using strong detergents is wrong.

Robert says, ""We wanted people to see that it is possible to design a house that is better for the environment, without living in the dark."" The only old-fashioned part of the house is the hall, which has the fireplace and staircase going up to the top of the building. The Vales do not pay water bills. Last winter, the house used only nine units of electricity a day, costing about 70p. This is much less than what other four-bedroom houses use.

Soon, they will add solar panels to generate more electricity. The house will still use mains electricity for cooking and appliances, but it will make more electricity than it needs. One day, it might even charge an electric car. The only heating is a small wood-burning stove in the hall, which they say they only use in very cold weather. 

Is the house warm in winter? One night in February, Robert was reading and said it was too warm to light the fire. The temperature on the first floor was 18°C, which is lower than usual, but he said it felt comfortable because there were no drafts and everything was at the same temperature. 

Robert believes that people who live in old houses should go back to how people lived in the past. However, it is hard to imagine many people wanting to do this. The secret of the house is that it is simple and easy to maintain. Most materials were bought from a local store and installed by local workers. This made the house cheap to build, costing the same as low-cost rental housing. It is not surprising that big building companies do not like this idea."
CAE_51,"**Text: The Camera and Fairies**

Arthur Conan Doyle, who created the Sherlock Holmes stories, thought he was a rational man and a scientist. In 1920, he saw photographs of fairies in a garden and believed they were real. He published these photos with an article, saying that fairies were wonderful creatures. 

In 1939, the two women who took the photos said they were fake. They had cut out pictures of fairies from a book and placed them among flowers. The photos looked beautiful, but the trick was simple. This goes against a common idea that a camera always tells the truth. 

Today, we can use computer programs to change our digital photos. It is a myth that photography has ever been completely honest. From the beginning, when cameras started to take pictures, the reality was changed."
CAE_11,"**Text: Blacksmiths**

For a long time, iron has been very important to people, and blacksmiths, who work with iron, have been seen as more than just skilled workers. Before the Industrial Revolution, blacksmiths were as respected as doctors and astrologers because they made weapons, armor, and farming tools. They were also seen as artists. In the 1700s, blacksmiths created beautiful ironwork for St Paul's Cathedral. The lovely metalwork in French and Belgian Art Nouveau buildings was also made by talented blacksmiths. 

However, by the late 1960s, there were very few blacksmiths left in Britain because heavy industry did not need them anymore, and modern architects rarely used beautiful wrought-iron designs. In the last 10 years, there has been a revival of interest in decorative architecture and new interior design styles. Still, much of the work looks similar to old styles, with many manufacturers calling their products ""classical"" or ""Victorian-style."" 

You can find many trendy design stores selling rusty candlesticks with extra decorations. Luckily, there are new events to promote blacksmithing. The first event is an exhibition of ironwork by members of the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA). It opened last week at the Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey. Alan Dawson, the secretary of BABA, says, ""We could be starting a new Iron Age because both the public and blacksmiths are seeing things differently now."" 

Power tools have made it easier for blacksmiths to work with metal. They can now bend, split, twist, and weld metal more easily. Dawson says, ""These artists can now express themselves with this material."" About 250 pieces of work are in the show, including bookends and a spiral staircase. Prices start at £90 and can go much higher. Most of the money will go to the individual makers, but some will be kept by the Association to promote good ironwork. 

Dawson has made an eight-foot gate and a lamp with a glass shade. He says, ""My style comes from letting steel bend and flow when it is hot. It's like drawing with metal in space."" Many artists love working with iron. Unlike other metals, iron and steel are harder to work with when cold. Susan May, a jeweler, says, ""It's magical because it is soft when hot, but when it cools, it becomes hard and strong again."" 

Ann Catrin Evans makes door knockers and handles from mild steel. Her designs are inspired by scary castles from horror films. One design looks like a ball and chain, and another looks like a Celtic cross. She says, ""I love that steel is cold and hard, and it feels like it will last forever."" No other metal gives people as much joy or a feeling of safety. Iron will likely be used for decoration for many years to come, as long as we do not have to see any more rusty candlesticks!"
CAE_14,"**Text: 'THE DAY I GAVE UP SMOKING'**

I thought everyone would be happy when I stopped smoking, but one of my coworkers was very angry. She said, ""What do you mean? If it was that easy, why didn't you stop years ago?"" I found it hard to explain how I went from being a heavy smoker to not smoking at all in just a few hours. It was strange for me too. 

I stopped smoking two months and three weeks ago. I did not plan to stop, and I did not really want to. I felt pressure from people who do not like smoking, and I still feel that way. I also had good health and did not often get sick. 

On that Thursday afternoon, I went to a session called The Easy Way to Stop Smoking. I was there to write an article about other people trying to quit. I said, ""I will not try to stop. I am here to write, not to quit."" I thought this was a good reason. I enjoyed smoking and it made me happy. 

During the session, we could smoke as much as we wanted. The room was full of smoke, and we had to open the windows. I noticed that when I was told to smoke, I did not want to. The messages about stopping smoking started to make sense to me. The idea of not being a smoker began to feel good. 

It was not hard to stop. The cravings for nicotine went away after a few days. I thought working without cigarettes would be hard, but it was not a problem. The hardest part was being at home on weekend mornings. I realized that smoking helped me feel less bored. 

I do miss smoking sometimes, but not too much. Every new experience as a non-smoker is different, like eating out, waiting for a plane, checking into a hotel, or during a break at the theater. These are moments when I would have smoked before."

Dorothy Hodgkin is the only British woman scientist to win a Nobel Prize, but many people in Britain do not know her name. For the last four years, I have been asking my friends if they know about her. If they do, they pass my test. 

Why should people in Britain know about Dorothy Hodgkin? She won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1964 for her work on penicillin and vitamin B12. She also helped discover the structure of insulin. Hodgkin was a very important scientist, but she is not as famous as other Nobel Prize winners in literature.

Hodgkin died in 1994, and her life shows important changes in the 20th century, like the growth of women's education and the spread of science around the world. When I started my research, I wanted to read about other scientists. I looked for a biography of Linus Pauling, who was a friend of Hodgkin and also won Nobel Prizes. But I could not find any books about him in the bookshop. 

Some people think that the lives of scientists are not interesting. Peter Medawar, another Nobel Prize winner, said that scientists' lives are often boring to read. This idea makes it hard for scientists to be seen as interesting people. Some scientists do not want to be in the media because they do not want to seem like they are promoting themselves. 

However, more scientists are now appearing in public in different ways. For example, Professor Richard Dawkins gives prizes on a TV quiz show, and geneticist Steve Jones advertises cars on TV. These activities help people see scientists as real people.

The way we write about scientists is also changing. In the past, biographies were often dull and focused only on their work. But now, books like Richard Feynman's ""Surely You're Joking, Mr Feynman?"" show scientists as interesting people with lives outside of their work. 

Dorothy Hodgkin loved her scientific work. She had three children and a husband who was often away because of his job. Her personal life is not the main focus of her work, but it shows how she balanced her family and her career. 

Hodgkin's passion for science is important. It can be hard to explain scientific ideas to people who do not have a strong background in science. But understanding science is not harder than reading Shakespeare or learning a new language; it just takes practice. 

It is sad that many educated people do not know about important scientists like Dorothy Hodgkin, even though they would feel embarrassed if they did not know famous writers or artists. 

**Questions:**

1. Who is Dorothy Hodgkin?
2. What did Dorothy Hodgkin win a Nobel Prize for?
3. Why is it surprising that many people do not know about Hodgkin?
4. What did Peter Medawar say about the lives of scientists?
5. How are scientists becoming more visible to the public today?
6. What is one way Dorothy Hodgkin balanced her work and personal life?"
CAE_56,"**Text: Margaret and Her Water Finding Skills**

Margaret Wilkins is known for her special ability to find water. She can use a forked hazel stick to find water underground. Many farmers ask for her help when their wells run dry. Margaret and her husband have a well-drilling business. They use machines like drilling rigs, but Margaret prefers her hazel stick for finding water. They have a success rate of over 90%.

This ability to find water is called dowsing. Some people think it is a special skill, while others believe it is based on science. One idea is that everything vibrates, and water vibrates more than other things. Some dowsers say they can feel or smell water. 

In recent years, many farmers have needed Margaret's help because of droughts. Most of her customers are farmers with dry wells. She says, ""We see customers only once in a lifetime because wells last a long time."" Other customers have holiday homes where it is too expensive to run water pipes. Some are building golf courses.

Margaret looks for water between 50 and 70 meters deep. She says, ""You can't drill where there is a risk of waste getting into the water."" The water she finds is usually clean, but she has to be careful because some areas have iron in the water.

To find water, Margaret first looks at a map and uses a pendulum. She holds the pendulum over the map, and it swings when she is above water. After that, she walks in the fields with her hazel stick. When she is above water, she feels a strange sensation. She uses the stick to find the exact spot to drill. 

Margaret holds the two forks of the stick and pulls them slightly apart. If the stick rises, it means water is below. It is important to drill exactly where the stick points. If she and her husband do not agree on the spot, they will keep looking until they do.

Margaret's ability to find water is interesting to many people. She calls it an ""intuitive perception of the environment."" This means she has a special way of understanding where water is. If she did not have this skill, it would be hard for her family to run their well-drilling business."

**We changed lives for a day!** Have you ever thought about living someone else's life for a day? It could be fun to try something new! We did this for four people. Here is what happened.

**A. Amanda's story**  
I had never been in a place like this before. It was dark and noisy, with many people and a great atmosphere. It was very different from my hometown, and I was not sure I could do it! Being a mother is a busy job, but this was harder! I had only fifteen minutes to learn how to carry a tray of drinks. The other waitresses made it look easy, but when I tried, the drinks fell off the tray and spilled everywhere. I felt so embarrassed, but the other waitresses laughed. Everyone makes mistakes at first! 

By 11:30 am, there was a long line of customers outside, and I felt very nervous. I was worried about remembering the orders, but it was easy because everything was done by machines. After a few hours, my feet hurt, and I could not get used to the loud music. Every time a customer spoke to me, I had to say, ""Pardon?"" which was embarrassing! By the end of my shift at 5 pm, I was very tired and wanted to soak my feet in hot water. One waitress told me it was a ""quiet"" day! I never knew waitressing was so tiring. I thought it was an easy job, but you need to be friendly and calm, especially when there are many customers. I am shy, and I don’t think I could work on a busy Saturday night. I was not happy with the pay either. I must have been a bad waitress because even the rich customers did not tip me! I was very glad to go back to my children. Taking care of them seems easy after waitressing!

**B. Cindy's story**  
I was a bit nervous about being a ""mum"" for a day, but I was also excited. I knew the girls could be naughty, but I thought I could handle it. When Amanda left for the restaurant, I had to get the two girls dressed and fed. After dropping off Sophie at school and Katie at nursery, I thought I would have three hours of peace. I was wrong! Amanda reminded me that I still had to make the beds, clean the house, and do the laundry. 

At 1 pm, I picked up Katie, went to the supermarket, and then took her home for lunch. But when I brought Sophie home from school, the real trouble started. They turned the couch into a trampoline and screamed loudly! I thought they would get tired, but I was wrong again. I thought I had a lot of energy, but they were too much for me! After a lot of talking, I got them to bed by 8 pm, but then the fun began! How many glasses of water can a child drink? I knew they just wanted to come downstairs to watch TV, but it was tiring to spend all evening talking with them. I never knew taking care of two small children could be so tiring. You don’t have time to think about yourself, and it feels like a big responsibility. Still, I really enjoyed the day.

**C. Rosemary's story**  
On the farm, I wake up at 5:30 am, so sleeping in until 7 was great! But I took a long time to decide how to dress. I could not wear my farm clothes to school! At assembly, I looked at about 400 students and hoped I did not stand out. Then it was time for a math class. The children worked in small groups, which was different from when I was in school. I helped with a nature project about snails. By lunchtime, I was tired and looked forward to a break, but teachers only have about five minutes to eat. There is so much to do before classes start again. I went to a meeting about reports and helped with sports trials. After lunch, there was a silent reading lesson, which was nice, and then a French lesson. The children wanted to practice their French with me, which showed me how rusty I was! Finally, we had Physical Education. I was very tired, but the children had so much energy. The hardest part was speaking in front of the class, even for just two minutes. Teachers may have more holidays, but I think I will stick to farming!

**D. Hilary's story**  
I arrived at White House Farm at 8:30 am, but Rosemary had been up for three hours! Rosemary's farm has 100 Jersey cows, 15 calves, and about 800 sheep! She also makes ice cream, yogurt, and cream, which she sells. I spent most of the morning in the ice cream shop, filling milk containers, making ice cream, and putting on labels. It was hard not to eat the treats! 

At lunchtime, I checked the sheep. I drove to a field and helped a sheep that had fallen over. If a sheep is left for more than 12 hours, it could die, so they must be checked every day. It must be hard in winter! After feeding the calves, I started milking. It took two and a half hours, and Rosemary does this twice a day, every day! I found it lonely. I missed the children because animals do not talk back! The worst part of the job is that you cannot take time off. The cows must be milked twice a day, so it is hard to plan a break. Rosemary will only have about three days off this year. Farming seems nice, but the reality is very different. The money is not steady, and I would not like to depend on the weather."

A trumpet is not just for Christmas. It is interesting how many musicians come from families without music. Hakan Hardenberger is a special trumpet player from southern Sweden. He is 30 years old and is known around the world. He plays old music from composers and also new music. When you see him, he looks young and friendly, just like the sound of the trumpet.

Recently, he played the Hummel Trumpet Concerto in a big concert hall in London. He also had a TV show about his work, filmed in London and Sweden. Hakan was born near Malmo. When he was eight years old, he got a trumpet as a Christmas gift from his father. His father liked Louis Armstrong's music, so he bought a real trumpet, not a toy. Hakan loved the trumpet and played it all the time.

His mother found a trumpet player from the Malmo Symphony Orchestra to give Hakan lessons. This teacher, Bo Nilsson, saw that Hakan had talent. Hakan is thankful for having such a good teacher. Bo was very passionate about the trumpet and always looked for new ways to play.

Hakan explains that the trumpet is a simple instrument, and it is hard to make a perfect one. Each trumpet is a little different. He learned to accept these differences and work with them. Even as a child, people could recognize Hakan's unique sound.

Unlike another famous trumpet player, John Wallace, who played in orchestras, Hakan always wanted to be a solo artist. He admired the French trumpeter, Maurice Andre, and bought all his records. Hakan's parents supported his dream to be a trumpet player.

When Hakan was 15, he needed to choose where to study. His teacher wanted him to go to America, but it was too far. Instead, he went to Paris at 16 to study with Pierre Thibaud. Thibaud told him that playing in an orchestra was not for him. Hakan knew he played better than many others his age. 

At 17, he entered his first competition in Paris. He only prepared for the first round but made it to the second round. He knew most of the pieces for that round too. In the final round, he faced a difficult piece. He did not win first prize, but he enjoyed playing and realized that people listened to him.

Hakan is honest about his music and career. He does not want to explain how he connects with people through music because he believes it might ruin the magic. He thinks music has the power to move people. 

**Questions:**

1. Where is Hakan Hardenberger from?
2. How old is Hakan?
3. What did Hakan receive as a Christmas gift when he was eight?
4. Who was Hakan's first trumpet teacher?

**ANNE'S DAY**  
""I wake up at 6:30 am, go to the gym at 7 am, and get to work by 8 am. I start surgery at 8:30 am. I do surgery all day on Monday and Wednesday, and sometimes on Friday afternoons. Most brain surgeries take about three hours, but some can take all day. Sometimes, I work for ten hours without eating or going to the bathroom. Deciding when to do surgery can be stressful. I don’t feel stressed while I operate, but I sometimes worry about the next day. Brain surgery is usually a last option for patients, but when it works, it is amazing. From 10 am to 1 pm, I see patients to explain their operations. I enjoy this and find it easy to talk to them. If they are upset, I try to comfort them, but I have to be quick. I leave work between 6 pm and 8 pm. Some nights and weekends, I am on call, and I always carry my beeper. When I am on holiday, I worry about my patients for the first three days, and I dream about operating at night. I find it hard to relax.""

**Age:** 31  

**MARITA'S DAY**  
""I wake up at 7:45 am, leave home by 8:20 am, take the train to work, and arrive at 9:15 am. At 10:30 am on Monday, we meet to talk about our work and any problems. I work in a team with three senior designers, a partner, and a junior designer. My job is mostly about production, with some design work. I get a brief from the client about what they want. I spend three to four weeks designing and developing the project. After that, I show my ideas to the client. If they like them, we make budgets and I hire photographers and illustrators. I also work with printers to make sure everything is done on time. I spend a lot of time managing people. I have to communicate well with everyone. When their work is ready, I put everything together and send it to the printers. It can be very stressful to manage many projects at once. Deadlines are always close, and my day is not always the same. I have lunch at 1 pm for an hour, and we often go to the pub. If the client likes my designs, it feels great, but it is disappointing if they don’t. I get home at 7:30 pm at the earliest, but sometimes it is much later. I find it hard to relax when I am busy.""

**Age:** 42  

**LINDA'S DAY**  
""I wake up at about 7 am most days, but two or three times a week, I wake up between 4:30 am and 5 am for long flights. At 10:30 or 11 am, I might go for a bike ride or swim. Because driving is a sitting job, I have to eat well and exercise. I usually have a big breakfast and snacks during the day. People often ask me for restaurant or shop recommendations, so I need to know the area. Many jobs are booked in advance, so I can check the routes. Not all passengers are polite; some can be rude. But most are nice, and I have good relationships with my regular clients. Sometimes I hear things in the car that I shouldn’t, so I focus on driving. I work seven days a week, up to fifteen hours a day. I try to go to bed by 11 pm.""

We spend about an hour and a half at each house. At about 11 am, we go to a cafe for a big breakfast. In summer, I may work until 10 pm; in winter, until 4:30 pm. I have an office at home, so when I get back, I check messages and return calls. If someone wants a new garden, I usually meet them in the evening. We use old materials to make gardens look old. Sometimes, clients have strange ideas, but it is satisfying to see a garden we created. It is hard to relax in the evenings because I can hear the phone ring. I sleep well because my job is very physical, and I am always tired at the end of the day.""

I help solve problems and coordinate the workers. The workers start at 6 am, so my first job is to find out what happened since I left the night before. The rest of my day depends on what I learn. I usually have paperwork to do or questions to answer. I have lunch for about half an hour between 2 pm and 2:30 pm, but I often eat while I work. The workers have set meal times, so I check things when they are eating. Because I check their work, we need to have a good relationship.

If I work early, I leave home by 8:00 am. I start the electronic sales system and make sure someone is at the cash register. I help customers find and order books. I enjoy serving customers, but it can be hard when they expect me to find many books quickly. From 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm, publishers’ representatives visit, and I discuss new books with them. I need to make sure new titles arrive on time. I finish my early shift at 5:45 pm. On two days a week, I work late and close the shop.

I listen to the news at 7:00 am, then get up and take a taxi to work, arriving at 8:45 am. I contact freelance reporters to learn about my region. I assess financial risks for companies working abroad and warn clients about possible problems. I provide three services: an online news preview, a security forecast, and a travel information guide. From 9:15 am to 9:30 am, I meet with editors to discuss stories. I have deadlines to meet, so I work quickly. I travel to Africa about three times a year to report on events.

**Get the leading edge - motivate yourself to take control at work.**

A. **What makes a good leader?**  
A leader is someone who inspires others and helps them change for the better. Leadership is not about being tall or smart. Pat Dixon, who wrote the book *Making the Difference: Women and Men in the Workplace*, says that leadership is about ""making things happen with people who are as excited and interested as you are."" A good leader should be enthusiastic and able to speak clearly and confidently. It is important to say ""I believe"" instead of ""I think.""

B. John van Maurik, who teaches a Leadership in Management course, says, ""Most people can be better leaders than they think."" To become a leader, you need to find and develop your hidden talents. In a way, we are all born to be leaders; we just need the right situation to grow. It is easy to see leadership in famous people like Emmeline Pankhurst, Mahatma Gandhi, or Richard Branson, but it can be harder to see it in our own jobs. However, being a good leader is very important for good management.

C. Think about the best and worst boss you have had. They might have been good at setting goals and meeting deadlines. But how did they achieve these goals? The best leader motivated you and supported you. The worst leader made you feel unimportant and kept information from you. When things went wrong, they blamed you. The first leader was very good; the second one was not good at all.

D. Leaders and managers are different. Managers like to work within set rules. Leaders create new ideas. Micheal Shea, who wrote *Leadership Rules*, says, ""A good manager can keep a company running smoothly, but a good leader can change a struggling organization, whether it is a company, a sports team, or a country.""

E. Whether you are the boss or a middle manager, you can improve your leadership skills. Here are some lessons to learn:  
- Leadership works best when you choose to do it. Find out what you care about. When you feel inspired to lead, use that energy and take action.  
- Start thinking of yourself as a leader. Your ability to lead is an important part of you.  
- Working together is good, but sometimes you need to be a strong leader. Try different styles. If you usually ask others for their opinions, try taking the lead yourself. See how this changes the results.  
- Set goals and try to achieve them. Look at your job and see where being a leader can help you do better and grow in your career.

F.  
- Leadership does not just happen. It grows when you take the lead, take risks, and learn from mistakes. Learn to delegate tasks, motivate others, organize, and give praise.  
- Don’t think that everyone will like your way of leading right away. Keep improving your communication skills. You don’t have to be liked, but your ideas should be respected.  
- Be visible and available to important people. Remember, you don’t have to lead all the time. Know when your help is needed and how you can help others become leaders too."

**Film critic Nick James reviews some recent movies.**

**A. Abyss**  
Before Titanic, director James Cameron made a tense Cold War movie about oil workers and navy experts trying to save a nuclear submarine deep underwater. The funny and brave foreman Bud and his team remind us of tough heroes in movies by Howard Hawks. The special effects and set design are very good. However, the dialogue and characters are not strong. The story feels like a simple B-movie.

**B. The Thin Red Line**  
This video version of the James Jones novel about the battle for Guadalcanal is directed by Andrew Marton. It is different from Terrence Malick's new film. Malick's film is poetic and mystical, while Marton's is a more traditional war movie. He focuses on one soldier and his tough sergeant. Malick's film is richer and more complex, but Marton's version has some good moments. The soldier's flashback about his wife is done in a strong way, which some may prefer over Malick's softer images.

**C. On Guard**  
This fun swashbuckler is based on Paul Feval's 1875 novel. It is better than most musketeer movies. Fabrice Luchini plays a villain who causes trouble behind the scenes. Vincent Perez is a lively hero, even if he does not last long. Daniel Auteuil is a bit too serious for this type of film, but he has his moments as a swordsman. The filmmakers use classic costume drama ideas with so much humor that it works well.

**D. Character**  
This serious story is set in Rotterdam at the turn of the century. The detailed production and costumes make the film look like a museum piece. Jan Decleir plays the harsh bailiff Dreverhaven, who is cruel when evicting tenants. His bad relationship with his son is the main part of the story, but the filmmakers focus too much on the details and not enough on the dark story.

**E. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly**  
This re-released video shows off director Leone's skills. The sound editing is excellent; every sound is clear. The story is very harsh, and when it slows down, Morricone's great music brings excitement. Morally, there is not much difference between the good (Clint Eastwood), the bad (Lee van Cleef), and the ugly (Ell Wallach), as they all act badly in the post-Civil War West.

**F. The Longest Day**  
The publicity says ""Forty-eight International stars"" for this three-hour war movie by Darryl Zanuck. With four directors and 23,000 extras, it is a big production. The early scenes, where the soldiers wait for news about the invasion, are slow for both the audience and the soldiers. It is impressive in size, but it is better to watch on a big screen. Watching it on video does not give the same experience."

**BOOK A** Steve Martin's *Compelling Evidence* is very interesting. The main character is a lawyer who is trying to start a new job after leaving a big law firm. He has to defend his boss's wife when she is accused of killing her husband. The trial scenes are exciting, and the ending has a surprising twist. This is a great first book in a popular genre.

**BOOK B** *Curtains for the Cardinal* starts with a lot of action. The main character, Sigismondo, helps rich people in Italy during the Renaissance. He gets involved in politics and a murder case, but we believe he will find out who is guilty. The story is complicated and a bit long, but it is still very good.

**BOOK C** *File Under: Deceased* introduces a new detective, Leah Hunter, who is a tax inspector. She starts to investigate when a strange man dies in front of her. Even though she faces problems and the local detective does not approve of her, Leah is brave and smart. She is a great character.

**BOOK D** *Double Deuce* by Robert B. Parker features Spenser, a private investigator. He helps his friend Hawk to remove drug dealers from a poor area in Boston. The dialogue is quick and clever, and there is more thinking than usual. It is always good entertainment from Parker.

**BOOK E** *False Prophet* by Faye Kellermann has detectives Pete Decker and Marge Dunn solving a case about an attack and robbery at a famous actress's daughter’s house. The author's easy writing style and focus on strange human behavior make this mystery fun to read.

**BOOK F** *Blood Red, Snow White* is written by husband and wife team Diane Henry and Nicholas Horrock. It features another lawyer and a female client, but the action happens outside the courtroom. The lawyer becomes a victim as the story unfolds. It has romance, money, and violence, making it an exciting suspense novel.

**BOOK G** *Dead for a Ducat* by Simon Shaw shows actor Philip Fletcher as a target. A funny group of characters comes together to film a story about Robin Hood, but Philip feels this is not the right direction for his career. Simon Shaw usually entertains well, but this time the story is not as strong.

**BOOK H** *Fall Down Easy* is Lawrence Gough's best book in a while. Canadian police are looking for a clever bank robber who targets female bank tellers. The story builds tension slowly and shows the smart but troubled robber, making it better than an average detective novel."

I might be too old for this, but here I go! At 34, Tim Pozzi has left a good job to go backpacking. He thinks about why he and others his age want to travel. This summer, I quit my job and decided to rent my flat and travel in South East Asia for a year. You might think I'm lucky, but I'm 34 years old and I'm nervous. I have traveled before. After university, I spent two years backpacking in North and South America. When I came back, I wanted to travel again someday. But then I fell in love, started a career, bought a flat, and got used to earning money. I realized I was giving up my happiness for my salary. When I gave my resignation letter, it felt like I was in control of my life again. I have no ties now. Many of my friends are married with children. They don’t want to change places with me, but they envy my freedom. I am not in a relationship, and I don’t have big career goals. I feel I should enjoy this freedom, even for my friends! 

Why am I so nervous? First, I need to make plans. How can I let someone else live in my home? How do I organize renting it out? And I need to decide where to go. I often put things off and I am already behind my schedule. I thought, “I might as well enjoy the summer in England,” and then, “Why not wait for the football season?” It is hard to cut emotional ties. I wonder if I can still handle backpacking. Will I be able to live simply? Will I feel out of place with younger backpackers? Maybe not. Many people in their late twenties and thirties in Britain want to leave their lives and travel. Jennifer Cox from Lonely Planet says more people are realizing they can have adventures: “People who always say ‘I wish I had that chance’ are now seeing they can have it anytime. They just need to be brave and organized.”

For Danny, a 30-year-old accountant, and his girlfriend Tammy, a 28-year-old teacher, this trip is a last chance before settling down. They bought a round-the-world ticket for a year. Danny says, “I’m ready to give up job security for this trip. I know I won’t move up in my career, but I think it’s a risk worth taking. When I left the office, I threw my calculator into the river to show I was serious!” For Matt, who just left the Army, traveling helped him change. “In the military, there is a set way to do things. I needed to change that to live well as a civilian.” 

There are many reasons to travel at my age. Angela Baron from the Institute of Personnel Development says, “Today, many people work on short-term contracts. If your contract ends, you have nothing to lose.” Some big companies even allow career breaks. “If you train someone well, it’s good to know they will come back instead of going to a competitor.” Dan Hiscocks, from Travellerseye, says more thirty-somethings are thinking about their lives. “If you are not happy, it’s not just about staying in a job. Now people know there are opportunities and that a job is not forever. Travel lets you think about your life.”

Is wanting to travel just a sign that my generation can’t handle adulthood? Jennifer Cox says no. “It shows a better-educated, more stable society. We care more about living a balanced life than just paying bills. We ask ourselves, ‘Is this what I want?’” Ben, a 32-year-old picture researcher going to Central America for a year, does not think he is running away. “I am running towards something. I want to grab what I want for myself.” But he is also nervous. “I will miss my comfortable routine, going to the office every day, saying ‘hi’ to everyone, and having coffee.” 

I feel the same way about leaving my easy life. I might not be going on this trip if my boss wasn’t so hard to deal with. Jennifer Cox says, “This is common. A big change, like a breakup or losing a job, can push people to travel.” It took a little push for me to start, but now I feel excited about the next 12 months. No matter what happens, I will be happy that I took this chance. I think many of us older backpackers feel the same way!

CAE_42,"**Text: 'Working from Home'**

Georgina McGuiness took a long break from her job as a journalist. She felt she did not know much about new technology. In this text, she shares how she changed her home into a good place to work.

The Christmas before last, I turned 37 years old. I realized I needed to get back to my job in journalism. I looked at my resume and saw that I was stuck in the past, like in the 1980s, when typewriters were common. I thought no one would want to hire me because I did not know how to use a computer. Many job ads asked for experience in desktop publishing, which I did not have. I felt like I could not even use a computer.

I thought it would be hard to leave home to work, but then I entered a competition in a local newspaper. My family and I won a computer package! We got a laptop for my husband and a personal computer for the family. We started to learn about the Internet and began chatting with people from around the world. The children loved using the computer, and I set up a small office in the kitchen. I had a phone, a fax machine, and everything I needed to work from home while taking the kids to school.

At first, I was scared to use the computer. I thought I would lose my work if I pressed the wrong button. But I learned the basic skills I needed. It was easier than I thought. I started writing articles for a magazine, and now I feel proud that I can work from home.

The computer helped me become more organized. Before, my desk was always messy, and I lost important papers. Now, I can keep track of my money and save time with invoices and letters. I can also research stories online and talk to other journalists.

However, working from home has some downsides. I sometimes feel lonely because I do not see many people. There are also distractions at home, like chores and sharing the computer with my children. But many people are buying computers for work and fun, and they enjoy not having to travel to work every day.

A report about computer use in UK homes says that most home workers are educated and own a personal computer. I feel like I am doing well with my computer skills. One day, I might even send an article to a newspaper in Australia or start my own magazine from home. The possibilities are endless!"
CAE_59,"**The Tartan Museum**

The Tartan Museum is in Edinburgh, Scotland. It has modern buildings that look like cheese wedges. The outside of the museum is very big and easy to see. It has a tall yellow tower and a garden hanging from the roof. When it opened, people had different opinions about the building. Some thought it was beautiful, while others did not like it.

Now, the inside of the museum is almost ready. The exhibitions will tell many stories about Scotland's history. There are important objects, like jewels from Mary Queen of Scots. The museum wants to show these treasures without too much national pride. 

Dr. David Clarke is in charge of the exhibitions. He wants visitors to enjoy their time at the museum. He says it is for everyone, even those who do not know much about history. He does not want to show things that are not real or that guess what the past was like. He believes people deserve the truth.

Visitors will see explanations and pictures to help them understand the objects. There are also computers in the museum to provide more information. The museum has many different rooms with pale walls and deep display cases. Light comes in from special windows, making it bright and pleasant to look at the items.

There is a special area for children called the Discovery Centre. A group of kids helped create this space. They wanted to ride through the displays, but instead, they got a hands-on area for children to explore.

On the top floor, there is a gallery that changes every three years. It shows objects chosen by Scottish people that have been important in the 20th century. Some items include an electric guitar and favorite toys. This idea is fun, but it may not be serious enough for some visitors.

Dr. Clarke believes that objects can tell stories about the past better than anything else. The museum's modern design is impressive from the inside, but some people wonder if it is in the right place."

**The Future of Newspapers**  
Peter Preston

Change is a nice word. It can make us feel calm. But change can also scare some people. Transition means moving from one place to another. For newspapers, this change to the online world is not easy. Many people think it will happen, but it is not clear how.

Print newspaper sales are going down. More people are visiting newspaper websites. For example, The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian have seen their print sales drop by 8% to 10% each year. But their websites are getting more visitors. This is true for many newspapers, but it depends on different factors like time and place.

A recent survey showed that worldwide newspaper sales actually went up by 1.1% last year. In the West, sales went down, but in Asia, they increased. Some magazines also did well, with a 5.4% rise in sales. 

E-books are becoming very popular, and sales are increasing a lot. However, when bookstores looked at the sales of physical books, they found that sales were only down by 0.4%. This means people are buying both e-books and physical books.

Many people think young people do not read newspapers anymore, but this is not true. The latest survey shows that nearly 5 million people aged 15 to 35 still read national newspapers. Different countries have different trends. In Britain, print sales have dropped by 10.8%, but in Germany, the drop is only 7%. France has seen a smaller drop of 3.1%.

In the past, experts thought that online advertising would help newspapers succeed. But now, online ads are going down. Many US newspapers have started charging for online access. The best way to get readers is to offer both print and online access together. Print newspapers help sell online subscriptions, and they make much more money from ads than online ads.

However, it is hard for newspapers to keep both print and online versions. It is expensive and complicated. But print newspapers still have a strong presence, and it is harder for them to be noticed online."
CAE_32,"**Text: Photographing People**

People are very interesting to photograph. A photo with a person is usually more exciting than one without. However, taking good photos of people can be hard. The photographer must pay attention to actions, gestures, and expressions. Sometimes, just having a camera can change how people act.

A. **Grouping People**  
When taking pictures of groups, avoid straight lines. Ask people to stand at different angles and distances. You can have some people sitting or kneeling in front so you can see all their faces.

B. **Posing for Pictures**  
People often feel stiff in front of a camera. Help them relax by suggesting comfortable positions, like folding their hands or putting them in their pockets.

C. **The Right Approach**  
Do not pretend you are not taking a picture when it is clear you are. This can make people feel tense. Most people will agree to have their picture taken, but they might feel shy. You may need to guide them to look at the camera.

D. **Eye Contact**  
A photo looks better if the person is looking at the camera. Ask them to look into the lens. They might not be able to do this for long, so remind them just before you take the picture. You can also say something funny to get a real reaction.

E. **Candid Concentration**  
Instead of looking directly at the camera, the person can focus on something else in the picture. This can make the photo feel more natural, as if you are watching them without them knowing.

F. **Expressions and Gestures**  
Expressions and gestures tell us a lot about a person. A laughing child can make us smile, while a sad face can make us feel sad. Look for common expressions like smiles, frowns, or thumbs-up.

G. **Situation Interest**  
The background of a photo can add interest. Make sure the background does not distract from the person. Use a wide-angle lens to make the person look larger compared to the background.

H. **Interaction**  
Good photos often show people interacting, like talking or laughing together. Look for moments of connection, like eye contact or a handshake.

I. **People and Places**  
Many photos of people are taken on trips. To show both the person and the place, step back to include the background. Ask people to stand close to the camera, but make sure the background is still visible.

J. **To Pose or Not to Pose?**  
Decide why you want to take the picture. If you want a clear photo of someone you met on holiday, ask them to pose. For family photos, candid shots of events can be more lively and memorable than formal poses. A spontaneous picture can bring back memories better than a posed one."
CAE_65,"**Text: Under Sarah's Spell**

Sarah Janson is an artist who creates trompe-l'oeil paintings. These paintings trick the eye and look very real. In this interview with Joanna Watt, Sarah talks about her work.

Not many artists do not sign their work unless someone asks them to. Sarah Janson is one of these artists. She does not think the artist is important; she believes the work is what matters. She says, ""It's not the artist who is important, but the work."" Sarah is very humble and almost makes you think her paintings paint themselves. This makes the interview a bit difficult at first. She says, ""I just don't like to shout about myself,"" and she looks scared when asked if she can be photographed.

After a while, Sarah feels more comfortable, and the interview becomes fun and interesting. She has been a trompe-l'oeil artist for sixteen years. Before that, she studied drawing at art school for two years and worked in graphic illustration. She did not enjoy illustration, so she started working with a decorator named Jim Smart. He asked her to create one trompe-l'oeil painting, and she loved it. She decided to work on her own, not knowing exactly what would happen, but she felt it was the right choice.

Sarah's skills in observing details helped her become a good trompe-l'oeil artist. She says, ""People often ask me where they can learn trompe-l'oeil. But no one can teach you. Trompe-l'oeil is the school of life. It's all about observation."" She believes that you should always keep learning. She is honest about her weaknesses, saying, ""I can't paint bread; it always looks like grey concrete."" She also admits she struggles with math, especially when she had to measure for a big project at Lulworth Castle.

Sarah often talks about herself in the third person. She says, ""When I finished that ceiling, I thought, 'Well, I didn't do it, she did.'"" Her trompe-l'oeil paintings are very special and different from others. She has many important projects for businesses and private clients. Much of her work is inspired by buildings. For example, she created a trompe-l'oeil dining room based on a Venetian palace and a painting that makes a hallway look like it leads to two more rooms.

However, trompe-l'oeil can be tricky. Once people understand the trick, they might lose interest. Sarah knows this and says, ""Trompe-l'oeil has to do two things. First, it must draw you in; it's got to trick you. Secondly, it has to hold you and then engage your imagination."" She believes that trompe-l'oeil should also be personal for the client. She enjoys working with clients because that is where the best ideas come from. Some clients know exactly what they want, while others do not. She listens to them and tries to understand their ideas.

Many of her clients become friends because she spends a lot of time with them while working. Sarah is thankful for her clients, saying, ""I am very grateful for the mad ones who have let me loose on their walls."" They are happy with her work, which is why she is always busy. Even though she does not like to talk about her talent, she says, ""I really don't like to shout about myself."" She believes that both her work and herself should be calm and not too loud. 

In conclusion, you could never really get bored with Sarah or her art. Her work deserves to be more well-known, and I am happy to share it with others."
CAE_61,"**Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success**

Daniel Goleman talks about the 'people skills' that are important for success in our jobs.

A. The rules for work are changing. We are not only judged by how smart we are or by our training, but also by how well we manage ourselves and work with others. This new way of judging is used to decide who gets hired and who does not. It helps to show who will be a great worker and who may not do as well. These new rules are important for our future jobs. They are different from what we learned in school. Doing well in tests is not as important anymore. Now, it is more about social skills and personal qualities, like being proactive, understanding others, being flexible, and convincing people. These skills are called emotional intelligence.

B. In a time when job security is low, personal qualities are becoming more important at work. For many years, people have talked about these qualities using different names, like 'character' and 'soft skills'. Now, we have a better understanding of these skills, which we call 'emotional intelligence'. This means being able to understand and manage our own feelings and the feelings of others. In our work, it includes being aware of ourselves, controlling our emotions, being motivated, understanding others, and having good social skills. Some people think emotional intelligence just means 'being nice', but it can also mean being honest, even when it is uncomfortable. It is not about showing all our feelings, but about managing them so we can work well together.

C. More businesses are realizing that emotional intelligence is very important for good management. The more complicated the job, the more emotional intelligence matters. If someone lacks these skills, it can make it hard to use their knowledge and skills. Many people have succeeded despite having low emotional intelligence, but as work becomes more complex and requires teamwork, companies that work well together have an advantage. In today’s workplace, where teamwork and good customer service are important, emotional intelligence is essential for success in every job.

D. Unlike IQ, which does not change much, emotional intelligence can grow as we learn from our experiences. Studies show that most people get better at managing their emotions, motivating themselves, and understanding others over time. This growth in emotional intelligence is called maturity. We can learn these skills and use them to help us in our jobs, especially now when job stability is uncertain. Emotional intelligence is not a magic solution for companies, but if we ignore the human side of work, nothing else will work as well."
CAE_52,"Text: 'Should the media make money from content they do not own? Digital cameras and camera phones have made it easier to take pictures of news events. Social media has changed how people share these photos. Now, some journalists look at social networks for images when news happens quickly. However, some reporters have used photos from users without asking for permission. There are rules that say images on social media can be used without permission in special cases or if there is strong public interest, but people still argue about whether this is right. Research shows that about one in ten people would take photos or videos of a news event, which means user-generated content (UGC) is important for the future of the media.

**Ancient Chinese Medicine in the West?**  
Acupuncture is a treatment that is over two thousand years old. It comes from traditional Chinese medicine, which also includes herbs, massage, diet, and exercise. Acupuncture is used to help with many health problems, but doctors in the West mostly use it for pain relief. Some general doctors, midwives, and physiotherapists use it often to help with pain.

**A. What is it about?**  
Traditional Chinese medicine believes that health is when the mind, body, and spirit are in balance. They say that energy, called Qi (pronounced ""chee""), flows in the body along paths called meridians. There are twelve main meridians, each connected to an organ, and many small meridians that carry Qi to every cell. If the flow of Qi is blocked or weak, a person may feel weak or sick. When you visit an acupuncturist, they will check where the Qi is not balanced. They do this by feeling your pulse, looking at your tongue, and asking about your health, feelings, and habits. An acupuncturist uses very thin needles that go into the skin. They may also use warmth from burning herbs or pressure on certain points to help the flow of Qi.

**B. Over three hundred points**  
The points used in acupuncture are connected to the meridians and may not be close to where you feel pain. People often feel a mild ache or tingling when the needle is moved gently. This can be done by hand or with a machine. Acupuncturists say this feeling means the needle has reached the Qi. There are over three hundred points on the main meridians, and many more that are used less often.

**C. Science explains it**  
Even though not all doctors believe in traditional Chinese medicine, many accept that acupuncture can help with pain. They have found scientific reasons for how it works. For example:  
- It may block pain signals from reaching the brain.  
- It might release natural pain-relieving chemicals in the body.

**D. What type of pain can be treated?**  
Many people with long-term pain try acupuncture when other treatments do not work. Common pains treated with acupuncture include back pain, sports injuries, arthritis, headaches, and pain after surgery. Acupuncturists also say they can help with menstrual pain, facial nerve pain, and pain in terminally ill patients.

**E. Modern use for an ancient treatment**  
Acupuncture has been used in China for over 2,000 years, but using it instead of anesthesia during surgery started in the 1950s. This helped some doctors outside China believe in acupuncture. In China today, acupuncture is used in many surgeries, from tonsil removal to heart surgery. Needles can be used alone, with electrical stimulation, or with medicine. Some people say it helps reduce pain, but it can be different for each person. Many people might not like the idea of being awake during surgery, but acupuncturists say it has fewer side effects than regular anesthesia, and recovery is faster.

**F. Always effective?**  
Like many alternative therapies, it is hard to test acupuncture in studies. But studies show that 50 to 80 percent of people find acupuncture helps with chronic pain. Acupuncturists say they have a similar success rate. They know it does not work for everyone. For long-term pain, it usually takes six to seven visits to feel real relief, but some people may feel better after just two or three visits.

**G. A different approach to pain**  
Western and Chinese medicine see pain differently. An acupuncturist looks at the whole person, not just the pain. They spend time finding out what is wrong and what might be causing the pain. They ask questions about how the pain feels and if it gets worse in different weather. These details help them decide how to treat the pain. Most regular doctors do not consider these things.

**H. Traditional or not?**  
Some doctors have training in traditional acupuncture, while others, including many general doctors, prefer scientific explanations. Many traditional acupuncturists believe that using traditional Chinese medicine is the best way to help people heal deeply. It can be hard to measure this in studies. It is important to choose a good acupuncturist, who should send you to a doctor if needed."

P.D. James is a famous crime writer. Her full name is Phyllis Dorothy James. She seems calm and confident, but she is actually shy. She says that Adam Dalgliesh, the detective in her books, is like her if she were a man. Dalgliesh likes to solve crimes alone, just like P.D. James likes to write alone. She needs privacy to write and can do it anywhere as long as she is alone.

P.D. James does not agree that she is the best crime writer in Britain, even though many people read her 12 detective novels. She loves the books of her friend Ruth Rendell, especially those written under the name Barbara Vine. She also enjoys books by women writers like Iris Murdoch and Anita Brookner, but she likes some male authors too, like Graham Greene.

P.D. James became successful later in life. She was 42 when her first book, Cover Her Face, was published. She was born in Oxford and grew up in Cambridge. She met her husband there, who was a student. Life was not easy for her. Her husband, Connor, was very sick after the Second World War. She had to work long hours to take care of him and their two daughters, Clare and Jane. Her husband’s parents helped take care of the girls during this time.

While working for the National Health Service, she used her strong organizational skills. She worked in different jobs, including one at the Home Office. There, she worked with forensic science and got used to seeing dead bodies. However, she was not interested in death itself. She liked the challenge of writing crime stories. She always wanted to be a writer.

P.D. James did not want to write about her own sad experiences. She thought writing detective stories was a good way to learn how to write serious novels. She realized that she could write a good story about people while following the rules of a detective story. She believes that solving a crime brings order to chaos and shows that life is important, even if it is not perfect."

The pen is stronger than the psychoanalyst. The study of handwriting to show a person's character is becoming more popular. If you apply for a job in some countries, you will likely be asked to give a sample of your handwriting. This handwriting can help decide if you are right for the job. Handwriting analysis, or graphology, is seen as a real science in many places. Researchers say it can help show some illnesses, like heart disease and cancer, and can show emotional problems.

More companies are using handwriting analysis to help with job interviews. Many big companies now hire graphologists to look at the handwriting of people who want important jobs. But many doctors and psychiatrists are not sure if graphology is useful. Patricia Marne, a professional graphologist for over 20 years, thinks they should take it seriously. She believes handwriting can show psychological traits and some medical conditions. She says, ""Handwriting can show social class and intelligence. It can also help decide if a person should focus on arts or sciences and if they are honest or tricky.""

According to Ms. Marne, graphology can help find possible criminal behavior. She says, ""Criminals often have bad handwriting. Many come from difficult backgrounds and have emotional problems. This can show in childish handwriting and in writing letters many times."" She believes she can tell if people are honest or not. 

Ms. Marne says handwriting can also show if someone is under a lot of stress or has violent thoughts. It can even help predict if someone might think about suicide. Heart and lung problems can also be seen in handwriting. She explains, ""You cannot make a diagnosis from one sample unless the writing is very shaky. But if the handwriting changes over time, it could mean something serious is happening.""

A big emotional problem can change a person's signature for a short time. Ms. Marne says handwriting can show other psychological traits. For example, people who write with letters that connect are often clever and tricky. Those who write mostly in capital letters may be hiding their true selves. Light pressure in writing shows sensitivity. Original handwriting shows confidence and creativity. Disconnected writing shows a person who is a loner. Very small signatures can mean a person feels shy or inferior. Circles over the letter ""i"" show a need for attention, and crossing the ""t"" heavily can mean a person is intolerant.

Ms. Marne says it takes six years of study to analyze handwriting well, along with empathy and intuition. She believes more research is needed to make graphology a real science. She thinks this will happen soon. ""It is more accurate than psychoanalysis because you can see a person's history and emotional problems without asking them questions,"" she says. 

However, there is not much strong evidence to support these ideas. Some psychiatrists are critical of them. They say handwriting is just a result of education and the way writing is taught, and it does not have any other meaning."

Is your office working well? Fresh air and good chairs are important for a happy and healthy workplace, according to a new survey. We visited four different offices to see how healthy and happy they are. We had three experts with us: a building health consultant, an ergonomist who studies working conditions, and an occupational psychologist. Here are their opinions.

**Office A: Advertising Agency**  
*Building Health Consultant:* This office is very simple. It has no central heating and no mechanical ventilation. The windows open to the street. It is surprising that this office works well, but the small team of seven people seems happy. They change the office temperature by opening doors or using electric heaters, just like at home. This may be the reason they are happy.  

*Ergonomist:* The furniture does not match. Some chairs are old and broken, and they do not help good posture. However, the workers have different tasks, like meeting clients and making presentations. This variety helps them avoid tiredness and boredom.  

*Occupational Psychologist:* The staff enjoy their different tasks and the size of the office. It is small enough to know what others are doing but big enough to work alone. The office looks nice and is fun, showing both efficiency and creativity.

**Office B: News Service**  
*Building Health Consultant:* This office is not very exciting, but it is comfortable. The air quality is good, and there is a No Smoking policy.  

*Ergonomist:* The company has good chairs and lighting. The space is okay, but the layout could be better. The office feels impersonal with plain grey walls.  

*Occupational Psychologist:* The walls are mostly bare, except for some planners and a poster. Most staff have worked there for over five years, and they have good relationships. The office could be better if desks were arranged to share information easily.

**Office C: Bank**  
*Building Health Consultant:* This office gets mixed feelings from workers. It feels like being in a glass box. The air is not stale, even with smokers nearby.  

*Ergonomist:* The office is very standard and not inspiring. The desks are okay, but some chairs are not good for computer work.  

*Occupational Psychologist:* The staff support each other and use technology well. There are many awards on display. The office is busy, but the colors make it feel a bit dull.

**Office D: Newspaper**  
*Building Health Consultant:* This office has many problems. The air conditioning does not work well, and the space is messy. There is a lot of dust everywhere.  

*Ergonomist:* The furniture is not suitable for a modern office. Many chairs are old and do not help workers who are shorter.  

*Occupational Psychologist:* The office has old chairs and dirty carpets. It needs cleaning and better air conditioning. There were not many conversations when we visited; everyone seemed stressed. The company should encourage teamwork."
CAE_38,"**Chewing Gum Culture**

Chewing gum is popular in America, where people chew 12 million sticks every day. It is a simple food with less than ten calories per stick. Chewing gum must follow rules from the American Food and Drug Administration.

Today, most gum is made from synthetic materials. It has added ingredients to keep the flavor and make it soft. But this was not always true. Long ago, the ancient Greeks chewed a gum-like substance from the mastic tree, which grows in Greece and Turkey. Women in Greece used mastic gum to clean their teeth and freshen their breath.

American colonists learned to chew gum from the Native Americans in New England. They chewed resin from spruce trees. In the early 1800s, people sold spruce gum in the eastern United States. This was the first commercial chewing gum in the country.

Modern chewing gum started in the late 1860s when people discovered chicle. Chicle is a milky substance from the sapodilla tree in Central America. Gum made from chicle was smoother and more enjoyable to chew, leading to a big industry. However, it is hard to grow sapodilla trees, so many gum makers now use synthetic materials.

Today, the few people who collect chicle, called chicleros, have a tough life. They walk for miles in very humid conditions to find sapodilla trees. There are dangerous snakes and many insects, including a fly that lays eggs in their ears and noses. Chicleros climb trees to collect the sap, which they carry back to a camp. There, they boil the sap until it becomes sticky and forms bricks.

Life at the camp is not easy. Chicleros eat a simple diet of maize and drink local alcohol made from sugar cane. Even though their work is hard, chicleros worry about losing their jobs. Not long ago, the United States imported 7,000 tonnes of chicle each year from Central America. Last year, only 200 tonnes were collected in Mexico's Yucatan peninsula.

As chewing gum sales have increased, manufacturers have turned to synthetic materials to save money. Gum makers are also finding new ways to sell their products. They say that chewing gum can help you relax, give you energy, and reduce stress. During the world wars, soldiers were often given gum. One of the biggest claims is that chewing gum helps reduce tooth decay.

When we eat, plaque acid forms, which can harm our teeth. Our saliva helps protect our teeth by neutralizing the acid and providing minerals. Gum makers say that chewing for 20 minutes can increase saliva flow. Research is ongoing to create new textures and flavors. Today, glycerine and other vegetable oils are used to make gum. Most new flavors are artificial, but some still use natural ingredients. In America, a large area is used to grow mint for the two most popular chewing gums in the world."

A. **INDIA - GHANERAO HOTEL, RAJASTHAN**  
Ghanerao Hotel is in a small village near the Aravalli Hills. The village is known for its craftsmen. The hotel combines English country-house calm with Indian culture. The Ghanerao family has lived here for 400 years. Now, Sajjan Singh and his wife welcome guests to their home. The hotel has basic facilities, like hot water from a bucket, but this makes it special.

B. **NEW ZEALAND - HERMITAGE HOTEL, MOUNT COOK**  
One of my favorite hotels is the Hermitage Hotel on New Zealand's South Island. I found it by chance while climbing. After climbing a glacier, we walked down and found the hotel in a beautiful, wild area. It was a surprise to find such luxury after a long climb, with a man playing music on the piano.

C. **MAURITIUS - PARADIS HOTEL**  
The Paradis Hotel is on a quiet peninsula in the south-west of Mauritius. The road to the hotel goes along the coast, past empty beaches. The hotel is big and offers many free water sports, but you can find peace on the nine kilometers of private beach. If you swim a little way out into the ocean, you can hardly see the hotel. In the evening, when everyone has left, you can relax on the beach and feel far away from everything.

D. **ST LUCIA - LADERA HOTEL**  
The Ladera Hotel in St Lucia has a stunning view. It is quiet and high up, with open rooms looking out at the Caribbean Sea between two mountains called the Pitons. The hotel has a colonial style, with wooden furniture and four-poster beds.

E. **TURKEY - THE SPLENDID HOTEL, ISTANBUL**  
The Splendid Hotel is on Buyukada in the Princes Islands, a great place to escape the noise of Istanbul. The islands are just an hour by boat and have no cars, only horse-drawn carriages. The hotel is made of wood, painted white with red domes. It is a little old but still charming.

Sue Brown is a hotel inspector. She checks hotels for her job. Christopher Middleton watched her work. One minute into her inspection of the Globe Hotel, things are already going wrong. The receptionist is talking on the phone and does not notice Sue and Christopher. Sue whispers, ""She hasn't even seen us. This is very poor service."" This is a common mistake that Sue has seen many times in her 11 years as an inspector. 

Sue says, ""This hotel is not just any three-star hotel. It has three red stars, so I expect better."" Having red stars means the Globe Hotel is one of the best hotels in the guide that Sue works for. But even before they get a warm welcome, things feel cold. The entrance from the parking lot is through a door with a buzzer, and the hallway is long and empty. Sue says, ""This is not what I expected.""

Things get worse when the receptionist says, ""We have no record of your booking."" There are 15 rooms in the hotel, but only three are occupied. One room is on the top floor, but Sue does not like it. It is stuffy, and there is a big hole in the wall behind the wardrobe. 

When Sue started her job, people called her ""The Woman in Black,"" even though she never wore black. The next morning, after paying her bill, she tells the hotel manager, Robin Greaves, who looks scared. He quickly apologizes for a bad smell in the lounge. He says, ""We think there is a blocked drain."" Sue suggests that he should not let guests go into that room. She says, ""It is better to take them to the other lounge."" 

Greaves listens and takes notes. He has only worked at the Globe for five months, and he is trying to understand Sue's advice. Not everything is bad. Sue praises Emma, the assistant manager, and Trudy, the young waitress, for their good work. The dinner was also good enough to keep the hotel’s two-rosette food rating. Greaves asks, ""What do we need to do to get three rosettes?"" Sue replies, ""Do not serve a dessert that falls apart."" 

Sue's job is to tell the hotel what is wrong, even if it is hard to say. She remembers a time when a woman complained that Sue got her son fired. Sue explained that the son served her apple pie with his fingers. Sometimes, people write angry letters to her. Sue says, ""You get used to it, but it still hurts."" 

Sue must tell the hotel what she finds in person and also write a report. The hotels pay for her help. Even though it is a tough job, it is worth it to help hotels improve. Greaves is happy to hear that Sue will not recommend taking away the Globe's red stars. The bad news is that another inspector will come back in two months to check if the problems are fixed. Greaves smiles but looks worried and says, ""We will look forward to that.""

Doug Scott is a mountaineer who writes about climbing the highest mountains on each continent, called the Seven Summits. He started his journey to climb these mountains later in life. Here is his story about each mountain.

A. **Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)**  
Doug and his climbing partner, Dougal Haston, were in a snow cave below the top of Mt. Everest. They talked about sleeping bags, which Doug thought was strange because they were alone. He started talking to his feet because they were cold. Doug remembered other climbers who lost fingers and toes to frostbite. They were not just worried about surviving but also about how well they would survive. Doug felt calm and confident with Dougal. He found a good rhythm and continued climbing to the summit.

B. **Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)**  
This mountain is very dangerous. In April 1976, Doug and Dougal arrived at the Kahiltna Glacier and spent four days carrying equipment and food. They realized how hard their climb would be. They followed a route from 1967 but then chose a new route to the summit. They carried everything on their backs. After three days, Doug's sleeping bag was wet. They camped on a windy ridge and felt tired. Because of the low air pressure, it felt like they were higher than they were. Finally, they reached the summit and felt happy.

C. **Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m)**  
In September 1976, Doug and his friend Paul Braithwaite flew to Nairobi to climb Mt. Kenya. Instead, they got a free ride to Kilimanjaro. They got lost in the jungle and had trouble finding water. On the second day, they found arrows on trees that led them to a rock pool. They tried to climb a steep wall but decided to take a safer route to the top.

D. **Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)**  
In January 1992, Doug and his wife, Sharu, arrived at Punta del Inca. They met a guide named Phil who invited them to climb Aconcagua with his group. After waiting for bad weather to pass, they started climbing. The Polish Glacier was icy and windy. They decided to take a different route to avoid the glacier. They walked with many other climbers to the summit. They camped outside a refuge and met a group planning to climb the Seven Summits. This made Doug think about doing the same.

E. **Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)**  
Doug learned that climbing Vinson Massif was possible if he guided enough people to pay for the trip. In November 1992, his team left Britain for the South Pole. The sun was always shining, and it was very quiet. On December 7, they started climbing to the summit. Despite strong winds and very cold temperatures, they all reached the top in 8 hours. However, they could not see much because of a storm.

F. **Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)**  
In the summer of 1994, Doug's team met in St. Petersburg. They went to Terskol, where they had to pay a fee to their guide. After a few days of getting used to the altitude, they took a cable car to 3,900m and then walked to a refuge at 4,200m. Two days later, they faced strong winds while climbing. They thought they reached the summit but found there was more to climb. They returned to the refuge and then went down the volcano.

G. **Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)**  
On their trip to Carstensz, Doug and his team wanted to find a new route and spend time with the local Dani people. They were warned about possible danger from bandits but decided to continue. On May 12, they climbed and the weather got better. Two team members went ahead while Doug and Sham took their time. They reached the summit by 11 am, and Doug received a standing ovation for completing his seventh summit. Mission accomplished!

The Merrion Hotel is a new five-star hotel in Dublin. It took almost two years to change four old houses into this hotel. The hotel has the latest technology to help both the staff and the guests.

Peter MacCann is the General Manager. He wants his staff to know the guests' names. For more details about what guests like, he uses the hotel’s computer system. This system helps the hotel give special service to returning guests. It cost £250,000 to set up, but MacCann believes it will be worth it over time. He likes how well it works and the services it provides. For example, if a guest asks for certain music CDs during their first stay, those CDs will be ready for them when they come back.

Many hotel guests often complain about room temperature. The hotel has a system that lets guests change the temperature in their rooms. They can adjust it by three degrees around the normal 18°C. The front desk can also change the temperature in any room between 14°C and 25°C.

The hotel has many features for business guests. MacCann thinks that about 65% of the guests will be business travelers. To help them, the hotel has put a business center in each room. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that can also copy and print, and a video-conferencing system.

Technology changes quickly, so the hotel has prepared for future improvements. They have added extra cables for new technology. The televisions are rented, so they can be replaced with newer models when needed. DVD recorders can also be updated.

Even with all this technology, MacCann wants guests to feel comfortable. The hotel has 145 large and well-furnished bedrooms that are cozy and welcoming. There is also a swimming pool, a gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a beautiful garden.

The food at the hotel is very important. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, who has two Michelin stars, has moved his restaurant to the Merrion. He has designed a new kitchen and improved the restaurant. The hotel benefits from having a great place to eat without financial risks. With good technology and a skilled staff, the Merrion Hotel is likely to be very successful."

Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. The big garden around her house gives her many ideas for her art. It is full of her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wildly and spread all over the garden. The two long flower beds along the path in the garden have many colors and shapes. This is because the previous owners loved gardening and left plants that Susan likes. She also kept the gardener, Danny. 

""In fact, it was really his garden,"" she says. ""We got along very well. At first, he would say, 'Oh, it's not worth it' about some things I wanted to add. But when I said I wanted to paint them, he understood what I meant."" 

Susan likes to paint detailed pictures of single plants instead of the whole garden. Sometimes, she paints a group of plants together. Usually, she picks the flowers and takes them to her studio. ""I don't set everything up at once,"" she says. ""I take one flower out and paint it, which might take a few days. Then I bring in another one and add to the painting. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.""

Her busiest time is spring and early summer when the tulips bloom, followed by the poppies. ""They all come out together, and you're so busy,"" she says. But she also finds beauty in how flowers change as they wilt. For example, with tulips, ""you bring them in and put them in water. After a day, they change shape. They open up and look amazing. At first, you think they are boring, but they change all the time.""

Susan has always loved plants. ""I studied botany in school and collected wildflowers from the countryside,"" she says. ""I didn't like garden flowers then; I thought they looked fake, like silk or plastic flowers. I liked wildflowers because they grew in tough places, like cracks in rocks.""

Today, her garden has many plants from faraway places, but they grow well in her garden. She has a relaxed attitude about the garden, like a kind aunt who lets children play as long as they don’t break anything. 

With two art shows coming up and many flowers to paint, she has found it hard to work in the garden lately. She now has an extra gardener, but she knows that to stay connected to her art, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""

Many trees in the Brackham area fell down in the strong storms that March. The town lost two big lime trees from the old market square. The loss of these trees changed how the town center looked, and this upset some of the older residents. 

One of these residents was Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, the head of the local police. But during the storm, when the wind knocked down the walnut tree in his garden, he was too sick to notice. Pelham was a big and healthy man, but he was very ill with bronchitis for the first time in his life. When he first felt pain in his head and tightness in his chest, his wife, Molly, wanted him to see a doctor. He thought the police needed him too much, so he ignored her and tried to keep working. This made him forget things and made him angry. 

Finally, his colleague, Sergeant Lloyd, took him to the doctor. By then, he was too weak to argue. Soon, he got his medicine and went home to his wife, who sent him straight to bed. On Thursday morning, Molly told him that the walnut tree had fallen during the night. Pelham could not believe it. On Thursday evening, he asked if the house was damaged. He was happy to hear it was not and pulled the sheets over his head.

On Saturday, when the medicine started to work and he felt better, he realized that the loss of the walnut tree changed how the living room looked. The Pelhams' big house had a large garden. Pelham was happy he bought it because the garden felt private. But now, the storm changed everything. 

Before, the living room had the beautiful walnut tree outside. The tree let in light but also hid the old furniture that the family brought from their last house. Now, without the tree, the room was too bright, and the old furniture looked bad. The view from the window was not nice either. The tall house next door, which was hidden by the tree, was now visible. It had ugly purple bricks and many windows that seemed to watch the Pelhams.

“Doesn’t it look terrible?” Pelham said to his wife. But Molly, standing in the doorway, sounded happy. “That’s what I’ve been saying since we moved here. We need to buy a new sofa, no matter the cost.”"
FCE_16,"**Text: Living in the Valley**

We had lived in our valley for sixteen months when we first saw the dangers in the hills around us. It was the year when the storms came early, before winter started. Until then, we felt safe in our valley below the hills. Soon, snow began to fall. In one day, it was about 15 centimeters deep. It almost blocked our road and made the path by the stream slippery and dangerous. 

In the hills, the snow was much deeper and stayed longer. The wind was very strong up there. In our valley, we felt only some strong gusts of wind; the trees moved, but their branches stayed strong. Still, we knew we had to worry. The snow and wind were annoying, but they did not really scare us. The river, the Ryburn, which usually flowed gently, was what worried us the most. It reminded us of what could happen if the water from the hills was not controlled by dams.

Soon, the snow started to melt. Day by day, we saw dark clouds gather over the hills. These clouds looked dangerous and warned us of what was coming. We watched the river, which was getting fuller and wilder. The snow melted as more rain fell from the clouds, but the reservoir in the hills was filling up and getting close to overflowing.

Then it happened - for the first time in years, the reservoir overflowed. It was like a small Niagara Falls, as the water rushed over the dam and into the stream below. The river looked wild as the water rushed down. Just a few meters from our cottage, the stream was deeper than we had ever seen, moving quickly and dangerously.

For three days, we hoped the river would stay below its banks. Luckily, the dam held, and the water began to go down. In the past, before the dam was built, the river had flooded nearby villages many times. Now, the dam controls the river, and usually, everything is fine. The water from the hills, from snow and heavy rain, stays behind the dam, with only a little overflow sometimes.

Thanks to this dam, we can enjoy the big clouds over the valley and feel safe in our home."

Film critic Mark Adams talks about his ten years of work as a film critic for a newspaper called The Front Page. Writing articles about films for The Front Page was his first real job. Before that, he wrote reviews for novels in other newspapers, films for a magazine, and did some work for the radio. This is how he met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page. Tom had also worked in radio and television. He hired Mark, but Tom was not mainly a journalist, so he was not very careful when choosing his team.

At first, Tom wanted a team of critics to cover different art forms like books, TV, theatre, film, and radio. They would have a weekly lunch to choose what to write about, and there would be guests to make it fun. Mark felt like it was a dream to be part of a new newspaper. He thought it was strange that a new paper could start in a busy market. He even thought a rich person was helping him and pretending to hire him. The first time he saw someone reading the newspaper on the London Underground with his review, he felt very shy.

Tom's idea for a team of critics did not work out. They did not meet as planned, so they talked by phone instead. It turned out that people liked to have one reviewer for each subject, so Mark chose to focus on films. Without Tom's help, they would not have the current way of working, where Mark writes a long piece each week about one film. He likes this way of working. He did not want to do the usual film critic job, which means watching every new film. That would make him bored quickly. He did not want to sit in a screening room thinking, ""What bad film do I have to watch now?""

The time he has to write lets him explain his thoughts better, or sometimes he has to make something interesting out of a boring week. But what is his role for the public? He thinks people choose films based on stars, ads, or the director. Some people are loyal to certain types of films. It is rare for someone who does not like westerns to buy a ticket for one after reading a review, or for a romantic film lover to avoid a love story because of a review.

So, if a film review is not a guide for consumers, what is it? Mark does not feel he has to be ""right"" about a movie. He does not think there should be a set number of ""great"" or ""bad"" films each year. His job is to present his opinion. He does not want to be a judge."

Why would a schoolgirl want to swim 1500 meters, cycle 40 kilometers, and then run 10 kilometers? Because ""it's fun."" 

Melanie Sears is a teenager who loves sports. She is looking for a training partner for triathlons, especially a girl. She wants someone who enjoys running long distances (like 15 kilometers), swimming in cold water, and cycling long distances (like 100 kilometers). It is important to be able to do all three sports without taking a break.

Triathlons are becoming very popular in the Olympics. Many people watch athletes swim 1500 meters, cycle 40 kilometers, and then run 10 kilometers without stopping. It looks hard, but why do triathletes do it? Melanie is 17 years old and has good grades in school. She gives up a lot to do this sport. 

Melanie started her first triathlon when she was 14. ""I won the junior section, but I was the only junior there. It felt easy, and I waved at my friends while I was racing,"" she says. She felt confident and entered the National Championships. She swam fast and ran fast, but she did not win. ""I was following a man, and we got lost. I ended up cycling 20 kilometers too far. I cried while running,"" she remembers. But she did not give up. ""Sometimes I want to stop because it hurts, but I am afraid that if I stop once, I will want to stop again.""

Steve Trew, the coach, admires her determination. ""I tested her fitness, and she worked so hard that she fell into a wall. Most people stop when they are tired, but she keeps going."" This year, Melanie was the top junior in the European Triathlon Championships, finishing 13th. ""I was almost as good as the top three in swimming and running, but I need to get better at cycling,"" she says.

Melanie is trying to convince her parents to buy a special bike for £2,000 for her trip to New Zealand for the World Championships. Her training takes a lot of time, and she does not have a social life. ""I don’t go to parties. After swimming for two hours on Friday nights, I just want to sleep. But I call and write to the other girls on my team."" What do they talk about? ""No, we talk about our times in races.""

Melanie has tried other events too. She has done a shorter triathlon where you swim 750 meters, cycle 20 kilometers, and run 5 kilometers. She wants to try even harder events. ""The problem is, I have no one my age to train with,"" she says. 

**Questions:**

1. Why does Melanie want a training partner?
2. What are the three sports in a triathlon?
3. How old was Melanie when she entered her first triathlon?
4. What happened when Melanie entered the National Championships?
5. What does Melanie want her parents to buy for her?"
FCE_70,"**Text: The Collectors**

Amanda Roy writes about collecting things and why many people enjoy this hobby. Many adults like to collect items. It is a world of passion and excitement. But if you want to collect something, remember: if you do not love it, do not collect it.

People have always liked to collect. Long ago, early humans collected pebbles and wore them as necklaces. They liked the shapes and colors of the pebbles. This was the first way people gathered objects for fun and meaning. Today, children still collect stones and seashells because they are beautiful.

I have been collecting all my life. I collect many things, like flowers, pottery, and paintings. My first collection was stones from my parents' garden. When I was six, I went to a school in a cold, windy place in England. When my parents visited, they took me to a local museum. The museum had many interesting objects collected by people in the past. I loved looking at these objects.

Many adults also enjoy collecting. Some people collect because it is the only part of their lives where they feel in control. For me, I just enjoy it. One famous collector was the Duc de Berry in France. He had a ""room of wonders"" with many strange and beautiful items. Another collector, Catherine the Great of Russia, had more than 4,000 paintings.

You do not need to be rich to start a collection. I have collected many different things, like tulip bulbs and china cups. I remember when I convinced another collector to give me a special tulip. I planted it and took care of it, but one year it disappeared - stolen by another collector.

I once collected 350 American rag dolls. I searched all over the USA for them. Sadly, my collection was lost when my house caught fire. The next morning, I saw the remains of my collection and my furniture. I was very sad.

I am interested in how collections change hands. A silver spoon that belonged to a king or a poet is valuable. As small objects become popular, their prices go up. For example, toys from the 1950s are now worth a lot, especially if you kept the original boxes. (I threw away the boxes and the toys!)"
FCE_3,"**Text: My Line of Work**

Four people talk about their jobs.

**Lisa - Exhibition Programmes Organiser, Science Museum**  
I put together temporary exhibitions. This means I plan and design the exhibition and promote it. I read about the subject of the exhibition and talk to important people to find out the main ideas and goals. I decide what objects and pictures should be shown. I make sure the public can understand the exhibition by planning interactive displays, workshops, and theatre. I also work with engineers and electricians to keep the display safe for visitors. Before the exhibition opens, I help design and write brochures and leaflets to tell people about it.

**Janet - Teacher of London Taxi Drivers**  
When I arrive at 7:30 a.m., I check the accounts. Then, I see what new maps and documents we need for the London taxi-driver test. By midday, about 50 students are in school, learning how to make the journeys. They find the best routes, using the right one-way streets and turns. I help when there is a disagreement, like whether to turn right at a junction. When they are close to the test, I give them a simple route. I tell them they must use a different route if the road is closed. This helps them think.

**Sarah - Marine Conservationist**  
I live by the coast and work from home. I answer phone calls, create educational materials, and set up training courses. Sometimes, I go to our main office, but I usually work on the coast. I work with schools and study centres and run courses for coastal managers. I take them out to sea in a boat to help them understand the life under the water. This often changes their views because it is very different from using a computer. I am lucky because conservation is my hobby, so I enjoy my job. The downside is that I work for a charity, so I always need to find more money and cannot do everything I want.

**Chris - Map and Atlas Publisher**  
My work is varied. I make sure our publishing program meets market needs and keep about 300 books in stock. We have high standards for information and content. We get many letters from readers about things like international boundaries, and I must respond carefully. I discuss future projects and current sales with co-publishers. I work with a great team, which makes the job enjoyable. The downside is that there is too much administration, which leaves less time for interesting tasks like product development and design."
FCE_10,"**Text: A Holiday in Ireland**

Every June, we go to Ireland. Since the four of us started going on holidays together, we have spent the first two weeks of June at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. It is a big house by the sea, not far from the village of Ardbeag. The Malseeds, an English couple, bought the house and made some changes, but they did it carefully.

Strafe found Glencorn for us. He saw an advertisement when the Malseeds were still looking for guests. ""How about this?"" he said one evening and read the details. Last summer, we went to a hotel that friends recommended, but it was not good because the food was terrible. The four of us have been playing cards together for a long time: Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia, and me. My name is Dorothy Milson, but they call me Milly. Dekko got his nickname at school. He and Strafe were classmates, which is why we call Strafe by his last name, like the teachers did. We are all about the same age and live close to where the Malseeds lived before moving to Ireland. We think it is a funny coincidence.

""How nice,"" Mrs. Malseed said, smiling to welcome us again this year. She seems to know when guests are coming because she is usually waiting in the big hall that smells of flowers. ""Arthur, take the luggage up,"" she told the old porter. She named our rooms after flowers: Rose, Tulip, Lily, and Geranium. Mrs. Malseed painted flowers on the doors instead of using numbers. In winter, when few people come to Glencorn Lodge, she takes care of small details like that; her husband takes care of repairs.

""Welcome!"" Mr. Malseed said as he came into the hall from the kitchen. He smiled widely, making us feel special, not just like any other guests. Everyone smiled, and I could feel that our holiday had really started. Nothing had changed at Glencorn; everything was good. Kitty from the dining room came out to greet us. ""You look younger every year!"" she said, making everyone laugh.

Arthur took us to our rooms, carrying as much luggage as he could and coming back for the rest. After dinner, we played cards for a while, but we did not play long because we were tired from the journey. In the lounge, there was a man alone and a French couple. There were other people at dinner because Glencorn Lodge is always full in June. From our table by the window, we could see some guests walking on the lawns and others going down the cliff path to the beach. 

In the morning, we would walk along the beach to Ardbeag and have coffee at the hotel there, then return for lunch. In the afternoon, we would drive somewhere. I knew this would happen because we had done the same things every year. Since we first came here, we have all fallen in love with the beautiful landscape."

Sarah Sutherland-Pilch is a chalet girl. She is 24 years old and comes from West Sussex, England. This is her second year working in Val d'Isere, France. She cooks and cleans for visitors who come to ski and stay in wooden houses called chalets.

Sarah studied French and History of Art at Oxford Brookes University. She says being a chalet girl is not a career, but a fun way to spend a year or two before starting a regular job. ""I meet successful people every week,"" she says.

Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to work. The chalet can sleep up to 18 guests. She has her own breakfast before making breakfast for the guests. They eat porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants. After breakfast, Sarah cleans up and either makes afternoon tea or cleans the rooms, which she thinks is the worst part of her job. By 11 a.m., she is ready to ski. ""On a good day, we can ski until 4:30 p.m.,"" she says.

After skiing, Sarah returns to the chalet to prepare dinner. Dinner is served at 8 p.m., and coffee is ready by 10 p.m. After dinner, she cleans the kitchen. ""I hate coming to a messy kitchen in the morning,"" she says. Sometimes she talks with the guests, but other times they want to be alone. ""Good guests can make a week great,"" she says.

Sarah lives in the chalet with her friends. They go out at about 11 p.m. They usually start at a place called Bananas and might go to G Jay's or Dick's T-Bar later. But on Saturday nights, she does not stay out too late because Sunday is her busiest day.

On Sunday, she starts work early. Breakfast for guests leaving has to be ready by 7 a.m. After the guests leave, Sarah cleans quickly. ""We clear the breakfast, strip the beds, and get everything ready,"" she says. If she did not shop for food on Saturday, she does it now. At around 3 p.m., after cleaning, she prepares tea for the new guests who arrive at about 4:30 p.m. Sometimes the new guests are confused and have many questions.

Between tea and dinner, Sarah helps guests who need boots or skis. She takes them to the ski shop and gets a lift back to the chalet. Soon, it is time for dinner again. Sometimes she has a drink after dinner, but if she is too tired, she goes to bed early."

Miss Rita Cohen was a small girl with pale skin. She looked much younger than Seymour's daughter, Marie, but she said she was six years older. One day, she came to Seymour's factory. She wore overalls and big shoes, and her curly hair framed her pretty face. She was so small and young that Seymour found it hard to believe she was studying at the University of Pennsylvania. She was doing research about the leather industry in New Jersey for her Master's degree.

A few times a year, someone would call or write to Seymour to ask if they could visit his factory. Sometimes, he would help students by answering their questions on the phone or giving them a short tour if they seemed serious. Rita was almost as small as the children from Marie's third-grade class. Years ago, Marie's father had shown those children how he made gloves. He showed them the laying-off table, where the men shaped and pressed each glove using hot brass hands. Marie thought the hot hands looked strange and called them ""pancake hands.""

Seymour heard Rita ask, ""How many pieces come in a shipment?"" He replied, ""Between twenty and twenty-five thousand."" She took notes and asked, ""Do they come directly to your shipping department?"" He liked that she was interested in every detail. He explained, ""They go to the tannery first. The tannery makes the leather for us. My grandfather and father worked in the tannery here in town. I worked there for six months when I started in the business. Have you ever been inside a tannery?"" 

""Not yet,"" Rita said. 

""Well, you should visit a tannery if you want to write about leather. I can help you set that up. It's a tough job, but the technology has improved. What you will see is not very different from what people saw hundreds of years ago. Tanning is one of the oldest industries. They found 6,000-year-old tools for tanning in Turkey. The first clothes were just animal skins that were tanned by smoking them. It’s an interesting subject. My father knows a lot about leather. If you talk to him about gloves, he could talk for two days. Glovemen love their work. Have you ever seen anything being made, Miss Cohen?""

""I can't say I have,"" she replied.

""Never seen anything made?"" he asked.

""I saw my mother make a cake when I was a child,"" she said.

He laughed. She made him laugh. She was eager to learn. His daughter was much taller than Rita, but Rita reminded him of Marie. She had the same good-natured intelligence that filled their home with joy when Marie came back from school. Marie remembered everything and wrote it down neatly in her notebook.

""I have an idea,"" he said. ""We will show you the whole process. Come on! We are going to make you a pair of gloves, and you will watch them being made from start to finish. What size do you wear?"""

**Is it a tough job?** Chris Arnot asks four people with dream jobs if they are as great as they seem.

**A. Raquel Graham**  
Raquel Graham calls from a taxi on her way to the airport. She cannot meet us tomorrow because her boss wants her in Los Angeles. As a personal assistant to a pop star, she has to travel a lot. Raquel loves her job and gets along well with her boss. But there is one small problem - she does not like flying. ""On a long trip to California, I usually take sleeping pills to help me relax,"" she says. Her worst experience was flying on Concorde. ""It felt so closed in with those tiny windows."" When she is not traveling, she works in offices in Manchester and London. She does some boring tasks like organizing schedules, attending meetings, and making travel plans. She did not apply for this job. She met the manager of a pop group by chance and got the job. She also took a secretarial course at night classes. Five years later, she became a personal assistant.

**B. David Brown**  
David Brown has worked as an accountant and a golf caddy, which means he carries a golfer's bags. He prefers being a caddy because he loves golf. However, there are some downsides. He earns a small flat fee and a part of the winnings. Most caddies earn between £25,000 and £35,000, but they spend a lot on travel and hotels. He started caddying for golfer Greg Norman when he was 31. ""You are not just carrying bags. You give advice and try to understand the course,"" he says. His skills in accounting were noticed, and now he works as a statistical data administrator. He collects and analyzes statistics from the games, which are important for TV commentators and golfers.

**C. Martin Fern**  
Martin Fern is the editor of the 'Food and Drink' section of a daily newspaper. One of his easier tasks is to try food in fancy restaurants. What does he think about expensive restaurants? ""If people can pay, it is their choice,"" he says. ""I would rather spend £120 on a meal I will remember than buy a microwave."" He got a food column from a friend who was an editor. At that time, he worked in advertising and it helped him earn extra money. When he was 42, another newspaper offered him a full-time job. ""It meant I would earn less money,"" he says. ""But it was a chance to turn my passion into a job."" He still cooks at home and tries to stay healthy by cycling to the nearest subway station.

**D. Dick Prince**  
""I started writing children's stories about 20 years ago,"" says Dick Prince, a popular children's writer in Britain. ""Before that, I loved words and wrote poems. Then I had an idea for a story. I was a farmer and knew about chickens being killed by a fox. So, I wrote a story called The Fox Busters, which was my first published children's story."" Where do his ideas come from? ""It is not easy; I have to work hard on them,"" he says. ""I usually write in the mornings. I do not wake up very early. After lunch, I spend a few hours typing what I wrote in the morning. I use an old typewriter instead of a laptop. I get 50 to 100 letters a week, and that is the best part of being a writer. I try to answer them all, but now I have some help."""
FCE_66,"Text: 'In the lumberyard by the lake, there was an old brick building with two floors. Outside, there were big piles of soft sawdust. The sawdust looked like golden mountains and covered the yard down to the blue lake. One afternoon, Michael and his friends were bored. They followed Michael up the ladder to the roof of the old building. They sat with their legs hanging over the edge, looking at the lake. 

Suddenly, Michael said, ""I dare you to jump down."" He jumped off the roof and landed in the sawdust, rolling around and laughing. ""I dare you all!"" he shouted. ""You're all cowards."" He encouraged his friends to jump. They looked scared at first, but one by one, they jumped down and smiled with relief. 

In the warm sunlight, they lay on the sawdust pile, telling jokes. Then one friend said, ""Let’s go up to the roof again and jump down."" They were not very excited, but they went up and started jumping off. Soon, only Michael was left on the roof. The others were down below, smiling and calling, ""Come on, Mike. What’s wrong with you?"" 

Michael wanted to jump down, but he stayed on the edge of the roof, feeling nervous. He tried to count to ten and then jump, but he couldn’t. His friends began to laugh at him because he was taking too long. They shouted, ""Come on, you’re a coward! Do you think we will sit here all night?"" When he didn’t move, they started to walk away, still shouting. 

Michael felt sad and alone. He stared at the ground for a long time. The sun was setting, getting bigger and bigger. His clothes were wet from sweating. Finally, he closed his eyes and jumped off the roof into the sawdust. He lay there for a long time. The yard was quiet because the workers had gone home. 

As he lay there, he wondered why he couldn’t jump before. Then he got up slowly and walked home, feeling ashamed. He was late for dinner, and his stepmother said, ""You should be able to get home on time. If you won’t come home, you can stay out tonight."" She was a strong woman with soft skin and a little grey in her hair. She looked serious, but Michael didn’t really hear her. He was still thinking about his friends laughing at him.'"
FCE_44,"**Careers Advice**

Are you unhappy in your job? Do you want to change but don’t know how? Kitty Doherty has some good advice. Many people who want to change their job go to a careers adviser. First, you will write a short history of yourself. Then, you will take some tests called 'psychometrics'. After the tests, you will get a summary of the results and suggestions for different careers. 

I tried Career Analysts, a big organization that gives career advice. Taking the careers test felt like being back in school. I was with about ten other people, and we had to answer questions quickly. I reminded myself that it was not about passing or failing. The tests were hard to understand. They included finding mistakes in lists of names and numbers and matching similar shapes. After the tests, I talked with an adviser. He used my test results to make a report with his thoughts and suggestions. I agreed with most of what he said, but I was surprised to learn that I did not do well in the scientific and technical tests. I was glad to hear that I made the right choice in wanting to be a journalist.

Changing your career does not always mean a big change. Last March, Donna Laney, 25, lost her job as a marketing manager after five years. Her friends told her to go to Career Analysts for help. She said, ""Losing my job was a good chance for me to think about my career. I wanted to look at my skills and interests."" Some results surprised her. ""I didn’t know I was good at design. But I had to think about the cost of retraining in design and my money situation,"" she said. Other ideas included taking a year off to work in the Far East. In the end, she decided to use her current skills and move to a job that suited her better. Now, she works as a Public Relations officer. She believes she could have reached this point without Career Analysts, but they helped her understand what she really wanted to do. She has sent many friends there, and they are all happy with the service.

Some people feel they would not have made changes without help. Juliet Greene, 26, went to Career Counselling Services and made important decisions. ""After working at a bank for six years, I found my job boring and wanted a new challenge. I didn’t know what to do, so I went to Career Counselling Services with an open mind. The tests showed I was interested in sciences,"" she said. ""I had four meetings with an adviser. The third meeting was recorded, which helped me remember what I said. After the fourth meeting, I decided I wanted to study geology and start a degree later this year. The advice from Career Counselling Services was worth the money. I am much happier now.""

However, career advice does not work for everyone. Amanda Margetts, 24, a sales representative, said, ""I reached a point in my career where I didn’t know what to do. I thought a careers adviser might suggest something new. I got many new ideas, but I didn’t like them because they needed a big pay cut or a lot of retraining. I didn’t learn anything new about myself. You have to share a lot of personal information, and I felt that a friend would have given me the same advice."""
FCE_22,"**Text: Fun at the Dentist's**

If you go to W. Lloyd Jerome's dental office in Glasgow, you will see bright paintings on the walls and a nice blue couch. Patients sit on this couch while he checks their teeth. Jerome says, ""Fifty percent of people only go to the dentist when they are in pain. They are scared."" To help with this, he wants to make the office a place where people feel safe. That is why he does not wear a white coat. He believes that dental visits should be relaxing and enjoyable.

Many people think dental visits are painful or very serious. Jerome says, ""If people are relaxed and happy, they will forget their bad experiences."" One of his new ideas is to use virtual-reality headsets. ""We were the first dental office in Britain to use them, and they are very popular."" Patients wear the headsets during their check-up. They sit on the blue couch and watch a film about underwater animals while Jerome checks their teeth. The headset also shows a special camera that lets patients see inside their mouths.

Most patients like this part of their visit. The office also smells nice, like a perfume shop. Today, it smells like oranges. Jerome wants people to feel that this is not a normal dentist's office. He knows that the smell of a dentist can make people nervous. I thought the nice smell in the office was very pleasant.

Jerome is known as Glasgow's most stylish dentist, but he takes his work seriously. The relaxation ideas are important, but good treatment is the most important thing. For example, he uses a special tool that sprays warm water on the teeth to clean them instead of scraping. It feels a little strange at first, but it is not painful if people are relaxed.

Five years ago, Jerome went to the United States to learn about new dental techniques. He says, ""When you make it easier for the patient, it is easier for you too."" He believes that his way of treating patients is changing the serious style of British dentistry.

At that moment, a patient arrives. Jerome quickly goes to him, offers him a cup of tea, and asks what video he would like to watch. He gently leads the patient to the chair. The patient seems to enjoy this special treatment, and it feels more like a nice beauty salon than a regular dental office."
FCE_39,"**Text: Bitter Water Becomes Popular**

Chocolate comes from South America and is now a big business around the world. In Britain, people spend over £230 million on chocolate at Easter. This is about eight percent of all chocolate sales in a year. People eat more chocolate at Christmas than at any other time.

The cacao plant, which is used to make chocolate, was first grown by the Aztecs, Toltecs, and Mayans in Central America over three thousand years ago. The cacao tree is a tropical plant found in Africa, South America, Central America, the West Indies, and Southeast Asia. The fruit of the cacao tree is big and has 20-40 seeds inside. When these seeds are dried, they become cacao beans, which are used to make chocolate. In English-speaking countries, these are often called cocoa beans. This name is a mistake from the 17th century when they were also called cacoa and cocao beans.

The Aztecs used cocoa beans as money and made a drink called xocoatl, which means ""bitter water"" in their language. They added spices to the drink for special occasions and to welcome guests. The Spanish liked the drink better with cinnamon and sugar, but it took a long time for this recipe to reach the rest of Europe.

In the late 17th century, chocolate houses opened in big cities in Europe where people could drink chocolate. Until the last century, people made chocolate drinks from solid chocolate blocks that had to be melted in hot water. In 1826, CJ van Houten from the Netherlands invented chocolate powder by removing most of the cocoa butter from the beans. 

The chocolate bar we know today started in 1847 when a company in Bristol, Fry and Sons, mixed cocoa butter with chocolate and sugar to make a solid bar. A Swiss company later added milk to make milk chocolate. At the beginning of the 20th century, French companies were very popular in the British chocolate market. In 1879, the English company Cadbury named their factory Bournville, hoping to attract customers with a French name. 

Cadbury then created the Dairy Milk bar, which started as Dairymaid in 1905. Smart advertising linked it to the healthy milk from the English countryside, making it popular against French brands. Now, people in Britain eat about four chocolate bars each week. This has made chocolate companies look for new ways to attract customers. One new idea is to turn chocolate bars into ice cream, drinks, or desserts for people who want something different.

However, cacao farmers are still struggling because cocoa bean prices fell in the late 1980s. Many small cacao farmers went out of business. So, next time you enjoy a chocolate bar, think about the farmers who grow cacao."
FCE_18,"**THE SHELL ARTIST**

Peter Cooke is 83 years old and is a master at making art from shells. He has many ideas for new projects, like making paper and working with feathers, but for now, he focuses on creating beautiful objects from shells. 

As he shows me his work in his apartment, he asks, ""Am I boring you?"" He is not boring at all; he is very enthusiastic and charming. He points to some shell-covered decorations above his fireplace. He says, ""I won’t mind if people don’t buy them because I love them."" Peter never planned to sell his work, but five years ago, some friends told him he should have an exhibition. They helped him talk to an art gallery owner.

His first exhibition was in London, and 70% of his pieces were sold. His second exhibition opened yesterday. The prices for his art are high, around £2,000 for some pieces. There are 86 items in the exhibition, with prices starting at £225 for a shell flower in a crystal vase. Peter says he does not set the prices, but he knows his work is unique. The gallery owner told him that one day, people will want his pieces even more because he will stop making them.

Peter wishes he had started making art from shells earlier in his life. He believes he could have created even more wonderful things. Although he still has many ideas, he feels he cannot work as easily as he could when he was younger. His work is very different from the common shell crafts found in seaside shops. He has a ""miniature mind,"" which helps him create boxes covered in tiny shells, pictures made from shells, and baskets of realistic flowers.

Peter has his own way of working and uses materials he finds. He uses cardboard from laundered shirts for flower bases, a special glue from a sail-maker, and washing-up liquid to clean the shells. He says, ""I have an idea of what I want to do, and it just happens."" His attention to detail and color makes his work look very special.

Peter travels to many places to find beautiful shells, including France, Thailand, Mexico, South Africa, and the Philippines. He lies on the beach to look for shells to take home. He only collects dead shells and does not take shells with living creatures inside. He explains that many people walk on the beach and break shells, and the sea also breaks them. He believes it is okay to collect shells that are no longer homes for sea creatures. His argument is strong, especially when you see how beautiful his work is."
FCE_62,"**The Schoolgirl Model**

Kira Langer is 15 years old. When she is not traveling to exciting places and being on magazine covers, she studies for her school exams. Jane Laidlaw learns more about her.

The receptionist at the agency said, ""I'm afraid Kira will be a little late."" I replied, ""Oh, fine, no problem."" I was trying to think that all the bad things I had read about models were not true, but I kept thinking of words like difficult, vain, and unintelligent. I wondered how late she would be. Would it be one hour? Three hours? Maybe she would not come at all. What if she thought going to the hairdresser was more fun than talking to me? If she was late, she might be in a bad mood and not want to answer my questions.

But when Kira, the winner of the Looks magazine supermodel competition, walked in, she was smiling and relaxed. She was with her mother. Kira was not wearing expensive clothes; she had on a simple black dress and trainers. She was very friendly, very tall, and very pretty. All models under 16 must bring an adult with them when they work. Kira's mother looked proud of her daughter.

Kira seemed a little confused by her new fame, which is normal because it was not planned. Her older sister suggested that she enter the model competition. Kira said no, but her sister sent some photos anyway. When Kira learned she was a finalist, she was at school. Being chosen for the final gave Kira the confidence to continue, and she did very well. She won easily, and the Select model agency in London offered her work.

Now, Kira finds it hard to manage her two lives. Her friends and teachers are used to having a star among them. Kira says, ""They're really proud of me."" However, some unkind people at her school say rude things about her success. They say she thinks too highly of herself. This must be hard for Kira because she is not a selfish person. She says, ""They think that because I am a model now, I cannot stay the same. But the only thing that has changed is that I am more confident. I can stand up for myself more.""

As a busy model, her social life is affected. The Select agency can call her at any time and ask her to work the next day. Kira says, ""If my friends are going out, I can't say I will come because I don't know what I will do the next day. I can't really make plans, and if I do, they sometimes change. But my friends are good about it. They don't say, 'Oh, you are always going off to model now, you never have time for us.'""

Kira has the looks, talent, and support to have a great career. Not many people can say that before they finish their school exams. At the end of the interview, I asked her what she would like to do if she did not have her beauty. She paused and replied, ""I would like to do what you are doing."""

Father and son start Gold Rush

Terence and Chris Madden have traveled from the cold north of Canada to hot Africa to find gold. The father and son team - one is an explorer and the other is a mineral expert - think their mine on a Welsh mountain could have up to 10,000 ounces of gold. After ten years of digging in the Welsh hills, they believe they are very close to a five million dollar gold vein.

""As we dig, we are finding a lot of gold; now we just need to dig a bit more to where it is concentrated,"" said Terence, 68, from Liverpool. They have spent their lives looking for gold. Their search started when Terence read about gold worth millions of pounds hidden in the 'Dolgellau gold belt', an area near the town of Dolgellau in Wales. While reading old mining journals and newspapers at the Welsh National Library in Aberystwyth, they chose the best area of land to study.

Since they first cleared the land and found pieces of gold in the rocks, they have spent ten years getting permission to work from the landowners, taking samples of the earth, and removing old cars and trash. They dug out 150 tonnes of greenstone rock to make a tunnel and a 10-metre shaft. Now they are running out of money. They have spent their savings on this dream and need to find someone to invest £50,000 to dig a bit deeper to where the gold is.

Chris Madden says, ""Right now, this looks doubtful, but we have some people we can contact."" As news spread about their dig, many people in the area became interested in gold. Dolgellau depends on tourists, and residents are hopeful. ""It would bring more people here if they are right,"" said Peter Woolven, manager of the Royal Ship Hotel, ""but if they find gold, I hope many people do not come and dig up the hillside.""

The Welsh gold industry has declined a lot since the late 1880s when many people worked in hundreds of mines. One of the last mines, Clogau-St David's, which made wedding rings for the Queen and the Princess of Wales, closed a month ago. Now, individual gold-diggers are coming back. George Hall, another gold seeker, plans to dig a tunnel deep into the hill on the other side of the ridge from the Maddens. ""Searching for gold is very emotional,"" said Hall, 70. ""It's exciting to uncover hidden treasure. Maybe I will be lucky this time."""
FCE_31,"**Text: IN HOT WATER**

Rachel Mills is a scientist. She spends a lot of time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. Rachel teaches and does research about marine geochemistry. This means she studies the chemicals in the sea. She works at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. 

When she is not teaching, Rachel goes into a small steel vehicle to dive three kilometres down into the ocean. This vehicle is the size of a small car. Inside, there is very little space. Rachel can touch the two pilots who are with her. They cannot stand up or move around. They must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. 

A dive can last for 16 hours. It takes three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours to collect rock and water samples, and three hours to come back up. If there is a problem, Rachel can press a panic button. This makes a small escape vessel come out, which goes quickly to the surface. Rachel says, ""No one has tested it yet, but I don't think it would be a very nice trip.""

Rachel remembers her first dive. She got into the vehicle on a ship with an instructor. He explained what to do in an emergency, like if the pilot had a heart attack. They wanted to see how she would react in a small space. Now, Rachel has made six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian team. They went to a place five days away from the Canary Islands. There, they found many underwater volcanoes that were blowing out black smoke. 

When Rachel is not at sea, she works in her office at the Oceanography Centre. She says, ""Two-thirds of my salary comes from teaching, which I love, but I do it so I can continue my research on the 'black smokers.'"" Black smokers are underwater volcanoes that release hot water that looks like black smoke. This water comes out at a speed of one metre per second and is 350 degrees hot.

Rachel felt scared during her first dive with an American team. They were towing equipment when there was a loud explosion. She thought, ""I'm going to die."" They waited in silence, but they were still alive. The relief was incredible!

Diving to the deepest part of the ocean is an adventure for Rachel. Every time she looks out of the porthole and sees the chimneys, she feels wonder. She thinks, ""Here I am at the bottom of the sea, and no one else has ever seen this."" Rachel studied black smokers for three years for her PhD. When she finally saw them, it was an amazing feeling."
FCE_58,"Text: ""I was dirty, smelly, hungry, and a little sunburned. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. My body was tired, and my mind was confused by different train times, money, and languages. 'Never again,' I said as I got home. I said the same thing the next year and the year after that. All I had to do was buy one train ticket. Because I was under twenty-five years old, I could travel anywhere in Europe for a whole month. 

Sleeping in a train corridor is very different from sleeping in a bed. The train moves you into a deep sleep. Carrying all your things in a backpack makes you travel simply. You might waste things, like burning socks that smell bad or throwing away books you have read. But this is part of the fun of Inter-Rail. You can forget about rules and just enjoy the trip. All you need is that ticket in your hand. 

This ticket lets young people travel to many countries in one day. On my first trip, my friends and I did not know how special this ticket was. We thought it was just a cheap way to get to our campsite in southern France. But we wanted to travel more. There was always one more country to visit, and it did not cost us anything extra. 

We were not only interested in culture, but this was our first holiday without parents. We made our own plans and only saw the most interesting sights. We wanted to do something different. I was proud that sometimes all I wanted to see was the view from the train station. We were just trying to enjoy ourselves, like many other Inter-Railers who shared the train with us. 

The excitement of travel comes from seeing a place you only knew by name. When the train arrives at the station, you see the city for the first time. You can only understand Europe by seeing it, watching the changing landscapes, and noticing different lifestyles. Everyone knows about Europe, but it is not real until you see it yourself. This is why other people's holiday photos can be boring. 

While the train trip may not show you new things in the world, it is a valuable personal experience. Europe is big, and Inter-Rail gives people a great chance to see it, even if it did not happen for us right away."""

Arriving at an airport in another country and finding out that your luggage is missing is very disappointing. You may have to wear the same clothes for hours or days until the airline finds your bags. Sometimes, you might be in a different place with a different climate and have to wear clothes that are not right for the weather.

Airlines do not often say how many bags they lose, but it happens to many travelers. Even good airlines can make mistakes, and they cannot always promise that your checked luggage will travel on the same flight as you, especially if you have to change planes.

Airlines ask passengers to arrive at the airport early. This is to give enough time for bags to be checked and loaded onto the plane. There is also a minimum time needed to change from one flight to another. This time is often longer to help with baggage transfers. Usually, this system works well. But sometimes, extra security checks and air traffic problems can delay flights. These issues can cause bags to be lost. Human mistakes can also happen, like if a bag's label gets torn off. 

Big airports, called 'hubs', can have more problems because they handle many bags. For example, last year, Heathrow airport in London had over 41 million passengers, with nine million changing planes. British Airways had two million transfer passengers at Heathrow, with many moving between Terminal 1 and Terminal 4.

Even busy airports like Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Singapore, and Zurich can have bad days. The chance of losing luggage is higher at some airports. In the United States, Miami airport is known for losing bags when passengers quickly connect to flights to Latin America.

To avoid losing your luggage, choose direct flights when you can and check in early. If you must change planes, try to use the same airline. Allow extra time for connections by taking an earlier flight. Make sure to label your luggage with your home and holiday addresses, and include your flight numbers.

If your luggage is still missing, contact the airline staff in the baggage area and fill out a property irregularity report (PIR) before you leave the airport."
FCE_2,"**Text: The Kingfisher**

Wildlife photographer Charlie James knows a lot about the kingfisher. This is a beautiful blue-green bird that lives near streams and rivers and eats fish. Old trees grow over the stream, giving some shade to the shallow water. The main colors around are soft greens, browns, and yellows from the sunlight. The sounds of water in the breeze are gentle. The kingfisher moves quickly and straight, like a flash of light. It is gone in a second, but you can still remember it because it is so special. 

Charlie James loved kingfishers when he was young. He feels very strongly about this little bird, but he cannot say exactly why. The kingfisher is part of many stories. In Greek mythology, the kingfisher is a moon goddess that became a bird. Another story says the kingfisher flew so high that its top became blue like the sky, while its bottom was burned by the sun. There is some truth in this story. Kingfishers do not have blue pigment in their feathers. Instead, the way their feathers are made scatters light and reflects blue. This is why a kingfisher can look bright blue or rich green depending on the light.

Many wildlife photographers love kingfishers. They are shy birds, but you can watch them easily from a hiding place. Charlie James's first hiding place was an old blanket he put over his head while he waited near a kingfisher's favorite spot. The bird came back in a few minutes and sat very close to him. But it took him four more years to take his first good picture. During this time, the European kingfisher became very important in his life. He spent as much time as he could by a stream where kingfishers lived. However, school took away some of his time with the birds. He missed classes and called himself an ""academic failure."" But people noticed his interest in the kingfisher, which is the most common kingfisher in the world and the only one that breeds in Europe. 

At 16, he was hired as an advisor for a nature magazine. He then worked as an assistant to the editor and later became a freelance wildlife film cameraman. Now, he wants to make the best kingfisher film. ""No speech, just beautiful images that say it all,"" he says. ""I like to photograph parts of kingfisher wings..."" His voice trails off as he thinks about the colors of the bird he has loved for many years. His photographs show some of his feelings, but Charlie knows there is much more to his connection with the kingfisher than his work can show."
FCE_68,"**Text: Conducting an Orchestra**

Giving directions to an orchestra is not easy. Anne Inglis talks to five new conductors about their work.

A. **ANNE MANSON**  
Anne Manson, 30, asked to watch conductor Claudio Abbado's practice sessions in Vienna. She ended up helping as an assistant. Later, she had to lead the first rehearsal for Abbado. ""I wasn't nervous. I always felt good about standing in front of an orchestra,"" she said. Manson is from America and works with a London opera company that focuses on modern music. She is also becoming known in other European countries, thanks to support from the British Arts Council. Since her first experience, she has helped Abbado on many projects.

B. **ANDREW CONSTANTINE**  
Andrew Constantine, 31, says the hardest part of being a conductor is getting the right chances. He won a big competition in 1991 after trying twice before. He is thankful for the timing: ""If I had won earlier, I would have been forgotten."" The competition gave him many chances to perform and work as an assistant to a famous conductor. However, he finds it hard to shake off the ""competition"" label. ""If in three years my name is still linked to the competition, I will be worried,"" he said. But orchestras like the English Chamber Orchestra are inviting him back, which is good for his career.

C. **WASFI KANI**  
Wasfi Kani, who started Pimlico Opera, enjoys the long practice time needed for opera. ""The music deserves four weeks of attention,"" she said. Kani began conducting seriously in her late twenties. After university, she worked in London until Pimlico Opera became fully professional two years ago. Taking lessons with Sian Edwards was important for her. ""I saw her conduct and realized she was my size. I had always learned from bigger people, which makes a big difference."" She likes the complex nature of opera: ""There are many arguments, and you have to think about the singers' personalities.""

D. **ROGER VIGNOLES**  
Roger Vignoles, 48, says conducting surprised him, but he finds it fascinating. He started as a musician in an opera house and worked with good conductors. Last year, he directed Handel's Agrippina from the piano at a festival, something he had never done before. ""It was easier than I thought. I knew the music well and tried my best to get the performance I wanted. People respect my skills as a musician. I learn from every experience I have had, both in music style and performing. Now, I will do whatever people ask me to find out what I enjoy.""

E. **WAYNE MARSHALL**  
In 1986, conductor Simon Rattle noticed Wayne Marshall, a young assistant conductor, and told his agent about him. Now 32, Marshall soon found himself conducting a musical in London at short notice, which was a tough start. He had to deal with some relaxed musicians reading newspapers during the show. ""I was firm with them. I always gave a clear beat and did my best,"" he said. Many musicians do not seem to need advice from a conductor, but he is not afraid to say what he wants. ""I have never studied conducting formally, and no book teaches you how to conduct, but people have been kind to me. I am determined and know what I like."""
FCE_23,"**Variations on a Theme**

If you want to take children to a theme park, there are many to choose from in Britain. We asked five families to try the best ones.

**Fun Island - The Burns Family**  
Last year, we went to a big theme park in the US and thought Fun Island would be boring. But we were surprised! The park is good for younger children, so our three-year-old had fun too. The kids loved the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. There is a special dodgems ride for little kids, which was very popular. For older children, there are scarier rides, like Splash Out, where you jump into a pool! After five hours, Steve and I wanted to leave, but the children wanted to stay because they were having so much fun. Our only complaint is that the park could be more exciting, and the scenery was not great. But the staff were very helpful, and the park was clean and safe.

**Wonderland - The McMillan Family**  
None of us had been to a theme park before, so we didn’t know what to expect. We thought Oscar might be too young, but he loved it. He enjoyed the Mountain Train and liked Little Land, which has small models of famous buildings. The older children liked the ferris wheel and driving toy cars on a real road. We spent six hours there and were happy there were places to rest. The park looked nice, and the staff were friendly. There is something for everyone, even adults.

**Adventure World - The Jeffree Family**  
After seven hours, we still wanted to see more. The children loved the Big Top Circus, which had a great trapeze act. We went on the Terror Line, and even though the girls were scared, they said they enjoyed it. Their favorite ride was Running River, where you think you will get wet, but you don’t. For younger children, Toy Land is very fun. The children wanted to try the new ride, Fear Factor, but we were relieved they were too small for it! The park is so well designed that waiting for rides is not boring. It is very clean, and the staff are nice. One time, I couldn’t sit with both girls, so a staff member went with one of them.

**The Great Park - The Langridge Family**  
We arrived at one o'clock and were sad that the park closed at 5 p.m. This is a great theme park for younger children because the rides are not too scary. I am a bit scared of rides, but I had fun. We all loved Exotic Travels, a boat ride that starts slow and then becomes very exciting. We waited for half an hour for Lightning River, and it was over quickly! I wouldn’t go on the Big Leap, but if you are brave, it looked fun. If the children were a bit older, they might have found it too easy, but they loved it.

**Fantasy World - The Break-all Family**  
The park says there is ""No Limit to the Fun,"" and we felt that was true. Europe’s tallest roller-coaster, the Rocket, is very big, and Ben thought it was the scariest ride. Jennie thought the Hanger, where you hang upside-down 30 meters above the ground, was worse! There are many main rides, and the older children went on them several times. Sarah was too small for some rides but enjoyed the Long Slide. The staff were nice sometimes, but not always. You need a full day to enjoy Fantasy World. We wouldn’t have told the kids we were going home early."
FCE_60,"**Text: Running a Business in the Countryside**

Five women talk about their experiences starting a business in the countryside.

A. ""My customers are friends,"" says CHRISTINE HOGAN. She runs a computer design business that makes over £200,000 a year and has four full-time workers. ""My husband and I moved from London to the countryside when our children were small. I wanted to work from home. I had worked with computers before I got married, so my husband suggested I start a computer design business. It needed a lot of money, and it was hard at first. But I was careful and told the bank manager if I might spend too much. Working from home saves money, and I can work in the evening if I want. It is still a small business. We hardly ever deliver work; people from the area come to pick it up.""

B. ""I enjoy being independent,"" says MAGGY SASANOW. She works from home as a designer of greeting cards. ""I studied art at university and wanted to work in a museum. But when I got married, we moved to the countryside, where there were no jobs like that. So, I started my own business and make 50 different greeting cards that I sell to museums. I work in a big room upstairs. The bad thing about working from home is that there is always something to do, like mowing the lawn. I don’t advertise; my business comes from word of mouth. People send work from London because I am cheaper than other artists. Working alone means I don’t share ideas with others, but there are more good things than bad.""

C. ""It has been hard at times,"" says DELIA TURNER. She makes curtains and has had good and bad times. ""I started my business eight years ago. At that time, this type of business was growing, and in two years, my income went from £24,000 to £80,000. I used to have six full-time curtain makers, but I had to let them go because the economy got worse. It was hard because it is not easy to find other jobs here. Now, I am back to making curtains at home with my husband’s help and using women who work from their homes. I have to lower my prices when needed and look for new opportunities.""

D. TESSA STRICKLAND runs her children's book publishing business from her farmhouse. ""I moved to the countryside three years ago for two reasons. First, it was cheaper than London, and second, I love the countryside. I like being able to work when I want. Eighty percent of my income comes from deals with Australia, the Far East, and North America, so I have to take calls at strange times. The bad thing is that I need to be disciplined to close the office door. I publish children's books from different cultures, working with authors and artists. I had all my work experience in London, so I felt very alone at first.""

E. MEG RIVERS runs a cake business that sends cakes by post and has a shop. She makes £250,000 a year and employs six people, some part-time. ""I started ten years ago at home. I care about health, so I began making fruit cakes with good quality flour and eggs. Then friends and family asked for cakes, and soon I was sending cakes all over the country. Seven years ago, I rented a small building, and now everything is made there. We have a baker, an assistant, and a professional cake decorator. I don’t bake anymore; I manage the business. My biggest problem has been the money side of the business, which has been hard because we didn’t have a lot of money to start."""
FCE_1,"**Text: Meet the Amazing Watkins Family**

The Watkins family is very special. The sons are musicians and composers, and their dad makes musical instruments. 

John and Hetty Watkins are schoolteachers in South Wales. They wanted to buy a cello for their ten-year-old son, Paul, but it was too expensive. John thought, ""Maybe I can make one."" He found a school nearby that teaches how to make instruments. He took evening classes for about three years. 

After making some violins, John made his first cello. Paul, now 28, says, ""It turned out really well. He made me another one later, and I used it until a few months ago."" John has now retired from teaching and makes violins full-time. He sells about twelve violins a year. One of his violins was sold to a famous American player, Jaime Laredo.

Paul and his younger brother, Huw, started playing music when they were young. Paul remembers, ""I played the piano as soon as I could reach the keys."" He tried the violin but did not like it. Instead, he liked the cello player in his dad's music group. When he was six or seven, he started taking cello lessons.

Huw, now 22, says, ""My parents were supportive. I wanted to be like Paul, but I did not feel pushed."" Huw is now a pianist and composer.

Paul used his dad's cello to win a music competition. At just 20 years old, he became the main cellist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra. He played his dad's cello until last year. Now, he has a different cello that is very old, made by Francesco Rugeri. 

Paul will soon play this cello on television in a concert. He says, ""I will play it my way."" However, he cannot watch himself on TV because he is performing at the Cheltenham Festival that night. Huw will also perform his String Quartet in London at the same time. John and Hetty will have to be very busy to keep up with all their sons' music events!"
FCE_53,"**Looking after the Countryside: The National Trust**

The National Trust is an organization that wants to protect the British countryside. Gill Page visits the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and talks to Gareth Roberts, a warden who works for the Trust.

Gareth says that a National Trust Warden needs common sense. ""You also need to be good with people,"" he explains. ""You work with farmers, visitors, conservationists, and building companies."" Gareth grew up on the Lleyn Peninsula and worked on his parents' farm until he got married. About 80 people wanted the job of National Trust Warden for the Lleyn Peninsula. In the end, Gareth got the job because he knows the area well and has farming experience, even though he did not have formal training.

Gareth says, ""It helps that I still farm with my parents. I can talk to farmers and understand their problems."" His farming background also helps him with the physical work, like building fences, planting trees, and making walls. Since he started working for the Trust, Gareth has learned more about nature conservation. He remembers when he was young, he picked flowers, collected butterfly eggs, and found birds' nests. Now, he wonders where he can find those things. He believes farming has changed the countryside, but it is not the farmers' fault; they were just following government rules.

At first, farmers and conservationists did not get along. They both wanted things done their way. Now, they are talking and understanding each other better. Gareth says, ""We are close to bringing them together."" 

Gareth's job includes conservation, allowing people to visit the Trust's land, planting trees, and working with tenant farmers. ""My job is to make sure work gets done well and without too much trouble,"" he says. He enjoys seeing projects finished, but he spends a lot of time on reports and paperwork.

Gareth loves his job, even though he is always working. He enjoys talking to people, but some visitors can be difficult. ""Some people come in, ask for everything, and then leave as if they own the place. It can be annoying!"" he admits. But Gareth believes that common sense is important.

If you have common sense and like working outside, you might want to apply to be a warden like Gareth. But be ready; it may take a long time to find a job on the Lleyn Peninsula!"
FCE_55,"**The Netball Captain**

In our series about women in sports, Suzie Ellis met England's netball captain, Kendra Slowinski. Kendra is the captain of the England netball team. When I met her, she had a busy day. She taught at a local school and then had a training session in a supermarket car park. 

""Don't you get strange looks?"" I asked her. She replied, ""I am too focused on my movements and my feet to notice anything else. I might see cars slow down, but that’s all.""

Kendra said, ""My whole life is about being my best for the Championships."" She is following a strict schedule to be very fit for the games. This is her fourth World Championships, and it will be the biggest one yet, with 27 countries taking part. ""We will have home support, which is very special,"" she said. ""It is important to improve the reputation of netball in this country. There will be more pressure because we are playing at home. People expect us to start with a good game.""

Their first game is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. ""We have always beaten them, but they will be exciting to play. They are very skilled,"" Kendra said. The England team is currently ranked fourth in the world. But Kendra knows the Championships will be tough. ""You have to push yourself to play every day. There is no rest between games. In a series, you can still win if you lose the first game. But in the Championships, you have only one chance.""

In the fifteen years she has played at a high level, the sport has become harder and faster. Players are more aggressive on the court. ""You train hard to win,"" Kendra said. ""But after the game, we are all friends.""

Netball is also using more science for fitness testing. ""It is important that we think and train like world-class players,"" Kendra said. ""As captain, I need to have a strong mind and lead by example. I want to support and encourage my team.""

Kendra said, ""From the start of my netball career, I have planned carefully. I decided that this competition would be my last as a player."" She will likely coach young players in the future, but now she is focused on her last big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she might have a tear in her eye."
FCE_50,"**SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS**

What should you do if your child is very good at music? It can be hard to know how to help them. Some parents may not see their child's talent until they become frustrated and act out. Most schools can help children who are good at subjects like math or English, but children who are good at music need special support that regular schools may not provide. 

Children who are musically talented can benefit from going to a specialist music school. There are five of these schools in Britain. They help children aged seven to eighteen develop their musical skills with the help of professional musicians. 

At these schools, children spend a lot of time on music. They have individual lessons, play in orchestras, and practice singing and music theory. They also practice in special rooms, sometimes with a teacher. The rest of their time is spent on important subjects like English, math, science, and languages. Some students can study more subjects if they want.

All five specialist music schools in Britain are independent. This means they are not part of the government school system. The classes are small, so teachers can give more attention to each student. Most children live at the school, which means they eat and sleep there. This helps them be around other children who love music too.

However, there are some problems. One big issue is the cost; it can be very expensive (around £12,000 to £17,000 a year for students who live at the school). The schools try to help with scholarships and financial aid for families with talented children. Also, not all parents want to send their young children to live at school. Many school directors worry about admitting children as young as seven because it can be a tough environment. They want to help children grow up to be well-rounded individuals.

It is important to know that being in a special music school can be stressful. Some children may lose their musical talent as they grow older. The pressure to succeed can also make them feel like they are failing. However, the schools watch each student closely and offer help when needed.

Many former students say they learned a lot from the music schools, but some think it is not good to focus too much on music and not enough on other subjects. Many musically talented children are also smart and want to learn more in school. Because of this, it might be better to wait until a child is older to decide if they should go to a specialist school. 

Children who are good at both music and academics can do well in regular schools that have good music programs. They can also take music lessons on weekends at music colleges. However, this option may not be possible for families who live far from big cities like London."

Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. The big garden around her house gives her many ideas for her art. It is full of her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wildly and spread all over the garden. The two long flower beds along the path in the garden have many colors and shapes. This is because the previous owners loved gardening and left plants that Susan likes. She also kept the gardener, Danny. 

""In fact, it was really his garden,"" she says. ""We got along very well. At first, he would say, 'Oh, it's not worth it' about some things I wanted to add. But when I said I wanted to paint them, he understood what I meant."" 

Susan likes to paint detailed pictures of single plants instead of the whole garden. Sometimes, she paints a group of plants together. Usually, she picks the flowers and takes them to her studio. ""I don't set everything up at once,"" she says. ""I take one flower out and paint it, which might take a few days. Then I bring in another one and add to the painting. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.""

Her busiest time is spring and early summer when the tulips bloom, followed by the poppies. ""They all come out together, and you're so busy,"" she says. But she also finds beauty in how flowers change as they wilt. For example, with tulips, ""you bring them in and put them in water. After a day, they change shape. They open up and look amazing. At first, they seem boring, but they change all the time.""

Susan has always loved plants. ""I studied botany in school and collected wildflowers from the countryside,"" she says. ""I didn't like garden flowers then; I thought they looked fake, like silk or plastic flowers. I liked wildflowers because they grew in tough places, like cracks in rocks or on cliffs.""

Today, her garden has many plants from faraway places, but they grow well in her garden. She has a relaxed attitude about her garden, like a kind aunt who lets children play as long as they don’t break anything. 

With two art shows coming up and many flowers to paint, she has found it hard to work in the garden lately. She now has an extra gardener, but she knows that to stay connected to her art, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""

Sarah Sutherland-Pilch is a chalet girl. She is 24 years old and comes from West Sussex, England. This is her second year working in Val d'Isère, France. She cooks and cleans for visitors who come to ski and stay in wooden houses called chalets.

Sarah studied French and History of Art at Oxford Brookes University. She says being a chalet girl is not a career, but a fun way to spend a year or two before starting a regular job. ""I meet successful people every week,"" she says.

Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to work. The chalet can sleep up to 18 guests each week. She has her own breakfast before making breakfast for the guests. They have porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants. After breakfast, Sarah cleans up and either makes afternoon tea or cleans the rooms, which she thinks is the worst part of her job. By 11 a.m., she is ready to ski. ""On a good day, we can ski until 4:30 p.m.,"" she says.

After skiing, Sarah returns to the chalet to prepare dinner. Dinner is served at 8 p.m., and coffee is ready by 10 p.m. After dinner, she cleans the kitchen. ""There's nothing worse than a messy kitchen in the morning,"" she says. Sometimes she talks with the guests, but other times they want to be alone. ""Good guests can make a week great,"" she says.

Sarah lives in the chalet with her friends. They go out at about 11 p.m. They usually start at a place called Bananas and might go to G Jay's or Dick's T-Bar later. But on Saturday nights, she does not stay out too late because Sunday is her busiest day.

On Sunday, Sarah starts work early. Breakfast for the guests must be ready by 7 a.m. After the guests leave, she cleans quickly. ""We clear the breakfast, strip the beds, and get everything ready,"" she says. If she has not done the shopping for the week on Saturday, she does it now. 

At around 3 p.m., after cleaning, Sarah prepares tea for the new guests who arrive at about 4:30 p.m. Sometimes the guests are confused and have many questions. ""I think the mountain air affects them,"" she says. Between tea and dinner, Sarah helps guests who need boots or skis and then gets a lift back to the chalet.

Soon, it is time for dinner again. Sometimes she chats with friends, but if she is too tired, she goes to bed early."

Mandie Currie is a zoo-keeper. She spent a day at the magazine Marie Claire. ""Choosing my clothes for Marie Claire was hard because I usually wear a uniform at the zoo. First, I went to a photo studio, then to press previews, all before lunch. The zoo is a calm place, but here I was rushing around. Some people on the fashion team seemed stressed, but my job is not very stressful. At a fashion shoot in the afternoon, I laughed because I usually clean cages or handle rats. I like seeing how magazines work, but I enjoy my job at the zoo, so I will stay there.""

Alice Cutler is a fashion assistant at Marie Claire. She spent a day at London Zoo. ""I arrived at the zoo in my leather boots and dark blue trousers. The zoo gave me a green polo shirt to wear, which was good because I got very dirty. When I stroked an elephant, I thought Mandie was probably packing clothes. By five o'clock, I was very dirty, but I had a great day. When I stop working in fashion, I could see myself working with elephants, maybe in Africa.""

Karen Hodson is a nurse at Hammersmith Hospital. She worked with the television gardening show Ground Force. ""I was very excited to meet the team, and Alan Titchmarsh, the presenter, was very nice. I liked being outside because I sometimes do not see daylight at work. It was hard work, but it was fun. I thought I was strong, but I felt weak compared to the team. I did not think gardening would be so hard, so I will not quit my nursing job.""

Charlie Dimmock is a gardener on the TV show Ground Force. He worked a shift at Hammersmith Hospital. ""I made beds and gave out medicine. I thought I would faint during some jobs, but I was okay. The nurses are friendly, and it felt very different from my usual job with men. I feel my job is not as important as nursing. My day at the hospital was not easy, but it made me feel good.""

Lucy Harvey is a personal trainer. She spent a day with Ryanair as cabin crew. ""I changed into the uniform, and I felt different. People looked at me. Before the flight, our supervisor told us about safety, which I knew from my training. When the passengers got on the flight to Paris, I gave out magazines. Everyone stared at me, and I felt shy. On the way back, we had 80 schoolchildren who would not sit still. I wished I was back in the gym with one sensible adult.""

Sonia McDermott is an air hostess with Ryanair. She spent a day as a personal trainer in a gym. ""I was worried about this swap because I do not exercise. I was surprised by how much attention you give to one person. In my job, I meet 130 passengers four times a day. At lunch, I saw that some trainers did not eat very healthily, but they all drink a lot of water. I would not change my job for this, but it has inspired me to join a gym and try to be healthier."""

Five famous people share their favorite memories of train journeys with Andrew Morgan.

**Andrea Thompson - Newsreader**  
I fell in love with the south of France a long time ago and try to go back as often as I can. There is a local train from Cannes along the coast that goes to Italy. It takes you past beautiful sea views. It does not matter what the weather is like or what time of year it is; it is always lovely. Out of the other window, you can see some of the best gardens and houses in France. You feel like you are looking into the homes of rich people. The travelers are always lively because there are many tourists and locals, all enjoying the beautiful journey.

**Raj Patel - Explorer**  
I have enjoyed many train journeys, but my favorite is the Nile Valley Express, which goes across the desert in northern Sudan. When I was young in South Africa, I missed a family train trip from Cape Town to the Kruger National Park because I was too young and was sent to my aunt's house. When I moved to England as a teenager, I still had not traveled by train. London Waterloo was the first real train station I ever saw, and its big glass roof amazed me.

**Betty Cooper - Novelist**  
I am thankful for one train in particular: the Blue Train, which took my husband and me on our honeymoon across France to catch a boat to Egypt. On the train, my husband gave me a pink dress, which I thought was wonderful. Someone said that pink is good for the brain, and I have worn it ever since. The journey was lovely as we traveled through France and then by boat up the Nile. It was the perfect way to relax after all the wedding plans.

**Martin Brown - Journalist**  
We were working on articles about a trip around the world and had to cross a desert in Africa. There was no road, so we took the Desert Express. The schedule was not reliable; we were just given a day. We heard that the driver would wait for days if people were still coming. When the train arrived, many people rushed to get on, and some even traveled on the roof for free. At night, the train went through beautiful landscapes. It felt like a dream, like traveling on the moon.

**Arisu Mezuki - Actress**  
Most people have favorite memories of trains from when they were children, but I do not. I grew up in Singapore and Cyprus, where I saw very few trains. It was not until I was a teenager that trains became important in my life. I made a film that had a railway in Yorkshire. Most of the filming was on an old train line that volunteers had taken care of. That is where my love for steam trains began. When we were not filming, we took every chance to ride the train, and when I went back last year, it felt like time had not changed. Everything was still the same, even the gas lights on the station platform!"

If you want to publish your story, our expert Margaret Stubbs has some advice for you. Many readers of this magazine ask, ""I have written a story/book. Who should I send it to?"" 

First, you need to research where to send your work. You should learn about publishers and practice your writing skills. Writing well takes time and knowledge. No matter what you write, you need to know about the markets you want to reach. 

One of the best ways to learn is by reading. Go to your local library, bookshops, and newsagents. Reading many different things will help you understand what kinds of writing publishers want. 

This knowledge should be updated often because new magazines and books come out all the time. Publishers are always looking for new writers, so you need to give them what they want. 

If you are not sure what to write, let’s say you want to write short love stories. First, find out which magazines publish love stories. Get recent copies of these magazines and read them. Learn about the kind of stories they buy and who their readers are. 

These readers expect different things, and the editor wants to meet their needs. Sometimes, new writers send me their stories and ask, ""This has been rejected three times. Am I wasting my time?"" I never want to discourage anyone, but it is likely that their work is not ready to be published. 

Many new writers are too eager to send their work out too soon. If you have only written one story or article, it is very unlikely to be published. When you hear about someone’s success, they usually have been writing for years before they got published. 

When you send your work for the first time, keep writing more stories while you wait for a reply. Write ten more stories, or even twenty. Each one will be better than the last, and you will start to see yourself as a writer. Your skills and confidence will grow. 

Don’t throw away any of your stories; instead, try to improve them. I also suggest not showing your work to others in the beginning. Remember, every successful writer has faced many rejections before they succeeded. 

Do everything you can to improve as a writer. Look for a creative writing course near you. If you can’t find one, try joining a local writers' group. This will help you get ideas and confidence from other writers. 

Think of yourself as a writer and practice writing every day if you can.'"

On the last day of a bad year, I was waiting at the Baltimore train station for the 10:10 train to Philadelphia. There were more people than I expected. The station did not feel clean and bright like usual. Older couples with matching bags filled the benches, and many college students had their bags on the floor. A grey-haired man was walking around and talking to different people. He looked rich: he had tanned skin, a nice sweater, and a soft coat. He asked a woman sitting alone if she was going to Philadelphia. She said she was going north, but to New York. Then he asked an old lady if she was going to Philadelphia, but she said she was going to Wilmington. 

I was going to Philadelphia, too. I thought he could have asked me, but he looked at me quickly and walked away. He looked stressed. He asked a woman reading a book if she was going to Philadelphia. She was about thirty-five years old and looked like a teacher. She said yes. The man then asked her for a favor. I stood a little away and pretended to look at my wrist, even though I didn’t have a watch. 

The man said, “My daughter is flying out this afternoon from Philadelphia. I put her on a train this morning and then went home. My wife was upset because my daughter forgot her passport. She called from the station and didn’t know what to do.” The woman listened and seemed sympathetic. I thought it was better to stay quiet and see what he would say next. 

The man continued, “I told her to stay at the station, and I would get someone to bring her passport.” I thought it was strange he didn’t go himself if it was so important. The woman asked, “Why don’t you go yourself?” He replied, “I can’t leave my wife alone. She is in a wheelchair.” I thought this was not a good excuse. 

I looked at the man. He was holding a padded envelope, not a plain one. It was the size of a small book and looked stapled shut. I thought to myself, “Be careful, lady.”"

John Moore is the owner of a restaurant. He talks about his son, Gary, who is a famous TV chef. John believes everyone gets a chance in life. Gary got his chance to cook, and John got his chance to run a restaurant. When John heard about a restaurant for sale, he went to see it. The place was in bad condition, but it was perfect for him.

Running the restaurant made John think of his childhood. He remembers his mother working in a factory and how sad he felt when he was left alone. He wanted to have time for family. John's wife took care of the children and helped with the money while he ran the restaurant. They lived above the restaurant and always had meals together. This helped their children, Gary and Joe, become confident. They talked to the customers from a young age, which was good for them.

Gary was a lively child. When he was seven, he jumped into a corner bath and hurt himself. As he grew older, he worked for pocket money. He started with small jobs and by ten, he was working in the kitchen every weekend. He was disciplined and woke up early. In a family business, everyone helps out, and John liked seeing Gary work.

Gary was not very good at school, but he was great in the kitchen. By 15, he was as skilled as the adult cooks and sometimes was in charge. He could make over a hundred meals. John knew Gary would work in catering because he had talent. When Gary needed work experience for school, John sent him to a friend’s restaurant.

Recently, Gary started playing the drums and has his own band. John worries about what will happen to Gary’s cooking if the music becomes successful. He advised Gary to focus on one thing at a time. John told him that if he wanted to succeed, he needed to do it by age 30. If not, it might be too late.

At 17, Gary went to catering college. On his first day, he finished his work quickly and even helped other students. Everyone is surprised by how successful Gary’s TV cooking show has become. John is very proud of him. He always tells Gary that to get what you want, you must work hard because no one gives you anything. Gary has seen his chance and worked hard for it. John believes that even if children only remember a little of what you say, it is still good. He thinks Gary must have listened sometimes."
FCE_7,"**Text: Finding a Flat in Dublin**

Finding a good flat in Dublin that you can afford is very hard. The best way to find one is through friends. If you know someone who knows someone who is moving out, that can help. But if, like Jo, you just arrived in Dublin, you don’t have any friends to help you. Jo had to stay in a hostel and look for a flat. For Jo, Dublin was a big unknown place. She felt nervous when she got on the train to go there for work. She didn’t think about why she was going. Everyone at her school thought she would leave her small town. They wanted to go to new places and have exciting lives. Some of her classmates went to towns like Ennis or Limerick, where family helped them settle in. But Jo was going to Dublin alone.

Jo’s mother thought it would be good for her to stay in the hostel forever. It was run by nuns, so her mother thought she would be safe. Her father hoped the hostel was warm because hostels are often cold. Jo’s sisters, who worked in a hotel, thought she was crazy for staying in a hostel for a whole week. But Jo didn’t know they were talking about her while she answered an ad for a flat in Ringsend. The ad said, ""Own room, own television, share kitchen, bathroom."" It was very close to the post office where she worked, and it seemed perfect. Jo hoped it would be nice and that the people would like her. 

There was no line for this flat because it was not just a flat for rent; it was looking for a third girl to share. The mention of ""own television"" made Jo worry it might be too fancy for her, but the house looked normal. It was a red-brick house with a basement. The flat was upstairs. A cheerful girl with a college scarf was coming down the stairs. ""It’s a bad place,"" she told Jo. ""Both girls are awful."" 

""Oh,"" said Jo and kept climbing the stairs. ""Hello,"" said the girl with ""Nessa"" on her T-shirt. ""Did you see that stuck-up girl leaving? I can’t stand her."" 

""What did she do?"" Jo asked. 

""She didn’t do anything. She just looked around and made a face, saying, 'Is this all there is? Oh dear, oh dear,' in a posh voice. We don’t want her here, do we, Pauline?"" 

Pauline had a very colorful shirt and bright hair. Jo thought she looked like a punk. She had seen punks on O'Connell Street but never talked to one before. 

""I’m Jo, I work in the post office and I called about the flat."" 

Nessa said they were about to have tea. She got three mugs; one said ""Nessa,"" one said ""Pauline,"" and the last one said ""Other."" ""We’ll put your name on a mug if you come to stay,"" she said kindly."
FCE_43,"**Text: Behind the Dolphin's Smile**

People love dolphins. We go to see them in seaside places, movies, and TV shows. But according to the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society, dolphins are in trouble. Mark Simmonds talks about the decline of dolphins.

Dolphins are special to us. They are very smart animals, they can feel human emotions, and they make us dream of freedom in the ocean. This love for dolphins has grown because of TV shows. First, there was Flipper, and now there is Darwin from Seaquest. However, these happy images hide the real problems dolphins face in dirty and overfished seas.

The number of North Sea harbour porpoises (a type of dolphin) has dropped by up to 89,000. You might think that such popular animals are protected by law and cared for in special marine areas. But this is not true, and the lack of protection may lead to a big wildlife disaster.

There are forty different types of dolphins in the world. In northern Europe, the most common dolphins are the striped dolphin, the common dolphin, the bottlenose dolphin, and the smaller harbour porpoise. The striped and common dolphins usually live far out in the sea. We see them only in small groups, and we know very little about them. Bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises used to be seen near European coasts. Bottlenose dolphins are very social and were often found along the Channel coast and in rivers in Britain, like the Thames. Now, they can only be found in a few places, like the Moray Firth in Scotland and Cardigan Bay in Wales. The few that are left show signs of stress.

It is hard to know exactly why dolphin numbers are going down. Overfishing is taking away many fish from the sea, which also affects dolphins and porpoises. Porpoises need to find food quickly. If fish are taken from one area, they may not have enough time to find food in another area. They can also get caught in fishermen's nets, which they cannot see. In modern fishing, large nets are often left in the water or pulled quickly through the sea. Recently, many dead dolphins have been found on the beaches of France and Cornwall. Marks and cuts on their bodies show that they died because they were caught in these nets.

Pollution in the sea can also harm dolphins. For example, pesticides can build up in their bodies. Female dolphins can pass these poisons to their babies through their milk. There is already one case of a young dolphin dying from its mother’s poisoned milk.

Another big problem for dolphins is noise from humans. Dolphins live in groups and use sound to understand their world. In the sea, noise travels much better than in the air. This noise pollution from ships and oil wells may disturb dolphins in ways we do not yet know."
FCE_51,"**Getting Fit**

Exercise is very important for your mind, body, and spirit. It helps you feel balanced, especially when life feels busy and stressful. Many articles talk about fitness because it is really good for you. There are many reasons to exercise, and very few reasons not to.

Exercise helps your muscles and can change your body shape. It makes your muscles stronger and helps you stand and sit better. It can also help prevent injuries. Exercise can improve areas like your thighs, stomach, and arms. It is good for your heart, lungs, and blood flow.

You may have heard these reasons before, but here is something new: exercise can help with feelings of sadness and tiredness. It can also help you sleep better and reduce stress. Exercise can even help with some health problems. 

If you are not convinced yet, remember that exercise is good for you. There are many types of exercise you can try, like aerobics, jogging, or using weights. Be careful not to train too hard or lift too much weight, as this can cause injuries. If you are unsure, ask your doctor what is best for you.

Good posture is important. It affects how you look and feel. If you slouch, try to imagine a balloon pulling you up. This can help you stand taller and breathe better. Good posture also makes your body look slimmer.

Stretching is also important. It helps you move better and keeps your muscles from getting hurt. If you stretch four or five times a week, you will feel more flexible and fit. Stretching should be done slowly and carefully.

A good exercise routine includes warming up, stretching, working out, and cooling down."
FCE_11,"**IN THEIR NATURAL HABITAT**

What makes film-makers Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman stay away from home for many months? They are looking for the perfect shot. In the jungles and plains of East Africa, it is not easy to find producer Amanda Barrett and cameraman Owen Newman. Right now, they are in the Ngorongoro Crater, which has had six months of almost non-stop rain. This has caused some problems. Newman said they had to buy a special piece of equipment so that if one of their vehicles gets stuck in the mud, Amanda can pull him back to safety. Their teamwork has made some of the best wildlife films on TV, like their popular film about leopards. While this film was being shown, they were already back in the field, looking for another shy animal, the jackal.

Traveling film-makers have been moving around the world to film wild animals since television started. I talked to Newman about his work with Amanda while he was at a safari lodge, having a rare break with other people. ""We do have some arguments, but we get over them quickly,"" he said about his partner. They do not see one another as the leader. Newman believes they work well together because they both understand the animals in a similar way. ""When we travel, we set up our tents each night. But now we have a more fixed camp. We leave at 5 a.m. each morning, so we make tea the night before and keep it warm in a flask."" Their daily meals are pre-packed and heated by whoever is available. ""We can be out for up to eight weeks, so cooking can be a bit stressful,"" Newman said. 

It can be a tough life, but being in remote areas allows them to get close to the animals. Newman remembers filming a family of lions. One lioness would often go off alone, but when she returned, she would greet all the other lions and even their car. 

Newman first worked with Barrett in 1988 on a film called ""The Great Rift."" Two years later, they began working together to film Arctic foxes. Since then, they have learned to spend four months in one place to gather enough material for each half-hour film. Before they can start filming, they must submit a script for approval. ""Amanda and I have worked well together from the beginning,"" Newman said, ""because we have the same ideas and vision. We want to make a film that shows the true spirit of the place and the animals, and that touches people's hearts. I believe if you can make people feel something, that is better than just making them think."""
FCE_14,"**The Netball Captain**

In our series about women in sports, Suzie Ellis met England's netball captain, Kendra Slawinski. Kendra is the captain of the England netball team. When I met her, she had a busy day. She taught at a local school and then trained in a supermarket car park. I was surprised to hear about her training place. I asked her, ""Don't you get strange looks?"" She replied, ""I focus on my movements and my feet, so I don’t see much else. I might notice cars slowing down, but that’s all.""

Kendra said, ""My whole life is about being my best for the Championships."" She follows a strict schedule to be fit. This is her fourth World Championships, and it will be the biggest one yet, with 27 countries taking part. ""We will have home support, which is special,"" she said. ""It is important to improve the reputation of netball in our country. There will be more pressure because we are playing at home. People expect us to start well.""

Their first game is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. Kendra said, ""We have always beaten them, but they will be exciting to play. They are very skilled."" The England team is currently ranked fourth in the world. Kendra explained that the Championships will be tough. ""You must push yourself to play every day. There is no rest between games. In a series, you can lose the first game and still win. But in the Championships, you have only one chance.""

In the fifteen years she has played at a high level, the sport has become harder and faster. Players are more aggressive. Kendra said, ""You don’t train hard to lose."" But after the game, everyone is friendly. 

Netball is also using more science for fitness testing. Kendra said, ""It is important that we think and train like world-class players."" As captain, she believes it is important to have a strong mind and lead by example. ""I support and encourage my team,"" she said.

Kendra has planned her netball career carefully. She decided that this competition would be her last as a player. She may coach young players in the future, but now she is focused on her last big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she might have a tear in her eye. Her loyal supporters will be with her every step of the way."
FCE_63,"**Text: In Hot Water**

Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends a lot of time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She teaches and does research about marine geochemistry, which means she studies the chemicals in the sea. Rachel works at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she is not teaching, she goes into a small steel vehicle to dive three kilometres down into the ocean to study underwater volcanoes.

Inside the vehicle, space is very small. Rachel can touch the two pilots. They cannot stand up or move around, and they must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last for 16 hours. It takes three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours to collect rock and water samples, and three hours to come back up to the surface.

If there is a problem and they need to get to the top quickly, they can press a panic button. This makes a small escape vessel come out, and it goes quickly to the surface. No one has tested it yet, but Rachel thinks it would not be a nice journey.

Rachel remembers her first time in the vehicle. She got in with an instructor who explained what to do in an emergency, like if the pilot had a heart attack. They wanted to see how she would react in such a small space. Now, Rachel has made six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian team. They went to a place five days away from the Canary Islands in the Atlantic. There, they found many underwater volcanoes that blow out black smoke. The Russian team was leaving some equipment to study a project that would make a hole 150 metres through a volcano.

When Rachel is not at sea, she is in her office at the Oceanography Centre. Two-thirds of her salary comes from teaching, which she loves, but she also wants to do research on ""black smokers."" This is another name for underwater volcanoes, where hot water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke. This water comes out very quickly and is very hot, at 350 degrees.

The only time Rachel felt scared was when she dived with an American team. They were using a 50-metre rope when suddenly there was an explosion. There was a loud bang, and Rachel thought she was going to die. They waited in silence, and when nothing happened, they felt a huge relief.

Diving to the deepest part of the ocean is an adventure. Every time Rachel looks out of the porthole and sees the chimneys, she feels amazed. She knows that no one else has seen them before. Rachel studied black smokers for three years for her Ph.D. When she finally saw them in real life, it was an incredible feeling."
FCE_56,"**Interview Tips**

First impressions are very important. Studies show that people make opinions about us in the first few minutes of meeting. They notice how we dress, our eye contact, our body movements, how fast or slow we talk, our voice volume and tone, and our words.

Mary Pearce wanted to be a teacher. She worked hard to earn her degree. When she graduated, she felt very confident. She applied for a job at a nearby primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher. That morning, she saw a small hole in her jacket. She thought about changing, but she knew it would make her late. She believes it is important to be on time. Mary did not get the job. A friend who teaches at the school told her that the Head Teacher said, ""If someone does not take the time to look their best at an interview, what kind of teacher will they be?""

Simon Grant, a hotel manager, says, ""People who look like they care about themselves are more likely to care about their jobs. People think what is inside is important, but in an interview, you should try to look your best.""

Many people do not understand how important a professional image is. For example, Janet Goodwood worked for ten years as an administrative assistant in a big accounting firm. When the office manager retired, she applied for the job but did not get an interview. She thought it was a mistake and asked the Director of Personnel what happened. He told her she did not fit the image of an office manager and suggested she improve her wardrobe before applying again. She was shocked because she does a very good job, and she thought how she dresses should not matter.

Movement and gestures also affect how an interviewer sees a candidate. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian found that 7% of our message comes from the words we use, 38% from our voice, and 55% from our facial expressions. If our facial expressions and words send different messages, the listener will pay more attention to the non-verbal message. So, make sure your words match your body language. Mixed messages can confuse the interviewer.

It is also important not to seem too desperate for the job or too eager to please. When Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, applied for a promotion, her interview went very well, and she was offered the job right away. She was very happy but showed too much excitement. The boss saw how excited she was and offered her a lower salary than she wanted. She thinks she could have gotten more if she had controlled her excitement.

Finally, what we say and how we say it can help us succeed in an interview. David Artesio, a manager of an employment agency, suggests learning about the company before the interview. For example, the annual report will tell you about what the company does. Mention something that interests you during the interview. This will show your interest in the company.

Business consultant Marian Woodall suggests having a few questions ready and avoiding long, confusing sentences. She says, ""Poor communicators talk in long paragraphs. Successful communicators talk in short sentences and key points."""

**The Farmer**  
Matt Froggatt used to work as an insurance agent in London, but now he runs a sheep farm. He says, ""After 14 years in the city, I found it was no longer fun to work there. I wanted to stay for five or ten more years, but then I lost my job suddenly. I did not get a lot of money, but it was enough to start my farm. I met the head chef of a local hotel, which is one of the best in the country. By supplying them with meat, my reputation grew, and now I also sell meat by mail order. I am happy to be out of the office, but I still work long hours, about 80 to 90 a week, and I am still selling a product.""

**The Painter**  
Ron Able White was a manager in advertising, but now he is an artist. He says, ""I started painting as a hobby, but I enjoyed it much more than my job. It made sense to leave my job and become an artist. A career counselor helped me a lot. I think I was the first person to tell him, 'I don’t want to go back to my old job.' He was surprised because most people in their forties need to find work quickly for money. My wife and I got married young, and our children are grown, so we could take this chance. We moved to the north of England, where we did not know anyone. We left our friends, but we are lucky that they still visit us.""

**The Hat Maker**  
Katherine Goodison worked as a lawyer for five years before starting her own hat business in her London flat. She says, ""Being a lawyer was fun and I earned a lot of money, but I worked too many hours. I did not want to become a senior partner and work even more, so I left. Many people said I would get bored, but I never did. I have deadlines to keep me busy. In fashion, there are always new collections and designs to work on, so I have a lot to do. I feel happier now and less stressed. I do miss talking to colleagues. I love that I am responsible for my work. If I do a bad job, I am the one to blame. When I worked for a company, I cared, but now I care even more because my name is on everything.""

**The Masseur**  
Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16 years before becoming a masseur at the Life Centre in London. He says, ""I worked in finance from the age of 22, making deals. I liked the excitement, but I did not find it rewarding. I almost lost my job in 1989, but I left and traveled for a year. During that year, I thought about what I wanted to do. I was interested in health, so I visited many gyms and talked to the owners about how they started. I knew I needed qualifications to change my career, so I took courses in massage. Then I got a part-time job at the Life Centre. I have no regrets. I feel in control now, and I have peace of mind. That is the best part."""
FCE_6,"**Text: 'Dedicated to their sports'**

**Four young sports stars talk about their lives.**

**A Darius (runner)**  
I have always liked sports. I played many sports, but I was best at football and athletics. When I was 14, I tried out for a professional football club, but I chose to focus on athletics instead. My best moment was when I competed for my country in the youth team and won a medal. Unfortunately, not many people noticed, which was disappointing. I hoped to get some sponsorship because training is expensive. I train at home all winter and then go to Florida for three weeks before the season starts. It is fun there because the athletics facilities are great and the nightlife is exciting. But I have to be very disciplined. If my friends ask me to go out the night before training, I have to say no. I wish I could go, but being dedicated helps me in this sport. My main goal is to get to the next Olympics - that would be amazing.

**B Gabriel (surfer)**  
The surfing community is small, so I meet the same people at competitions. Professional surfers are serious, and the best waves are in the morning, so I have to skip late-night parties. I don’t mind too much, but I love sleeping in, and I usually have to give that up too. But it is worth it because without dedication, I might not have won the National Championships last year. After a win, I always celebrate with a big night out, and if I win money, I go somewhere nice. Winning that championship helped me get a chance to present a surfing show on TV. Now, I guess I am a bit of a celebrity.

**C Dieter (yacht racer)**  
When I am on a boat with my friends, we have a lot of fun. We are traditional and always celebrate a win in style. Some people say we act a bit childish, but we do not look for media attention. Sometimes, reporters care more about our celebrations than our race results. I am away for eight months a year, so it is nice to come back and hang out with my friends who do different things. You cannot always focus on the sport; it is not healthy. I am known in sailing, but I am not recognized much in the street. I would not like to be a celebrity. I get nice letters from fans who want signed pictures, and I reply to every one, even if it takes time.

**D Tomas (tennis player)**  
It feels great to walk on the court and feel the crowd cheering for me. At my last tournament, it got a bit crazy with many people around. I enjoy being recognized by fans when I am out shopping. But it has some problems. My last girlfriend did not like it when I got too much attention from female fans. Tennis players travel a lot, and that is why we broke up. It was hard, but you have to make sacrifices in sports; you need to be serious and professional. It does not bother me too much. I want to focus on my game now and enjoy other things in life after I retire, because that happens early in this sport."

Shopping in a supermarket with children can be very hard for parents. One mother says, ""They want everything they see. If it’s not the newest sugary cereal, it’s a Disney video or a comic. Usually, they want all three. I can’t buy everything, and if I give in to their requests, I feel bad about buying unhealthy food. I don’t like saying no all the time, and I get worried before we go shopping. I try to avoid taking them shopping, but I also think they need to learn how to make their own choices. I feel stuck.""

Research shows that children ask for something to buy every two minutes when they go shopping. More than £150 million a year is spent on advertising for children, mostly on TV. This amount is likely to grow, and supermarkets are a big place for this advertising. Children often do not understand why their parents say no to certain things, especially when they see fun ads on TV.

Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, ""Most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, but these ideas are not always right. It is good for parents and children to talk about food. If children only hear about products from TV ads, they get a one-sided view. Parents feel frustrated because they have to compete with ads and often disappoint their children.""

The Independent Television Commission, which controls TV ads, does not allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy things. But Dibb says, ""The goal of advertising is to make people want to buy something. So even if they cannot say, 'Tell your mom to buy this,' that is still the effect.""

Shopping with children can be stressful for parents because they have to decide which requests to agree to and which to refuse. One mother says she talks about food with her children, but she feels unhappy about how she handles their requests: ""My son listens to ads but is critical of them. We talk a lot about different products and look at labels. I have talked so much that he thinks all ads are bad. Now, we have less conflict in the supermarket because the children don’t ask for things I don’t want to buy.""

Parents also admit they are not always consistent with their children’s requests. Mike, a father of a seven-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter, says, ""We don’t buy him the sweets he wants because they are bad for him, but we buy double cream and chocolate for ourselves. It is nice to buy good things, and it is normal for children to want to share that. But I still get annoyed by their requests. It depends on how I feel. If I am in a good mood, I am more likely to say yes. It is hard to be consistent.""

Supermarkets could help reduce the conflict between parents and children by removing sweets from checkout areas or providing play areas. Even if parents spend less money without their children, the idea of shopping without their children’s demands might attract more customers."

The Merrion Hotel is a new five-star hotel in Dublin. It took almost two years to change four old houses into this hotel. The hotel has the latest technology to help both the staff and the guests.

Peter MacCann is the General Manager. He wants his staff to know the guests' names. For more details about what guests like, he uses a computer system. This system helps the hotel give special service to returning guests. It cost £250,000 to set up, but MacCann believes it will be worth it over time. He likes how well it works and the services it provides. For example, if a guest asks for certain music CDs during their first stay, those CDs will be ready for them when they come back.

Many hotel guests often complain about room temperature. The hotel has a system that lets guests change the temperature in their rooms. They can adjust it by three degrees around the normal 18°C. The front desk can also change the temperature from 14°C to 25°C.

Business guests will find many useful technologies in their rooms. MacCann thinks that about 65% of the hotel’s business will come from these guests. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that can also copy and print, and a video-conferencing system. The hotel is ready for future technology changes. They have added extra cables for new technology. They rent televisions so they can replace them with newer models when needed. DVD recorders can also be updated.

Even with all this technology, MacCann wants guests to feel comfortable. The hotel has 145 large and well-furnished bedrooms that are cozy and welcoming. There is also a swimming pool, a gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a beautiful garden.

The food at the hotel is very important. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, who has two Michelin stars, has moved his restaurant to the Merrion. He has designed a new kitchen and improved it. The hotel has better parking than before. This helps the hotel offer a great place to eat without financial risks. With good technology and a skilled staff, the Merrion Hotel is likely to be very successful."

Emma Marsden asked six women how they get their energy in life.

A. **Jeanette Kupfermann, Journalist and Author:** ""I get my energy from excitement. I like to do things that are challenging. When I learn something new, I feel very energetic. I also get energy from rhythm. Right now, I am learning flamenco dancing. Dance is fun and gives me energy. If I am bored, I feel tired. Doing something useful, even a little, gives me energy.""

B. **Linda Kelsey, Magazine Editor:** ""I have a lot of work, but I enjoy it. I love my job, so it does not feel hard. If you like what you do, you don’t feel sad, even if you are tired. I need a good amount of sleep. When I sleep six hours a night, I feel a bit tired. I know exercise gives me energy, but I need to find the energy to do it! I go to a yoga class once a week and try to exercise at home. After I exercise, I feel much better. I often feel low in the afternoon, so I think it’s good to eat something then.""

C. **Annie Nightingale, Disc Jockey:** ""I don’t eat very healthily for energy. I think my energy comes from being positive and enthusiastic. I don’t like negative people. I believe we should enjoy life. Enjoyment is important. I love my job, and the last two years have been exciting. I work with many lively young people, which gives me energy. I like taking photos, but I’m not sure if I’m good at it. I also write words for fun, like imaginary songs, when I travel.""

D. **Floella Benjamin, Author and TV Presenter:** ""My energy comes from doing things I enjoy. I believe in what I do, both at work and at home. Being positive helps me. I love working with kids because they are full of energy. Energy is like a natural feeling that comes from talking to others. Smiling at people makes me feel good. I try to eat healthily and don’t smoke or drink, but I don’t have a special exercise plan. I get my energy from playing with kids.""

E. **Deborah Moggach, Author and Playwright:** ""I love making a garden from nothing. I once turned a concrete area into a garden by breaking the concrete and adding soil. This gives me more energy than exercise. I also feel energized when I know someone wants to read my writing. I enjoy sneaking into a farmer's land or a forest. If someone sees me, I say, 'Oh, what a lovely place! I didn’t know it was private.' I like this because it feels playful.""

F. **Katherine Monblot, Therapist:** ""I think it is important to care about what you do in life. I like to take risks and get bored easily, which keeps me motivated. Doing things I don’t want to do makes me tired. I used to be part of many committees, but I didn’t like the time they took. You have a limited amount of energy, so use it for what is most important to you."""
FCE_45,"**ICE SKATING**

Ice skating has a history of thousands of years. Archaeologists have found skates made from animal bones. These bone skates were used until iron skates were made in Scandinavia around the year 200 AD. In Scandinavia, skating was an important skill for the upper classes. 

In the early 1900s, skating was seen as stylish, but in 1924, an 11-year-old girl named Sonja Henie changed this. She made skating more athletic and popular. Today, skating combines art and sports. It is both beautiful and physically challenging. 

For beginners, balance and control are very important. You can only go faster when you get better. The way you position your body helps with balance. Keep your legs slightly bent and your knees relaxed. Your body should lean a little forward. 

Relaxation is very important for skating. To start, your heels should almost touch, and your feet should point outwards. When you push with your back foot, make a small movement with the other foot. If you practice this, you can slowly make bigger movements as you get better. 

Learning how to fall is one of the first skills a skater needs. Even professional skaters fall. To fall safely, stay relaxed. This helps reduce the impact when you hit the ice. To get up, use your hands to kneel, then stand up. 

Once you can move confidently on the ice, you can try different styles like figure skating, freestyle, distance skating, speed skating, and skating in pairs. It is best to start with figure skating and then learn freestyle. 

With good instruction at ice rinks, you can quickly learn the basic moves. You will see that good skaters are relaxed and move easily. To skate well, you should practice exercises regularly. It can be dangerous to skate when your body is stiff, so warm-up exercises are important. Focus on your legs, back, shoulders, ankles, and knees. After skating, do the same exercises to avoid stiffness. 

Skating helps improve balance, coordination, relaxation, and movement. It also helps your heart and lungs and makes your body stronger. When combined with swimming or jogging, skating is a great way to stay healthy and fit."

If you want to see something that makes people cry happy tears, it is a talented child winning a medal. Julia Gregson asked three young stars and their mothers to talk about their lives.

A. Annika Reeder, 15, won a gold medal for gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games. She wants to be a physiotherapist and compete in the next Olympics. ""The training is very hard right now. I don’t have time to watch TV, go out with friends, or do much besides gymnastics and school. I try to take it one day at a time. When I feel very tired, my coach sometimes gives me a day off, but usually, I keep going. You can’t take too many days off because it makes you stiff.""

B. Annika's mother said, ""From a young age, Annika showed great talent. I have seen some parents push their children, but it doesn’t work. To perform at Annika's level takes a lot of time and energy. You have to want to do it yourself. People say we, as parents, have given up a lot, but they don’t see what the sport has given us. We love it and what it has done for Annika. Before gymnastics, she was a shy girl who hid behind me, but now she has friends from all over the world and is very confident.""

C. Sarah Stokes started show-jumping at ten years old. Since then, she has won the British National Championship. ""It’s good that my parents like show-jumping because they train me and take me everywhere in the horse box. The shows can last from one to five days. I never get tired of it; I love show-jumping. Even if my parents were not there, I would still do it because I am very determined. I am happy when they are proud of me, but I do it for myself. This year, I want to qualify for the British young riders (under-18) team. My big dream is to win a gold medal at the Olympics.""

D. Sarah's mother said, ""From the moment Sarah sat on a horse at age 1, I knew she loved it. When she was 5, she would wake up early to exercise her pony. To qualify for big shows, we have to travel all over England. To save money, we sleep in the horse box. Sarah is very organized. She is always happy on a horse and knows what to do. Watching your child succeed at something they love is amazing.""

E. Jane McShane, 10, is the Under-14 Chess Champion in Britain. ""Tournaments are very friendly. I know everyone, and it is fun. When I play, I don’t concentrate as much as I should. I just look around and don’t think too much. I am not scared of being proud; I don’t talk about my success at school because I don’t like to feel embarrassed.""

F. Jane's mother said, ""Jane played her first game when she was 5. My father said, 'Let’s see if she likes it.' He tried to teach me when I was young, but I was bored. Jane loved it from the start. By the end of that day, she knew all the moves, and by age 6, she was beating adults. When she wins, I am happy, but if she wanted to stop playing tomorrow, I would support her. I don’t want to hold her back because she is special. If she has this talent, I want her to reach her full potential."""
FCE_29,"**Simplified Text:**

Chris Greener was fourteen years old when he told his teacher he wanted to join the navy. The teacher joked, ""What do you want to be? The flagpole on a ship?"" This was funny because Chris was already almost two meters tall. Today, he is 228 cm tall and is the tallest man in Britain.

Every ten years, people in Europe get a little taller. More tall people are being born, but this does not mean we are becoming a super race. Instead, we are going back to how we were as cavemen. We are now getting better food than before, which is helping us grow taller. Professor Chris Stringer says, ""We are becoming like Cro-Magnons, the people who lived 40,000 years ago.""

For most of human history, our ancestors ate many different foods. Women gathered fruits and herbs, while men hunted animals. They ate from 85 different wild plants. But about 9,000 years ago, farming started, and this changed everything. Now, most of the world's land is used for farming, and three main plants—wheat, rice, and maize—give us more than half of our food. This limited diet has hurt our health. 

In Ohio, scientists found that when people started farming corn, they became sick and underweight. Tooth decay and diseases increased. Even though corn was not good for health, farming spread because it could feed many more people than hunting could. 

Today, many people are still not getting enough good food, but in Europe, the US, and Japan, diets are getting better. Now, the average man in the US is 179 cm tall, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. This is a good change, but there are still problems. Beds have not gotten longer since 1860, and there is less room for legs on planes and trains. Clothes companies have to change their sizes often.

The question is: how tall can we get? Some scientists think we might reach a height of 193 cm this century. However, while some people are getting taller because of better food, as a whole, humans are actually getting smaller. 

10,000 years ago, during the last ice age, people were a bit rounder and taller to keep warm. Now that the climate is warmer, we seem to be getting thinner and shorter, even with good food. As the planet gets hotter, we might get even smaller. So, the growth of humans could be affected by global warming. 

**Questions:**

1. How tall is Chris Greener?
2. What did Chris want to be when he grew up?
3. What are the three main plants that provide most of our food today?
4. What happened to people's health when they started farming corn?
5. In which countries are diets getting better?"
FCE_57,"**Text: Studio Audiences**

What is it like to be in the audience when a television show is being made? Cosmo Landesman found out. Studio audiences are a common part of television, but many people do not understand them. When we watch game shows, we see the audience getting excited and wonder, ""Who are these people?""

Some people think that studio audiences are not important. They say that even people who work in television do not respect them. I thought that studio audiences were just made up of silly people who wanted to be on TV. But there is no typical studio audience. They come from different backgrounds and jobs. Television wants to attract different people for different shows.

Many people who watch TV at home do not understand why anyone would want to be in a studio audience. Why would someone apply for tickets, travel far, and sit for a long time in a studio just to watch what they can see at home? One idea is that people hope to be on TV for a moment. I did not believe this until I talked to Angela. She said, ""I came because it was a chance to be on television.""

Another idea is that people are curious to see how a show is made. But the most common reason I heard was, ""A friend gave me a ticket."" Most of us have never been in a studio audience, but we think we know what it is like. You sit close to strangers while someone shows cards that say APPLAUD or LAUGH, and you clap or laugh when you see them. This is true for some shows, but not all. One studio manager said, ""We believe a show should be good enough not to need these signs.""

Is there a real difference between being in a studio and watching TV at home? For Claire, being in a studio is ""more exciting."" Charlotte liked being part of live television. She said, ""Last year I saw my favorite comedian. When you watch him at home, you miss a lot."" What I missed was seeing the live actors. I could only see the back of someone’s head. The opening scenes were far from where I sat, so I ended up watching the show on a monitor.

Going to a studio may not be the best way to watch television, but that is not what matters. For most people in the audience, it was just fun and a free night of entertainment."

I do not like wild landscapes. I like places with people. When I travel, I enjoy lovely villages with old temples, not empty deserts. When I was eight, I went to school in England. On Saturdays, I would ride my bike to the village of Lastingham in its beautiful valley. Cycling helped me relax from school. I loved exploring the hills, valleys, and old villages. I am from Scotland, so the landscape felt familiar but also different. I still visit there today. I wrote about my adventures in my diary. This was my first try at travel writing, which I later became known for.

**Sophia**  
There is a small train that goes from Hythe to Dungeness, run by volunteers. I always travel first class because it is not much more expensive than regular tickets. The view is not amazing. The train goes across Romney Marsh with its sheep and next to a canal. But there is one part of the journey I always look forward to - when the train goes through back gardens. For a few moments, we see people doing everyday things, like making tea or folding a chair. I see myself in their eyes, a woman in a small train, looking into their homes. I like the simple landscape of fields, sheep, and a distant grey sea. It makes me look closely for something new.

The Hartland Peninsula is a quiet and beautiful coast. The beaches are hard to reach and have many rocks, so there are not many people here. A few brave surfers come, but most visitors enjoy the beauty of the sea. This coast faces the Atlantic and is known for shipwrecks. There are walking paths along the coast that you can combine with trips into beautiful valleys with oak trees, ferns, and wildflowers. We stay in a simple place with a family in the village of Southole.

**Annette**  
My favorite place in England is the Trough of Bowland. It is a wide-open moorland, perfect for hiking. There are not many people living there or visiting. It is a quiet and remote area, and I like the feeling of space. I found this place by chance when I was a student, and I visit every year, either alone, with my boyfriend, or now with my son. It has not changed much since my first visit. Having a child makes these visits special. It makes me sad that he is growing up in a city.

**James**  
I bought Glenthorne, my favorite house in Britain. I wanted peace and to reconnect with my English roots. I grew up in what is now Sri Lanka, but at twelve, I went to school in Devon, in the west of England. I used to ride my bike around the moors and village streets. There was a story about a place we would never cycle past: if you went down the driveway, you would never return. That place was Glenthorne. It is my dream place. It is a magical, quiet, romantic house. You can only hear the sea, wind, and birds."

We are 'animal people' who love all kinds of animals. One afternoon, my daughter called me at work. She was excited because she found a wonderful pine snake. ""Can we keep him?"" she asked. I said, ""Yes, but only for one night."" We had a special tank for animals that come to visit us for a short time. 

I got home late. I quickly put a pot on the stove to boil. Suddenly, I heard my sons screaming, ""Oh, Mother! Help! Do something!"" I ran to their bedroom. The problem was with Domino the cat and Bianca the white mouse, which was a Mother's Day gift for me. Domino had the mouse in his mouth and was running around the room. He was trying to find a way out while avoiding the kids' arms.

I jumped into the room and tripped over something. I fell on the floor. I saw the snake escaping from the table and slithering all over the floor. The snake was moving fast, and the kids were jumping around, screaming. The dog was barking loudly. The pot on the stove boiled over, and I ran to turn it off. 

I caught Domino by the tail and saved the small, wet mouse from his mouth. The same mouse was caught by Domino three more times but lived a long life. After saving the mouse, I looked at the snake. It seemed strong and had no weak points. I sat on the floor like a snake-charmer, moving back and forth. Slowly, the snake relaxed and rested its head on its body. 

I carefully lifted the snake and stood up. I walked to the end of the garden and pointed the snake towards a tree, hoping it would be happy there. When I let go of the snake's head, it surprised me by sliding over my shoulders like a colorful shawl. 

We stood together in the evening light: four young children, Mum, and the snake. My oldest child, DJ, said, ""Mum, you are nice and warm, and the shed is not."" I asked the children to help me encourage the snake to move on. Slowly, it climbed up the wall and disappeared over the roof. As the last part of the snake's tail went away, my three-year-old son Clay sighed and said, ""Boy, that was one big snake!"""

In our fast world with phones and computers, writing letters is becoming rare. But for me, getting a letter is special. There is excitement when a letter arrives, joy in seeing who sent it, and happiness in reading it. Writing letters has been part of my life for a long time. It started with little notes to my mother. She always made me write thank-you letters for gifts, no matter how short or messy they were.

When I left home at 18 to study in London, I wrote to my mother every week, and she wrote back. Sometimes my father wrote too, and I loved his funny letters. Most letters from home talked about everyday life with my parents and their friends. We also called each other, but I remember the letters more.

I also received letters from my boyfriends. Many of them had to work or study far away, so we kept in touch by writing. Writing letters helped our relationships. I found it easier to express my feelings in writing than by talking. I enjoy letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. Notes are nice, but it’s even better to get news from a whole year! I love getting letters in airmail envelopes with pretty stamps.

I get letters from friends in different countries. One friend is in Sri Lanka, and I have penfriends in Australia and Vancouver. There is also a lady in France who writes to me. We started talking in a restaurant while on holiday. If I hadn’t asked for her address, I would not have been able to write to her. Luckily, she replied, and now we write to each other regularly. I can practice my French with her, and we have visited each other.

My best letter-writing moment was this summer when my family and I visited my American penfriend in Texas. We had been writing to each other for 29 years but had never met. Everyone was surprised that we kept in touch for so long. The local newspaper even wrote about us!

I am happy that my children are also writing letters. Like my mother, I make them write their own thank-you letters. My daughter writes me little letters, just like I did for my mother. She and my son have penfriends in Texas, set up by my penfriend. I encourage everyone not to let letter writing become a lost art."

**Careless Tourists Damage Ancient Rock Art**

Many ancient pictures carved into the rocks in France are being damaged. There are about 36,000 drawings on rocks in Mont Bego in the French Alps. Scientists are worried that these drawings will not last for future generations. The mountain has drawings that are 4,000 years old. They show cows, fields, and different gods and goddesses. 

More and more tourists visit the site, but some of them are ruining the pictures by writing on them. Jean Clottes, who is the chairman of the International Committee on Rock Art, says, ""People think these pictures will always be here. But if the damage continues, there will be nothing left in 50 years."" He has seen tourists stepping on the drawings and damaging them. Some visitors even take pieces of the rock home as souvenirs. 

When tourists cannot take a good photo, they rub the drawings to make them clearer. The weather makes the drawings smooth, but when the sun shines, some visitors rub them to see them better. Some people even bring sticks to scratch their own drawings or names into the rocks.

Experts have different ideas about how to protect the drawings. Henry de Lumley, who is the director of the Museum of Natural History in Paris, thinks the best way to save the site is to make it a ""no-go"" area. This means only guided tours would be allowed. He believes that if we do not protect the site, it will be destroyed, and important research will stop. 

Clottes disagrees with this idea. He says it is too strict and will upset local people. The site was made a historic monument by the Ministry of Culture, and we should do our best to save it. 

David Lavergne, a regional architect, also wants to keep the site open. He thinks that it is hard to stop visitors from damaging it because the area is very big. He would like everyone to see it, but there is not enough money to hire guards. They might have to charge a fee to visit. 

Annie Echassoux, who has also studied the site, is worried that it will be damaged more as it becomes easier for tourists to visit. She believes the best solution is to block off the area and have guides. She says, ""We need to find money because this area is a historic site. If we do not act, we will lose the drawings for future generations.""

1. How many drawings are there in Mont Bego?

This amount is likely to grow, and supermarkets are a big place for this advertising. Children often do not understand why their parents say no to certain things.

Climbers used to go to the mountains to climb. Now, people can climb indoors or outdoors. The crowd is excited. High above them on a climbing wall is the French climber, Francois Lombard. He is in the World Cup Climbing Championships at the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham. This arena is also known for the TV show Gladiators, but both events have one thing in common - The Wall.

In the past, climbers practiced on cliffs where there were good places to climb. In winter, they had to deal with cold weather, go for walks, or climb on snow and ice in Scotland. As climbing became more popular, it was important for climbers to stay fit. Since they could not use cliffs for much of the year, they started to climb on brick edges or stone buildings. This helped them keep their fingers strong and avoid boredom.

Soon, many sports centers built climbing walls using special bricks. One of the first climbing walls was made by Don Robinson, a physical education teacher, in the mid-1960s at Leeds University. He created a wall with natural rock set in concrete. Many climbing walls like this were built in sports halls in the 1970s, but they had problems. These walls were only straight up and down, while real cliffs have different shapes like overhangs.

In 1985, a Frenchman named Francois Savigny made a new material that looked like the shapes on cliffs. This material could be attached to any wall and removed when climbers wanted something new. French companies also started to use steel frames to build climbing walls. Steel was lighter than concrete, so they could make overhanging walls without a lot of construction. This system allowed climbers to have many different holds to use."

Do you want to be an actor? If you tell someone this, they might say it is a risky job. Acting is indeed a risky career. There are many actors, but not enough jobs for them. When you decide to be an actor, some friends may think you are crazy, but others may support you. Everyone will give you different advice. It is a personal choice, and you are responsible for your own dreams. 

There are no easy ways to become an actor. There are no tests to pass, and finishing your training does not guarantee you will get a job. Success depends on luck and talent. However, there is always a need for new actors, and acting can be exciting and rewarding.

Many people want to know what talent is. Talent is a natural skill and imagination. Imagination is hard to measure. It also depends on a person's courage and belief in what they do. 

Why do people want to act? It can be hard to explain. In theater, the important moment is when the actor connects with the audience. This connection is what motivates actors to perform. 

If you ask successful actors how they did it, they might not know. They understand some things about their skills, but they do not take success for granted. They know they must keep working hard because their fame can change quickly. 

Disappointment is a big challenge for actors. Last month, you might have been without a job, doing other work. Then, you may get a chance to audition for a role. But even if you want the job very much, you might not get it. Because of this, actors often do not talk about their chances of getting a role. They find ways to deal with the stress of competition and the fear of rejection. No one likes to be rejected. 

From the moment you start auditioning, you are saying you are ready and hopefully talented enough for the job. In many ways, it is up to you. If you do not care enough, others may not care about you either."

Chris Greener was fourteen years old when he told his teacher he wanted to join the navy. The teacher joked, ""What do you want to be? The flagpole on a ship?"" This was funny because Chris was already almost two meters tall. Today, he is 228 cm tall, making him the tallest man in Britain.

Every ten years, the average height of people in Europe gets a little taller. More tall people are being born, but this does not mean we are becoming a super race. Instead, we are going back to how we were as cavemen. We are starting to lose the effects of bad diets from the past. Professor Chris Stringer says, ""We are becoming like Cro-Magnons again,"" who lived on Earth 40,000 years ago.

For most of human history, our ancestors ate many different foods. Women gathered fruits and herbs, while men hunted animals. One study found they ate from 85 different wild plants. But about 9,000 years ago, farming started, and this changed everything. Now, most of the world's land is used for farming, and three main plants—wheat, rice, and maize—give more than half of the food we eat today. This limited diet has hurt our health. 

In Ohio, scientists found that when people started farming corn, healthy hunter-gatherers became sick and underweight. Tooth decay and diseases increased. Although corn was thought to be good, it caused health problems. Farming spread because one piece of land could feed many more people than hunting could. 

Today, many people are still not well-nourished, but some countries like those in Europe, the US, and Japan are starting to eat better again. Now, the average man in the US is 179 cm tall, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. This is a good change, but it also brings problems. 

Even though people are getting taller, beds have not changed in size since 1860. Also, there seems to be less space for legs on planes and trains. Clothes companies have to change their sizes often. 

The question is: how tall can we get? Some scientists think we might reach a height of 193 cm this century. However, they also say that while some people are getting taller because of better food, as a group, we might actually be getting shorter. 

10,000 years ago, during the last ice age, people were a bit rounder and taller to keep warm. Now that the climate is warmer, we seem to be getting thinner and shorter, even when we eat well. If the planet keeps getting warmer, we might get even shorter. So, the growth of humans could be affected by global warming. 

**Questions:**

1. How tall is Chris Greener today?
2. What did Chris want to be when he left school?
3. What are the three main plants that provide most of our food today?
4. What happened to hunter-gatherers when they started farming corn?
5. What is the average height of men in the US?"

**The Farmer**  
Matt Froggatt used to work as an insurance agent in London, but now he runs a sheep farm. He says, ""After 14 years in the city, I found it was no longer fun to work there. I wanted to stay for five or ten more years, but then I lost my job suddenly. I did not get a lot of money, but it was enough to start my farm. I met the head chef of a local hotel, which is one of the best in the country. By supplying them with meat, my reputation grew, and now I also sell meat by mail order. I am happy to be out of the office, but I still work long hours, about 80 to 90 a week, and I am still selling a product.""

**The Painter**  
Ron Able White was a manager in advertising, but now he is an artist. He says, ""I started painting as a hobby, but I enjoyed it much more than my job. It made sense to leave my job and become an artist. A career counselor helped me a lot. I think I was the first person to tell him, 'I don’t want to go back to my old job.' He was surprised because most people in their forties need to find work quickly for money. My wife and I got married young, and our children are grown, so we could take this chance. We moved to the north of England, where we did not know anyone. We left our friends, but we are lucky that they still visit us.""

**The Hat Maker**  
Katherine Goodison worked as a lawyer for five years before starting her own hat business in her London flat. She says, ""Being a lawyer was fun and I earned a lot of money, but I worked too many hours. I did not want to become a senior partner and work even more, so I left. Many people said I would get bored, but I never did. I have deadlines to keep me busy. In fashion, there are always new collections and designs to work on, so I have a lot to do. I feel happier now and less stressed. I do miss talking to colleagues. I love that I am responsible for my work. If I do a bad job, I am the one to blame. When I worked for a company, I cared, but now I care even more because my name is on everything.""

**The Masseur**  
Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16 years before becoming a masseur at the Life Centre in London. He says, ""I worked in finance from the age of 22, making deals. I liked the excitement, but I did not find it rewarding. I almost lost my job in 1989, but I left and traveled for a year. During that year, I thought about what I wanted to do. I was interested in health, so I visited many gyms and talked to the owners about how they started. I knew I needed qualifications to change my career, so I took courses in massage. Then I got a part-time job at the Life Centre. I have no regrets. I feel in control now, and I have peace of mind. That is the best part."""
FCE_5,"**Text: A Winning Game**

Two brothers are finding that their childhood game is good for business. Dave and Norm Lagasse, two brothers in their forties, are sitting in their home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA, and playing a game. In front of them is a wooden board with round plastic pieces. They are playing pichenotte, a game they say is special. Their grandfather, Lucien Rajotte, brought the game from Quebec, Canada, to the USA. Soon, the family was playing the game every weekend and holiday, and they had a great time.

The family moved to New Mexico, but they did not forget Grandpa's pichenotte board, which he made from old wooden crates. They continued to play regularly. When visitors came, they were often curious because the game was unknown in southern USA. Three years ago, Dave saw that the old pichenotte board was damaged, so he decided to make a new one. It looked great! A relative saw it and wanted one. Then a friend wanted one too. 

One night, the brothers took one of Dave's new boards to a sports bar in Santa Fe. ""People watched and said, 'No way I'm playing that silly game.' But then they sat down, and soon they could not leave the table!"" When people asked about the game’s origins, Dave did some research. He found that the game probably started in India, where a similar game called 'carroms' is played. This game changed into 'squails' in Britain, and British people brought it to Canada. Pichenotte is the French-Canadian version of the game that developed in Quebec.

Pichenotte can be played by two to four people. Each player has 12 pieces or 'pucks'. They flick the pucks across a round board using their fingers. Flicking a puck into a small hole is worth 20 points. There are three rings around the hole worth 15, 10, and 5 points. The game has eight small posts that are obstacles. The game usually lasts about two minutes.

When the brothers saw how popular the game was at the bar, they made more boards and took them to markets and craft fairs. Many people came to buy them, and the game became more popular. Soon, championships started, and a trophy called the 'Lord Pichenotte Cup' was made. As more people learned about the game, the boards sold quickly. The brothers decided to make pichenotte boards full-time. They set up a workshop in their garage and have made more than 450 boards. Each board is made of birchwood and mahogany, weighs 12kg, and is 1cm thick. Norm says, ""They are very strong and last a long time.""

The boards are sold for $595 each on the brothers' website. There are no professional pichenotte players or TV shows yet, but the brothers hope that one day they will be very successful. For now, they are happy to spend their free time playing the game they love."
FCE_41,"**WELCOME TO THE MODEL VILLAGE**

When you first enter the Model Village, it is hard to believe that a few years ago this was just a piece of empty land, covered with weeds. For many years, people thought this land was useless. One man, with the help of his wife, worked hard to change this land into the beautiful place you see today. 

Many tons of soil and clay were moved to change the flat land into the lovely landscape you see now. Machines like bulldozers helped, but a lot of hard work was also done by hand. After the land was shaped, about 1,000 tons of topsoil were added to create the lawns, flower beds, and rock gardens. 

In the Model Village, hundreds of trees and bushes were planted. These plants were chosen carefully because they needed to survive near the sea and strong winter winds. Most plants came from local garden centers, but some were brought from Canada and New Zealand. 

The village was created by Colin Sims, who made over 100 models by himself over nine years, starting in 1972. The models are made from different materials like stone, concrete, wood, and plastic to last in all kinds of weather. At first, Colin needed help from experts to learn about the materials, but soon he became an expert himself. 

You will see that all the models are made to the same scale and have many small details. This was done with patience and special building techniques. The Model Village is very popular and is known for its high quality and care. The methods used here have been used in other model villages in England and even in some college courses about modeling. 

All the buildings in the village show traditional British styles and are not based on one specific place. One of the most impressive buildings is the Manor House. This is a typical 13th-century stone building with a brick tower and stone walls, based on manor houses found in the West Country. 

As you walk around the village, you will also see the Castle, St Mary's Church, a zoo, and a mini golf course, which is the newest addition. Please stay on the paths during your visit and do not touch the models; if you accidentally break something, it will take us a long time to fix it. You can take photos from the pathways only. Dogs are welcome on a short lead.

To make your visit more enjoyable, you will find buttons in front of some models. Press these buttons to see the models move. At the end of your visit, we would love to hear your comments. We are always planning new models, and your ideas can help us create a more interesting display. We also want to know if any models did not meet your expectations. We are always replacing and updating the models, and we need your help to know which ones need attention.

We hope you enjoy your visit and look forward to seeing you again. Don't forget to tell your friends about it!"

Every week, British tabloid newspapers print pictures that invade people's privacy. These pictures often break the rules that newspaper editors should follow. While some pop stars do take pictures with paparazzi sometimes, this is not common. Usually, it hurts people in the public eye when their private moments are shown on the front page. Very few people ask for help from the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), which was created to handle these problems. These pictures are rarely important for the public. For example, do private photos of pop stars help solve a crime? How does a picture of a famous actress on a hotel balcony help public health and safety? The actress has complained about long-distance photos before. Since she was in a hotel, where people expect privacy, she had a good reason to complain, but she did not take any action. It is a scandal that the PCC did not start an investigation. 

The PCC should also look into a recent story about a pop star's love life. Like the actress, the pop star has not made a formal complaint. Shouldn't the PCC take action on this and other bad stories? This seems like a good idea. It could lead to many decisions against newspapers. Other newspapers would report this, and it would be on TV and radio. The public would not support these newspapers, and editors would have to stop publishing such stories. Photographers would also be affected and might not be able to hide and take pictures of celebrities anymore. 

If the PCC decided to act like a ""police officer,"" there would be some problems. How would it decide to start an investigation? Should it talk to the victim and encourage them to complain? If the person does not want to complain, should the PCC still investigate? Celebrities and royals might expect the PCC to take action when stories are about them, and they might be upset if it does not. The job is too big. How could the PCC watch all of the British press: national, local, and magazines? There is also the problem of embarrassment. Even if someone's privacy is invaded, would they want the embarrassment of an investigation? Most people probably just want to forget about it and move on with their lives. Some might have other reasons to stay quiet. They might have a worse story that they do not want to be public. In this case, the PCC might seem like the enemy.

One British comedian had problems with the press when he and his wife were secretly photographed on their honeymoon. He did not complain then, and he did not complain later when a photographer took pictures of him and his family on vacation. He was afraid that the newspaper would use the pictures again and say he was angry, thinking it was just a joke. This fear is understandable. People think they will be targeted again if they challenge the tabloids. It is hard to find an easy solution to this serious problem.

**Questions:**

1. What do British tabloid newspapers often print?
2. What is the Press Complaints Commission (PCC)?
3. Why did the actress have a good reason to complain?
4. What might happen if the PCC takes action against newspapers?
5. Why did the comedian not complain about the pictures taken of him?"

Many college graduates get advice when they start their first job. This article talks about what to think about when you want to find a second job. We are not talking about people who want a temporary job while looking for a permanent one. We also do not talk about those who leave a job they do not like after a few weeks. Instead, we will help those of you who are ready to take a real step in your career. You have learned some skills and have an idea of what you want to do.

What kind of job should you look for? It depends on your long-term goals. You need to think about whether you want to focus on a specific area, move up to a job with more responsibility, or change to a different field.

If you want to travel, now is a good time to do it. You can work temporarily when you come back and then find your second job. Future employers will be happy to see that you have traveled and are not likely to leave again soon.

Juliette Davidson spent her first year after college working for three lawyers. It was a good first job because they were very supportive. She learned how to work in an office and improved her typing skills. However, there was no chance to move up in the job. One day, she decided to leave, bought a plane ticket, and traveled for a year.

Now, Juliette works as a Personal Assistant to Brenda Cleverdon, the Chief Executive of Business in the Community. She says, ""In two and a half years, I have become more skilled, and my job has really changed. From the start, my boss wanted to help me grow. My job title is the same, but my tasks have changed. I now do most of the letters and budgets. I also answer questions from important people and those who want to start their own business.

Confident people may seem like they were born that way, but most say it is a skill they learned. Nina Hathway asks five people how they became confident.

**A. Jenny**  
When I left school, I was very shy. I thought I would always be shy. When I was about twenty-five, I helped at my daughter's school. I was nervous, but I did well. Someone suggested I take a university course. On my first day, I was very scared, but my confidence grew. Working at the school changed my life.

**B. Michaela**  
Four years ago, my father got sick, and I had to run the family business. I was scared and became too aggressive. I learned that to be confident, you must believe in yourself. If work is too much, I don’t feel guilty if I leave some tasks for the next day. When I face something hard, I remind myself that I have nothing to lose. Fear can make you feel less confident, so I talk to myself to calm down.

**C. Lisa**  
People think I am confident, but I often feel scared. I learned to look confident because it is important in TV. Interviewing people showed me that many of us feel nervous in important situations. My mother gave me good advice when I was a teenager: “Who is looking at you? Everyone is too busy worrying about themselves.” I also believe you gain confidence by facing your fears. I was nervous during my driving test, but I passed. After that, I felt braver.

**D. Barbara**  
I feel confident because I enjoy my work, but I built this confidence over time. If you keep trying and learn from mistakes, you will feel more confident. I work hard and am liked at my restaurant, but not everyone likes me. That’s okay. You must like yourself and not try to be what others want. My company offers training courses, which help me feel better about myself. It is good to set small goals and see your progress.

**E. Kim**  
After college, I worked as a secretary. I often sat in meetings and did not speak up because I was scared. Eventually, I found the confidence to share my ideas. When I started working in politics, I was very nervous about speaking in public. I told myself, “Don’t be silly. People do this every day.” I also wrote down some notes to help me. I think everyone feels a little nervous when speaking in public. The secret to confidence is to keep telling yourself, “Nothing is impossible.”"

Paul Forster goes to a kite-flying festival and spends a nervous night in the forest. Adnan Ali smiled when I gave him his torn kite. ""You have to keep it,"" he said. ""It's traditional. If the line breaks, finders are keepers. I have many more."" He showed me a pile of beautifully decorated kites at his feet. All the kites were 120 cm wide and long, made of tissue paper and bamboo. We sat in the shade of the trees behind the Beach of the Seven Lagoons in Kelantan, and looked at Malaysia's biggest kite festival.

In the center of the beach, there were 10 platforms where helpers held up the kites. A row of competitors held the lines of their kites and waited for the countdown. When the whistle blew, the crowd cheered, and the kites flew into the air like rockets. More than 500 men and boys had signed up for the competition, which lasts for five days every year. Each person entered four different kite designs. The kites were judged on decoration, stability in the air, and how well they flew. 

""Flying kites isn't so difficult,"" said Adnan, ""but making them takes real skill. Visit me at home, and I'll show you how to make them."" I received five invitations that day, and I decided to accept his. At his house, I drank cold tea and ate fish crackers in a big room. As it got dark, he asked me to come back the next day to help rebuild his kite, but I could not. Instead, I explored the southern part of the state, driving towards Kuala Lumpur, into the mountains with thick rainforest.

I took a wrong turn, and the road ended at a river. A small boat was waiting to take people across. Nearby, I saw a sign that said: ""Jelawang Jungle 3 km."" Before I started walking, it would have been good to know that most of the path was uphill and slippery. When I reached the track, I found a man named Baba waiting with tea. He took care of a kitchen and some bamboo huts. I decided to stay there, trying not to think about the insects under my thin mattress. 

At night, it was very dark, and I heard many sounds. A waterfall was loud nearby, and many creatures were moving and making noise. In the morning, I saw a great view of green mountains. In the afternoon, it rained. First, there was wind, then lightning hit the trees. I got wet quickly. Sliding down the hill, I wondered how the big butterflies avoided the rain. I also worried about my car getting washed away and if I would drown if I opened my mouth. Luckily, my car was still there, covered in mud, at the bottom of the hill.

In Kota Bahru, the capital of Kelantan, everyone asked me questions: ""Where are you from?"" ""How old are you?"" But they were friendly. Kelantan is known for its kites, but I remember it more for the kindness of the people."

During the Easter holidays, children can join a quiz about surprises. You can get free quiz sheets at the desk by the Orange Street entrance. Children will find 14 surprising paintings and answer different questions about them. The quiz sheets will be available from 25 March to 9 April during normal gallery hours.

**New Picture**  
The Gallery has a new still life painting by the Dutch artist Jan van Os from the 18th century. This large painting (89.1 cm x 71 cm) shows flowers and fruit in bright colors on wood. It is one of the first paintings of this kind in the Gallery. The painting is signed and dated 1777 and 1778. It is common for artists to date their work in two years because they wait for flowers to bloom in different seasons. This painting was given to the Gallery by Miss Violet Churchman in memory of her sister, Ida Nancy. You can see it in Room 25.

**Special Exhibition**  
The exhibition ""Painting in Spain during the late 18th century"" started in the Sunley Room on 15 March. The Gallery has bought works by three Spanish painters from this time: Paret, Melendez, and Francisco Bayeu.

PET_21,"**MONEY**

What is money? The pound, the dollar, and the franc are types of money. They are like grams or kilometers, but you can use money to buy things. For example, a five-pound note can buy a book, a big bag of sweets, or some cinema tickets. But the note is just a piece of paper that does not cost much to make.

A long time ago, people did not have money like we do now. There were no banks or shops. Back then, Mr. Green, a farmer, traded the corn he grew for Mr. Hive's honey. This was a trade between two people who wanted what the other had. Over time, many societies created their own types of money, called currencies, so people could trade more easily. Now, most countries use a national currency."
PET_46,"**Text: Write a Winning Story!**

You can win £1,000 in this year's Fiction Prize and have your story printed in Keep Writing magazine. Ten other people will win £100. We need people who can write good stories. The judges are Mary Littlejohn, a novelist, Michael Brown, a television reporter, and Susan Hitchins, the editor of Keep Writing. They want interesting and original stories. Last year, detective stories were very popular, but the winner wrote a love story.

You can write about anything you like, but here are some tips to help you:

1. **Write About What You Know**: This is important for every writer. Last year, many stories were about love, family, and problems with friends. Try to make ordinary situations interesting so people want to read more.

2. **Get Your Facts Right**: If you describe a place or explain something, make sure you are correct. Don’t write about things you are not sure about.

3. **Hold the Reader's Attention**: Start your story in an interesting way and end it with a surprise. A bad ending can ruin a good story.

4. **Think About the Characters**: Make your characters feel real by using good words to describe them.

Your story must be your own work, between 2,000 and 2,500 words, typed, double-spaced, and on one side of the paper only. We cannot accept stories by fax or email. You must include the application form with your story. We cannot return your story or discuss our decisions. 

You should not have had any fiction printed in any magazine or book in this country. The story must not have been printed or recorded anywhere in the world. Your fee of £5 will go to the Writers' Association. Make your cheque payable to Keep Writing and send it with the application form and your story to us. 

The closing date is 30 July, and we will tell the winner within one month. If you win, you must agree to have your story printed in our magazine."

Hypatia was born in Alexandria, Egypt, in 370 A.D. For many years, she was the only woman scientist in history books. Hypatia's father was the director of Alexandria University. He made sure his daughter got a good education. This was special because most women did not have many chances to study. 

After studying in Athens and Rome, Hypatia returned to Alexandria and started teaching mathematics. She became famous for her knowledge of new ideas. We do not have her books, but we know she wrote important works in mathematics. Hypatia was also interested in technology and created some scientific tools to help her work.

PET_27,"**Text: Grass**

Grass is one of the most successful plants in the world. There are over 9,000 types of grass, and they grow in every part of the earth. Grass can live in very cold places like the Arctic and the Antarctic. Grasslands are home to many animals, from small insects and birds to big animals like cows and lions. All these animals need grass to survive.

Grass grows back quickly after it is cut or damaged. Unlike other plants, new leaves grow from below the ground, not from the top. This is why many animals can live together in one area. When they eat all the grass, new grass starts to grow again, so there is always food available."

She did not tell her parents, who own a supermarket, that she wanted to work in fashion. She thought they wanted her to have a different job, so she studied management at university. After university, she moved to London and worked at an advertising agency. She went to events but could not buy the designer clothes she wanted. So, she started making skirts and tops for herself. When her friends saw her clothes, they asked her to make some for them too. She found a small shop in London that sold her designs. They were very popular, and nothing came back. This made her feel good, so she left her advertising job, took a loan of £20,000, and started her own women's clothing brand. Her parents were not angry about her choice and said they would help her, which made her happy. Now, her clothes are in over 70 stores, and her business makes more than £500,000.

The Sunningdale Hotel was built in 1913 and opened by Princess Louise. It has given good service to people from all over the world. Many guests of all ages and nationalities have stayed here. In the last 80 years, over 50,000 guests from 174 different countries have visited Sunningdale.

The hotel is on a main road that goes to the town center. It is about 20 minutes by bus from the center of town. Buses to many other parts of the town stop outside the hotel. Guests should not take buses with a blue sign that says ""Express"" because they do not stop near the hotel. An underground station is less than 100 meters away.

The main building has 200 comfortable single rooms. Each room has hot and cold water. Showers, baths, and toilets are at the end of the corridors. The hotel has a shop, sitting rooms, four television rooms, a table tennis room, a library, and a laundry. There are also eight pianos for guests to use. There is parking for cars in the hotel area. Daily newspapers are free, and guests can buy stamps at the office.

Guests who stay for a long time must pay for their rooms every week in advance. They need to tell the hotel one week before they leave. Both short and long-term guests are welcome, but long-term guests get rooms first.

Meal times are: breakfast from 7 am to 9:30 am, lunch from 1 pm to 2 pm, and dinner from 5:30 pm to 7 pm. If guests are studying or working late, they can ask for dinner until 11 pm by writing their name on a list or by calling before 7 pm. There are 10 choices for breakfast and dinner.

No animals or fires are allowed in the hotel. Guests should be quiet and respect others, especially between 11 pm and 8 am. If guests arrive by train, it is best to take a taxi to the hotel because it is far from the main train station."

PET_49,"**Text: The Ghan Train**

Mark Ottaway took a train from Darwin, in the north of Australia, to Adelaide, in the south. The Ghan train goes across Australia, from the warm north to the cooler south. It is often called the ""famous Ghan,"" but it is known for being late. 

In the 1920s, there was a plan to connect Darwin and Adelaide by train. A train line was built from Adelaide to Alice Springs, but it often had problems with flooding. A new train line was finished a few months before my trip. The train can go up to 115 kph, but the Ghan is not a fast train. It has few stops, and most passengers are on holiday. The Ghan is not as luxurious as other famous trains, but the food on board is very good. 

The train was first built to carry goods, not people. It was thought that sending goods from Europe to the south of Australia by train would save time and money. It is special to have a train that goes from north to south, and the Ghan is the first one in the world to do this.

When I waited to get on the Ghan, I saw that everyone was excited for the trip. Most of the other passengers were older Australians. Our first stop was Katherine, where the train stayed for four hours. Some passengers got off to take a boat trip. I stayed on the train until Alice Springs, where I went on a two-day trip to Uluru (Ayers Rock) with a small group and a guide. Climbing the rock is not encouraged now, so we just walked around it and watched the beautiful sunset.

From Alice Springs, there are two trains a week going south, so many passengers stop there. The view from the train after Alice Springs is not very interesting. There is a lot of flat land with only cattle to see. But on the third day, early in the morning, we reached the hills near the Southern Ocean. My journey was over, and even though the train did not meet all the promises, it took me to some amazing places in Australia."
PET_31,"**Text: Climbing Ben Nevis**

Every year, many people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland. It is the highest mountain in Britain, and it can be very cold there. Climber Keith Hewitt talks about his first climb on Ben Nevis.

""It was February, and it was my first big winter climb. We climbed up the north side of the mountain to Tower Ridge. It is six hundred metres high, which is probably the longest climb in Britain. We planned to camp for three days in the 'Carries', which are big bowls cut into the mountain halfway up. We carried tents, sleeping bags, and metal spikes for our boots. You need these spikes because the snow can be very hard, like ice. 

Even though some people in my group were very experienced, we took a lot of safety equipment. This included lights to get help, hard hats, and extra clothes. The weather was good, with no strong winds, but I still felt nervous when we started. Climbing Ben Nevis in winter is always hard.

The path went up, and my legs felt heavy. I was the weakest person in the group, so I had to rest more often. The others sometimes stopped to let me catch up, but as soon as I did, they started climbing again. I promised myself to train better before my next climb.

After climbing 200 metres, we reached the start of Tower Ridge. It is only a metre and a half wide, and the mountain drops down hundreds of metres on each side. We knew we had to stay calm and focus on every step as we moved slowly along it. After seven hours of climbing, we reached the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and the island of Skye, which is 48 kilometres away. But we were not lucky; a mist had come down.

Getting back down to camp can be as hard as going up. You need to read a map well because a wrong turn can lead to dangerous slopes in winter. I was happy we took turns reading the map. That first time, I only felt I enjoyed the climb when I was safe in the tent. But at least I made it to the top."""
PET_58,"**Text: Anna's New School**

This week is very exciting because we have moved into our new school building! It is a great place. The builders used wood to build it, just like our old school. But this school is one of the first in my country that is good for the environment. 

The school took a long time to build. We watched the builders clear the land where the school would be. It was exciting, but it also meant that some nice land was gone. The building machines were very loud, and sometimes the builders had to stop because it rained a lot. We thought the building would never be finished.

Now, we have five big classrooms. They are much bigger than the ones in our old school, which was very old. We share one room with people from the town for meetings. There is also a nursery, a nice dining room, and big changing rooms. We are excited to use them when our new sports field is ready.

When you enter the school, you will notice that there are no heaters! The heat comes from the people inside - the children, the teachers, and the computers. The building is designed to keep the heat inside. It also keeps the sound inside, so when we sing in our classrooms, it feels like we are in a concert hall!

Another interesting thing is that the school roof has a tree on it! The builders put it there because it is a custom in Austria, where the roof was made. The electricity for lights and computers comes from a wind turbine on a hill behind the school. We went with our teacher to see it yesterday, and it spins very fast. It is so big that we can see it from far away! We took pictures to put on our website.

Even though we are using the school now, some parts are still being finished. For example, we are putting on a play for our parents, but we have to go back to our old school hall to do it. The new hall will be ready next year. We are very happy with our new school, and our teachers say we will learn much faster now!"

A month ago, I did not know that on a Saturday afternoon in November, I would be 30 meters above the ground and enjoying it. Now, I looked down at the river far below me and understood why people love rock climbing. My friend Matt and I arrived at the Activity Centre on Friday evening. The place was not great, but we had everything we needed: beds, blankets, and food. We were happy to be out of the city and in the fresh air.

On Saturday morning, we met the other ten people in our group. Cameron came with his friends, Kevin and Simon. Sisters Carole and Lynn came with their friend Amanda. We all came from different places, and none of us knew the area. We knew we would spend the weekend outside, but we were not sure how.

Half of us went caving in the morning, while the others went rock climbing. Then we switched activities at lunchtime. Matt and I went to the caves first. Climbing out was harder than going in, but after a lot of pushing, we finally got out. We were covered in mud but happy and excited about what we had done."

On Saturday afternoon, I left my handbag on the bus. In my handbag were my cheque book, address book, and my purse, which had about £50 in cash and some credit cards. When I realized what I had done, it was too late. I didn’t know what to do. I am 72 years old, far from home, and I was very worried. I stood by the road and cried.

A young man asked me what was wrong. I told him what happened. He gave me some money for my bus fare home. When I told the bus driver what happened, he said I could keep the fare. I got home safely, and soon after, the telephone rang. It was the manager of CityBus, the company that owned the bus. He said they had my handbag and would bring it back to me. 

I got my handbag back, and everything was inside and untouched. I want to say thank you to everyone who helped me that day. I really appreciate their kindness and honesty.

Sharks are some of the most scary animals in the ocean. They are very good at finding food underwater because they can see well and feel movement with special lines on their bodies. This makes sharks dangerous for smaller sea animals that they eat. 

Sharks are like other fish in some ways, but their bodies are different. For example, most sharks must swim all the time to breathe and stay alive, so they do not sleep much. Also, if sharks are turned upside down, they can stop moving completely. This is helpful for scientists who need to study sharks. It helps them learn more about these interesting animals."

My name is Nathalie. Last year, I was one of the youngest foreign students to join the Kirov ballet school in St Petersburg, Russia. At my first ballet class, I was nervous because I didn’t know anyone. Everyone came to me and asked questions in Russian. I tried to speak in Russian, and then they started talking in English, so we could understand each other.

Now, six months later, everyone is very nice to me. My Russian has improved a lot, and I understand my teachers. For the first two weeks after I arrived, my mum stayed with me. When she left, I felt a bit sad. I even called home one night to talk to her because I felt lonely.

The classes in Russia are much harder than my ballet school in England. I eat a lot to keep my energy up. This helps me perform well in class. In the evenings, I watch my favorite films on my computer, but sometimes I fall asleep before the movie ends.

Now that I feel settled, I really like it here. I enjoy walking around the city and visiting different shops, even in December when it was very cold. I bought a fur hat because it was minus 10°C, but the Russians said it was warm for that time of year! At least my room is warm and cozy.

PET_55,"**THE ICEHOTEL**

For many years, the Arctic was a popular place to visit in the summer to see the land of the midnight sun. In winter, only a few people lived there, and they enjoyed the snow and ice. In the late 1980s, people decided that the dark and cold winter could be a good thing. 

In the winter of 1990, a French artist named Jannot Derit was invited to open an exhibition in a special igloo (a building made of snow) in the small town of Jukkasjarvi, on the frozen Torne River. This building was called Arctic Hall, and it attracted many visitors. One night, some foreign guests thought it would be fun to sleep in Arctic Hall. The next morning, they were very happy with their experience, and the idea of an ice hotel began.

Today, the ICEHOTEL is famous around the world. When winter starts, a team of builders, architects, and artists from many countries come to Jukkasjarvi to build the hotel for that year. As they finish one part, it opens for visitors and guests, while they continue to build other parts. The first part is ready in December, and each week a new part opens until January 7th, when the hotel is finished. 

The ICEHOTEL is built outside, using natural materials from winter, so the finishing date can change depending on the weather. In spring, when it gets warmer, the hotel melts. Inside the hotel, the temperature is never colder than -5 to -8 degrees Celsius, no matter how cold it is outside. Guests receive warm clothes like overalls, hats, and gloves as part of their stay. It is also a good idea for guests to bring sweaters, scarves, and many woollen socks. They should wear shoes that are a bit bigger than normal to fit the thick socks.

If you want to visit the hotel, you can buy warm sweaters, woollen socks, and more on the ICEHOTEL website. You can order these items when you book your visit, and they will be delivered to your room when you check in. The hotel is in the village of Jukkasjarvi, 200 km above the Arctic Circle, but only 15 km from Kiruna airport and 17 km from Kiruna train station. You can arrange a bus to take you from the airport or train station to the ICEHOTEL."

A report by Dave Worthington

Homestyle is a new furniture shop. It opened at midnight last Thursday but had to close very quickly. Up to 6,000 people came to the shop. There were many special offers, like a leather sofa for £45 (only until 3 am) and a bed for £30 (only between 3 am and 8 am). The shop will normally be open from 9 am to 9 pm every day, but it said it would stay open for the first 24 hours. However, it had to close within half an hour of opening.

A police officer said, ""We knew a large crowd would come, but people were not patient. The shop was full, and the managers decided to close the doors. The people outside got angry because they thought everything would be sold before they could get in. They did not want to wait quietly in line. There was also a long line of cars trying to park. Many people left their cars in the middle of the road and walked to the shop. This blocked the road.""

One customer, Jenny Smith, got into the shop. She said, ""I waited in line for three hours, but I didn't have time to buy what I wanted. The staff were calm and explained what was happening. They had to close for safety. I will come back when they reopen, but I don't want to wait in line again."""

Tanya Streeter has four world records in free-diving. Free-diving is a sport where people dive deep into the ocean on one breath of air. In 2003, Tanya made history by diving 120 meters deep while holding her breath. She came back up without help. A year before, she had dived deeper but used a balloon to come back up. This time, she held her breath for over three and a half minutes. She became the only woman to break a world record held by a man.

A team of fourteen safety divers watched her dive from different depths. Some people think free-diving is too dangerous because of accidents, but Tanya believes safety is very important, along with training. Most free-divers focus on one or two types of events, but Tanya has a regular training schedule. She spends two-thirds of her time training at the gym and the rest in the pool and ocean. She uses an exercise bike to make her heart stronger. She does not run because she wants to protect her knees. Instead, she walks fast to stay fit.

When Tanya practices diving, she usually travels away from home. She tries to do fourteen dives in four weeks, with a rest day between each dive. It is important for her not to get tired, as this could affect her preparation. When she is not training, Tanya often appears in public to promote sports products. She also helps environmental groups by doing research or making films.

Tanya grew up on the Caribbean island of Grand Cayman. She loved swimming and exploring rock pools to see sea life. She says her life now is like living her childhood dreams. Because she is famous in some countries, people listen to her when she talks about environmental issues. In the future, Tanya, who is now in her thirties, wants to keep breaking her own world records. She started free-diving at twenty-five and plans to continue for many more years."
PET_12,"**CARTOON FILMS**

Cartoon films have very few limits. If you can draw something, you can make it move on the screen. New ideas and computer programs make cartoons exciting for people of all ages. In the late 1970s, many people thought cartoons were only for children. But soon, some directors had new ideas. They showed that it was possible to make films that both adults and children could enjoy. However, not every cartoon film was a success. For example, The Black Cauldron did not do well because it was too scary for children and too silly for adults. Directors learned from this mistake, and film companies started to make a lot of money again."

""I never thought I would spend my first year at university making a TV show called The Finnegans. I had only acted in school, but I loved the book since I was eleven. My grandmother said I was just like Polly Finnegan, and I always dreamed of playing her.

I took a year off to travel before university. While I was in Chile, my mother emailed me. She told me there were plans to make the book into a TV drama. I knew I had to try for the role. My mother was surprised at first, but she sent my photo to the director and convinced him to meet me. I flew back and got the part.

Filming started a week after university began, so I asked for permission to be away for three weeks. When I returned to university, I woke up at 6:00 am to write the essays I missed. I didn’t tell my university friends, but they found out and thought it was great. It was an amazing experience, and I feel so lucky.

After university, I want to make acting my job. I am not from an acting family, but my grandfather was an opera singer. I have tried for other TV roles, but I have not received any offers yet. I don’t know how I did it all because I also had a busy social life. When filming finished, I didn’t know what to do. I have since acted in two college plays. Unfortunately, I haven’t been home much, and now that my first year at university is over, I am going to Greece for the summer with friends."""

When I opened the first 'Body Shop' in 1976, I just wanted to earn enough money to feed my children. Today, 'The Body Shop' is a big company that is growing fast all over the world. Since we started, I have learned a lot. Many of these lessons are in this book. I believe we have important ideas about how to run a successful business while staying true to our beliefs. 

This is not a normal business book, and it is not just about my life. The main idea is that to be successful in business, you need to be different. Business can be fun, and it can be run with love. It can also help people. In business, like in life, I want to enjoy myself, feel like I am part of a family, and be excited by new things. I have always wanted the people who work for 'The Body Shop' to feel the same way. 

Now, this book shares my ideas with everyone. I hope there are no limits to our 'family' and to what we can do. I find this thought exciting, and I hope you do too.'"
PET_4,"**A JOURNEY ALONG THE BEAUTIFUL DOURO RIVER**

Jules Verne runs a 'hotel ship' on the Douro River in Portugal. The MV Lady Ivy May can hold 160 guests in double cabins. All cabins have outside views and a private shower and toilet. On the ship, there is air-conditioning, a sun-deck, lounge, bar, dining room, shop, and library.

**Itinerary**

**Day 1:** You will leave London Heathrow in the early evening and fly to Oporto. A guide will meet you when you arrive and take you to the Lady Ivy May, where you will spend the night.

**Day 2:** After seeing the sights in Oporto in the morning, you will return to the ship and travel to Entre-os-Rios. This part of the journey takes four hours.

**Day 3:** You will keep traveling up the river. In the early evening, the ship will stop at Peso da Regua, where port wine is made. At dinner, you can try the delicious food and drink from this area.

**Day 4:** After breakfast, you will go by bus to the old town of Lamego. You will visit the cathedral, some churches, and a museum. The museum used to be a palace and has many paintings, tapestries, and sculptures. Then, you will return to the ship and sail to Tua.

**Day 8:** You will arrive in Oporto with time for sightseeing and shopping before your flight back to London Heathrow."
PET_30,"**HONEY**

Honey is a sweet liquid made by bees. It is made of water and sugars. Bees can travel a long way, up to seventy-five thousand kilometers, and visit over two million flowers to make just half a kilo of honey. The color and taste of honey depend on the flowers the bees visit. There are more than three hundred types of honey. Lighter honey is usually milder in taste than darker honey. 

In ancient times, honey was the main sweet food because sugar was very rare. The ancient Egyptians valued honey a lot and used it as payment. Today, honey is made and eaten all over the world. Research shows that honey can help reduce tiredness and improve sports performance. Honey is not just food; it can also help with sore throats and is used in many skin and hair-care products."

Norwich is the capital of East Anglia, a part of Britain. It has been a place to live for more than two thousand years. It started as a small village by the River Wensum. In 1066, when the Normans came, it became one of the largest towns in England. Norwich has two cathedrals and a mosque, making it a center for different religions. The first cathedral was built in 1095 and celebrated its 900th anniversary recently. In 1994, Norwich celebrated 800 years since it became a city and could govern itself.

Today, Norwich is smaller than cities like London or Manchester, with about 150,000 people. In the 16th century, it was the second city of England. It grew for 300 years and became rich, known for having many churches and pubs. Now, there are fewer churches and pubs, but in 1964, the University of East Anglia was built in Norwich. The city has many students and is a modern commercial center, especially for insurance services.

Norwich has many entertainment options, like theatres, cinemas, nightclubs, busy cafes, and good restaurants. There is also a football team with green and yellow colors, called 'The Canaries', but no one knows why.

One of the new attractions is a shopping center called 'The Castle Mall'. For over two years, there was a big hole in the city while builders worked on it. They moved a lot of earth to make a park on the roof of the Mall, with water pools and many trees. The people of Norwich are happy that the old open market is still there, next to the new shopping center. Both places are busy, showing that Norwich has a good mix of old and new."
PET_43,"**The Albuquerque Balloon Festival**

Every autumn, the sky above Albuquerque, a city in the south-western United States, becomes very colorful. This is the Albuquerque Balloon Festival, which happens every year for nine days. The first festival was in 1972 to celebrate the 50th birthday of a local radio station. There were about twelve hot-air balloons that took off from a parking lot in the middle of Albuquerque. Since then, the festival has grown a lot. This year, at least a thousand balloons from many countries are expected to come.

**What to See**

The pilots talk to each other using radios. They light up the burners of their balloons at the same time. This is called a ""balloon glow,"" and it is a great time to take beautiful photos. You should arrive just after night falls or before 5:30 am to see these ""glows"" as the balloons rise into the dark sky. During the day, you can walk around the balloons and talk to the pilots as they get ready to fly. The balloons are in many sizes and colors, some look like animals or cartoon characters, and some are shaped like popular drinks and fast food. Kids will enjoy it.

In the afternoon, you can also take a balloon ride over the desert with one of the many companies that offer this. Another option is to take a cable car from the desert to the top of the nearby mountains. This is the longest cable car ride anywhere, and you can see the festival from above.

There are many other fun things for visitors of all ages, like balloon races and fireworks on the first night and the last three nights of the festival.

**The Albuquerque Box**

This is a special wind pattern that helps balloon pilots. The Sandia Mountains protect the balloons from strong winds and create gentle winds at different heights. This means that skilled pilots can control the direction of their balloons by going up or down.

**Practical Advice**

Buy your tickets in advance online to avoid a long wait. Wear several layers of thin clothes because it can be cool at night and in the early morning, but during the day, you will need sunglasses and sunscreen. Bring a flashlight for night events and don’t forget your camera. If you use film, make sure to bring high-speed film for evening and night photos."

The Eden Project is in the south-west of England. It is one of the most popular places for tourists in the UK. The big 'biospheres' look like something from a science-fiction movie. Each biosphere has a different climate zone. This shows visitors how important plants are for people. 

Many products we use every day come from plants. For example, we get wood, rubber, fruit, rice, sugar, coffee, and chocolate from plants. There are over 135,000 different types of plants grown here. 

Even if it is cold outside, electric heaters keep the plants warm. In the Rainforest Zone, it is always damp because of a big waterfall. Another zone looks like the Mediterranean, California, and South Africa. There are plans to build a desert zone soon."

Some people have said they do not like this year's book, New Writing 3. I do not understand why. It has 500 pages of good writing for £6.99, which is great! Most of the book is fiction, including parts of novels and complete short stories. There are some nice pieces by well-known writers, like Candia McWilliam and Rose Tremain. 

Interestingly, many less famous writers have written about food. I suggest you do not read Jane Harris's story, Those Nails, right after eating. It has some very unpleasant scenes that might make you feel sick! 

There are also poems from nineteen poets, including R. S. Thomas and John Burnside. You can find parts of novels that are not finished by Jim Crace and Jane Rogers. Lastly, there is a little non-fiction, which has a funny article by Alan Rusbridger about some newspapers, and a surprising piece by Ursula Owen about herself. 

This is a great collection, and I am excited to see what next year's book will be like!"

""The best age to start learning the violin is between three and six,"" says Margaret Porter, a violinist and music teacher. ""It's a time when you learn about the world."" Margaret, who lives in London, likes to teach children who are three or four years old, but she also teaches some five-year-olds who really want to learn.

When she started teaching the violin in 1972, her first class was made up of her children's five-year-old friends. Margaret's students have group lessons. Each group has about twelve students, and each lesson lasts one hour, every two weeks. Also, each student has one private lesson with her every week. Parents must come to the classes too. It is important for parents to be interested in the lessons.

From the first lessons, students learn to play by ear. They do not try to read music until they have been playing for a few years. For a long time, there is a big difference between how they play and how they read music. Margaret says her method is not meant to make great violinists. She suggests that students who do very well should leave and learn the violin in a more traditional way."
PET_56,"**Text: Moonshine**

The band Moonshine released their third CD last week. The CD is called ""Here Again"" and is a follow-up to their last CD, ""The Waves."" There have been some changes in the band. Tom Wilcott is now playing bass guitar instead of Simon McVee, who left the band last year. Tom Simpson has joined the band as the new drummer.

The first song on the CD is a dance tune. This shows that the band is not going to focus only on slow songs anymore. The second song is also a dance tune and is even louder. Most of the other songs are in the band’s usual slow style. These two dance songs will surprise many fans. They could easily become popular hits because they are very good.

The singer, Rob Letchford, shows how talented he is by hitting every note perfectly. Fans should be happy that he recorded these songs before he had problems with his throat. Because of this, the band had to cancel their next tour. (Anyone who bought tickets does not need to worry; all the concerts will be rescheduled as soon as Rob gets better.)

On this CD, Moonshine shows they can make great music in different styles, from the slow songs we know to the dance songs that make you want to move. However, I think they put their best songs at the beginning, and the last few songs are not as good. Still, ""Here Again"" is sure to be a big hit and will bring more success to the band."

San Francisco is a city on the coast of northern California. The first Europeans to find this area were led by a Spanish explorer named Gaspar de Portola. He saw it for the first time in 1769. Even though San Francisco Bay is a beautiful natural harbour, it was found by land, not by sea.

In 1849, many people came to San Francisco hoping to find gold. But it was not the gold seekers who became rich. The richest people were those who owned banks and law firms. They built big houses on a hill called Nob Hill.

Today, many tourists visit San Francisco to see famous places like Chinatown and the Golden Gate Bridge. Some even take a short boat trip to Alcatraz Island to see the old prison."

He also writes about himself, including his mistakes - he often slept in church or looked at pretty girls. He shares stories about his home life, like a fight with his wife and how they made up, and his worry about her being sick. He enjoyed books, music, the theatre, card games, and parties with good food and fun. Pepys was a busy man with many important jobs - he was a Member of Parliament and President of the Royal Society. He is also remembered for his work with the British Navy."
PET_33,"**The History of Shoes**

In the past, people did not think much about shoes being comfortable or stylish. Early shoes were probably made from animal skins. People tied these around their ankles when it was cold. Today, we still use leather for shoes, but we also use other materials like silk, plastic, and cotton, depending on what is popular.

About one hundred and fifty years ago, people started to wear different shoes for each foot. Before that, shoes were straight and could be worn on either foot. 

Long ago, all shoes were made by hand. Now, many shoes are made by machines in big factories. The use of sewing machines helped the shoe industry make many shoes quickly and at lower prices for more people."

When I hurt my back, I had to stop running for a while. I wanted to help more women enjoy running and feel good about it. So, I started a running club for women in my area. I was upset because many race organizers say there are not enough women in running, but they do not make separate changing rooms for them.

I put up posters, and 40 women joined the club. They were young and old, fit and not fit. Many of them wanted to lose weight, but I don’t think they thought much about running before. When they did think about it, they imagined it was hard and painful. They didn’t see that running can be fun, with chatting and smiling in nice places, like by a river.

At first, they could only run for one minute, but now they can run for thirty minutes! They have also learned about healthy eating and staying fit. I wanted to help women with running, and I feel very happy to see how much they have improved. They are happy too!"
PET_40,"**THE HISTORY OF THE IDITAROD - THE LAST GREAT RACE ON EARTH**

In the 1880s, gold was found in Alaska, the most northern state of the USA. Many people came to Alaska to find gold and get rich. New towns were built quickly. One town was called Iditarod, which means 'far, distant place'. In 1909, Iditarod became the largest city in Alaska for a short time.

In the summer, boats could bring supplies to the towns. But in winter, the rivers and ocean froze, and it was hard to reach them. So, in 1910, a winter path was made for dog teams pulling sleds. They carried mail, food, and clothes to the gold miners. This path was called the Iditarod Trail. It took a team of dogs about three weeks to travel across Alaska. They stopped at 'roadhouses' to rest and eat.

The trail was used every winter until the 1920s when airplanes replaced boats and dog teams for transport. However, in 1925, dogs became famous again when a disease called diphtheria hit the city of Nome. The medicine to cure the disease was in Anchorage, far away. Airplanes were new, and no one knew if they could fly in the cold. The best pilot was away, so they decided to use dog teams to bring the medicine.

The trip was over 1,000 kilometers, mostly along the Iditarod Trail. It took twenty dog teams just six days to finish the journey. Leonhard Seppala, a Norwegian looking for gold, traveled the first 400 kilometers. He trusted his dog Togo to find the way in the snow, and Togo was a great guide. The last part of the journey was done by Gunnar Kaasen, who had driven dog teams in Alaska for 21 years. His lead dog was Saito. At one point, Balto, another dog, stopped the team from falling into icy water. The medicine arrived, and Balto became a hero.

Today, a dog sled race is held every year from Anchorage to Nome, following the famous route from 1925. It is called the Iditarod and is known as 'The Last Great Race on Earth'."

In this hotel, you can eat, drink, and sleep in ice rooms. You can even have a wedding there. The bar is made of ice too, so it is not good to put hot drinks on it! The bedrooms are about -4°C, but guests get special sleeping bags to keep warm. They can also get warm outdoor clothes if they need them.

He went to meet her and saw her kicking a ball outside the football club. He realized she was very fast.

""He talked to me about athletics. I did not understand what he meant. The only sport I knew was football. Then he bought me running shoes and took me to train. It was hard work, and my legs hurt."" Jose spoke to her parents and convinced them that she could be successful and help their family. They agreed to let him take her to train.

In 1991, she accepted an invitation to train in the United States. She had said no before because she would miss her family. Her life was different from the girls she met in the US. She said, ""They were good athletes, but I worried about my parents having enough to eat. They worried about dresses and make-up. They did not know much about me or my problems. But I knew I was lucky to be there. The trainers were great, and I learned a lot.""

In early zoos, animals were trained to perform for visitors. Now, this does not happen. Today, the purpose of zoos is for people to see animals acting naturally.

Most cities have a zoo or wildlife park. Some people think zoos are good because they help us learn about nature and see wild animals up close. These things would not be possible without zoos. 

However, some people do not like zoos. They believe it is wrong to keep animals in cages. They also say that in some zoos, animals live in dirty places and do not get good food."

I play the trumpet in my school jazz band. Last month, we had a jazz competition with bands from local high schools, and our band won! Each band wore different costumes. My band wore black school uniforms, while others wore bright T-shirts. We did not look like professional adult bands, but we were all used to performing in competitions. The quality of our playing was amazing, especially because we are all so young. Players from each band even made new songs right on stage. It was exciting to watch, but it was even better when my band played!  

My school has a great jazz band, but not everyone who wants to join can. Only about half of the people who try out get in. However, anyone who wants to play can go to jazz practice before school. We also spend time together after school, listening to jazz and learning about it. There are trips to jazz summer camps across the country. I have been to a couple and learned a lot.  

Adults are often surprised that young people like jazz. My music teacher thinks it is because pop music is not challenging enough for serious music lovers like me. I find jazz exciting because it is both new and old. You can create your own music, but you also feel part of its history when you play on stage like great jazz performers did before you. My school is lucky because we have great teachers and parents who support us. Without them, we would not get far with our music!"

PET_28,"**Antarctica Sightseeing Flights Website**

Welcome to our website! Here is what you need to know before booking a flight. 

During the short summer in Antarctica, we take tourists on a big passenger plane (Boeing 747) from Sydney, Australia, over Antarctica and back. The flight dates for next year are not set yet, but if you book now, your deposit can be changed if we need to change the date.

**Questions**

Here are answers to common questions about Antarctica Sightseeing Flights.

**How long is the flight?**  
The flight is about 12 hours long. After about four hours, we usually see the first sea ice and icebergs. We spend four hours over Antarctica and the rest of the time flying back home. During the flight, experts who have worked in Antarctica will talk about the environment and history, and they will answer your questions. There is a camera next to the pilot that shows you what the pilot sees from take-off to landing.

**Will I get a seat next to a window?**  
All passengers get two boarding passes. At the halfway point of the flight, you will move to the seat on your second boarding pass. Business and first-class passengers will have a window seat for half of the flight and a seat next to the window for the other half. Economy passengers will have a window seat or a seat next to a window for half of the flight and a seat at the end of the row for the other half. While we are over Antarctica, we encourage passengers to get up and move around the plane so everyone can see the sights. The pilot flies in long 'figure 8s' over interesting places so that everyone can see well from both sides of the plane.

**What happens if the weather is bad?**  
We have 17 different flight plans. On the morning of the flight, our captain looks at the weather and chooses the best direction for clear views.

**Will I see penguins and other wildlife?**  
Most wildlife in Antarctica lives at sea level, which is over 3,000 meters below the plane, so we cannot see them clearly. We do not land in Antarctica because of environmental reasons. If you want to see wildlife, you need to join a boat tour.

**Can I take photographs?**  
Yes! You can bring all cameras. We also have some fun photo opportunities on board where you can wear Antarctic cold weather clothes."

Bill, who is ten years old, says, ""I love my mum's cooking, and now I can do it better than her. The teachers make us laugh, especially when we eat the food we made together.""

Flora is twelve years old. She has some trouble with onions. ""I love cooking. I made a meal for ten friends, and they really liked it. My mum suggested I find a hobby instead of doing nothing on weekends. At first, I was happy to stay at home, but now I am really glad I came.""

Their teacher, Philippe, says, ""It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, even if the kitchen is not always clean when they cook! Adults keep learning about food. If parents teach their children to cook when they are young, they will know how to make food for themselves when they grow up."""
PET_5,"**Winter Driving**

Winter can be dangerous because it is hard to know what will happen, and accidents can happen easily. Fog can appear suddenly over a hill. Ice can be hidden under melting snow, which can make you lose control of your car. A car coming towards you might slide across the road.

**Rule Number One** for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly. If you move the car suddenly, it can be hard to control. So, when you turn the wheel, press the brakes, or speed up, do it gently and slowly. Imagine you have a full cup of hot coffee next to you. Drive carefully so you do not spill it.

**Rule Number Two** is to pay attention to what might happen. The more ice there is, the further down the road you should look. Test how long it takes to stop by gently pressing the brakes. Remember, you might be driving faster than you think. 

In general, allow double your normal stopping distance when the road is wet, three times this distance on snow, and even more on ice. Try to keep control of your car at all times to avoid problems."
PET_41,"**Craigie Aitchison**

Craigie Aitchison was a painter from Scotland. He moved to London to study law, but he went to art school instead. In art school, he found drawing classes hard, but he kept painting. When he was in his late twenties, the Italian government gave him money to study art. He became interested in early Italian artists, and this can be seen in some of his paintings. He loved the green and brown colors of the Italian fields and the bright light there. He wanted to show this light in his paintings. 

To do this, he painted colors thinly, one on top of another, from light to dark. He said, ""It's a secret - because I don't know myself. I don't start by painting yellow, knowing I'm going to put anything on top."" Aitchison makes painting sound easy. He said, ""Anyone can do the colors - you can buy them. I just notice what you put the colors next to.""

Unlike some artists, he does not make drawings before he starts painting. He thinks that if he draws first, he might get bored and not finish the painting. Instead, he changes his paintings many times before they are done. He likes to paint people who do not ask to see their pictures while he is painting. He said, ""If I feel they're worried and want to look at the painting, I can't do it.""

Since he moved to London, he has not felt part of the Scottish art scene. He says he is not interested in following any tradition, but he just paints the way he can. Still, his work influences young British painters."
PET_38,"**Text: 'Rock Band'**

Two years ago, our 14-year-old son, Ben, asked us for a drum set for his birthday. At first, we did not like the idea because of the noise. Ben said, ""It's better than watching TV or playing computer games in my free time, and it will keep me out of trouble."" In the end, we agreed. We said, ""Okay, but you must think about the family and the neighbors when you play.""

That was just the start. Because drums are hard to move, Ben's friends began coming to our house with their guitars and other equipment. Now, for several hours a week, our house shakes with their music and singing. At least Ben's hobby is good for our health: when the band practices, my husband and I go for a long walk. 

I must say, even if their music sounds a little strange, they are a friendly and polite group of young men. I cannot say if they are good musicians, but they play regularly in local clubs for young people. Our main worry is that they will not spend enough time on their school work because of their music, but this has not happened yet. I always tell Ben how important his studies are. One thing is sure: Ben was right. His music has kept him out of trouble, and he is never bored."
PET_17,"**Text: Atlantic College**

Last week, I visited Atlantic College, a great private college in Wales. It helps young people get important life experience outside the classroom and study for their exams. The students are between 16 and 18 years old and come from many countries. In the morning, they study, and in the afternoon, they do useful activities. These activities include helping on a farm, caring for people with learning difficulties, or checking rivers for pollution.

One good thing about Atlantic College is that students come from different backgrounds and countries. Many students cannot pay the fees of £20,000 for two years, so there are grants available. About a quarter of the students are British, and many of them can only attend because they get help from the government.

Barbara Molenkamp, a student from the Netherlands, said, ""I really admire the college for trying to encourage understanding among young people. You learn to live with people and respect them, even those you don’t like. During the summer holidays, my mother couldn’t believe how much less I argued with my sister.""

In summary, Atlantic College gives its students a great education with methods that really work."
PET_47,"**Text: Being an Older Student**

I am 32 years old and I just finished my first year at university. I go to lectures and I have learned to read books quickly and write long essays. I decided to go to university after being away from school for fourteen years. 

Before, I worked as a secretary. I earned good money, but I was bored because my job was easy and I did not have to think much. I felt sad because I thought I was stuck in that job. I saw students at the local university who looked happy and full of hope. I wanted to feel that way too.

Now that I am a student, I find it hard to make friends with younger students. They often think I am a teacher and ask me questions I cannot answer. I also feel different from the teachers because, even though we are the same age, I know much less than they do. 

But I am happy to study because I know I need a qualification to get a good job, and that is very important to me. Unlike most eighteen-year-olds, I prefer to spend my weekends reading books instead of going to parties. I also enjoy the student benefits like long holidays and discounts for the theatre and cinema. 

Sometimes I worry about what I will do after university, but I hope that going back to school now is a good choice."
PET_48,"**Text: Henry Ford**

Henry Ford was born on a farm in Michigan in 1863. He did not like farming. When he was fifteen years old, he started working as a mechanic. In 1893, he made his first car. After driving it 1,500 kilometers, he sold it and built two bigger cars. In 1903, he started the Ford Motor Company. He used strong but light steel to make cars that were cheap for regular people to buy. 

In 1908, he made the first Ford Model 'T', which cost $825. Soon, he was selling 100 cars every day. By 1927, the Ford Motor Company was worth $700 million. Early Ford cars were simple and cheap, but this sometimes meant there were fewer choices. Henry Ford said about the Model T, ""You can have any color you like, as long as it's black."""

Rebecca Stevens was the first woman to climb Mount Everest. Before climbing the highest mountain in the world, she was a journalist and lived in a small flat in south London. In 1993, Rebecca left her job and family and traveled to Asia with some other climbers. She found that life on Everest is hard. 

""You must carry everything on your back,"" she said. ""You can only take what you need. You can't wash on the mountain, and in the end, I didn't even take a toothbrush. I am usually a clean person, but there is no water, only snow. Water is very heavy, so you only take enough to drink!""

When Rebecca reached the top of Mount Everest on May 17, 1993, it was the best moment of her life. Suddenly, she became famous. Now, she has written a book about her trip, and people often ask her to talk about it. She has a new job too, on a science program on television.

Canada Geese are big blue and white birds. When autumn comes, they fly south to find warmer weather. The winters in Canada are very cold, and the birds can die if they stay there. Last spring, Bill Lishman found sixteen young Canada Geese on his farm. They had lost their parents. Bill thought, ""These young birds will not know what to do in autumn."" 

Bill had a small plane, and he decided to teach the birds to follow him. All summer, he took short trips in his plane, and the young geese flew after him. When autumn came, Bill flew to Virginia in the United States, which is 600 miles south of his home in Canada. The geese followed him all the way. 

Bill left the geese in Virginia and went back home. This spring, Bill waited for the birds to come back. They did not arrive, so Bill flew to Virginia to find them. He looked for two weeks but could not find them. When he got back home, Bill found the geese waiting for him. They had found their way home without him!"

When Esther finished school at sixteen, her aunt Flory gave her £500 for her birthday. Most of Esther's friends went to college, but Esther used her aunt's money to start her own business. She bought fruit, sugar, and glass jars to make jam. She sold the jam for £1 a jar to her friends and soon made £1,000.

At first, her parents did not want her to make jam. They thought she should study and become a teacher or a doctor. But Esther did not listen to them. She kept making jam. After a few months, she sold it at the local market. Then she started making orange juice and sold it to a school where her friend worked.

After two years, her business grew a lot, and her parents were very happy. She made many kinds of food and sold them to shops and supermarkets. She was so busy that she needed to hire some people to help her."

Corryvale Farm is in the west of England. Stephen and Jenny Blackler have cows and chickens. They sell milk and eggs. But most of their money comes from Jenny's sheep. She has 50 sheep, and each sheep has enough wool for six sweaters. Every six months, Stephen cuts the wool off the sheep so they do not get too warm.

Five years ago, Jenny made some sweaters with the wool and tried to sell them at country markets. But it was summer, and the weather was hot, so people did not want to buy sweaters. Then, she made some socks. Everyone loved them because they were cheap, strong, and easy to wash. This is how Jenny's business started.

At first, she made the socks at home, but soon she had many customers. So, she had to send the wool to a factory, where all the socks are now made by machines. There are six colors, five sizes for all ages, and different socks for walkers, sportsmen, and skiers. 

Jenny is busiest at Christmas because Corryvale socks are a popular gift. In Jenny's office, there are many letters from happy customers all over the world."

Most house burglaries happen between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m., say the police. Inspector Ian Saunders told our newspaper that the number of house burglaries has increased by more than 30% compared to last year. He also said that 67% of burglaries happen when people go out and forget to close a door or a window. 

He said that night-time burglaries are rare because families are usually at home then. But winter afternoons are the best time for burglars because it is dark and they cannot be seen easily. Many houses are empty at that time because people are still at work.

Inspector Saunders said it is a good idea to leave lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when you go on holiday. This will help keep burglars away. He also asked neighbors to watch the other houses in the street when people are not home. They should call the police if they see anything strange. 

""We will also tell you how to make your house safe,"" Inspector Saunders said. ""This help costs nothing."""

KET_44,"**Text: The History of Farming**

Before people started farming, they looked for plants and fruit in the forest to eat. This meant they had to move all the time to find food. But about 12,000 years ago, in the Middle East, people began to grow their own food. These people were the first farmers. 

Farming allowed people to stay in one place, and their villages became bigger. Some people in the villages could do other jobs, like making clothes, because the farmers grew food for everyone. 

However, farming was hard when the weather was bad, and some people did not have enough food to eat. Today, farmers can grow more food, and it can travel a long way to reach our homes."

This is more than the USA, making it the biggest film industry in the world. Most Indians like to watch films more than any other free-time activity, and ten million people go to the cinema every day. 

Bollywood films often tell romantic love stories, and singing and dancing are important parts of every film. People outside India also enjoy Indian films. Last year, Bollywood made over $500 million by selling its films to other countries. Indian actors make more films each year than American actors in Hollywood, but they earn less money. This is why most Bollywood films cost about $2 million to make. A Hollywood film usually costs at least $5 million to make.

Today, there are police officers everywhere, but in 1700, London had no police officers at all. A few old men tried to protect the city streets at night, but they did not get paid much. About 300 years ago, London was getting bigger. The city was very dirty, and many people were poor. There were many thieves who stole money in the streets, so people stayed at home as much as they could.

In 1750, Henry Fielding started to pay some people to stop the thieves. They were like police officers and were called 'Bow Street Runners' because they worked near Bow Street. Fifty years later, there were 120 Bow Street Runners, but London had grown very big and needed more police officers. So, in 1829, the first Metropolitan (or London) Police Force was created with 3,000 officers. Most of the men worked on foot, but some rode horses. Until 1920, all the police in London were men. Today, London police officers are paid well, and the few who still ride horses get paid even better."

KET_7,"Text: 'Visit the Edinburgh Festival! Every year, many people come to Edinburgh, the capital city of Scotland, for the Edinburgh Festival. For three weeks in August and September, the city is full of actors and artists from all over the world. They come to Edinburgh for the biggest arts festival in Britain. During this time, the streets are full of music and dance from morning until night. You can even see artists painting on the streets. One of the best parts of the Festival is the 'Fringe', where students do comedy shows in small places like cafes. Many tourists come to the Festival to see new films, plays, and listen to music from famous musicians. This year, you can see over five hundred performances with actors from more than forty countries. The tickets for these shows are not very expensive, and it is usually easier to see your favorite star in Edinburgh than in London. So come to Edinburgh next summer, but remember it can be hard to find a room, so why not book your hotel now!'"
KET_43,"**ICE-FISHING**

If you drive north from Toronto for three hours, you will reach Lake Nipissing. In winter, the lake freezes, and many Canadian fishermen go there every weekend. They build small wooden houses on the ice and paint them in bright colors. Then they sit inside to catch fish that swim under the ice. 

Bob Marvisch has been coming here for twenty-five years. ""You need clothes that are light but warm: two pairs of socks, gloves, several thin sweaters, and a snow suit on top,"" he says. ""Catching fish is easy. First, you break the ice and make a small round hole. Next, you take a fishing line and put some bread on it. Then you put the line through the hole and into the water. You pull the line up when the fish eat the bread. The fish are between ten and twenty centimeters long. Some people like to eat them, but when I catch three or four fish, I prefer to have some chocolate or another snack! Today, I have caught twenty-five! It's a great sport, and you can meet nice people here!"""

KET_11,"**Text: Madame Tussaud's**

One famous place for tourists in London is Madame Tussaud's museum. Here, people can see wax figures of famous people. Madame Tussaud was born in France in 1761. Her uncle, who was a doctor, made wax figures. He opened a museum in Paris. Marie helped him with his work. 

In 1789, during the French Revolution, Marie went to prison. There, she had to make copies of the heads of famous people who had died, including Queen Marie Antoinette. In 1795, Marie married Francois Tussaud. In 1802, she came to London with her wax figures. She opened a museum, and her figures can still be seen today."
KET_14,"**BICYCLES**

Bicycles are a cheap and clean way to travel. The first bicycle was made about 150 years ago. At first, bicycles were expensive, and only rich people could buy them. These early bicycles looked very different from today’s bicycles. Later, when bicycles became cheaper, many people bought them. People started riding bicycles to work and for fun. 

Today, many people use cars more than bicycles because cars are faster and keep you dry in the rain. But some people still like to ride bicycles to work. They say there are too many cars in town centers, and it is hard to find a place to park!"
KET_63,"Text: 'The Elephant Show by Daniel Allsop, age 14

Last summer, I went to Thailand for a beach holiday with my family. One day, we visited a park near our hotel. The park had beautiful flower gardens, but we wanted to see the elephant show. We went to a big square with seats on three sides. Three elephants came in with their trainers and stood in front of a large white card. Each elephant got a paintbrush and started to paint on its own card. The trainers gave each elephant a new brush with paint and took the old one away. Slowly, the elephants followed their trainers' instructions and drew pictures on the cards. I couldn't believe my eyes! One picture showed a river, another a tree, and the last one a bunch of flowers. When the trainers held up the paintings, everyone wanted to buy one. We also gave the elephants the bananas we brought for lunch. Twenty years ago, elephants worked in the forest. Now, they do not work there anymore, but the smartest elephants live in special places where visitors can watch them.'"
KET_56,"**Text: Big Cats**

There are many kinds of cats. They are different in size and look. Tigers are the biggest cats. They can be 3.7 meters long from head to tail. Most cats do not like water, but tigers often lie in water when it is hot. 

Lions are the only cats that live in big family groups. Many lions work together to find food for the group. They usually live in flat, open areas where they can see far and follow other animals easily. All cats need good eyes to catch smaller animals for food. They also need to be fast and strong."

KET_20,"**THE OSTRICH**

The ostrich is the largest bird in the world. An adult ostrich can weigh more than 90 kilos. Most wild ostriches live in southern Africa, but there are not many left. Like all birds, ostriches have wings, but they cannot fly. They use their wings to help them turn when they run. Ostriches can run very fast, from 65 to 90 kilometres an hour, so it is hard for other animals to catch them. Baby ostriches are the same size as chickens and take about 3 years to grow up. Ostriches eat plants and can live for many days without water."

It was natural for me to start snowboarding. It is easy to learn, and you can get good in a few months."" 

We asked her if she practices a lot. She replied, ""In winter, I snowboard in the mountains every day from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. I also run and bike. I love doing all of it! I enjoy the competitions and being in the mountains. It is so beautiful. But free-riding, which is when you do what you want outside of competitions, is the best for me."" 

We also asked her what is important when learning to snowboard. She said, ""You can learn quickly, but you need lessons. It is also important to have the right clothes so you don’t get wet because you will fall down a lot at first!""'"

KET_64,"**Text: Mount Kilimanjaro**

Mount Kilimanjaro is the highest mountain in Africa. Many people have climbed Kilimanjaro, from a seven-year-old boy to an 87-year-old man. There are different paths to the top. The Marangu path is five kilometers long and is the easiest. It takes about five days to climb and many tourists use this path. 

Only half of the climbers who try to reach the top succeed. This is often because the weather can change quickly. At the start, it can be hot and rainy, but at the top, there is ice and snow, and the temperature can be below 20 degrees. Climbers need to bring both sunglasses and warm clothes!"
KET_29,"**Text: Otters**

Not many people have seen an otter. Otters live near rivers and make their homes from small pieces of wood. They usually come out at night. Otters are very good swimmers and can swim faster than 10 kilometers an hour. They have thick brown fur that keeps them warm in the water. An otter can close its ears and nose, so it can stay underwater for several minutes. 

Twenty years ago, there were few otters in Great Britain. The rivers were very dirty, and many fish and insects died. The otters could not find food. But today, there is a lot of food for them because the rivers are clean again."

People have always made buildings. We need houses to keep us warm and dry. We build stadiums to watch football matches and concerts. We also have buildings like museums to keep beautiful things.

Many people work together to build a building. The architect decides how the building will look and draws pictures of their ideas. Engineers make sure the building is strong and safe. Then, workers carefully build it.

The Sydney Opera House is a famous building with a beautiful roof. It looks nice from every side, not just the top. The Olympic Stadium in Munich is also famous. It has a roof that looks like a tent made of glass."

Gail Rollins is one of the best runners in Edinburgh. This summer, she wants to run the 10,000 metres and maybe the 5,000 metres at the European Championships. In the past, Gail was famous for coming second in big races. She always laughed and smiled, and people in her city love her for this.

In 2004, everything changed when she ran her first half-marathon, which is a long race. She won and had the fastest time of the year for any British woman runner. Gail's manager and husband, Mike Rollins, also ran when he was younger, but he had to stop because he hurt his right leg. He can still run a little and sometimes trains with Gail. But it is not fun for Mike when Gail runs faster than him.

Gail trains hard. She runs long in the morning and fast in the afternoon. She always takes a break from running on Sundays. Mike says, ""I am with her all the time. Sometimes I ask, 'Are you sure you should be eating that?' It is usually cakes, but she can eat almost everything."""
KET_52,"**Text: Piano Players - When They Were Young**

**Ivan Petrov**  
Ivan was born on a farm in Russia. From the age of twelve to eighteen, he studied in Poland. His first music teacher could not play the piano, but she taught him and his sister songs from operas. His mother started teaching him the piano when he was six years old. When he was ten, he wanted to write music, and he began his first song.

**Oleg Gagarin**  
Oleg was the youngest of five children. When he was four, his father, who liked to play the piano, taught him some traditional Russian music. At six, he began lessons with a piano teacher in his city. Oleg soon won prizes for his piano playing. At fourteen, he went to a music college in Austria for two years. After that, he returned to Russia.

**Josef Heptmann**  
Josef's father was German, but he taught music in Poland, where Josef was born. The family moved to Germany when Josef was two years old. A year later, he started playing the piano. He gave his first concert when he was six. At ten, he gave fifty-two concerts in two months during a trip to England! Josef loved music, but he was also interested in physics and languages. He is very busy now, but one day he would like to write his own music."

Bill Prince-Smith was a farmer, a teacher, and a dentist before he became a writer of children's books at the age of 60. Now, thirteen years later, he has written more than 80 books. Every day, he goes to his office and writes. In the evening, he gives his work to his wife to read. ""She tells me when she doesn't like something,"" says Bill. ""My ten grandchildren do not live near me, but they also read my stories and tell me if they are good or bad."" Because of this, Bill has learned what young children want to read.

Bill writes about life in his village and on the farms nearby. His fifth book is his favorite: *The Sheepdog* is about a farmer and the dog that helps him. ""I have always liked animals,"" says Bill, ""and dogs are very clever; they learn quickly."" Last year, the book was made into a film with real animals and actors. The film-makers used new technology to make it look like the animals are speaking. Bill was very happy with the film. ""Sometimes film-makers change books, but they didn't change mine, and I love the film."""
KET_35,"**POSTCARDS**

Today, many people send postcards to their friends and family. These postcards often have pictures of beaches, mountains, or castles. You can write a message on the back. Many people send postcards when they are on holiday because they are cheap and the pictures are often nicer than their own photos. 

The first postcard was sent at the end of the 1800s. It had a picture of a town by the sea. Later, postcards showed news events, like accidents or visits from important people. People liked these postcards because there were no pictures in newspapers at that time."
KET_5,"**Text: Dinosaurs**

No one has ever seen a dinosaur. The last dinosaur died about 60 million years ago, a long time before people were on Earth. Nobody knows for sure why they all died. The closest living relatives of dinosaurs are birds. Dinosaurs did not all look the same. There were more than 5000 kinds. Some were very small, but others were very big. The largest dinosaurs were bigger than any other animals that ever lived on land. 

For example, the Brontosaurus was twenty meters long, and it ate plants. The Tyrannosaurus Rex was not as big, but it was very strong. It had sharp teeth for eating meat. It could also run fast because it had long back legs."

Bears can be dangerous animals. An adult bear is very strong and can hurt a person. Bears are good at climbing trees and can run fast. However, they cannot see well. Like most animals, they find food using their noses. 

There are seven types of bears. The largest is the white polar bear, which is almost three meters tall. There are two types of black bears: one lives in North America, and the other lives in South-East Asia. Not all black bears are black; they can be dark brown or reddish brown. 

Many people love the black and white panda bear, which comes from China. Not many pandas live in the forest today because it is hard for them to find food."

Crocodiles live in warm places in the world, like Africa, South America, and Northern Australia. They spend most of their time in slow water, but they can move quickly in water and on land. You often see crocodiles in big groups. They eat many things, like fish, birds, and small animals. Sometimes, they can also eat big animals or even people. There are more than ten types of crocodiles, and they all have very sharp teeth. They often lose their teeth, but they grow new ones. Crocodiles are usually about 3.5 meters long, but some can be much bigger. They can live a long time. The oldest crocodile in a zoo was 66 years old."
KET_17,"**A HISTORY OF AIR TRAVEL**

In 1783, two French brothers made the first balloon to take people into the sky. One hundred and twenty years later, in 1903, the Wright brothers built the first plane with an engine and flew it. This happened in the United States. In 1918, the US Post Office started the first airmail service. 

Aeroplanes changed a lot in the next thirty years. In the 1950s, aeroplanes became much faster because they had jet engines. In 1976, Concorde was made in the UK and France. It is the fastest passenger plane in the world and can fly at 2500 kilometres an hour, so the trip from London to New York takes only four hours. 

Today, millions of people travel by aeroplane, and it is hard to imagine a world without them."

Visiting the theatre in London 400 years ago was very different from today. The building was round and had no roof. People got cold and wet if it rained. The queen liked to go to the Globe Theatre, by the River Thames, to see plays by William Shakespeare. All the actors were men. Visitors ate, talked to friends, walked around during the show, and some even threw things at the actors!
