CPE_15,C2,"'Garbage in, garbage out'**
Charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems like a good idea for the environment and for saving money. However, it may not be. Many aspects of modern life are similar in developed countries, including how rubbish is collected. Rubbish bags or bins are picked up regularly by special trucks and taken to a landfill. Economists find this strange because, in many places, this service is free. Households pay for it through local taxes, but a family that throws away four bins of rubbish each week pays the same as an elderly couple that only throws away one bin. However, rubbish disposal is not free. The more rubbish people throw away, the more rubbish collectors and trucks are needed, and the more local authorities have to pay for landfills. This creates a basic economic problem: if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. 
One solution is to make households pay for the cost of disposing of their waste. This would encourage them to throw away less and recycle more, assuming local governments provide places to collect recyclable materials. However, economists Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman found that what seems like a logical solution can have complicated and sometimes disappointing results. They studied several American towns and cities that have started charging households for rubbish. The most common method is to sell stickers or tags that people attach to their rubbish bags or cans. Only bags with these labels are picked up during the weekly collection.
In a paper published last year, Fullerton and Kinnaman focused on a scheme introduced in July 1992 in Charlottesville, Virginia, a town of about 40,000 people. Residents were charged 80 cents for each tagged bag of rubbish. This may seem like a good use of market forces. However, the authors concluded that the benefits of the scheme did not cover the costs of printing materials, paying sellers, and the wages of the people running the scheme. 
True, the number of bags or cans collected fell sharply by 37%. But this was mainly because people started cramming more garbage—about 40% more—into each container, a behavior first noticed in Seattle when it introduced rubbish pricing. People jumped on their bags to fit more in. However, machines at landfills can compact rubbish better than individuals can. The weight of rubbish collected, which is a better measure of disposal costs than volume, fell by only 14% in Charlottesville. In 25 other Virginian cities without a pricing scheme, the weight of rubbish also fell by 3.5%.
Worse still, some people chose to dump their rubbish illegally instead of paying for collection. This is hard to measure, but the authors estimate that illegal dumping may account for 30-40% of the reduction in collected rubbish. The only positive outcome seems to be a 15% increase in the weight of materials recycled, suggesting that people chose to recycle (which is free) instead of paying to have their rubbish taken away. However, this increase may not be directly related to the fee, as many residents were already recycling through a voluntary program in Charlottesville.
In a more recent study, Fullerton and Kinnaman looked at rubbish economics in more detail. One conclusion is that pricing does reduce the weight of rubbish, but not by much. On average, a 10% increase in sticker prices only reduces rubbish by 0.3%. This figure is lower than in other studies, but is it surprising? To significantly reduce rubbish, people would need to buy less of almost everything. A small tax on rubbish is unlikely to make a big difference. 
If this is true, we should consider whether other factors, like income and education, are just as important as price. For example, in richer towns, people throw away more rubbish than in poorer ones, and they have less time to recycle. Should we say that charging households for rubbish is a bad idea? Not necessarily: free disposal is probably too cheap. But the effects of simple policies can be complex. Detailed economic models are often needed to understand them, and sometimes the results are not pleasant."

Theodore Zeldin discusses how our work life could change. Do you feel respected and appreciated in your job? Success in a career is not enough anymore. Many professions feel they are not valued or understood, and even famous people often feel unhappy despite their success. Loving your job used to be enough to be part of a lucky few, but now you need to think about how your job affects you as a person, your mind, character, and relationships. This question is very important. No matter how skilled you are, if your work makes you boring or unable to talk to others outside your field, then no amount of status or money can make up for that. 
I want to find out how work can focus on personal fulfillment instead of just serving industrial needs. Work should not only create wealth but also be a meaningful part of life, helping us discover new talents and connect with more people. However, changing this will not eliminate unemployment. This is too simple because as more people get educated, they want jobs that are interesting and meaningful. We should see a lifetime of work as a work of art, with the fulfilled person at its center. 
Even middle-class jobs, like doctors and accountants, are not as appealing as they used to be. Doctors often feel more stressed than their patients, and accountants worry about their profession's ethics. Many architects do not get to use their creativity, and administrators are stuck in their own rules. Middle managers, who once felt proud of their status, are losing their confidence. At the same time, companies and public institutions are getting smaller. Efforts to improve decision-making and rewards have not made employees feel more committed. In Britain, only 8% of employees feel their values match those of their organizations.
I am studying different jobs to see how they shape or harm people. I have looked at what humans can achieve in different cultures and how courage can be developed. I am now focusing on finding better ways to earn a living. There are many experts trying to help companies make more money, but we also need to understand ourselves as human beings and figure out what kind of people we want to work with. 
How many of us feel truly alive at work? How many of us feel like part-time slaves, thinking we can leave our boring jobs but feeling trapped by our qualifications and careers? For example, hotel workers make up 10% of the workforce. Many smart and lively people work in hotels for low pay and long hours because the idea of what a hotel is has not changed much since the Ritz in the 19th century. A hotel is not just a place to sleep; it is a small version of the United Nations where people from all over the world meet, often without talking to each other. 
Many hotel staff are foreigners who want to learn a new language and culture, but they have only shallow interactions with guests. Hotels could be cultural centers that connect guests with the city and each other. Hotel owners could use the knowledge of their many student employees instead of giving them only simple tasks. If they listened to their staff's true ambitions, they would see that hotels could offer many more services. However, they are often limited by accountants who say companies should focus on one main activity to make the most profit. 
It is time to rethink what this means from a human perspective, not just a financial one. For me, work is about relationships. Many people now want work that allows them to be independent and express themselves. They should have the chance to design their own jobs and choose their colleagues and customers, as long as it is practical and profitable. This means they need to learn to communicate across different professional languages and connect with people who may seem very different at first. 
Everyone knows communication is important, but it is different from real conversation. Traditional conversation is not the same as the new kind of conversation that people feel is missing today. This new conversation is more personal and creates a bond of respect between people. It helps us understand each other better and can change us. It is more than just relaxing; it is a powerful way to create equality. Every time we have a meaningful conversation, we change the world a little bit."
CPE_24,C2,"'BROADCASTING: The Social Shaping of a Technology'**
The term 'broadcasting' originally referred to the act of spreading seeds widely by hand. This idea is not just about farming; it also represents a hopeful view of modern progress. It suggests planned growth and the potential for a good outcome if conditions are right. The metaphor assumes that there are central resources available for spreading and reproducing this growth.
We need to explore why a new technology that sends words and pictures electronically was organized in a way that fits this farming metaphor. Although television is connected to two-way communication methods like the telegraph and telephone, it was designed from the beginning as a centralized 'mass' medium. This means that it was set up to send signals from a central point to private homes, which matched the social and economic structures of modern societies.
There were attempts to create different forms of television, but these remained just experiments. Two lesser-known alternatives are worth mentioning because they show what television could have been in a different social setting. In the early 1930s, radio enthusiasts in Britain experimented with two-way television as a possible replacement for regular telephones. Popular science magazines like Radio News published articles on how to build television transmitters and receivers, and many amateurs were active in this field.
However, in 1938, the British Radio Manufacturers Association established standards for television equipment and channel regulations, which pushed these grassroots innovators out of the picture. This marked the end of a chance for television to develop as a more democratic form of communication in Britain.
Broadcasting was not only influenced by strong economic interests but also by the deep structures of modern societies. Despite the efforts of TV amateurs, television was mainly used for public exhibitions in the USA during the early 1930s and was seen as a potential competitor to the film industry. In fact, throughout the 1930s, most people watched television in public places, especially in Britain and Germany.
The idea of grassroots or amateur two-way television was unlikely to succeed, while systems based on public viewing were operating in several countries during the 1930s. These systems could have challenged the idea of television as a private home entertainment medium, but this challenge did not happen. Manufacturers recognized the potential for mass sales of home television sets once prices dropped. As working-class people improved their living standards and joined consumer society from the 1920s onward, the dream of having a fully equipped home for entertainment became a reality for many in Western countries. This trend is now happening globally.
There is a clear link between social modernization and the structures of broadcasting. As societies modernized, there was more centralization of power and capital, and traditional communities broke apart, leading to new lifestyles. People became more mobile, both socially and geographically, which made them feel more isolated compared to those in stable early communities.
Centralized broadcasting was a way for governments to efficiently reach all citizens with important information and helped create a sense of community within the nation-state. The widespread nature of these processes made broadcasting the dominant form for both radio and television.
However, it is important to also consider the positive view of broadcasting as a tool for democracy. During the time between the World Wars, many countries recognized broadcasting as a way to ensure equal access to information necessary for informed participation in political, social, and cultural life.
Television is changing, and there is a risk that the term broadcasting may become outdated or insufficient. If this happens, the term will only refer to a specific way of organizing audio-visual technology during a certain centralized period of social modernization."

**Clutter**  
Sometimes, it feels like no matter how many things you own, you never feel secure. It is normal to want a comfortable home that meets your needs, but there comes a point when wanting more things becomes too much. Modern advertising is designed to make us feel insecure. One common message is that if you don’t have certain products, you are not as good as others. To see how much advertising affects you, try not to look at any billboards the next time you walk down the street. We are constantly surrounded by advertisements on television, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, t-shirts, and the internet, all telling us to buy more.
**Caves**  
Research centers and universities around the world have spent many years studying caves, focusing on their origins, water systems, and living things. Caves are a small but interesting part of nature that makes us curious and eager to learn more. Because they are natural features, caves have been studied for a long time, especially in places where they impact our lives. However, visiting many caves requires physical ability, so cave research often involves both scientists and amateur explorers who visit caves for fun.
**Weather Watch**  
Many careful observers without special tools started the study of weather, which has developed into a complex science since the 17th century. Today, satellites and electronic devices provide us with a lot of weather information quickly, and computers can solve complicated math problems much faster than humans. Meteorology uses many technical terms that can be hard to understand for most people. However, human experience is still very important in turning data into weather forecasts. Observations made by people can give valuable information that helps professionals understand the mysteries of the atmosphere."
CPE_16,C2,"**MUSIC AND THEATRE**
Until recently, I believed that opera is mainly theatre. Now, I think differently. After working at a national opera house, I learned that opera is primarily about music, and theatre comes second. This is how it should be. However, I come from the world of theatre, where the words and the actors are the most important. In theatre, once the performance starts, there is no one directing the action, and the performers and audience usually speak the same language.
At any musical performance, whether in a concert hall or an opera house, there are many people who, like me, do not have a deep understanding of music. Some may feel embarrassed about what they don’t know, while most are amazed by the talent of the performers. A brilliant singer or a skilled string section is easy to admire. Even a good musician shows us the results of years of hard work. Watching top-class music is similar to watching an athletics match. We know athletes are doing something similar to what we do when we run for a bus, but we also see how much better they are.
Theatre audiences have different expectations. They often do not understand the skills of an actor and may not be impressed by an actor delivering a long and difficult speech. They often ask, “How do you learn all those lines?” This does not mean that theatre audiences are less demanding than concert audiences; many of them are the same people. However, in theatre, audiences and performers meet on more equal terms, regardless of how challenging the material is.
The question is, does music need to learn anything from theatre about this relationship? I believe it does. I have seen how a different approach can improve the experience for concert-goers. Live music is very theatrical, full of emotions like passion, humor, sadness, and intimacy. It can also be unpredictable, reaching into the imagination of the audience as a group. 
The rules that still dominate music performances, such as strict dress codes and showing great respect for conductors and soloists, create a clear difference between performers and listeners, which can feel uncomfortable. On the other hand, when contemporary music audiences applaud between movements or after a brilliant piece, it can be a spontaneous way to show appreciation, but it can also disrupt the flow of the performance.
Is there anything that can be done? Yes, a lot is being done. Many projects are encouraging new audiences to attend concerts and operas, breaking down the barriers that make people feel that “serious” music is not for them. I remember a special event, the community opera *In Search of Angels*, which took place in different locations within a cathedral and then moved into the town. It was a wonderful musical experience, where the skills and generosity of the professional musicians were very important, and it changed many audience members' lives, as they were not just there to watch and listen but also to participate.
What I hope for in music is a bit more of the excitement and boldness that the best theatre can show. Sometimes this can come from using unusual or challenging locations, where normal expectations are changed. This can have surprising effects on both performers and audiences. People may have to give up some comforts; the sound might not be perfect, or it could be a bit cold, but theatre audiences have learned to be brave as they follow artists into unexpected places.
I know that most plays are performed in a traditional way, similar to concerts. However, I believe that something should change in how we experience music. I can only speak as a fan: I love theatre and spend as much time (and money) as I can enjoying music. I want both to succeed and for more people to experience the joy I feel as an audience member."

**Sand**  
I admire how sand can be changed into useful things like glass and concrete, but I do not like it in its natural form. To me, sand is mostly a barrier that stands between a seaside parking lot and the water. It blows in your face, gets into your food, and can hide important items like car keys and coins. When you are wet, it sticks to you and is hard to remove, even with a strong hose. However, the strange thing is that as soon as you step onto a beach towel, get into a car, or walk on a clean carpet, it falls off you easily. For days after, you find sand on the floor every time you take off your shoes, and even more when you take off your socks. Sand stays with you longer than many illnesses. So, I would prefer to avoid sand.
**Lock and Key**  
The search for a safe home, privacy, and security has existed since people first built homes. The simple lock on a door has changed to electronic locks that use plastic cards with many combinations. However, people still want to keep out the ""bad guys."" The idea of a lock and key is partly psychological. Recently, some companies have tried computerized locking systems that use smart cards to control electronic locks. But many people do not like these systems. You might accept them at work, but at home, everyone wants the comfort of using a real key. Because of this, when a locksmith company created a new electronic system, they made sure to include a real metal key.
**Modern Art**  
I was nervous about visiting the new Tate Modern gallery because, like many people, I find modern art confusing. I know I like some of it, especially furry things, neon light sculptures, and large photographs. Maybe if I knew more about it, I would have stronger opinions. However, the goal is not to understand art completely, but to let it speak to you. This is a nice idea, but it has not worked for me in the past. This new gallery tries to give visitors real insight into the reasons behind the artworks. The first thing I noticed was the labels, which provided context and explained what the art was trying to express. Instead of staring at the pictures without understanding, these pieces of information helped me to comprehend the art better."
CPE_46,C2,"**Every Picture Tells a Story**
**Adapting Novels for Film**
Turning novels into films often means cutting down the story. This can be frustrating for writers, but it can also be enlightening. While working on a script, I realized that I could remove a lot of dialogue and descriptions from a scene in the novel and still convey the same message. This does not mean that the original dialogue and descriptions were unnecessary. It is about how each medium engages the audience and the type of repetition it uses. 
In a novel, repetition can include reminding readers of a character's traits or using phrases like ""he said."" A character's trait only needs to be described once, but reminding readers helps them understand better. Usually, we can tell who is speaking in a dialogue scene from the context, but speech tags make it easier to read. 
Stage plays mostly consist of dialogue and often mimic real speech, sometimes using a lot of unnecessary language just to keep the conversation going, which can make it hard to understand the main message.
**Watching Movies**
When watching movies, people can feel like they are part of the story. It is an experience that takes them away from reality, at least for the duration of the film. However, once the movie ends and the lights come on, that feeling disappears, and they return to the real world. People often do not feel guilty about the time spent watching a film, and this escape from reality can make it hard to take movies seriously. Many from older generations, including our teachers, did not see movies as art but just as entertainment. They enjoyed being entertained but did not value films as an art form.
**The Film Studios**
The Leiper Film Company studios were made up of many different buildings. The layout was confusing, with only a few recognizable places like the Script Department. Most of the rooms looked the same and were used for both official and unofficial meetings. Finding a specific room without help was quite a challenge. 
The studio had three main entrances, which made it even more confusing for newcomers. None of the entrances had a place to ask for directions. However, there were not many strangers around, as the studio did not encourage visitors. It was assumed that the employees knew their way around. Thanks to their hard work, stories of romance and adventure would reach audiences everywhere. Couples like Jane and George, or Sally and Dick, could escape their everyday problems for at least three hours thanks to the studio's efforts.
**Film-Makers**
Many people want to make movies. Bookstores are filled with guides on scriptwriting and film production. Popular universities offer courses, and there are competitions that give away cameras like the one Robert Rodriguez used to make his film *El Mariachi*, which cost $7,000 and launched his career as an independent director. Rodriguez achieved his dreams early. On his 23rd birthday, he wrote about how Orson Welles made *Citizen Kane* at 25 and Spielberg made *Jaws* at 26, thinking he had only a few years left to make his big film.
In the past, when studios were in charge, film-makers were expected to take their time to learn the craft. They often worked behind the scenes as editors, writers, or cinematographers, starting with low-budget films. John Huston was 35 when he made his first film, *The Maltese Falcon*, and Fred Zinnemann, who directed *High Noon*, found success in his forties. Today, without the support of studios or television, new film-makers often have to work independently."
CPE_3,C2,"'In those days, the council houses were all over the western side of the city. There were many rows of small, old houses made of orange brick or pale white stucco. In summer, the chemicals from the May and Baker factory, which was two miles away, created a strange smell of sulphur around the doors and gardens. The most common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy making a face of disgust as he walked down someone’s front path. I have forgotten most of my early life, but I remember sitting near an upstairs window and looking at the houses as they disappeared into the distance. Later, I have memories of faces I cannot name, my mother ironing towels in a house that I don’t think was ours, and snow falling on the turrets of a big mansion at Earlham. It is not surprising that my mother appears in these early memories. I remember her as a small, precise, and often angry woman. I never understood why she was angry, so I could not do anything to make her feel better. Even as a child, when I went with her to the small shops in Bunnett Square or on longer trips into the city, I sensed that her personality was unusual. She was the most solitary person I have ever known, feeling alone in a room full of people. She also had a strong sense of propriety that was not common in the West Earlham estate. This sometimes led to intense spring-cleanings or strict rules about how to behave. I never fully understood her moral code, which included not going into neighbors' gardens or damaging their rose bushes while walking down the street. It meant sitting quietly for long periods in a silent dining room, with my hands folded, listening to radio programs that my mother liked. There were many rules and restrictions. Over time, other figures appeared in these strict early memories. Despite her solitude, my mother had some friends. There was Mrs. Buddery, who was obsessed with the Royal Family, Mrs. Winall, who rarely spoke except to agree with others, and Mrs. Laband, who was more lively and not always approved of by the others. Later, I realized that this trio was not good company; they often talked about their bad legs, the cold weather, and ungrateful children, a group I often felt I belonged to. Looking back, it felt like a heavy weight made of the West Earlham houses, my mother, her friends, and the pressure to 'behave properly' was on my shoulders, and I felt it was my duty to grow up and free myself from it. This was not easy. Growing up in West Earlham followed a clear pattern. Until you were five, you stayed at home and got in your parents' way. I remember long, boring days when I was about four, playing on a rug in the front room while my mother sat coldly in an armchair. Then, in September after your fifth birthday, you went to Avenue Road infants school, which was half a mile away. The lucky few had a mother with a rickety bike and a child seat. I think my mother let me go with other children in the street for this journey. If I remember anything from these early years, it is the summer holidays, when I caught glimpses of the world outside West Earlham: a vague old man next to Mrs. Buddery who told stories about his time in the Merchant Navy; a charity fair held at a house far away where a kind woman gave out lemonade and tried to get me interested in something called the League of Pity, a kind of junior charity. My mother dismissed this idea, saying the organizers were 'only after your money.' My mother often talked about people having mercenary motives, and she had the deepest contempt for politicians. If she thought of the House of Commons, she imagined it as a fancy post office where rich people opened letters filled with five-pound notes sent by gullible people. I might be exaggerating. I might overlook her good qualities and focus on her flaws. But there was little kindness in my mother; it seemed to have been taken away. To be fair, she was aware of her role in my education. Sometimes, on Sundays, she would take me in my 'good clothes' on the 85 bus to the Norwich Castle Museum. Hand-in-hand, we would walk through rooms filled with paintings by the Norwich School of Artists. My mother did not completely dislike this activity and eventually began to have opinions about the art. I remember her stopping in front of a painting of a Roman soldier in full battle gear and saying, 'Well, I wouldn't like to meet him on a dark night!' This was one of the few times I remember my mother trying to make a joke.'"
CPE_10,C2,"Philadelphia Avenue**
I walked down Philadelphia Avenue on the odd-numbered side. The evening was getting darker, and the air was humid with a light drizzle that made my walk feel secretive. I knew this side of the street very well; I remembered our neighbors, the Matzes and the Pritchards, Han Kieffer's grocery store, and the houses of my first playmates, all girls. Although I didn’t know everyone by name, each house was as familiar to me as the small troughs in the sidewalk that carried rainwater from the roofs to the street, which I often skated over on my roller skates or scooter. 
As the street sloped down, I noticed that the houses changed too: the porches became lower, and the front yards got smaller. Over the years, things changed: wooden porch railings were replaced with iron ones in a Southern or Spanish style. In Shillington, some houses I remembered as homes had turned into stores, and strangely, some stores, like Pep Conrad's and Han Kieffer's, had become homes again. I wondered how the people used those spaces and how they lived with the smells of the products that used to be sold there.
**Bachelor Fads Furniture Designer Rick Gilbert**
Rick Gilbert lives in a flat that used to be a curtain warehouse. It has the typical features of a loft, like exposed brick walls and large doors that used to let in curtains from the nearby railway. However, Gilbert did not want a completely open space. He found it hard to work when his living area was so close. To create a separate area near the entrance, he used a large piece of corrugated plastic. This helped hide his office, created a hallway, and led to the kitchen in the middle of the flat. He wanted the kitchen to be a neutral space where he could cook for friends or make coffee for clients. 
To balance the modern look of his plastic screen and stainless steel kitchen, Gilbert chose light wood for the floors. His flat is filled with modern chairs and sofas, but it also has sentimental furniture given to him by his parents or found at markets.
**Bruce Chatwin**
Bruce Chatwin was a unique and talented writer known for his adventurous life. His first book, *In Patagonia*, published in 1977, changed travel writing. It reads like a thrilling story, with the charm of romantic fiction and deep insights. However, even in this book, Chatwin mixed facts with fiction; he often changed details to make his stories more interesting or to highlight the themes of travel and discovery. He suggested that through travel, we can uncover hidden histories that are meant to inspire future explorers.
**Swimming**
During a warm summer rain, I quickly crossed the lawn behind my house and jumped into the pool. As I swam breaststroke, I kept my eyes just above the water. Each raindrop created a small splash that turned into bubbles. The best moments were when the rain got heavier, drowning out the birdsong, and steam rose from the water as if the pool was meeting the sky. 
In the summer of 1996, while enjoying this rain, I began to think about swimming across Britain. I wanted to follow the rain as it traveled to the sea, escaping the frustration of swimming back and forth in a pool, like a tiger pacing in a cage. 
Many of us live in a world where everything is labeled and explained. This makes our reality feel more like a visual experience. That’s why walking, cycling, and swimming are important; they help us reconnect with the wild and old parts of our world by getting off the main paths and discovering things for ourselves. A swimming journey would let me explore the mysterious parts of our world, like dark forests or high mountains."
CPE_67,C2,"**Crying**
Charles Darwin believed that crying did not have a clear purpose in human evolution. However, he was likely wrong. Recently, scientists have shown that crying has social importance. Psychiatrist John Bowlby emphasized how crying helps create a bond between a mother and her child. Many people think that tears, especially in children, mainly show feelings of helplessness. 
Understanding why adults cry is more difficult. It appears that the sound of crying is less important than the visual message it sends. Crying may have helped early human groups by building trust and social connections. 
There are many reasons why we cry. We might cry to show sympathy for people facing great injustice. Sometimes, we cry without meaning to, which can be embarrassing, when we hear touching music or speeches. We may also cry while watching a sad movie, and interestingly, this happens more often when we are with others than when we are alone. The social role of crying seems clear, but research is still ongoing."
CPE_27,C2,"The Heat is On**
We have all heard about global warming, but how much warmer will the Earth get, and how will it affect our lives? Most people know what global warming is, but few understand its consequences. A warmer climate is likely to change the weather in all parts of the world. Since the atmosphere is connected to everything on our planet, any climate changes will significantly affect plants, animals, water, and soil. Humans have learned to use these natural resources to our advantage, allowing us to produce food, build cities, and support billions of people. Therefore, any changes to these resources are serious.
The challenge we face is understanding how the world will change and what is causing these changes. Over the last 100 years, human actions have significantly increased the levels of certain gases in the atmosphere, which are closely related to global temperature. These increased levels are likely already affecting the global climate, but our limited knowledge makes it hard to predict the current and future situations. 
We know that greenhouse gas levels have changed in line with global temperatures over the past 40,000 years, suggesting a strong connection between the two. Evidence shows that our planet has warmed by about 6°C at the surface over the last century. Most scientists believe this warming is not entirely natural and is partly due to human pollution. 
A lot of research has been done to predict the effects of higher global temperatures. Most of this research uses computer programs called general circulation models (GCMs). These programs analyze temperature, pressure, solar radiation, and other climatic factors to predict climate conditions for the past, present, or future. However, they are simplifications of reality and have many limitations. Their results are only approximate, and they can be slow and expensive to run. 
Despite these challenges, most people agree on one important point: the rate of climate change will be faster than anything we have experienced before. The predictions from GCMs help us understand the world we will live in over the next few generations. Currently, they suggest that the average global surface temperature will increase by between 1°C and 3.5°C by the year 2100. They also predict that sea levels will rise by 15-95 cm and that rainfall patterns will change. Scientists expect extreme weather events, like heatwaves, floods, and droughts, to become more common in some areas. 
These predictions highlight the potential impact of climate change on the environment and humans. Changes in climate can affect where ecosystems, like forests and grasslands, are located, the types of species they contain, and their ability to provide benefits that societies depend on. This includes food production, water resources, and human settlements. Some effects may be irreversible and could be harmful in many areas, but not all impacts will be negative. In fact, some climate change effects may be beneficial. 
For example, in Australia, research has shown that wheat production has increased by about 0.5 tonnes per hectare since 1952, partly due to climate trends. Warmer temperatures have led to fewer frosts, which means less damage to crops. However, many predicted effects of future climate warming are concerning. Even small changes in climate can affect water availability, especially in dry regions or areas already facing shortages. 
The Mediterranean Basin is one example where decreasing rainfall has been observed. In southern Portugal, rainfall is now more concentrated in autumn and winter, with less in spring. Another worrying effect is the change in glaciers, which will impact ice and vegetation, wildlife habitats, and human structures. There is a strong chance that Arctic ice will melt completely, making marine transport easier but increasing the risk of icebergs.
One of the most dramatic effects of global warming will be rising sea levels. This will happen because warmer water takes up more space and because of melting ice. Since about half of the world's population lives in coastal areas, rising sea levels could have severe consequences. Increased flooding is a likely result, affecting cities like London, New York, and Tokyo. Many people could lose their homes and jobs, leading to millions of environmental refugees. 
The most serious consequences may be faced by small, low-lying island nations, which could disappear if worst-case scenarios happen. This would be devastating for the people and cultures of these islands, as well as for the countries that would need to take in those who have been displaced."

Wanted: a middle-aged, married couple for a 501-day round trip to Mars. Applicants must be physically and emotionally strong. This will be the profile of the first astronauts on Mars if multi-millionaire Dennis Tito's plans to launch a capsule on January 5, 2018, succeed. The capsule will take the crew to about 160 km above Mars. The spacecraft will use Mars' gravity to return to Earth without using extra fuel, as fuel efficiency is very important. The 2018 deadline is set because the next time Mars and Earth will be in the right position for a launch is in 2031. It is a challenging task, but there is a race to develop new technologies. If these technologies are ready in time, the spacecraft might succeed. Even if it never leaves Earth, the work done to reach these goals will help future missions.'"
CPE_44,C2,"**AESTHETICS**
Sometimes, the existence of art makes it harder to understand art itself. This is because art is often seen as just the physical object, like a building, book, painting, or statue, rather than what it means to people. The true value of art comes from how it affects our experiences. However, the beauty and long history of some artworks can create ideas that prevent new ways of thinking about them. When a piece of art becomes a classic, it can feel disconnected from the human experiences that created it and the feelings it brings to life.
When art is separated from its origins and its impact on our lives, it becomes difficult to see its true meaning. Art is then treated as something separate from other human activities. A key task for anyone writing about art is to connect these refined experiences with everyday life, which includes our common activities and struggles.
Just like mountains are part of the earth, art is part of human experience. Those who study the earth, like geographers and geologists, show how this connection works. Similarly, those who study art must also show how art relates to everyday life. To truly understand art, we sometimes need to set it aside and focus on the ordinary experiences that we usually don’t think of as artistic. 
For example, while we can enjoy flowers for their beauty and smell without knowing about plants, understanding how they grow requires knowledge about soil, air, water, and sunlight. To grasp the deeper meaning of art, we must start with the simple experiences that catch our attention and bring us joy.
Many people today find joy in things they don’t consider art, like movies, jazz, comic strips, and even sensational news stories. When art is only seen in museums and galleries, people often seek enjoyment in their daily lives instead. Even those who disagree with the traditional view of art may still hold onto the idea that art is separate from everyday experiences. However, the best appreciation of art happens when it is closely connected to the ordinary things we do."
CPE_22,C2,"Observing Lions**
In popular culture, lions hunting for food are seen as amazing teamwork. As the sun sets, a group of lions quietly comes out of the shadows and surrounds their unsuspecting prey. They appear to be perfect social animals, working together for a common goal: their next meal. However, after many years of studying these animals in the wild, we have a different view. When we began our research in 1978, we wanted to understand why lions hunt together, raise cubs, and scare off rivals with their loud roars. If we measure an animal's success by how many offspring it raises, then cooperation might not be beneficial. If one animal is too generous, its friends may take advantage of it. So, why do lions seem to ignore the rules of self-interest? We thought we would find the answer in two to three years, but lions are very good at being inactive. We would add lions to the list of unreactive noble gases like krypton, argon, and neon. Therefore, we needed different research methods to learn about their behavior. Since wild lions can live up to 18 years, we are only now starting to find answers to our questions.
**Pop Music Review**
The release of Bedrock's third album was a significant moment for a talented band that had struggled before. ""New Life"" started a movement that changed rock music in this country for the rest of the decade. Gone were the serious themes and dull sounds of the past; instead, a lighter mix of catchy local styles emerged. This album combined social commentary and strong emotions with sounds from fairground organs and brass bands. Humor and irony were prominent, and the singers proudly expressed their backgrounds. The album showed Bedrock as skilled collectors and observers, as well as talented songwriters. They playfully explored traditional English themes like sunbathing and Sunday afternoons. However, the album's true strength was in its deep, emotional tracks like ""So Low,"" a beautiful song about weather, and ""To the Brink,"" a serious ballad. The beauty of ""New Life"" lies in its high quality - 16 tracks with no filler, which is impressive in an era of long CDs.
**Extract from an Autobiography**
As a child, I was always interested in stories about 'The Sibyl,' wise women who had great influence in the ancient world. At first, I only knew of one from a story my mother told me. An old woman from Cumae offered Tarquin, the King of Rome, nine books for 300 gold pieces. When he refused, she burned three of them and offered him six for the same price. When he refused again, she burned three more. He finally bought the last three for the full price. I understood even then that there was a deep lesson in this story about sales and life. I was often a lonely only child. I would ask to play with other kids, but they would say no. My mother advised me to do something so interesting that the other children would want to join me. It worked, and it is a lesson I have never forgotten. When I had the chance to write a travel book, I needed to find a topic that mattered to me. I am not a keen traveler; at the first chance, I sent my editor a long list of places I did not want to visit. In the end, I am only interested in ruins because I prefer to travel through time in my mind.
**What Happens to Your Manuscript?**
When you send your manuscript, it will likely join a pile of other submissions waiting to be reviewed, known as the slush pile. The person reviewing it is usually either a junior member of the editorial team (often under 18) or an experienced freelancer who works a few mornings a week. Neither has much power, but they want to find something original. The junior hopes to make a name for themselves and find a new author, while the experienced freelancer wants to keep their job. If they think your novel is good, they will pass it to a senior editor, and it will eventually be discussed in a meeting. The editor who supports your novel must explain why it should be accepted based on its quality and potential sales. They also need to consider if you, as an author, seem like a long-term prospect, which you should have assured them of in your letter. Additionally, they will think about how marketable you are, which is important because a new novel needs all the support it can get. For this reason, publishers often like to meet potential authors before making an offer."
CPE_39,C2,"Advertising on Trial**
If you work for an advertising agency, the early 1990s may have been very challenging for you. The recession was worse than expected, affecting many industrialized countries for thirty years. In Britain, in 1991, the economy shrank, interest rates were very high, and consumer spending dropped on almost everything except basic needs. More than half a million people lost their jobs, and around 75,000 homes were taken back by banks. Every business was impacted, with some industries, like vehicles and construction, seeing a 30% decline. Many people and companies around the world suffered.
Advertising professionals were not the only ones losing their jobs during this tough time, but those who remained often felt a lot of pressure. They were seen as responsible for helping their companies make money, which meant they were closely watched by their colleagues and bosses. They also faced the challenge of doing their difficult jobs with smaller budgets. They were told that they needed to do more with less. 
Despite these challenges, the importance of marketing grew. Companies began to realize they should create products and services that customers actually wanted, rather than just what was easy for them to make. Over the past ten to fifteen years, many companies started to take marketing seriously. As a result, marketing activities received more attention from management, and some brands began to be marketed effectively. This increased the status of marketing professionals, but it also added to their workload.
Marketing is often mistakenly seen as a solution to all problems. Since about half of marketing budgets go to advertising, the pressure is on advertising professionals to deliver results. While the 1980s were a good time for advertising, the early 1990s brought the worst downturn in a generation. This was partly due to the economic situation, but there were also deeper changes that would not go away when the economy improved. 
During the recession, many clients reviewed their advertising budgets and became more critical of the effectiveness of advertising. They wanted to see clear evidence of the benefits of their spending. With a strong desire to account for every dollar spent, many companies questioned what they were getting in return for their advertising investments. Advertising, which has always faced skepticism, was under more scrutiny than ever.
Client companies expressed their needs clearly: they wanted better strategies, targeting, creativity, media placement, and thinking. They aimed to get the best people from advertising agencies to work on their projects and to motivate them to produce excellent work. While this situation does not necessarily call for sympathy for the advertising industry, it does mean that many advertising professionals still face the same challenges as their clients: how to achieve more with less.
In addition to these challenges, other factors made creating effective advertising even harder. Some of these were direct results of the recession, such as debates over production costs and a reluctance to take risks, which are often essential for good advertising. Other changes were happening regardless of the economy, including significant demographic shifts, the growing power of retailers, changing consumer needs, the rise of sponsorship, and stricter legal rules on advertising. Some companies also faced the new challenge of advertising in foreign markets.
Together with the economic situation, these issues forced advertising professionals to reconsider the saying by Lord Leverhulme: ""Only half my advertising works. The trouble is I don't know which half."" Now, more than ever, there is pressure to increase the effectiveness of advertising. Unfortunately, help for those who want to improve is not easily available. Companies and advertising agencies have been too busy dealing with these challenges to discuss them openly. Those who have managed to succeed often want to keep their successful strategies private. 
As a result, while conferences and seminars may offer some useful information, the available books on advertising often do not provide practical guidance. Many of these books treat the advertising process with too much respect, suggesting that the work produced by advertising agencies is always of the highest quality and value, which is not true and does not help the employees responsible for the advertising."
CPE_18,C2,"**The Lure of the Kitchen**
When I was at university, I decided I wanted to be a chef. This was an unusual choice among my friends. Most people did not want to work in cooking. It seemed like a hard job. Chefs often have long hours, a lot of pressure, and they do not get paid well. However, these reasons did not stop me. I was not happy at university. The work was difficult, and the social life felt closed and self-important. Being a chef seemed like a good escape from the stress of university life. It promised a seriousness and honesty that I felt was missing in my college experience.
My desire to cook was not just a reaction to being a student. It also came from my love for food. I first realized this when I had a meal at a famous restaurant in London. It was an amazing experience. I still remember my starter. After that meal, I wanted to kneel and thank the chef who made it. I felt happy for days. This made me want to learn the secrets of cooking. I changed my student life into a preparation for becoming a chef. My history degree felt unimportant, and I focused on cooking by reading cookbooks, visiting markets, and making special meals.
**Extract from a Novel**
The swimming instructor at my school was a tough man, small and muscular, with tattoos on his arms. When I asked him to teach me how to dive, he told me to sit on the edge of the pool, put my hands above my head, and roll forward, pushing off with my feet. I practiced this until the hour was over. The next time, he had me stand up and dive off the edge. He was strict, and every time I came up from the water, he looked at me with disapproval: ""Don't look down, look up!"" ""Keep your legs straight."" ""Point your toes!"" The following week, I went up to the high diving board. It felt very high as I stood there, trying to gather my courage. Slowly, the noise around me faded, and I felt like I was in a bubble of silence. I waved my arms as I had been taught, tried to look up, and jumped into the air. For a moment, I felt like I was flying. When I hit the water, I fell awkwardly, and my legs were everywhere. The instructor looked at me with disappointment and shook his head. But even he could not take away my happiness. I thought, ""This is what they mean by 'free as a bird.'""
**The Traveller**
For those of us who value a comfortable bed, running water, and the chance to live until tomorrow, the idea of a traveller seems strange and fascinating. These are people who choose to take risks, like climbing dangerous mountains or sailing alone on small boats. They might eat insects if there is nothing else to eat and can live for months in uncertain conditions. It is easy to see them as odd or eccentric, like hermits or extreme sports enthusiasts. While they exist, their unusual world is far from our daily lives, and we can easily ignore it, happy to return to our own lives with microwaves and phones, where the risks are more predictable.
**SAILING**
Jonathan Raban is afraid of the sea, which is probably why he spends so much time on it. He does not say he is a world-class sailor, but he is skilled. His main reason for sailing is that, as a writer, he enjoys writing about his experiences. Sailing gives him stories to tell. Raban's small boat has a device that tells sailors their exact location anywhere in the world. While he appreciates this tool, he also believes that the invention of the compass was a mistake. He thinks it changed how people relate to the sea. Since the compass was invented, sailors focus on it instead of observing the waves and feeling the ocean. The sea, which used to be full of life, has become just a space to navigate. Because of this, a sailor can often let an autopilot take over, which may be why Raban has time to study the waves closely."
CPE_62,C2,"**Holiday Reading**
Summer gives us two great joys: escaping home and reading books. These joys are closely connected. Books can help us feel more at home in the world. We can relate our own experiences to those in great books written long ago or in faraway places. There are fewer types of people than there are individuals, so in the stories of others, we find our own thoughts and feelings. Authors can express feelings we thought we were alone in having, using words we might struggle to find. What we feel shy or confused about is clearly described in their writing, which is even more surprising if the author is from a different time or place. We feel thankful to these authors for reminding us of who we are.
Through reading and traveling, we escape the dullness of our daily routines. Our eyes are most open during the first few days in a new place, just as they are when we read a great book. A good book can show us things we might have ignored before. Our minds become more aware of the details around us, like the colors of the sky, the expressions on people's faces, or feelings we didn’t know we had.
**Author's Note**
These reflections on travel were published as articles in the Observer newspaper over seven years. I have made some small changes to fit the articles better, but not much else. I corrected a few mistakes, but only minor details. Looking back, I could have made more improvements, but that would have taken too long. For example, in my second article about China, I thought the Hong Kong dollar would stay strong, but a year later it fell. If I rewrote it to include that prediction, it would no longer be a report of what I experienced at that time. Like any traveler in Southeast Asia or anywhere else, I was there, not knowing what would happen next, just trying to understand what had already happened. This is the real story of modern air travel: the world opening up to people who can afford a ticket. However, I don’t believe all my fellow travelers were completely unaware. Even a postcard can have a purpose.
**Ecotourism**
If there were awards for tourism phrases that have been misused, ""ecotourism"" would win first prize. This term first appeared in the early 1980s, when people became more aware of the environment and tour operators realized that many travelers wanted to ensure their trips would not harm the places they visited. It quickly became a popular marketing term for holidays. Today, ""ecotourism"" can mean anything from a two-week stay with remote tribes to a one-hour boat trip through an Australian gorge. Any tour that includes cultural experiences, beautiful nature, wildlife, or a bit of adventure is likely to be called ecotourism. While the original idea was to help travelers make informed choices, the lack of clear rules and definitions has left many confused in the ecotourism market.
**Transylvanian Journey**
I lost my notebook from my trip to Transylvania for 50 years, but I found it again a few years ago by chance. It has helped me remember that time and write about it, but it wasn’t always as helpful as I hoped. In Transylvania, I had a much easier time than I expected, moving from one welcoming house to another and often staying for weeks. When I stayed in one place for a long time, I stopped writing because I thought there was nothing to record. I was slow to start writing again when I moved on, and sometimes I only made quick notes instead of writing a full story. Worried that some details might be out of order when I began writing this book, I added many warnings and explanations. But then I realized that these pages were not meant to be a guidebook, so I let the story unfold without too many restrictions."
CPE_49,C2,"Fashion and Writing**
**Fashion**  
Fashion is often thought of as a modern idea that developed with capitalism in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. However, many fashion historians argue that fashion, in terms of style and design, has a long history. They often start their discussions with the growth of trade in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. As societies have become more complex, populations have grown, and new technologies for making different types of clothing have emerged, the meanings of dress have also become more complex. Because of this, it is hard to say exactly what any piece of clothing means today. For example, a man's suit, which is often seen as a sign of uniformity, can have very different meanings depending on the context and the person.
**Writing**  
Reports about publishers fighting over popular new books can give a false idea of what life is like for most novelists. For those of us who are not best-selling authors, there are two main ways to make a living. The smartest writers work full-time jobs and write in the evenings, so they have a backup plan if their book is not quickly published or made into a movie. Others, like me, take on various small jobs, such as teaching, running workshops, and writing articles. I have heard of a writing job at a chocolate factory, but I have never found anything like that. Somehow, by balancing part-time jobs and using credit cards, and often thanks to the help of friends mentioned in the Acknowledgements, I manage to write my novel.
**Sudden Fame**  
The small places we performed in around the country were starting to sell out, and we needed extra security to manage the growing number of excited fans. We had to use secret entrances to avoid being overwhelmed by our followers. On the few nights we were not working, it was hard to leave the house without being chased by fans. In just a few days, we became celebrities. Our fans watched our every move, and our management took care of all our needs. Although I still felt shy, it was mixed with a strange, naive confidence that only people who are usually shy can understand. In short, I felt completely out of my comfort zone."
CPE_31,C2,"Music - The Challenge Ahead**
Technological advances are changing our lives at work, home, and during our free time. Susan Hallam talks about how these changes affect music in Britain. In the late 20th century, there was a quick increase in ways to listen to music, such as through radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, videos, and new multimedia technologies. However, there has been a decrease in live music performances and full-time jobs for professional musicians. 
It is clear that access to music will keep growing, as it meets many human needs. On a national level, no important state event is without music. For individuals, music offers many activities, both formal and informal. A society without music is hard to imagine. The question is not if there will be music in the 21st century, but what kind of music it will be and whether people will still want to learn to play musical instruments. I believe that people will continue to want to learn instruments. 
The music industry is a major source of income in Britain, and musical skills will remain important for many jobs, especially in media-related fields. Besides its job-related importance, there is growing evidence that playing an instrument can help develop skills at a young age. Research in the USA suggests that listening to or making music positively affects spatial reasoning, which is one way to measure intelligence. While these results need more confirmation, studies in Europe show that group music lessons can improve social relationships in schools and help young children focus better, especially those with behavioral issues.
Current research is also looking into how playing an instrument might help develop skills that can be used in other areas. For example, regular practice can help create good study habits and focus, while performing in concerts can teach punctuality and organization. Because of these reasons, there will likely be a continued demand for instrumental teaching in the near future.
What about the long-term future? Will there be a change in focus, and if so, what will it be? There are many possibilities, but I believe two are likely. First, the types of music people listen to will become more varied, with new genres combining different styles. Second, technology will be used more to create and perform music, making it easier to compose without needing advanced technical skills. However, this may also reduce the need for live performances and musicians focused only on that.
At the same time, more people of all ages will want to participate in making music. These activities will likely be community-based and reflect the musical traditions of those communities. If this future is to happen, what should the music profession do to prepare? 
The focus of instrumental teaching will need to change. We must find ways for more people to learn different instruments throughout their lives. This will require changes in the instrumental curriculum and how we measure progress, making them relevant to a wider audience. 
Training for musicians will be crucial. They will need to inspire and teach learners of all ages, work with large and diverse groups, and develop skills in communication, social interaction, entrepreneurship, and management for community work. This is a big change from traditional methods and will require a response to demands for public accountability. 
Positively, this is an opportunity for everyone involved in music education to show the high quality of music teaching available. Finally, we must work to raise the importance of music itself. Music is vital in our lives, but it is often taken for granted. Those in the music profession at all levels need to work together to make sure this changes."
CPE_58,C2,"**The Actor's Craft**
Sometimes, actors face criticism and disrespect. Much of this negative opinion comes from the actors themselves when they are asked to talk about their work in interviews. Instead of giving a thoughtful answer like the dancer Pavlova, who said, ""If I could tell you, I wouldn't dance it,"" actors often use boring clichés or get caught up in gossip. Paul Scofield once wrote to a friend that an actor's work is only interesting when it is performed. He believed that discussing it makes it feel empty and unimportant. Each time an actor performs, they start fresh, learning about their character and the writer's ideas. After a play ends, they feel empty until they perform again, and this emptiness shows in discussions about acting.
**A Review of Hamlet**
Adrian Lester's performance as Hamlet is a mix of boyhood and manhood, and it is both simple and confident. He skillfully handles the text and shows great control over his body and emotions. Lester portrays a young man filled with anger but also uses humor, making his character both strong and lovable. His performance is impressive, even if it seems understated. You can see how Lester's body language shows a character waiting to be brought to life. Similarly, Handy's portrayal of Horatio suggests a character moved by a force he understands and does not understand. This raises questions about acting: Is it just copying real behavior, or is it something deeper? What brings these characters to life, both morally and physically? This is a key question in theatre.
**One Director's Approach to Rehearsal**
This director's rehearsal process starts with a method called ""dropping in."" The stage manager shows the script on a screen while the actors listen quietly. When it is their turn to speak, they look at the screen, think about the first line, and find the reason to speak. For example, if the line is, ""Queuing all night, the rain, do you remember?"" they take a breath and let the thought come to them. They might picture a queue at a bus stop or a concert from their past. After visualizing the scene, they find the impulse to say the line. This director encourages actors to be open-minded and trust that something will happen during the rehearsal.
**The Perfect Theatre**
The perfect theatre should make you feel that your presence matters. Attending a live performance is special, and the staff should understand this. It feels isolating if the people working at the theatre seem uninterested. The theatre should create a connection between the performers and the audience. Audience members should feel close enough to hear and see everything happening on stage. The design of the auditorium is important; it should fit the human voice and body. If the space is too large, it can feel wrong because drama is about the human experience. Many theatres built in the late 1800s got this right by creating spaces that embrace the stage. I appreciate theatres that have a sense of history, like old stone steps in a church, which show layers of human presence. When it comes to plays, you can't please everyone. You can't predict what the audience will want to see. When you go to the theatre, you want to experience something unexpected; otherwise, you might as well stay home."
CPE_37,C2,"**Text:**
**Paul Simon**  
Rock and roll in the 1950s was mainly a music style for young people, but it also had a big effect on the middle class and older adults. It opened the door for the next generation of rock stars, who listened to it with excitement, knowing that this new and unusual sound would be important in their lives. For Paul Simon, like many other young people in the US, the best way to hear this exciting music was through Alan Freed's radio show, Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party. Freed's show was very popular among young people who wanted to become rock stars. Just like young John Lennon, who was 3,000 miles away in Liverpool, listening to Radio Luxembourg - the only European station playing rock and roll - Paul Simon was captivated by the music from Freed's show. He was getting ready to take the next big step for a teenager who loved rock and roll: moving from listening to making his own music.
**Snow**  
I could not see a clear path, but I thought I would be okay if I walked carefully. The wind was strong, pushing me down as I slipped on the icy ground. Suddenly, the snow that looked safe gave way beneath me. I fell into a hole about four feet deep. The snow had formed a roof over the space between two rocks, and when it melted, it left only a thin layer that I fell through. I pulled myself out, feeling shaken and scared, and I wondered what I would have done if the hole had been thirty feet deep. I sat against a pine tree that was sticking out of the snow to think about what to do next. In an hour, I had only gone about half a mile. It was clear that I would have to change my plans.
**Qualitative Research**  
There are many books that try to help researchers understand qualitative research. While a lot has been written about how to collect data, these books often do not explain how to analyze that data. There is still a lot of mystery about how researchers study their data. Because of this, we asked different social scientists who have worked on qualitative projects to talk about the methods they used. The goal was to share their experiences and understanding of qualitative data analysis, not to create a guidebook for new researchers. This task involves making complex processes easier to understand. While this may seem simple, we have found it to be quite challenging. Therefore, we have allowed our contributors to present their work in different styles, including personal stories and more formal writing."

**Screen Learning**  
A few days ago, I saw my six-year-old son eating noodles in a funny way. He was pulling them up with his teeth and pretending to be fierce. ""I'm a little dinosaur,"" he said. He was acting out a scene from a recent TV show, so I asked him what he remembered about dinosaurs. He didn’t remember much. Many people are excited about learning through the internet and computers, but is this a good way to learn? One writer shared his experience with an interactive program he tried with his son. The father read the words while the son played with the pictures. The father thought that if his son had spent ten minutes reading a book, he might have learned something. Research shows that learning happens best in an environment where there is conversation with teachers or parents. Technology can help teach our children, but traditional education is still very important.
**Hollywood**  
By 1918, most of the world’s film-making had moved to Hollywood. The local people did not like this change, seeing their neighborhood in Los Angeles affected by these newcomers. However, they eventually accepted it because success is an important American value. Success is measured by how much money a film makes. Hollywood knows a good film when it sees one; it can make a star and bring in profits. In less than a hundred years, Hollywood has changed from a small village to a town as famous as New York, Rome, or Paris. Physically, it has changed a lot; a hundred years ago, you would walk through orange groves to get to the village store. Yet, in some ways, it still feels like a village, with a narrow focus on films: how much money they make, who is dating whom, and who is working on which project. Many successful people try to leave Hollywood to live elsewhere, but it remains the main place for anyone in show business.
**Photography**  
Photography was created by artists in the nineteenth century as a new way to capture images. These artists wanted a lasting record of what they saw, and photography gave them that. The combination of light, lenses, and special surfaces created images that were more detailed and realistic than paintings, which took much longer to create. This upset many traditional artists. They initially enjoyed the new images but later claimed that photography could not be considered art because it relied too much on machines. Despite this, photographers believed they had discovered a new art form. They used photography to express their views of the world, just as other artists used brushes and pencils.
**Book Illustration**  
During the time of black-and-white book illustrations, it was common for every children's book to have illustrations. This also applied to many novels for older children, although fewer copies were printed over time. The children's publishing industry was active but often low-budget, leading to many average-quality works. However, the best artists always tried to do their best. The collection of black-and-white illustrations is a mix of valuable and less valuable works, making it a great place for research or casual browsing. Many of these treasures will be shown to the public again, either through new editions of classic books or exhibitions of original illustrations. There are signs that interest in this period is growing, and soon, a creative publisher will likely produce a series of classic children's book illustrations from this time."
CPE_68,C2,"Blogging: Sharing with Caution**
Not long ago, a website warned about the dangers of public check-ins, which are online announcements of where you are. The website's message was clear: when you say, ""Hey, I'm at this place,"" you are also telling everyone where you are, including people you might not want to meet. This shows that there can be negative effects from sharing too much online. 
The internet gives us many chances to share our lives with a global audience, which can seem exciting: wealth, fame, and more. However, we often jump into this online world without thinking and end up feeling lost. It might sound sad, but there is hope. The early internet users, known as bloggers, have already faced these challenges. They explored the internet before social media existed, experiencing both successes and failures.
One of these early bloggers was Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student who started sharing his life online in January 1994. At that time, the web was mostly used by graduate students and scientists. Hall saw a chance to share his personal experiences. He created a blog where he wrote about his life and included photos and art. In January 1996, he began posting daily, attracting many readers who were interested in his bold approach to blogging. Hall was open about everything, and while some saw him as an exhibitionist, others appreciated the artistic side of his work.
However, one day, visitors to his blog found it replaced by a video called Dark Night. Hall shared that he had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it, his partner told him to choose between the blog and the relationship. Hall felt that sharing his life online made people distrust him. The blog ended, but the issue of sharing personal information online remains.
In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a young woman in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, a colleague sent her blog link to the company's vice presidents, including some she had criticized, which led to her losing her job. This situation illustrates what experts call the ""online distribution effect,"" where people feel they can say things online that they would never say in person. However, our online lives are connected to our real lives, and ignoring this can lead to serious mistakes.
Armstrong's story had a happy ending. After taking a break from blogging, she got married and started a new blog focused on her family. Today, she is a well-known ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her family. Once known for her online mistakes, she has learned to share her life more carefully. Armstrong's experience teaches us an important lesson: just because we can say anything online, it doesn't mean we should."
CPE_23,C2,"Enough Sleep?**
Tiredness is often seen as a common problem today. In wealthier and busier countries, sleeplessness and anxiety have increased. Research in the USA shows that 40 million Americans suffer from chronic sleep issues. Some popular novels in Britain have characters who cannot sleep or are set in sleep research labs. This growing interest in sleep includes its patterns, its importance, and the problems people face with it. A leading sleep researcher states, ""People need more sleep."" Many people reduce their sleep when they are busy, often waking up early to avoid traffic.
Recently, a sleep researcher conducted an experiment. He let participants sleep for up to 14 hours a night for a month. After three weeks, they settled into an average of eight hours and fifteen minutes of sleep. This shows that they needed more sleep than they were getting.
In Europe, a university sleep research lab in the English Midlands has studied various topics, including how tiredness affects sailors, how airport noise impacts sleep, and the dangers of driving when tired. They recruit participants through student newspapers. Participants are picked up by taxi, paid £5 an hour, and asked to change their sleeping habits based on instructions. Dr. Louise Reyner reassures participants, saying, ""Some people worry because we put electrodes on their heads, thinking we can see their dreams or thoughts."" However, the lab focuses more on physical aspects of sleep.
In a dark room, there is a driving simulator with a large screen. Participants are told to come at 2 PM, which is when people usually feel sleepy, especially after little or no sleep. They drive while answering questions. The road ahead seems endless, with bright sunlight and warm air. The young men insist they will not fall asleep. Dr. Reyner has a video of one participant trying hard to stay awake. At first, he sits up straight, but then he starts to blink more often and his head begins to droop. Eventually, he falls asleep for about ten seconds, waking up suddenly. By the second or third time, the car has gone off the road. Dr. Reyner suggests that drinking coffee can help. Two cups can make someone a safer driver for at least half an hour. She also recommends energy products like tablets and caffeinated gum, especially for shift workers.
But what else do we know about sleep? It is known that humans, like other mammals, sleep in a daily cycle. When asleep, we go through four stages, from light sleep to deep sleep. Dreams usually happen during light sleep, and the brain temporarily paralyzes the body to prevent injuries. Beyond this, many ideas about sleep are not certain. Some believe sleep helps repair the body or rest the brain, but it might also happen during relaxed wakefulness.
Scientists agree that women sleep about half an hour longer than men, and older people need less sleep, though the reasons are unclear. Some researchers say, ""Sleep is a way to travel through time without getting hurt."" 
People's sleep patterns have changed over time. A history professor studied British sleep habits from 1500 to 1850 and found that people went to bed early, woke up after midnight for a while, and then went back to sleep. This time was used for thinking, remembering dreams, or even stealing. The poorest people benefited most from this quiet time, escaping their daily struggles. By the 17th century, with more artificial light, wealthy people began to adopt the sleep patterns we have today. The industrial revolution later forced most people to work longer hours in lighted buildings.
However, in many non-western cultures, the old sleep patterns still exist. According to an anthropologist, some societies do not have strict bedtimes. People sleep for a few hours, then wake up again. The idea of a full night’s sleep is not common. In certain tribal societies, noises from humans and animals, as well as the need to watch over fires and protect against predators, make it hard to sleep continuously. It seems that people everywhere are in need of more sleep."
CPE_60,C2,"'We are talking about big cowboy boots. Really big boots. I stood in my expensive designer cowboy boots on the rocks in the Arizona desert. Money was not a problem. I wore a full cowboy outfit, and if you had the outfit, you might be a cowboy. But I was not. It wasn't working for me. I squinted into the morning sun, looking at the Arizona mountains, and I had to admit that I did not feel at home. I flew in from Denver just after dawn, thinking I might look like a cowboy coming from the sky. But that feeling disappeared when I saw a real cowboy in the luggage area of Phoenix airport. He was wearing a dirty t-shirt, needed a shave, and was carrying a worn bag when he noticed my new cowboy boots. He raised one eyebrow and walked out without looking back. 
There should be a suit of clothes that an ex-racing driver can wear without feeling out of place. Something that makes him feel comfortable wherever he goes. I loved being a racing driver and driving racing cars. I am addicted to it, and it is all I know how to do. But I don’t do it anymore. I couldn’t even if I wanted to. I thought about what I should do now. A racing driver should have one or two backup plans for when he stops racing. I thought I had some, but when I tried to reach for them, they disappeared. 
How about being a commentator at the racetrack? There were many former Indy and Formula One drivers wanting to be commentators. Or maybe I could sell classic cars? That plan lasted all winter with phone calls, lunches, lawyers, and meetings with bankers. But it was a bad year for selling old Ferraris, so I decided to step back before I lost everything. 
Being an 'ex' anything is hard. How much do you want to hear about how I almost became the World Champion? Nobody wants to hear a story that ends with 'almost.' Even if I had been the champion, you would probably only want to hear the story for a few minutes before getting bored. Last year’s champion is last year. I don’t want sympathy, and I don’t get any. Why should I? I had a good career, made money, and saved enough. But I miss the excitement of getting into that powerful racing car. I miss the thrill of going from zero to one hundred and fifty miles an hour in 4.9 seconds. I even miss the danger of racing. 
I miss the bright and interesting people and the reporters who acted like what I said was important. Being famous, even a little, has its perks. Businessmen and politicians liked to tell their friends they knew me. Little boys would sneak under fences to get my autograph. And now that I don’t drive anymore, I have a lot of free time. Just last week, the phone rang twice. I have time in the morning and afternoon, and tomorrow looks free too. I looked up at the clear blue sky. There were no buzzards flying above. Maybe Arizona doesn’t have buzzards. But a couple of small brown birds in a cactus nearby were warning me to leave their nest alone. I never thought the desert had songbirds. I realized that a fake cowboy in designer boots still has a lot to learn.'"
CPE_1,C2,"Vancouver**
In the last ten years, many people from around the world have moved to Vancouver, in western Canada. In the evenings, residents walk through the city streets, and if you join them, you will likely hear different languages being spoken. People come to Vancouver for its mild weather, beautiful location between the ocean and mountains, clean and safe environment, and good educational and job opportunities. Although some locals may complain about how quickly new buildings are being built, it is clear that the new residents and growing tourism have helped improve the city. In the past, locals called Vancouver 'Terminal City' because it was a gateway to other places. Although this name is not used as much now, Vancouver is still a major gateway.
**Putting Pen to Paper**
Journalists like me are often not good at writing letters. Some say this is because we do not like to write for free, but I think it is more about how we try to make our writing very effective in our work. This focus on effect can make writing a letter feel less spontaneous. A true artist, who may rewrite their work many times, does not have this problem. I believe that understanding the impact of their words is a key sign of a real artist. When Shakespeare wrote his famous lines, he probably did not think about how the use of long words made them powerful and showed his talent.
**Supermarket Opening**
Opening a new supermarket used to be a big event in Britain. You could always expect a celebrity, like a soap star or a member of the royal family, to come and cut the ribbon. Now, new supermarkets seem to open every day, and celebrities are no longer needed. Why pay a famous person when anyone can open it for free? Last week, waiting customers did not care who opened the new Superbuy store, as long as they were at the front of the line. According to one customer who knew someone working there, the first five men to enter would receive a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women would get a bunch of flowers. This news quickly spread through the crowd, making those at the front feel proud and causing envy among those who arrived late."
CPE_53,C2,"Citizen Kane**
When the film *Citizen Kane* was released in 1941, there was a lot of excitement around it. However, it did not do well at the box office. It was only when it was shown on television that people started to remember it. This film has inspired many people to become filmmakers, which is surprising because it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles believed that its success came from the fact that he did not know the rules of filmmaking, so he just went for it. He had a great team, including cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and special-effects expert Linwood Dunn. When Welles and Mankiewicz decided to create a story about a newspaper owner who was similar to but not exactly like Hearst, Welles realized he had found the perfect role for himself as both director and actor, and he took the opportunity with great enthusiasm.
**Dermot and Carmel**
That morning, Dermot thought Carmel was acting a bit strange. He had mentioned twice that he might be late and that he might stop at the golf club on his way home. He wanted to talk to someone, and that was the best place to do it. Carmel had nodded her head as if she didn’t really hear him. “Will you be okay? What are you going to do today?” he asked. She smiled and replied, “It’s funny you ask. I was just thinking I have nothing to do today, so I will walk downtown and look at the shops. I feel like it’s almost wrong to waste the day like this.” Dermot smiled back, saying, “You deserve to enjoy yourself. And if I’m late, I won’t need anything to eat, so don’t worry about it.” “That’s fine,” she said.
**Title Race**
“Tea boy? Do you mind? I’m a mobile lukewarm beverage resource facilitator.” Human nature can be very funny. A recent study showed that job titles are a major cause of jealousy and problems at work. A survey by a well-known recruitment company found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees believe that job titles create divisions among coworkers. Most surprisingly, the survey revealed that 70% of office workers would give up a pay raise for a more “motivational” or “professional” job title. If our desire for better titles is so strong that it overcomes our basic need for money, we are in trouble. In the early twenty-first century, no one wants to be called “subordinate.” The job titles being discussed focus on skills (like specialist or coordinator) but are really just fancy words."
CPE_55,C2,"**The Vienna Assignment**
I was in Vienna to take photographs. This was usually the reason I traveled. Photography was more than just my job; it was a big part of my life. The way light fell on different surfaces always inspired me. I loved how one picture could capture the essence of a time, a place, or a person. I believed that one day, I might take the perfect photograph. As long as I had film in my camera, there was always a chance. I would finish one roll, load another, and keep looking with open eyes. This was my way of working, and I had followed it for a long time.
Once, I got lucky when a photo of a smoke plume from a burning oil well became very popular. It was a brief moment of fame, but it was mostly just luck. They say you create your own luck, both good and bad. After that, I decided to work as a freelance photographer. It should have been a smart move, but life had other plans. The mid-nineties were not as successful as I had hoped, especially after my photo made it to the cover of Time magazine. That’s why I found myself in Vienna instead of somewhere more exciting. But I was still taking photographs, and I was getting paid for it. That didn’t sound too bad to me.
The assignment came about by chance. I had taken photos in London for a picture book called *Four Cities in Four Seasons*—which included London, Paris, Rome, and Vienna. I had received a good payment for capturing the moods of my city in different seasons. I had my own style, showing daffodils in Hyde Park and the heat haze in Piccadilly. I knew that some of my best work would be ignored because it was just a picture book, not meant to challenge anyone’s views.
After a cold snap over Christmas, I submitted my winter photos of London and learned that the Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, had left his job in Vienna for reasons I didn’t need to know. Instead of hiring someone new, they offered me the job. The Austrian publishers liked my work, and I was available, while the French and Italian photographers were not. I was happy to go. Things at home were not good, so a week in snowy Vienna sounded perfect.
They put me up at the Europa hotel in the old city. I had last visited Vienna with my wife for a busy weekend of sightseeing. It had been hot and chaotic, and I hadn’t taken many photos. This time, alone in cold January, I knew it would be different. As soon as I arrived and saw the beautiful light over the snow-covered roofs, I felt excited. I was ready to take great pictures.
On my first day, I didn’t even try to take photos. I rode the trams around the Ringstrasse, getting on and off to enjoy the atmosphere. The weather was cold, like the grand buildings from the old empire that shaped the city. I hadn’t seen what Schussner had done in the other seasons, and I didn’t want to. This was going to be my Vienna, and I was ready to discover it.
A photograph captures a moment, but you have to wait for the right moment. So, I took my time, looking carefully until I was ready. The next morning, I was out at dawn. The fresh snow meant Stephansplatz would be beautifully white and almost empty. I hadn’t figured out how to capture the cathedral in one shot. Its tall spire reached into the grey sky, while at ground level, it was massive and imposing. I realized I might have to settle for a partial view. In that weather and at that time, it could still be magical.
Photography has always had a sense of magic. Even the early photographers felt this before they fully understood the chemistry behind it. You can watch a blank sheet of paper turn into a photograph in a dark room. Even when you know how it works, the mystery remains. Perhaps that’s why what happened at Stephansplatz that morning didn’t surprise me in a strange way."
CPE_50,C2,"Kinetic Art**
Exciting news: London's Hayward Gallery has changed into a place full of wonder. This change is not due to a big-budget show, but rather a unique look at a less-known part of the last 60 years. A new exhibition shows the history of kinetic art, which is art that involves movement, in the twentieth century. It shows that creating art that moves by itself or explores the idea of movement has been an important but often overlooked theme in creative work during this time. The exhibition features a wonderful collection of paintings, drawings, documents, and films about kinetic art, put together by curator Guy Brett, who has studied this topic for many years. Visitors can enjoy the art without too much text, allowing them to make their own connections and discoveries.
**David Hockney**
David Hockney's art attracts many people who might not usually be interested in art. Some like it because it is figurative and easy to understand, while others enjoy the themes of leisure and escape from daily life. Some people might even be drawn to Hockney's charming personality and his clever comments that make him popular in the media. However, this popularity raises the question: does it mean his art lacks serious purpose? Some critics believe Hockney is an overrated artist. But one could argue that his popularity does not mean his work is unimportant. Hockney knows his own limits and believes it is not fair to judge his work based on a narrow idea of greatness. He does not claim to be a great artist and understands that only time will tell how he will be remembered.
**Window-shopping - an Art Exhibition**
In recent years, I have seen many contemporary art exhibitions, some brilliant and some not so good. What bothers me are shows that seem to push a specific idea, suggesting that certain artists share a common view. Sometimes this works, and we learn about new trends in seemingly unrelated works. More often, though, it feels forced. As a curator, I wanted to create a show that was different. Together with seven artists, I took over a space in an empty warehouse. 'Window-shopping' was meant to be a collection of individual artworks that connected only because they were all art. For example, Sam Cole's knitted cats chased each other on a toy train track, while Matthew Crawley filmed a video camera until it broke. These works did not fit into a specific theme and would not usually be shown together, but they did not interfere with each other and, I hope, added to each other's impact. I did not make any grand statements about contemporary art, but I believe that art is an individual activity where artists set their own rules.
**Art History**
People who enjoy paintings sometimes hesitate to analyze them, fearing it will ruin their enjoyment. Some believe that art historians, who focus on theory rather than practice, overlook the joy of looking at art and the special act of creating it. This idea is similar to thinking that knowing how a dish is made takes away from its taste. Understanding the importance of enjoyment does not mean we cannot also learn about the art we appreciate. In fact, knowing more about what we are viewing can enhance our pleasure. Additionally, pleasure is complex. How we feel and recognize pleasure is influenced by our senses and is shaped by the society we live in. While it is important to value our instinctive responses to art, the belief that thinking about art takes away from enjoyment is an outdated idea that once promoted art as a substitute for thought."
CPE_25,C2,"Metals**  
Stone Age people may have been interested in metals because they wanted to decorate themselves. While sitting by a river, waiting for fish, one of our early ancestors might have found a shiny yellow stone and picked it up. It felt different from regular stones and was very attractive. This could be how gold became important to early humans. Because gold is easy to shape, it quickly became a popular material. Copper might have also been discovered by chance. Once people realized how useful copper tools were, they began to search for copper ores and ways to extract the metal. This led to the development of metalworking, which improved the lives of our ancestors.
**St Ives**  
We were quiet as we carried our bags down the narrow, cobbled street that led to the town center. We bent down against the strong wind and tried to avoid the cold waves crashing over the walkway. The streets were empty, and all the windows in the cottages by the water were closed tightly against the storm. We had seen the weather get worse as we arrived in St Ives on a small train. As the dark clouds gathered, visiting Cornwall in the off-season without a car did not seem like a good idea anymore. I had convinced my friend to come with me by promising beautiful walks along the Cornish coast and cozy evenings by the fire.
**Computer Modelling**  
Studying the past is difficult because it is gone. The people who lived in times of peace and those who faced wars and droughts are long gone. The reasons why they settled in certain places or formed families and communities are now forgotten. Archaeology gives us some clues, but we cannot test our ideas with experiments on past cultures. We cannot go back in time to see what happened. However, computer modeling allows us to recreate ancient landscapes and environments and fill them with virtual communities—digital people that have some of the needs and abilities of real humans. We can set rules for them and create social groups. Then, we can change the weather or the population and see how these virtual cultures and their artificial people respond."
CPE_34,C2,"
**Vervet Monkeys**  
Cheney and Seyfarth studied a group of vervet monkeys. One day, the dominant male noticed a strange male monkey nearby. The stranger wanted to join the group, which could mean the dominant male would lose his position. To keep the stranger away, the dominant male made an alarm call that vervet monkeys use to warn of a leopard. The stranger quickly ran back to the trees. This happened several times throughout the day. However, the dominant male made a mistake. After using the alarm call successfully, he called out while walking across the open ground himself. 
**What Cats Catch**  
In a village in England called Felmersham, people collected information about what their cats caught. Over one year, seventy cats caught more than 1,000 animals. A professor in America estimated that all the cats in Britain might kill 100 million birds and small mammals each year. However, this number is not realistic because most cats live in towns and catch fewer animals than those in the survey. The important question is whether these numbers are sustainable. The answer seems to be yes. In winter, many people feed birds, and gardens provide places for birds to nest, keeping their population above natural levels. The survey showed that cats are important predators, but they are not destroying Britain's bird population.
**Buffalo's Day**  
Buffaloes are very important to the marshmen, and they are treated with care. Each morning, the buffaloes, who have been sleeping near their owners, slowly leave to go to the reed beds beyond the water. They often groan about their tiredness before finally moving forward into the water. Once in the water, they seem to forget their purpose and relax, making low sounds of complaint. Their movements away from the house are slow and almost unnoticed, but eventually, they are swimming, looking tired. They spend the day among the reeds, grazing on green shoots.
**Picasso, Pablo**  
In 1940, Picasso painted several still lifes of fish while staying in the fishing port of Royan. One painting shows a fishmonger’s table with a crab and some soles. The fish look alive, but the painting is hard to read because Picasso used a flat pattern of overlapping shapes. The light colors and delicate brushwork create a calm underwater scene. However, there is a sense of tension as the fish seem to be ready to fight the crab. The sharp shapes in the painting suggest danger, giving it a deeper meaning."
CPE_12,C2,"Photography**
Over the last one and a half centuries, photography has been used to capture many aspects of human life and activities. In this relatively short time, photography has improved its ability to record moments in time and space, allowing us to see both large and small details. It has given us images from faraway places, distant parts of the solar system, and the social issues of modern life. Photography has become one of the most important ways to express what it means to be human.
However, the idea of recording events visually has a much longer history. The first pictorial records date back to the Upper Paleolithic period, about 35,000 years ago. We cannot be sure why early cave paintings were made. They might have recorded actual hunting events, served as magic to help with hunting, acted as religious symbols, or simply brightened daily life. Still, these images are closely connected to human culture.
Throughout history, people have questioned how accurate visual images are and what their role is in society. The saying ""seeing is believing"" has given special importance to visual images. When photography was invented in the mid-nineteenth century, it seemed to promise a truthful visual record. The camera was seen as a tool that worked like the human eye, capturing fixed images that closely resembled what we see. The chemical process used in photography allowed for the capture of natural scenes.
At the same time, photography was seen as a sophisticated cultural achievement, producing images that artists had worked hard to create. Ironically, because photography seemed so realistic, many believed that everyone could easily understand photographs. For example, in 1933, photographer August Sander said that even the most isolated person could understand a photograph of the sky, whether it showed the sun, moon, or stars.
However, as global communication increased in the late twentieth century, we must consider how well photographs can cross cultural differences. Is photography limited by cultural norms like any other form of communication, such as language? Has our familiarity with photographs made us overlook the complex ways they convey vivid impressions of reality? 
Photography is often seen as providing convincing evidence, making it seem like a clear window into reality. It is common for someone to show a photograph and say, ""This is my grandson."" Since its invention in 1839, photography and the attitudes towards it have changed significantly. This change may be partly because photography has moved into what we might call ""mythic time."" Its original role as a record-keeper has evolved, and photographs, once closely connected to the photographer and the subject, have become historical documents. These images often tell us more about the people and society that created them than about the subjects themselves.
I want to show that the camera is not just a silent recorder of events. Photography does not only reflect culture; it can also inspire social and political change. For example, it is hard to imagine the cultural changes of the Italian Renaissance in the fifteenth century without recognizing how the development of perspective changed visual representation. Similarly, photography has played a major role in creating the media culture of our time, while also revealing the harsh realities of the world."
CPE_26,C2,"**How to Write Poetry**
Teaching people how to write poetry can be tricky. It is important to be creative, but making one mistake can ruin everything. I do not want to act like I know everything, so I will say this: for someone who is just starting to write, reading a lot, writing often, and letting your imagination flow is more important than any advice. Some people need a stable life to write poetry, while others can write to escape their problems. Some writers follow a schedule, while others wait for inspiration. All approaches are valid, as long as they are not just following strict rules. Finding your own voice is key; listen to your inner thoughts, nurture them, and let them grow. One day, your voice will be strong enough to stand on its own.
**The Short Story**
In a short story, it is important not to have too many characters or long descriptions. Flashbacks should be brief and only used when necessary to explain something. A memory in the main character's mind can help move the story forward, but it should not slow down the action. Dialogue is very useful because it can show different sides of a situation quickly, keeping the reader interested. Too many words can ruin a short story, but being brief does not mean it should be just a summary. Conflict and action should be strong in a short story, just like in a novel, but every word must count.
**Screenplays**
Writing a screenplay for a film is similar to playing chess. Most chess players make mistakes as they play. We may not know everything, but we know enough to play. We can sometimes see a few moves ahead, which feels good. As we learn more about chess, we realize that it is more about long-term strategy than short-term moves. We start to see the game as a whole, not just individual moves. We notice patterns in the game, like openings and end games. The more we play chess, the more we understand its complexities, just like in screenplay writing.
**Looking at Writing**
Humans naturally want to speak, as we see in young children, but no child is born knowing how to write. Charles Darwin said that language is a natural human instinct, but writing is not. Language exists in all societies, both now and in the past. While languages change, they do not necessarily get better. English is not more complex than the languages of ancient tribes. All healthy children learn to speak without lessons. When children are together without a common language, they create their own. In contrast, writing systems have been created only a few times in history and started as simple codes. Until recently, many children did not learn to read or write, and even today, some struggle. A group of children is unlikely to invent an alphabet, just as they would not invent a car engine. Children are naturally good at sounds, but learning to read and write is something that takes time and effort. We need to understand how writing works and how children learn so we can help them succeed."
CPE_8,C2,"""I have never started a novel with so much doubt. If I call it a novel, it is only because I don’t know what else to call it. I have a small story to tell, and I do not end with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave my reader uncertain. This book is about my memories of a man I met only a few times, and I do not know much about what happened to him in between. I could create a more complete story by imagining what happened, but I do not want to do that. I just want to write down what I know. To avoid embarrassing people who are still alive, I have given the characters in this story names I made up, and I have taken care to ensure that no one can recognize them. The man I am writing about is not famous. He may never be famous. When his life ends, he might leave no more trace of his existence than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the water's surface. If my book is read, it will be for its own interest. However, the way he lives and the special qualities of his character may influence others, so that long after he is gone, people may realize that a remarkable person lived in this time. Then it will be clear who I am writing about, and those who want to know a little about his early life may find something useful in this book. I believe my book, with its limitations, will be a helpful source of information for my friend’s biographers. I do not claim that the conversations I recorded are exact. I never took notes of what was said, but I remember well what concerns me. Although I have put these conversations in my own words, I believe they represent what was said. I mentioned earlier that I have invented nothing, but I have taken the same liberty that historians take to create speeches for the characters that I did not hear. I did this to make the scenes more lively and believable, as they would be less effective if told only as facts. I want to be read, and I think I am justified in making my book interesting. The thoughtful reader will see where I have used this technique and can choose to ignore it. Another reason I feel nervous about this work is that the people I write about come from a different culture. It is hard to truly know people, and I believe you can only really know your own countrymen. People are shaped by many things: the place they were born, the home they grew up in, the games they played, the food they ate, the schools they attended, the sports they liked, and the poets they read. All these experiences make them who they are, and you cannot understand them just by hearing about them; you must live them. You can only know them if you are one of them. Because you cannot fully understand people from a different country except by observing them, it is hard to give them credibility in a book. I have never tried to write about anyone but my own countrymen, and if I have done so in short stories, it is because you can describe characters more briefly there. You give the reader general ideas and let them fill in the details. In this book, I do not claim that my characters see themselves as they truly are; they are seen, like my main character, through my own perspective."""
CPE_4,C2,"**POETRY RECITALS**
At any time in history, the world of literature can seem confusing to those living in it. However, later generations can see clear patterns and important figures in literature. Right now, there is a complex mix of different styles of poetry, various groups of poets, and different ways of presenting, criticizing, and teaching poetry. There are also many opinions about what a poet's role in society should be.
In general, the current discussion in contemporary poetry is about the mistrust and disagreement between serious 'literary' poets, who write poems meant to be read on the page, and 'popular' poets, who prefer to perform their work for an audience. This division is not strict. Over the last twenty years, public poetry readings have become more common in many forms. Small literary groups in towns hold readings in village halls or members' homes. Schools and colleges invite poets to read and talk to students, and arts festivals often include poetry readings by well-known authors.
The effects of these events, where poets often have to perform in public, are varied and uncertain. For 'pop' poets, whose work is made for live audiences, performing is beneficial. Their poems are usually simple and can be understood quickly. However, when these poems are read on the page, their weaknesses in thought and technique become clear.
On the other hand, poets who are serious about their craft aim to create deep and meaningful work. They try to express strong emotions and ideas in a small space and use a variety of rhythms. Unfortunately, these poets may not be appreciated by audiences who are hearing their work for the first time. The risk is that they might only read their easiest poems, which may not represent their best work.
Attending poetry readings cannot replace reading poetry from a book, but it can be enjoyable and educational. Hearing good poets read their work aloud, even if they are not great speakers, helps the audience understand where to place emphasis. It is best if the audience has the text in front of them or knows the poems beforehand.
The main reason for popular poetry recitals, which sometimes include music, is to help audiences enjoy poetry and see it as an art form for everyone, not just a select few."

Historians are increasingly using oral evidence, but this approach has its challenges. It is overly simple to think that a person's story is a clear reflection of their past experiences. In an interview, both the interviewer and the interviewee influence each other. The historian chooses who to interview and what topics to discuss. Even if the historian only listens, their presence can change how the informant remembers and talks about their past. The final result is shaped by the historian's social position and their understanding of history, which may also affect how the informant shares their memories. Historians must recognize their role in creating new evidence. The challenges continue even after the interview. The informant's memories are not always direct connections to the past. Their memories can be influenced by other sources, like the media, or by feelings of nostalgia or resentment about their childhood. These emotions can make the testimony seem more convincing, but they may actually come from later experiences rather than the time being discussed.
**Animal Science**  
There are two main ways to study animal science: the physiological approach and the whole animal approach. Physiologists focus on how the body works, including how nerves, muscles, and senses work together to create complex behaviors. Those who take the whole animal approach study the behavior of animals in their natural environments and the factors that influence that behavior. Within this approach, there are psychologists and ethologists. Psychologists usually work in labs studying a few species, like rats and pigeons, while ethologists study animals in the wild and their natural behaviors. Although these two areas are still somewhat separate, they are increasingly working together. Physiologists often claim that their methods are more fundamental. However, understanding how nerve cells work does not eliminate the need to study behavior itself, as behavior has its own structure and units that must be examined. Trying to explain a bird's nest-building behavior by only looking at nerve cells would be like trying to read a book with a microscope.
**The Social Sciences**  
Students studying social sciences for the first time face a challenge: they must learn both the content of their new subject and the methods used to study it. This means they need to understand not only the knowledge found in textbooks but also how that knowledge is gathered and organized. These two aspects are closely connected. While we all have experience with social life, social sciences go beyond common sense. Each social science focuses on a specific part of social life, uses particular research methods, and has its own key concepts. These concepts form the logical basis of the subject, allowing social scientists to move beyond everyday understanding and differentiate one discipline from another.
**Classical Architecture**  
In Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building structures. According to the Roman architect Vitruvius, architecture involves Order, Arrangement, Proportion, Symmetry, Propriety, and Distribution. He also provides Greek terms for some of these ideas, likely based on earlier Greek sources that we no longer have. While utility and function are not part of his main definition, Vitruvius does discuss how to design buildings for different purposes. Initially, the focus is on the artistic side of architecture. The origins of classical architecture are complex, with a long history of simple structures, like huts, in Greece and Italy that did not meet Vitruvius' artistic standards. Although these early structures were not artistic, they contributed important elements that influenced later architectural designs. Despite their simple appearance, classical temples are essentially single-room huts."
CPE_7,C2,"The two sisters kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for a while. She would drive around the gardens and the railway line, jumping over a small bridge with all four wheels in the air, which was Lily's only mistake. After that, they would pass the gasworks, where there was a strong smell. Chen, however, found it funny that his wife was driving without him knowing. ""So you can really drive, Lily? Well done!"" he said. Mui thought men were strange. Her brother-in-law should have been upset, but instead, he was excited and made plans with Lily for a trip. They decided to go on a Monday at the start of next month, which was the quietest day of the week. They planned to leave early in the morning and return by midday so they wouldn’t lose any customers. In the meantime, Lily would practice driving. Despite her worries, Mui bought a road map and got a ten percent discount, which impressed Chen. However, Lily felt a bit insulted that Mui didn’t trust her navigation skills.
Within an hour of leaving home, they were looking at the English Channel. Lily drove very well. Even Mui, who was in the back seat ready to give directions, had to agree. On the road, Lily passed a couple of slow cars with great skill, and Chen even applauded her. After passing the gasworks in the seaside town, they drove smoothly along the empty promenade. Lily parked in a small street near the sea that had many empty spaces. She wasn’t sure about the road signs and preferred to pay for parking rather than risk getting a ticket. 
Lily noticed her sister’s worried face in the driving mirror. She thought it was better not to add to Mui's worries. Lily locked all the van doors and checked each one carefully. ""Don't worry,"" Chen joked. ""No one will want that old van."" The sisters were annoyed. Lily told her husband he was ungrateful, and Mui scolded him for being too quick to judge. Surprised, Chen took Man Kee to look at the grey sea. He held his son close and thought about how he wanted to raise him. Chen wanted Man Kee to learn about business and own many restaurants one day. The sight of the sea made Chen feel thoughtful as he planned for his son’s future.
He noticed smoke on the horizon and then saw a ship shining in the morning sun. Chen put a coin in a telescope and tried to find the ship. At first, he couldn’t see it, but then he finally spotted it. It was a small, old tramp steamer. Chen lifted Man Kee to the telescope. ""Do you see the ship, Son?"" he asked gently. ""It’s a special little ship for people like us. It may be small and old, but it will take us back home when we are done here. It will take you to your homeland, Son, which you have never seen."" Chen kissed the top of Man Kee's head. Lily and Mui were behind them. Lily put her arm around Chen's shoulders. ""The little old ship,"" Chen said. ""Let your mother see, Son."" Man Kee didn’t want to let go of the telescope, and when he finally did, the telescope stopped working. By the time Chen found another coin, the ship was gone, and Lily was left watching seagulls searching for food in the water."
CPE_43,C2,"**THE WELL**
I had read that if you go deep enough into a hole, you can see the stars on a clear day. I convinced you to help me with my idea. You watched with wide eyes as I pulled up the well bucket, steadied it on the wall, and then climbed in. I asked you to let me down. I didn’t think about how heavy the bucket was or that you might not be strong enough to hold it. You held the handle, trying to help as I pushed the bucket off the side of the well. As soon as it was free, I fell down. You screamed and tried to stop it, but then you let go. I fell into the well and hit my head. At that moment, I didn’t realize I had achieved part of my plan. I saw strange lights, like the stars I usually saw in cartoons when a character got hurt. At first, I was dazed, then scared, then relieved, and finally angry at you for letting me fall and worried about what Mother would say.
You called down to check if I was okay. I opened my mouth to shout, but then I heard panic in your voice, and I couldn’t speak. I lay still, peeking at you through my eyelashes. You disappeared, calling for help. I waited a moment, then quickly climbed back up and pulled myself over the edge, landing on the courtyard stones. I heard alarmed voices coming from the castle's main door. I ran the other way, down to the passage leading to the moat bridge, and hid in the shadows. Mother and Father came with you and old Arthur; Mother was screaming and waving her hands. Father shouted for Arthur to pull on the winch handle. You stood back, looking pale and shocked. I was hidden in the shadows, feeling a rush of excitement. Then I noticed the drops of water I had left from the well to where I stood. I looked in horror at the dark spots of dirty water on the dry stones. At my feet, the water had formed a small pool. I looked back into the courtyard, where Father was shining a flashlight down into the well. The drops sparkled in the sunlight. I couldn’t believe no one had seen them. Mother was now screaming loudly, a sound I had never heard before. It shook me deeply. What should I do? I had gotten back at you, but now things were more serious than I expected. What started as a fun prank had turned into something that would lead to serious punishment, probably for me.
I regretted not thinking this through. In just a few minutes, my clever plan had turned into a disaster. Suddenly, I had an idea. I gathered my courage and left my hiding place, staggering out and blinking. I called out softly, then yelled louder when no one heard me. I stumbled a bit further and then fell dramatically on the stones. Sitting up, comforted by my crying mother, I sighed and said, ""Oh dear,"" smiling bravely. I claimed that I had found a secret tunnel from the bottom of the well to the moat and crawled through it until I got out. I thought I was almost getting away with it until Father appeared in front of me. He made me repeat my story. I hesitated. His eyes narrowed. Thinking I was covering up a mistake, I said the secret passage had collapsed after me; there was no point in sending someone down to look for it. I said the well was dangerous and that I had barely escaped with my life. 
When I looked into my father's eyes, it felt like looking into a dark tunnel with no light at the end. It was as if he was seeing me for the first time, and I was seeing how the world looked from an adult's perspective. My words got stuck in my throat. ""Don't be ridiculous, boy,"" he said, sounding more disappointed than I could have imagined. He stood up and walked away. Arthur looked down at me, his face showing regret and concern. He seemed to want to shake his head, not because I had a scary adventure and my father didn’t believe me, but because he could see through my sad lie. He worried about my character and future because I had lied so easily. His pity felt like a harsh lesson, even more than what my father had given me, and it affected me deeply."
CPE_51,C2,"**REMOVAL DAY**
Now that her children are grown, Susan, who is a widow, must leave her family home. The van had the words 'Removers of Distinction' on it, and indeed, everything that made the house special was being taken away. Fred, the removal man, carefully packed all the fragile items, while his helpers were not as gentle. Susan was leaving a beautiful four-story house that looked over a small harbor. The memories of her children growing up there felt present in the air, like dust. When they first bought the house, her son Robert, who was five at the time, had asked, ""Mum, how do you get a house home?"" It was easy to miss the little boy he used to be, especially now that he was an adult helping with the move. He was making sure Susan didn’t mention the piano. Francesca, their daughter, was also helping, insisting that only she could take care of the Steinway piano.
Fred noticed Susan was not crying. ""Do people cry?"" she asked. ""You'd be surprised,"" he replied. ""They seem happy while packing, but then they cry in an empty room. They are fine once they get to the new place; it’s just hard to see everything taken apart."" Susan understood that feeling. If she had been alone, she would have warned the movers about the piano before they started. But Robert insisted it was the movers' job to notice any problems. The piano was now the last item to be moved, sitting proudly in the best room of the house.
Sitting on the bottom stair, with all the chairs gone, Susan remembered the day they moved in. It felt like that day was playing in reverse. The piano had been the first thing brought in, but it got stuck on the stairs. The movers struggled for nearly two hours, and little Robert watched in amazement while Francesca cried, ""We can't live in a house without a piano!"" They had to find a way to get it inside, and her late husband, Peter, had solved the problem. They left the piano outside while they moved in the other furniture. The next day, a builder took out the first-floor window, and a crane was borrowed to lift the piano through the window. The children were overjoyed to see it come in, but it had cost a lot, and they couldn’t afford to have it tuned for months.
""That's that,"" Peter had said. ""That's there forever."" But forever is a long time. The children were too busy to visit often, and Susan found it harder to move around the house. She thought about the stairs and remembered that the banister rails were still not fixed properly. She should have warned the movers about the piano, but now it was too late. 
""Are you all right?"" Fred asked her. ""Just the piano left now, and then we’ll be done."" Susan moved away from the stairs, feeling anxious. Robert and Francesca stood in the hallway watching. ""No tears then?"" Fred asked casually. She was close to crying. It was strange how moving things made them feel so important. Chairs, cups, and many other items that seemed unimportant before now felt full of emotion. Just then, the piano appeared at the top of the stairs, with Fred guiding it down. 
""Easy does it!"" Fred called out as they carefully brought it down and placed it behind the van. Robert was the first to laugh, and soon they were all laughing together, relieved that it was over. As they walked down the path for the last time, the only tears Susan shed were tears of laughter."
CPE_11,C2,"Online Literary Criticism for Everyone**
**Do-it-yourself literary criticism: Is it just harmless fun?**
From the beginning, one of the main ideas of the Internet was to allow open access. In theory, anyone could publish their thoughts or share music online. However, in the early years, some technical skills were needed. Still, there was one area that became available to everyone: literary criticism. By visiting Amazon.com, the first popular online bookstore, anyone could try writing book reviews. 
Amazon's approach to book reviews was simple: anyone could share their opinion and give a book up to five stars. Each book had its own page, and when a reader wrote a new review, it appeared automatically. This allowed Amazon to have many free reviews, and potential buyers could see what other readers thought, instead of just relying on the publisher's description or professional critics.
Other online bookstores also offered similar features, but Amazon was the largest, with over 80% of the online market. This meant it had the most customers and received the most reviews, which sometimes led to problems. Thousands of reviews were submitted each day, and it was hard to check them all. A team of editors looked for reviews that followed Amazon's rules. For example, one-word reviews or personal attacks on authors were not allowed. Reviews that gave away the ending or mentioned other reviews were also banned. However, since reviewers could remain anonymous, it was easy for some to break the rules. 
For instance, some authors wrote positive reviews for their own books. One author, Lev Grossman, was upset by the bad reviews of his first novel, so he wrote some good ones anonymously to balance things out. His trick worked until he wrote an article about it, and then Amazon removed the fake reviews. Authors could also comment on their books by clicking a link that said, ""I am the Author, and I wish to comment on my book."" Most authors used this to encourage readers to buy and enjoy their books. Some even shared their email addresses for direct communication. However, Amazon did not always check if these comments really came from the authors, except for well-known writers.
The real excitement came from readers, not authors. When James McElroy's book, *We've Got Spirit*, was published, it received good reviews from the press. But many people mentioned in the book felt hurt and used Amazon to express their anger. Many negative reviews appeared but were quickly removed. Despite this, Amazon saw the large number of reviews as good for business. 
Amazon wanted reviews to be a place to discuss books, not just a chat room. They paid special attention to bestselling books to ensure all reviews followed the rules. This meant that silly reviews were more likely to appear on pages for less popular books. For example, *The Story about Ping*, a classic children's book about a duck, inspired some humorous reviews because ""ping"" is also a term used in technology. One long review compared the book's story to Internet architecture, saying it gave a good overview of networking concepts. 
However, most reviews on Amazon were serious. They provided a good idea of whether a book was worth buying. The writer George Orwell once said that reviewing too many books made it hard to have real feelings about them. This is why making literary criticism available to everyone is a positive change."
CPE_14,C2,"Art in Modern Times**
In modern times, especially over the last two hundred years, we often think that every artist must go against the art of their time. Art is praised for being unique, revolutionary, and sometimes shocking. We feel good about admiring artists whose work was not appreciated a hundred years ago. However, when we look at art today, we often say that some artists have gone too far and that their work is not really art anymore. The media often expresses these feelings for us, and we tend to agree because we expect to be confused by the newness of art. We do not notice the old themes and methods that are still present in today’s art. We want artists to be different from us, with special talents that break the rules. In the past, people commissioned artists for specific purposes, and art was part of everyday life. Today, we leave artists to work alone and sometimes get upset if they try to connect with us.
**Picture This**
I will describe a situation and then ask an important question about it. An artist chooses a piece of text from an art book. The text talks about the variety of pictures and asks, ""What are they all about?"" It then states, ""There is no end to the different kinds of pictures."" This language seems childish, but stay with me. After choosing the text, the artist asks someone to prepare a canvas for him and then to take it to a sign painter. He tells the sign painter to write the chosen text on the canvas in simple black letters without making it fancy. The sign painter does this. So, my important question is: is the final product a painting?
**Underground Encounters**
At the Mercury Gallery in London until June 26, there is an unspoken rule for painters: once you find a successful style, you should stick to it. Collectors expect artists to keep creating in the same way, and if they try something new, people often feel disappointed. I’m not sure why this is the case. Gallery owners prefer safe choices, and perhaps art buyers feel more comfortable with familiar styles. Some artists, like Picasso and Hockney, have successfully tried new things. Eric Rimmington is another artist who is now trying something different, and we will see if he succeeds. His new show changes from the still lifes he is known for to paintings of the London Underground. Rimmington finds a special charm in railways. He started with drawings of Kings Cross Station in the 1980s and then moved underground to explore what happens below. These sketches have inspired his exhibition called Underground Encounters, which features 40 paintings and drawings that show the unique beauty of this hidden world.
**Extract from a Novel**
I have come to this island with a few books. I do not know why I say ""escape."" The villagers joke that only a sick person would choose such a remote place to recover. So, I have come here to heal myself. Besides an old peasant who comes daily to clean, I am quite alone. I am neither happy nor unhappy; I feel like I am floating in my memories. I talked about the uselessness of art but did not mention its comforts. The comfort of my work lies in the fact that in the silence of a painter or writer, reality can be changed and shown in a meaningful way. Our everyday actions are like a rough cover hiding the true meaning beneath. For artists, art allows us to deal with the pain of daily life, not to escape it, but to fulfill our true potential through imagination. Otherwise, why should we hurt one another?"
CPE_63,C2,"**Family Business**
""Look, this isn't good!"" said my Dad. We were in the car on our way back to London. My father, with my brother Maurice beside him, had just picked me up from the fancy girls' school I attended. He had also just been to Parent's Day, where I received the Latin prize and the prize for the best end-of-school exams. He had a long talk with my headteacher, and now we were heading home for the holidays.
""What isn't?"" I asked, although I had a feeling I knew what he was thinking because he was unusually quiet. Normally, he talked a lot. ""You can't fool me. You'll do what you want now,"" he said. ""With all those certificates, I heard you will get a scholarship to Oxford."" ""So?"" I replied, trying to act tough. ""Mightn't that be useful?"" 
""I also heard,"" he continued, and I knew a serious talk was coming, ""that you want to be a barrister. A barrister!"" My father knew a lot about lawyers and the law. ""I just said that,"" I replied. ""I couldn't think of anything else!"" ""And apparently,"" he went on, ""you have the right personality - you can quickly understand a lot of information, you are good at talking, and you enjoy performing."" ""I don't know about that,"" I said. ""All I know is what I see on TV.""
""Anyway,"" he said, getting serious, ""I feel like your heart isn't in the family business. You will go to Oxford University, and after that, I can't see you wanting to join us."" The problem was that, like many children in family businesses, I felt trapped by my father's expectations. I could see many career options, and I wanted to explore them. But I also didn't want to upset my father. I wasn't as scared of him as Maurice was - I was the favorite - but I still found him intimidating.
""It's too soon to know,"" I said weakly. ""I tell you, you're not going to want to join us,"" my father said, who often turned out to be right about these things. ""It's a pity because you have the talent - the brains, the courage, the vision."" ""There's still Maurice,"" I said, feeling down. My father scoffed. We both knew Maurice didn't like the business. ""Anyway,"" I added, ""you could always use me as a consultant."" 
My mother had died when I was young, and my father raised me and Maurice. Maurice was two years younger than me, and since he was motherless, I took care of him. It wasn't hard; I loved him. Because the business was successful, we lived comfortably - in a big house in London, attended nice schools, wore good clothes, and went to parties, theaters, and operas. My father knew many interesting people - politicians, actors, and businessmen - and our home was always lively.
""I tell you what,"" my father continued. ""You can help us during the holidays until you leave Oxford, and then if you decide to leave us, you can. It will give you some pocket money and help me."" ""OK,"" I said, relieved to avoid making immediate choices, especially the sadness my father would feel if I disagreed with him. This was how he controlled us.
So, it happened. In my last term at school and during university breaks, I helped out, never more than twice a year, and always with easier tasks. I became one of the smarter students, with a small house, a nice car, designer clothes, and a black dress from Paris that I planned to wear for my final exams.
In my last term, my father came to visit me and took me to a village for a meal and a chat. There were only a few weeks left. My tutor predicted I would get a First Class degree in Law, and I knew that if I focused and organized my thoughts, he might be right. I felt ready and confident. But then my father told me that he needed me to do one last important task for the family business, and he promised it would be worth my time.
""But Dad,"" I protested, ""I have my final exams coming up, and I need to focus on that. It's really important that I do well, and I don't want to think about anything else right now."" I could tell my father didn't understand the pressure I was under (or maybe he was jealous of my life away from him), and he would see my refusal as a betrayal. 
As he explained the task, I saw more clearly than ever how focused my father was - the way he approached his work with energy and control. In his own way, he was a genius, and I respected that. It made my own plans seem less important. ""All right,"" I said. ""I'll do it."""
CPE_56,C2,"
Simon Costello realized that buying the house in Pembroke Square was a mistake within a year of moving in with Lois. A house that requires strict budgeting is often not worth buying at all. However, at the time, it seemed like a good and desirable choice. Simon had been successful in his work, and cases were coming in regularly. Lois returned to her job at the advertising agency two months after the twins were born and received a raise that brought her salary to thirty-five thousand. She strongly wanted to move, and Simon did not resist her arguments, which seemed convincing at the time: their flat was not suitable for a family, they needed more space, a garden, and a separate room for an au pair. They could have found these things in a less expensive area of London, but Lois wanted more than just extra space. Mornington Mansions was not a good address for a rising barrister and a successful businesswoman. Lois felt that even saying the name of their old flat lowered her social status.
Lois decided that one of them should use public transport to save money. Since her office was on the other side of London, Simon had to be the one to travel by tube. The crowded journey made him feel envious and unhappy, and he often thought about his grandfather's house in Hampstead, where he had stayed as a boy. He remembered the smell of dinner, his grandmother's care for his tired grandfather, and how she made his life easier. She had been a supportive lawyer's wife, always present at legal events and seemingly happy with her life. But that world was gone. Lois had made it clear before they married that her career was just as important as his. This was a modern marriage, and both of their jobs were essential for their lifestyle. Their home, the au pair, and everything depended on both of their incomes. 
Now, their hard work could be ruined by Venetia, who had come to their office in a bad mood. Something had upset her, and she confronted Simon with intense anger. He regretted not leaving his room earlier; if he had, she might have calmed down and thought things over. He remembered her angry words: ""I defended Brian Cartwright today. He told me that when you were his lawyer four years ago, you knew he bribed three jurors. You did nothing. Is that true?"" Simon replied, ""He's lying. It isn't true."" She also accused him of knowing that Cartwright had given shares to his fiancée before the trial. Simon denied it, but his denial sounded unconvincing even to himself. He felt guilty and ashamed, remembering the fear of punishment from his school days. When he looked into her eyes, he saw her disbelief. 
He wished he had said, ""Cartwright told me after the trial, but I didn't believe him. He will say anything to make himself look important."" Instead, he had told a more dangerous lie, and she knew it was a lie. But why was she so angry? What did his past actions have to do with her? Why was Venetia acting as the judge of their legal practice? Was her own behavior always perfect? Did she have the right to ruin his career? He was unsure of what she could do, but if this rumor spread, it could destroy him."
CPE_36,C2,"'I chose this place to live because I thought I would be anonymous among people who didn’t care if the rented houses were falling apart or if the gardens were messy. I was wrong. People in the shops, who are living their real lives, soon start to recognize you. The beautiful roses from next door remind me that gardens were once loved. Usually, I stay inside, trying to forget that summer is happening outside, but tonight, I am watching the swifts flying between the trees and roofs. I have trimmed the rosemary and lemon balm to make space for a chair, and my arms are tingling with scratches. It is a small London garden, where plants must grow tall or spread out to survive. 
“Been doing some clearing, I see,” says my upstairs neighbor, Jaz, leaning out of the window. She is a writer with several unpublished manuscripts, and I sometimes help her with them as an English teacher. I have a copy of her latest manuscript now. “How’s the work going, Jaz?” 
“For goodness sake. In no other job do people ask you about your work so many times a day,” she replies. Then she adds, “I’ve got something to drink in the fridge. I’ll bring it down.” I don’t want Jaz in the garden, and I realize it looks messy. The only way to the garden is through my flat, and Jaz is knocking on my door. 
“So, you’re on holiday now, you lucky person,” she says, sitting in shorts and a tank top on the chair while I drop a cushion onto what used to be a small lawn. “Cheers,” she says, feeling young. “I should’ve gone into teaching – a writer doesn’t have holidays. But you know what they say, those who can, do; those who can’t, teach.” And then there are those who can do neither. 
“So, what are your plans for the holidays?” All my worries about the end of the school year come rushing back. Empty days. Hot pavements covered in melting chewing gum. The walk to the shops and back. The little park with its fountain, and loneliness sitting beside me on the bench. “Actually, I’m going to Stonebridge tomorrow. I’ve been meaning to ask if you could feed the cats.” My heart races as I say this. “Of course I will,” Jaz replies, knowing she will be around. “So where will you stay? A nice bed and breakfast?” 
“No. I’ll be staying with my oldest friend, Ruby, at the Rising Sun. We’ve known each other since we were eight.” This isn’t true, but I often deal with fiction. “Going back to your roots. So what do you think of it so far? My work?” My silence makes Jaz ask about her manuscript, The Cruelty of Red Vans, which is half-read on my desk. I like the title and tell her so. I can see how red vans could be cruel, always bringing gifts to other houses and delivering rejected manuscripts to hers. 
Something makes me speak honestly for once. “Let me give you a little tip,” I start. “What?” she asks, surprised. “Try writing about nice people for a change, people who want to be good: a little less self-centeredness, a bit more fiction…” 
“Teachers!” Jaz replies, acting like a rebellious student about to take back a poorly graded paper. “I keep a journal, I have for years, where I write something good, no matter how small, about each day.” My words sound as old-fashioned as my dress. “Keep a journal! Nice people! Get a life, Ann.” 
Oh, I have a life. I have my work, and I go out sometimes and come back home, reading on the tube. When we finally go inside, my calm kitchen gives me a moment of comfort, but suddenly I remember my school geography teacher, Miss Tarrantine, who was about my age now, closing one eye in a strange wink as she said, “I’ve had my moments.” We nearly died laughing.'"
CPE_6,C2,"**Heritage**
Heritage is important because it connects people and communities to their past. We often feel connected to our personal heritage, knowing about our grandparents and hearing stories about their lives. However, there is also a need to learn about our wider past to help us understand our future, both as individuals and as a nation. Heritage gives us a sense of continuity; knowing about the past helps us feel secure about the future. Just as we inherit our genes, we also inherit a culture that has been passed down through generations. There may be parts of our national heritage that we do not like, but it is still a part of who we are, and it can be comforting to feel connected to something larger. Heritage teaches us a lot and is essential for our well-being. It influences everything from our customs to our material culture. In the past, we learned about our heritage through stories and legends from our ancestors. However, in modern society, many of these oral traditions have been lost. Now, we often look to places and buildings to understand our past. It is very important to preserve these connections as a way to honor our ancestors' identities.
**The Fens**
Some time ago, I started writing a novel called *Waterland*, where the landscape of a region in England called the Fens became very important. After the book was published, people asked me why I, a Londoner with no personal connection to the area, chose to write about it. The simple answer is that I found the Fens interesting because they seemed quiet and empty, providing a blank canvas for my story. However, I learned that the Fens are not truly flat or empty. They are uniquely English but also strangely different. It is surprising that there is a place in the middle of England that many people find unfamiliar, especially since many other areas of Britain have become part of the national culture. The Fens are both empty and full, cultivated and wild, seemingly simple yet deeply mysterious. While writing my novel, I did not explore the Fens extensively; I have never visited places like Wisbech or Prickwillow. As a fiction writer, I prefer to imagine worlds rather than seek strict proof. However, trying to imagine the Fens is logical because, as shown in Edward Storey's book, the Fens are not just a landscape but also a way of thinking.
**Museums**
Museums need to make their collections easy to access. In the past, this meant just putting items in display cases with long labels that were hard to understand. Today, accessibility should mean more than that. Displays can be engaging and use creative techniques to attract visitors and evoke emotions. Museums should also reach out to the community. For example, some museums provide loan boxes of objects for teachers, and they have started offering similar materials for elderly people with memory loss. Museums focus on real objects, not replicas. They exist to provide a genuine experience with items that have historical significance. This is their strength and what sets them apart from heritage centers, theme parks, books, and CDs. Museums that meet this challenge and create exciting displays and outreach programs will find that their competition in ""virtual history"" can actually help them by increasing interest in real historical items.
**Architecture and Environment**
The desire to preserve things is not new, but changes in our towns happen quickly and on a large scale, affecting many of us. This can make some people very focused on preservation and encourage others to think more about the nature of our towns and their future. It can be argued that people who have lived through significant events, like world wars, are more likely to value preservation than earlier generations. Anything that represents stability becomes important. If there is a psychological need for preservation, planners should consider it. Change is not a problem if we learn how to manage it. Changes in our towns reflect social changes, such as population growth, welfare, and our needs."
CPE_33,C2,"Einstein**
If you stop anyone in the street and ask them to name a scientist, they will likely think of Albert Einstein. His image is often used to sell products like computers and encyclopedias. Most people know little about what Einstein actually did, except that he created some complex theories called 'relativity', which are known for being hard to understand and for making strange predictions that seem to go against everyday experiences. 
Einstein was part of a major change in scientific thinking, a revolution that started modern science in the twentieth century. Physicists and mathematicians were trying to create a new, clearer description of the universe by studying how matter and natural forces interact. Einstein made important contributions by rethinking the basics: time, space, matter, and energy. Before him, scientists followed Isaac Newton's idea of a universe where stars and planets moved in a fixed space and time. Einstein changed this idea, saying that time and space are not fixed but relative.
**Young Readers**
When we were children, Lydia and I did not trust any book that won awards because we thought it would be boring. Our mother often criticized us for this attitude, but our father would give us small coins for each chapter we read to encourage us to look at better books. He would also include some good books in our Christmas and birthday gifts, marked with a note saying, 'This Book is NOT Literature'. Although we thought most of his choices were 'boys' books', he did introduce us to some shorter works of good fiction and, once, to a famous collection of poems.
**Language**
Jacob Grimm wrote in 1851, 'The origin of human language is truly secret and wonderful.' This secret has led to many strange ideas. For example, Charles Caller claimed in 1928 that 'primitive man' might have made sounds like ""meuh"" when he sensed danger. This sound is sad. The early humans who traveled through dangerous lands made desperate noises, and some of these sounds are still present in words today, like 'malaria', which means ""fever"", or the Latin word 'mors', which means ""death"". 
Many people avoided discussing the origin of language, thinking it was a topic for odd theories. However, recently, the study of how language began and evolved has become very important. Language likely developed in East Africa about 100,000 years ago. At first, speech was mainly used for friendly communication and was a key tool in struggles for power. Sharing information was probably not the main purpose of language, which goes against the ideas of philosopher John Locke, who described language as a 'great conduit' for sharing knowledge."
CPE_20,C2,"Writing Reviews**
Frank Kermode looks at how to write reviews from the perspective of someone who does it. Most reviews are written quickly and do not last long. There are strict deadlines and limits on how long they can be. Once published, they are only read for a short time—usually a day, a week, or at most a month. Because of this, many people think that writing reviews is not very important. Often, both the public and the writers believe that people only write reviews because they need money or because they cannot spend all their time on a novel or a serious book. 
However, writing reviews is a skilled job that requires different abilities. Writing a short review of six or eight hundred words for a newspaper is different from writing a longer review of six or eight thousand words for an international journal. A review in a weekly magazine, which is about fifteen hundred words, has challenges from both short and long reviews. 
Reviewers must think about their audience. Some readers may only skim the review, while others may be very interested in the topic and want a detailed article. Reviewers also need to know a lot about different subjects and must write in a way that intelligent readers can understand and enjoy. This means that most reviewers also write other things besides reviews.
The American writer John Updike, who does not think highly of criticism, still enjoys writing reviews when he is not working on his novels. He collects all his reviews, no matter how short, into books with modest titles. Some might think that less famous writers should accept that their reviews will not last long, but it is understandable if they want their work to be remembered, especially if they believe some of their best writing is in their reviews. I feel this way about my own work too. 
My main job has been in academia, and most of my serious books are academic, which professors are expected to write. However, in the English-speaking world, there is not a strict difference between reviewing and literary study, so it is common for the same people to do both. The time has passed when academics criticized professors for writing reviews, thinking it was a waste of time or not dignified. Complaints from non-professors about professors taking away their opportunities to write reviews are also less common now. This is partly because there are many more reviews being written today, so almost anyone can write one, and also because there are fewer opportunities available.
I believe this situation is good for both readers and professors. Readers can trust that the reviewer knows what they are talking about, and for professors, writing reviews helps them stay connected to the public. It also reminds them that they need to communicate clearly with non-professors. When they talk to each other, they may use complicated language, but when they write for a general audience, they need to be clear. 
In conclusion, despite its importance, reviewing is usually a secondary job. You can only do it well if you are also doing something else well."
CPE_40,C2,"Ralph unlocked the door to his apartment and, as he entered the dark, quiet hallway, he felt a brief sense of ownership that still surprised him after three years. When he first bought the flat, he would come home excited and curious, wondering what had happened while he was away. The flat felt like a welcoming place, a space where he could focus without distractions. He thought he should worry about things like intruders or broken pipes, but his flat always seemed to be waiting for him, looking either independent or neglected, depending on how tidy he had left it.
Over time, he began to see it as an extension of himself, a place where his thoughts and feelings spilled out. He grew frustrated with its inability to change. There were always a few letters piled up by the door and the answering machine blinking with messages when he returned. He was thankful that his windows were intact and that nothing had been stolen, but he often wondered what the flat would look like if something bad happened.
From his dull office on the third floor, Ralph looked forward to his quiet evenings at home. After leaving the busy office, he felt a bit more like himself on the bus ride home, but he still struggled with the need to be alone, even though he craved company. At his desk, he wanted solitude and time to enjoy his belongings, but once he escaped, he felt empty and lost. He suspected that his job, which didn’t suit him, had changed him, moving him away from who he thought he was.
He often read or listened to music at night, but he started to wonder for whom he was doing these things. His thoughts became unclear, and he felt disconnected. He remembered a time when he felt more in control and believed he could have changed his situation if he had recognized his own worth. However, he had been so eager to find something that he followed the first opportunity that came his way, as if it was meant to be.
After university, he tried to make a plan for a better life, but he was not surprised to find that he only wanted to get by. He applied for jobs he heard about from friends, following them as they moved forward, unable to see how he could find happiness in his work. He went to one job interview, grateful for the chance, but he didn’t think to evaluate the job itself, which was a vague editorial position at a local free newspaper. After a pleasant conversation with Neil, his boss, he didn’t consider the long-term challenges he would face. Neil offered him the job right away, saying he was the only graduate who had applied, which Ralph took as a compliment at the time."
CPE_45,C2,"**Goat Racing**
I was about to see goat racing on Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. I was pushing my way through ice-cream vans, large crowds, food stalls, and loud music. Even though everyone was moving towards the racecourse, I tried to find a good spot to watch. An area was blocked off to create a course for the goats. It was not as fancy as regular racecourses, but it was similar because spectators lined both sides of the ground where the goats would run. They were trying to keep a few selected goats in order, which is not easy because goats are known to eat almost anything.
**Canoe Trip**
As the day ended, I started to worry about the night ahead. The canoe was too wet to sleep in, there was nowhere to stop, and we hadn’t seen any villages or huts since early morning. In the dim moonlight, we used our flashlight to see the cliffs, but the flashlight batteries were dying. We changed the batteries, but they didn’t work. We realized we wouldn’t be able to find a place to camp. A few miles later, Lesley shouted that she saw a distant flickering light, and we felt hopeful. But the light was just the moonlight shining on the waves. Soon, we could hear the loud sound of rushing water, but we couldn’t see what was happening. Time seemed to stop as we continued on.
**How to Be Presentation Perfect**
I am not good at making presentations, but as the managing director, I often have to present to my colleagues and major shareholders. How can I improve my presentation skills and my confidence? You are not alone. Making a presentation requires different skills than running a company, but more senior executives are expected to be good at it. If you want to convince your audience, you must believe in what you are saying. Show your belief with passion and enthusiasm during your presentation. This means you need to prepare well. Test your ideas beforehand and ask colleagues to help you think of difficult questions your audience might ask. You should also create a positive atmosphere from the beginning. Start with something everyone can relate to and gradually lead to the conclusion you want to reach."
CPE_64,C2,"
Some activities cannot be rushed; they take the time they need. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you are impatient with mayonnaise and add the oil too quickly, it will not turn out right. If you pull hard on a tangled fishing line, the knot will just get tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some tasks are done very quickly, while others take seconds, minutes, hours, days, or even years. Some things can be done faster, like solving crossword puzzles or doing math in your head. But other things cannot be rushed. If you try to hurry them, they may fail, like the mayonnaise or the fishing line.
Sometimes, saying ""Think fast; we need results"" is not helpful, just like trying to get a good night's sleep in a short time. We learn, think, and understand in different ways, and these ways work at different speeds. There are three main speeds of thinking. 
The first is faster than thought. Some situations need an immediate reaction. For example, when my motorbike skidded on a wet road, my body reacted quickly to keep me safe, and only later did I think about what happened. A concert pianist or an Olympic fencer also does not have time to think about their next move. This quick reaction can be called our ""wits.""
The second speed is thought itself. This involves figuring things out, weighing options, and solving problems. A mechanic trying to fix a car, a scientist interpreting results, or a student working on an assignment are all using this type of intelligence, which we often call ""intellect."" People who are good at solving these problems are seen as ""bright"" or ""clever.""
The third speed is slower and less direct. It is more relaxed and dreamy. In this mode, we think about things slowly, like when we are daydreaming or meditating. Sitting on a rock by the sea, listening to the waves, is a different mental state than planning a meal or writing a letter. This slow way of thinking is just as important as the faster types. Taking time to think is necessary, especially when life gets busy. 
Some everyday problems are better solved with a slow mind. Some complex issues can only be understood with a relaxed attitude. Recent studies show that slower thinking is good for understanding complicated situations. Deliberate thinking works well for clear problems. For example, deciding where to go on holiday is usually straightforward. But when we are unsure about what to consider or when the issue is complicated, we need to use our slow thinking.
If the problem is how to manage a difficult team at work or whether to change careers, it may be better to sit and think rather than rush for answers. This type of intelligence is linked to creativity and wisdom. Poets and philosophers have long understood the limits of fast thinking and have tried to develop slower ways of knowing. Recently, scientists have begun to study these slower ways of thinking. The field of cognitive science is showing that our unconscious mind can do many interesting and important tasks if given enough time. It can learn patterns that our conscious mind might miss, understand complex situations, and solve difficult problems better than quick thinking can."
CPE_29,C2,"Surviving in a Foreign Land**
I have been welcomed warmly. It’s a friendly and well-equipped base camp in a very isolated place. At any time, there are about forty people here - scientists, students, weather experts, and satellite trackers - in a close community where everyone helps each other. My school French is just enough to communicate, but not enough for casual conversation. I miss the small details in conversations, and my phrasebook is not helpful at breakfast. This is not a practical problem for me, but at first, I struggled with my self-confidence. I found myself a bit nervous about mealtimes. I would hesitate, worried about which table to choose, scared of the silence that followed when I spoke, and anxious in a way I haven’t felt since my first weeks of school. I still smile awkwardly or panic when people talk to me. I think this occasional sadness is not about missing company or communication, but because I have lost the social confidence that my speaking skills usually give me.
**Elliot**
When I first met Elliot, I was just a young author like many others, and he did not pay much attention to me. However, he never forgot a face. When I saw him here and there, he would shake my hand politely but did not want to get to know me better. If I saw him at the opera with someone important, he would often not notice me. But then I had a surprising success as a playwright, and I noticed that Elliot started to look at me differently. One day, I got a note from him asking me to lunch, and I thought he was testing me. After that, since my success brought me many new friends, I began to see him more often.
**Alfred Hitchcock**
The film director Alfred Hitchcock always said that he didn’t care about the story of his films or the acting, but he did care about the visuals and the sound. For Hitchcock, it wasn’t a message that moved the audience, nor was it a great performance. He believed that people react to pure film, no matter their cultural background. So, if a film is made well in terms of its emotional effect, the Japanese audience should react at the same time as the Indian audience. Hitchcock was always clear and logical in his self-assessment. He was a man of reason and a talented craftsman who liked to hear the audience scream. He did not focus on speculation or deep ideas, and his view of his own characters was straightforward. He focused on film, pure film, and the clear, measurable beauty of what a film can do to an audience."
CPE_57,C2,"Amateur Astronomy**
Many things have changed in astronomy over the last fifty years. Until about thirty years ago, there were not many charts and catalogues available. Telescopes were limited, and there were few books on practical astronomy. Today, there are many types of telescopes and equipment that people can buy. Electronic calculators and computers have changed how almanacs and charts are made, and they have made it easier to analyze observations and publish results. This might be seen as the golden age of amateur astronomy. However, a lot has also been lost. Now, you may have to travel 80 km to find a dark sky, unlike the skies in cities 50 years ago. Daytime skies are often filled with airplane trails that can last for hours and spread out to form clouds, making it hard to observe the sun and stars at night.
**Too Much Choice**
Today, people have too many choices. There are too many things to do and too many options. In our modern economy, the desire for new products and services can feel like an addiction, and technology speeds up this change. New products come out quickly, and just as one is released, another is on the way. This can be overwhelming and tiring, leading to a feeling of disconnection from life. While choice is important in our economy, having too many choices can cause stress, take up time, and make life more complicated. Because of this, many people are looking for ""simplexity"" - the simple things that bring meaning to our complex lives. However, simplifying life is not easy in a world full of excess. There are more brands of detergent and breakfast cereals than we need, and more software updates and plans than we can keep track of.
**McAndrews Hotel**
Every summer, we spend two weeks at McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. This is a family tradition started by my grandmother, and it has become very important to us. Nothing can interfere with this ritual. We are a special group of guests at McAndrews: old-fashioned and perhaps a bit snobbish. I dislike the bad manners of shop assistants, which some people see as equality. I also do not like the overly friendly behavior of waiters who seem to struggle to keep their distance. I know the names of most of the other guests, as they have been coming here since childhood like me. However, I can be sure that when I see them in the hotel, we will only exchange polite greetings, respecting each other's privacy. This kind of respect is hard to find in hotels today."
CPE_9,C2,"**Text:**
**Othello**  
A great production of Shakespeare's play *Othello* has moved from Stratford to London. I want to correct an unfair review I wrote when the show first opened last spring. At that time, I said that Ray Fearon was too young for the title role and I criticized his acting. I still believe that changing the age difference between Othello and Desdemona changes the story, but I take back my comments about Mr. Fearon's wonderful performance. The entire cast is excellent. Some memorable scenes include the one where Cassio's games with other young officers become dangerous, and the moment when Iago starts to lose control and struggles to regain it. I challenge anyone not to cry during the scene where Emilia helps Desdemona get ready for bed. The pace and tension throughout the play are fantastic. Do not miss this production.
**Lake Vostok**  
In the middle of Antarctica, there is nothing alive. On the edges of the continent, there are many penguins, seals, and birds. But in the vast white area in the center, life does not exist. However, there is a large hidden lake called Lake Vostok, which is under nearly 4 kilometers of ice, right below the coldest place on Earth. The water has been cut off from air and sunlight for up to 25 million years. Biologists are eager to explore its mysterious depths and find out what strange organisms might be there. Geologists and glaciologists are also interested. For two years, researchers around the world have been planning ways to uncover the secrets of the lake, and if they succeed, we will see a lot of discoveries about Lake Vostok in the next few years.
**Scientists**  
Last week, I heard something interesting on the radio. A group of scientists is discussing what motivates them to be scientists; the phrase ""because it's there"" comes to mind. We all know that it is the long-standing quest for knowledge, the wish to understand everything from atoms to black holes. But these scientists want to know why we want to learn all of this in the first place and why science cannot explain our desire to know. I think it is more important to know if what we scientists are doing is right, rather than getting stuck in debates about the purpose of it all. I believe the key issue is not why we pursue science, but to understand that science is a tool, and we should decide how, where, when, and why to use it."
CPE_42,C2,"
**Food**  
Our relationship with food is very important and satisfying. Many people who enjoy cooking buy cookbooks like this one. However, we often think that cooking is only worth it for special occasions or complicated dishes. This is not true. You can make a delicious soup by simply putting some chopped carrots, a leek, celery, and herbs into water. This is much more satisfying than buying a packet or a tin of soup. Instead of buying a sweet chocolate mousse full of preservatives, you can make a tasty dessert in just five minutes that both adults and children will enjoy. Cooking is also a way to show care and love by sharing your food with others. Sharing meals is important to us, which is why we celebrate events like birthdays and anniversaries around a table. No one would choose to have takeout for a wedding or anniversary party, and few would want to discuss business over canned soup.
**In the Elevator**  
This morning, Alistair tried to clean up his office, but there were still papers everywhere. Tax forms were overflowing from drawers and boxes, waiting for a day when he would organize them. He also had a lot of paperwork from owning an apartment building. Many books and journals were close to the new bookshelves. As the elevator took him to his floor, he knew Mallory would arrive on time for their meeting. She would knock on his office door exactly at the hour. She was very strict about time and neatness. How would she react to the mess? She might think someone had broken in. He could walk in behind her and pretend to be shocked. Mrs. Wilson, his cleaning lady, had come while he was trying to clear some space on the floor. When he peeked out of his office as she was unlocking his apartment, he smiled at her, hoping she would help. But her expression was cold. She seemed to think there was no way she would go into his messy office.
**KAREN**  
Karen wanted to be different from her mother, so she created her own story, one of strength and uniqueness. In her story, there were important moments, like when she was twelve years old and her brother accidentally hit her in the eye with a golf club. At first, she thought she would go blind, but the bone protected her. The doctor later told her that the club had missed her eye, and she only needed a few stitches. When she opened her eyes in the doctor's office and saw her mother talking about miracles and small blessings, she felt that she was saved for a reason.
**Miss Fogerty**  
Miss Fogerty was both excited and sad as she walked back to her duties across the wet grass of the village green. It is always thrilling to be the first to know something important, especially in a small community, and Miss Fogerty's life was usually quiet. However, she felt deep sadness for Dr. Bailey's health. He had been her doctor for many years, and she appreciated his care during her yearly throat problems. His best quality was making patients feel like there was always enough time to talk about their worries. This quality made him very loved in the village. He was always willing to share his time, knowledge, and humor, and in return, he received great loyalty and affection from the people."
CPE_59,C2,"**Joanna's Lessons**
Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist. So why has she decided to write books for young children learning the piano? Even someone who cannot hear music well would be impressed by her performances. Watching her play the piano is exciting, as she plays many different styles of music, including classical, jazz, and blues. 
At a recent concert for kids, one small boy asked her, ""Can you play Match of the Day?"" This surprised many concert pianists, but Joanna found it funny. She realized that, to him, she was not a real pianist until she played that song. She played it well and probably remembered this moment for her next children's concert.
Joanna is unique among top concert pianists because she cares about how young children learn to play the piano. She has just published a beginner's piano book for children called *Joanna MacGregor's Piano World*. She has done this despite her busy schedule, which includes many music festivals and collaborations with other artists. 
Joanna believes that the first lessons in music are very important. Many music teachers focus on talented children, but she thinks that most people enjoy music in a more everyday way. She wants to make music accessible to everyone. 
From ages 18 to 25, before she became a concert pianist, Joanna taught many beginners. She also grew up in a home where her mother taught piano, and many children came to learn. This experience helped her understand that music should be available to everyone, not just those with exceptional talent. 
Joanna believes that just like everyone should learn to swim or speak a little French, everyone should try to learn the piano. Some children learn quickly, while others take their time and may give up. This can happen at any stage. Some kids find the beginning too hard, while others feel pressure to perform like children they see on TV.
She worries that some parents use music to push their children to achieve, instead of letting them enjoy it. Many children stop playing because they feel they cannot meet their parents' expectations.
When asked if she thinks other piano teaching books are not good, Joanna is careful not to criticize them. She believes her books are colorful and fun, but they are not the only ones that help beginners enjoy learning. To make her books interesting, she includes stories and music on CDs. 
Joanna wants learning to be fun. She encourages children to improvise and explore the piano. As they progress, they need to learn to read music, which can be challenging. Joanna understands this because she relied on her ear when she was young. However, she believes that practice is the most important part of learning.
To help children practice, she suggests they should have a clear goal. Other tips include playing through a piece, even with mistakes, and mixing difficult pieces with easier ones. She wants to support those who find practicing hard, as she knows it can be a struggle."
CPE_54,C2,"Writing by Hand and on Screen**
Dr. Johnson believed that ""what is written without effort is usually read without pleasure."" This means that good writing takes hard work. When I look back at my handwritten school essays, I notice they had very few mistakes. Today, I would rewrite them many times. I think this is because writing by hand was physically hard. The slow pace of writing helped me think carefully. When using a computer, it is easy to make mistakes. Many writers find that the time they spend fixing mistakes on a computer is about the same as the time they spent writing by hand. Also, emails, unlike handwritten letters, can feel less personal. Many love letters are now sent by email, which is a good thing. At least these emails are written in some form of English and grammar. However, words on a screen can feel dull. Writers often do not realize the power of writing and may exaggerate their messages. Words typed quickly can lack the care and personality of handwriting.
**The CD**
I put down my cup and went to look at the CD. The case was not impressive, but the shiny disc inside looked interesting. ""Wonderful little things, aren't they?"" Mr. Warriston said as he came back into the room. I agreed and carefully handed the disc to him. ""It's amazing they can fit seventy minutes of music on these,"" he said, bending down to the music player. He turned it on, and many lights lit up. He pressed a button, and a small drawer opened. He placed the disc inside, pressed the button again, and the drawer closed. ""Some people say they sound cold, but I think they..."" ""Do you have to turn them over like records?"" I asked. ""What? No,"" Mr. Warriston replied, standing up. ""You only play one side."" ""Why?"" I asked. He looked surprised and then thought for a moment. ""You know, I have no idea. I don't see why you couldn't make both sides playable and double the capacity..."" He looked at the machine. ""You could have two lasers, or just turn it over by hand... hmm."" He smiled at me. ""Yes, good point."" He nodded toward my wooden chair. ""Anyway, come on, let's get you sitting in the best place for the stereo effect, okay?"" I smiled, happy to have asked a technical question that Mr. Warriston could not answer.
**Books vs. Electronic Text**
When comparing books and electronic text, the author Malcolm Bradbury was right when he said that if matches had been invented after cigarette lighters, we would have been amazed at the improvement. Many people believe that electronic text is as important as the invention of printing, but they forget that changes in how we think take a long time. This idea is called chronocentricity, which means thinking that our generation is the most important in history. A book from 1979 said, ""In the 1980s, the book as we know it will slowly disappear."" So far, this has not happened. Reading long texts on a screen is often a bad experience, so most people do not do it. Computers encourage people to read only parts of texts. Some people say that this quick reading leads to new types of stories, but many books have always been read in a non-linear way. What is new is that computers do not encourage reading a text from start to finish.
**The Office**
Charles walked through the office door and saw a perfect world of order. The carpet was clear of papers, and the dark wooden desk looked just as he remembered it from the auction five weeks ago. Neat file holders were being put in their proper places. Twelve years of trade journals filled the shelves on one wall. Kathleen struggled to close the filing cabinet and then turned to him. ""You have to use computers, Charles. This is just too much."" ""Hello, Kathleen. Oh, this is amazing,"" he said, admiring the room and its antique furniture. He was not thinking about computers or any other machines, not even a pencil sharpener. ""Simply amazing,"" he said, avoiding the topic of computers. Over the two years he had known her, they had talked about this many times. She could never understand why he resisted technology when he was good with computers and had even published an important paper on computer skills. She had inspired that paper. Through the keyboard, she could explore any software and create something new that could do amazing things."
CPE_32,C2,"""You don’t take sugar, do you?"" shouted his secretary. She was not really asking; she was stating a fact because she had been making Lancelot coffee for many months. She often forgot small details because he was not usually supposed to be there. However, he was now there all the time, realizing that staying away only caused more problems. He thought about how he had gone from being a respected advisor, meeting authors and playwrights for lunch, to being overwhelmed with work and struggling to find a parking spot in the mornings.
""This came,"" she yelled, waving a manila folder before placing it in front of him. ""From that guy in Los Angeles. You said you wanted to see it."" A label on the folder read: ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert,"" and below it said ""An Expanded Synopsis."" Lancelot did not want to see the word ""synopsis."" He preferred to see a label that said ""A First Draft."" He had already seen a synopsis of this book and did not want to see another one, even if it was revised. Ian Cuthbert had received a large advance for this book when Lancelot had bought the company. Ian was one of several old friends Lancelot had mistakenly commissioned to write books. Ian was a clear example of how someone with a difficult personality often becomes even harder to manage when given a chance.
Lancelot skipped the introduction he had read many times and looked at the synopsis. He recognized almost every phrase. He closed the folder and pushed it aside. Clearly, at this rate, Ian's manuscript would never arrive. The synopsis lacked the brilliance Ian was known for, and beneath its playful tone, it felt empty of real ideas. Lancelot remembered stories about a famous author whose last book was published after his death, written chapter by chapter, with payments made one at a time. In that case, the payments were small parts of an advance that had never been given. Ian's advance had been huge, which went against the usual rule that authors must deliver a manuscript before getting paid.
Lancelot, who had studied modern languages at Oxford, remembered when Ian Cuthbert was seen as a great talent in Cambridge. Ian's peers aimed to take over British theatre, and they succeeded quickly. But Ian seemed less motivated than them. He wore his overcoat like a cape and spoke about a famous French writer as if he had been there. Yet, for some reason, Ian's creative talent remained hidden. While less talented people succeeded, Ian withdrew further. Even when he was influential as a literary critic, he was hard to work with. He was officially appointed to edit a magazine about the arts, but it never published anything despite using up a lot of money. His renewed contract with a fashion magazine led to stories about his high pay, which was increased to encourage him to produce more, and then to get him to produce anything at all.
At editorial meetings, Ian often criticized others' ideas harshly. Ten years later, he could hardly be counted on to show up for his own funeral. Lancelot was starting to think that ""A World History of the Short"" had been a mistake from the beginning."
CPE_65,C2,"England's Breakfast Revolution**
Health experts agree that a good breakfast is very important. However, in history, breakfast is a relatively new meal in England. There are few mentions of breakfast in medieval literature. Some travelers did eat a meal at dawn before long journeys, and sick people sometimes had breakfast for health reasons, but most people did not eat breakfast unless they were kings or nobles. 
In the sixteenth century, breakfast started to become common for everyone. Some writers believe this happened because food became more available. However, they may not have considered other important social changes. For example, new work patterns meant that more people had jobs with set hours. Many of these jobs started very early in the morning. As a result, eating a meal in the morning became necessary and was no longer just for the wealthy."
CPE_61,C2,"**Photography**  
When a photographer takes a picture, they choose what to show based on their skills, personal views, and experiences, as well as social and cultural influences. In this book, we will explore how these factors affect the style, content, and meaning of a photograph, and how viewers understand and react to these images. For example, a casual reader of a newspaper usually understands the photographs printed on the page. However, instead of just accepting the photograph as it is, we might ask if it truly shows what the scene looked like at that time. Does it express the photographer's opinion? Is the exact moment captured important, or should we see the photograph as a symbol of a situation in the world?
**More than a Game**  
For me, sport has always been more than just a game. The most successful athletes have strong self-belief. You need to focus completely if you want to succeed in sports. There is only one way to be the best, and you must set aside everything else. Sports can be harsh, and no one will do the work for you. It’s a matter of survival. Sports have taught me discipline and determination, but they also show the value of teamwork. My sport allows me to shine individually, but it is still a team effort, and I must balance both. This is similar to life – you can achieve as an individual, but you must remember that others are around you. Sports have given me a lot, not just money. They have opened doors for me and shown me things around the world that many people will never see. However, you also have to sacrifice a lot for these rewards.
**Tuning In**  
Some experiences stay in our memory so clearly that they create moments of clarity. For me, such a moment happened one night in California many years ago when I lay awake listening to a mockingbird singing from a hidden spot in one of the tall trees in the neighborhood. I don’t have trouble sleeping – it was the beautiful singing that kept me awake. As I listened to the bird’s complex melodies, I found myself in a surprising artistic experience. To understand the bird's patterns, I had to think about my knowledge of jazz and Indian classical music. The bird made me feel like I was enjoying an amazing live performance. I reacted with groans and cheers as one surprising musical variation followed another through the open window until I finally fell asleep."

""People have always had strong feelings about birds. But what does this say about us? Paul Evans reports. 
There is a bumping sound coming from the greenhouse. A little brown bird, a wren, is bouncing against the glass. Is it trying to send a message from another world, or is it just a bird stuck inside? Depending on how you see it, both could be true. 
Wrens have been part of British culture for a long time. In medieval times, people believed that the direction in which wrens flew could tell them about their luck. Today, images of wrens can still be found in many British homes. Even if old beliefs have faded, the wren still holds a special place in our hearts. A place without wrens feels sad and empty. 
This connection to birds comes from a time when people were more connected to nature for their survival. They developed a way to understand the importance of other creatures. However, these beliefs can change over time. 
For example, the red kite was once seen as a valuable bird in London, known for taking bread from children. But soon, people began to see them as pests, and they disappeared from many areas except Wales. Over time, red kites became symbols of conservation in Britain and are now protected and reintroduced to help them thrive again. 
Our relationship with birds goes back to the beginning of human history. Early humans watched birds closely because they could warn them about danger, bad weather, and food sources. Birds also connected them to their dreams. When we wonder why birds matter to us, we are also exploring what it means to be human. 
Birds represent flight, song, and freedom. Our interest in them reflects our own identity in relation to nature. Some people might think these feelings are outdated, but they are still part of who we are. Losing this connection would be difficult. 
Recently, birds have become important indicators of environmental change. In Britain, 30 bird species are now endangered, which is sad not only because we are losing these beautiful creatures but also because it represents a loss of culture. Birds carry a lot of meaning. For example, the skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing represent spiritual love, romantic love, and magic. Anyone familiar with the poems of Shelley, Shakespeare, and Robert Graves will feel sad about losing these birds. 
However, the loss of other birds that are not mentioned in literature or folklore is often ignored. Folklore is very important. The stories and legends that have survived over time create a strong connection to the birds, more so than scientific terms. This connection helps us feel emotions that are often hidden in our busy lives. 
Whether we watch wildlife films or observe birds in our gardens, the joy we feel cannot be fully explained by science. Birds engage us in ways that are hard to understand, and the stories we tell about them help us interpret their messages. The wren in the greenhouse connects our present with a distant past, holding onto its song and moving into the future—a mystery that keeps us thinking."""
CPE_28,C2,"**Maps**
The purpose of a map is to show the relationships between points and features on the earth's surface. These relationships are based on distance and direction. In the past, distance was often described in terms of time, such as ""a few hours' walk"" or ""a day's journey by river."" This way of measuring distance provided more information about how easy it was to travel through different areas rather than the actual distance. 
Direction is also important, but for most travelers, the main questions were ""Where do I go from here?"" and ""How far away is it?"" Therefore, having an exact representation of direction was not always necessary. Because of this, written directions were often used alongside maps for a long time. Even today, some maps, like those showing train routes, do not always show true directions. 
In the past, important landmarks along a route were marked by signs, which could be realistic or simple symbols, and their size indicated how important they were. The way maps were made varied depending on their purpose and location, so understanding the specific style used in early maps is essential.
The history of map-making, or cartography, is mainly about improving the accuracy of distance and direction and expanding the information included on maps. To achieve this, cartographers have used knowledge from other sciences. For example, instead of finding direction by looking at shadows or stars, they began using the magnetic compass and developed tools to measure angles accurately.
As explorers learned more about the world, they tried to create maps of what they knew. Astronomers discovered that the earth is not a perfect sphere but is slightly flattened at the poles, which led to better mapping techniques for large areas. 
Over time, the needs of map users changed. Travelers and merchants were no longer the only people using maps. Soldiers, especially after the invention of artillery, needed accurate maps to understand the land's features. This led to the creation of contour maps. Other users, like archaeologists, historians, and modern geographers, also had specific needs for maps. 
Today, cartographers create maps that show various types of information, such as geological layers, climate zones, and land use. The growing recognition of the importance of maps in many scientific fields has led to a modern revival of cartography.
It is important to note that the development of maps has not always been a straight path. There have been times of slow progress, mixed with periods of rapid change, where old ideas coexisted with new ones. Cartographers have often understood the theory behind improvements but had to wait for better tools to put their ideas into practice. Since it is easy to make a map by copying an old one, many map publishers have been slow to accept new ideas.
Therefore, maps should not be taken at face value as proof of current knowledge and techniques. The many maps we have today are the result of significant human effort and thought. They provide a valuable record for those studying human history, making the study of historical cartography both interesting and educational."
CPE_35,C2,"
I was taken into a young man's living room, which was a nice and calm place compared to the messy rooms where the rest of his family spent time. Moving from the kitchen to his room felt like going from economy to business class. This room had the biggest collection of records I had ever seen, the first stereo record player I had encountered, and it was surprising to see a teenager who had bought Georgian wine glasses, pictures, and furniture. His name was Andrew Lloyd Webber. He had received a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford, to study history, and he had nine months before starting, during which he wanted to become England's version of the composer Richard Rodgers. My own dreams were just as crazy; I wanted to be a pop star for the usual reasons: women, money, and fame. The difference between Andrew and me was that my dreams were not life or death, although they might have felt that way if I had failed. So, when Andrew suggested that I try to become a famous lyricist like Oscar Hammerstein, I was open to it. This was partly because, within ten minutes of meeting him, he played me three of his own tunes, and I could tell he was very talented. As he confidently played songs from the many shows he had created at school, I was reminded of the best show albums from my parents' collection. He needed a new lyricist for his work. I didn’t have much to impress him with, except for praising his music and showing him a seven-inch single of a song I had written with an unknown pop group that had not done well. We said we would meet again and write something together. I was still more interested in pop music than in theatre, but I thought I had met someone special who would succeed in musical theatre soon. Even if we didn’t become top composers, we could try to compete with the Beatles and Rolling Stones later in the summer. The Everly Brothers had just made a comeback and would need new songs. 
The next day, back at my desk in the office where I was training to be a lawyer, the excitement I had felt about a life in show business with Andrew had faded a bit. I would still look for ads in Melody Maker for groups needing a singer and write more simple songs that wouldn’t show my voice’s limits, but it was likely I would finish my exams and become a respectable lawyer by twenty-five. By then, I would probably have outgrown pop music, as my father had predicted I would by twenty-one. This worried me—if he was right, I only had a few months left to enjoy it. But I felt I had nothing to lose by seeing Andrew again. It would be fun to go to a musical with him and write lyrics for musicals instead of pop songs. Andrew was an interesting person who talked about good food and Victorian architecture and supported Leyton Orient football team. I wasn’t sure about the musical idea he had been working on for a year, but in 1965, I was rarely sure about anything. His talent was clear, and he said he had many contacts. I soon found myself back in his living room. The idea was about Dr. Thomas Barnardo, a 19th-century philanthropist who started orphanages. His story was important, but it didn’t excite me much. The hero seemed too perfect in Andrew's version, and the idea felt unoriginal, too similar to Lionel Bart's hit show, Oliver. However, Andrew's strong belief in his music was contagious and somewhat justified. What did I know about musicals? As David Land, who would later be my agent for over twenty-five years, often said, if there is a demand for one hamburger place, there is room for two. We could be the second one. I started working with great enthusiasm, especially on the funny songs. Andrew explained the plot, played me the tunes, and often gave me the titles, which had likely been thought up by his school friend who had tried writing before. I even skipped a day at the law office, pretending to be sick, to write my first set of theatrical lyrics. I didn’t know it then, but I had changed my career."
CPE_5,C2,"**Text:**
**Language**  
You and I are part of a species with a special ability: we can influence each other's thoughts with great accuracy. Language is so important in human life that it is hard to imagine living without it. If you see two or more people together anywhere in the world, they will likely start talking to each other. When there is no one to talk to, people often talk to themselves, their pets, or even their plants. I like to think of language as an 'instinct.' This means that people know how to speak in a way similar to how spiders know how to spin webs. Web-spinning was not created by a brilliant spider and does not require special education or skills in building.
**Climate and Weather**  
Climate and weather, which are mainly caused by the air around us, greatly affect the lives of animals and plants. Climate can strongly influence the appearance of landscapes. For example, warm and wet conditions all year round allow tropical jungles to grow, which are full of many different species. In contrast, cold and windy areas can only support a few types of living things. The daily weather patterns that create the climate are caused by large air masses rising and mixing, as the atmosphere is always moving. Some of this movement is because the layer of gases is on a spinning planet. Since air is light, it does not move at the same speed as the Earth and tends to lag behind. However, a more important cause of air movement is the sun.
**Coffee**  
As a barista, my job included serving drinks, but I was also responsible for making coffee. In Lygon Street, Melbourne, a restaurant's success can depend on its coffee. I spent several days training to make coffee, learning more than I ever wanted to know about cleaning and maintaining the restaurant's shiny espresso machine. I also learned the key principles for making a perfect, rich cappuccino. By the end of the first week, I realized that making a good cup of coffee was not as easy as it seemed, and I thought I might be sent back to simple tasks like cleaning ashtrays. Fortunately, my boss was patient. ""Making coffee is both an art and a science,"" he said, ""and you need time to learn how to do it well."""
CPE_41,C2,"Art on TV**
Why does television often struggle with programs about visual arts? Painting and sculpture are perfect subjects for the camera, which can show an entire artwork and then zoom in to see the details. However, there are few TV series that truly capture the joy and complexity of viewing art. A good example of this is Robert Hughes's eight-part series on American art, called *American Visions*. Hughes is a respected critic with a strong personality, and he has almost eight hours to introduce British viewers to an art style that is often overlooked in British galleries. I expected the series to focus on famous artworks, but instead, it explored how American history and culture are shown in its art and architecture.
**Dealing in Metals**
For 20 years, I worked as an international metals dealer and became known as a speculator. The metals market is less regulated than other markets. With some luck, a willingness to take risks, and a good understanding of the market, it is possible to earn a lot of money. Taking risks is a normal part of this industry. This adventurous culture fits well with a free-market global economy. However, the free-trade economists who believed that the market would keep the prices of scarce metals high have found the opposite is true. More minerals are being mined, and the cost of raw materials is going down. When considering inflation, the prices of most metals are about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to investigate claims against a multinational company that benefits from these low-cost raw materials.
**Extract from a Holiday Brochure**
Abaco and its nearby cays are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas, which stretch from Florida to Cuba. Each island has its own character and offers something unique. To explore the islands and cays of Abaco, a boat is essential. If a boat is not included with your accommodation, don’t worry. There are many ferries and water taxis available. You can also rent boats if you prefer to explore on your own. Sailing is the most popular way to travel here. Abaco is known as 'The Sailing Capital of the World' for good reasons. The calm, protected waters are also perfect for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The cays and their beaches stretch for 200 miles like a string of pearls. At night, the lights of the restaurants and cafes in Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay shine brightly."
CPE_69,C2,"Build Your Own Bamboo Bike at the UK's First Workshop**
Join a course at the Bamboo Bike Club, led by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan, where you can create your own custom bamboo bike frame and enjoy a fun weekend of bike-building. It’s Saturday morning in Hackney Wick, east London, and the Bamboo Bike Club is busy with activity. This is the only bamboo bike-building course in Britain.
Bamboo is becoming a popular material for bike construction. Companies like Calfee Design from California and Bamboo Bikes from Yorkshire have brought back this method, which has been around since 1894. However, many cyclists find ready-made bamboo frames too expensive, costing around $2,995 or £1,868. This high price inspired James and Ian to spend years working in a shed in Brecon, Wales, to create a bamboo bike business that is affordable for regular cyclists. They wanted to share the joy of making something unique and sustainable, not just sell bike frames.
The Bamboo Bike Club is more about community than business. James works on wind turbines, and Ian is a civil engineer, but they run monthly courses where you can build your own bike frame at a reasonable price. 
On the first day of the course, James and Ian teach participants how to choose strong bamboo and create solid joints. They guide everyone as they glue the bamboo tubes together to form the bike frame. Alloy tubes are added for parts that need extra strength, like the handlebars and wheel forks. This process can be challenging, especially for those who are not used to DIY projects. However, James and Ian are there to help, checking every cut and joint.
Many participants are engineers, but Ian assures everyone that it’s okay to make mistakes. If you mess up, just try again with a new piece of bamboo. Each piece has been checked for quality, allowing you to choose the look of your bike frame: plain bamboo, black, or mottled.
On Sunday, the focus shifts to building the lugs, which are the parts that connect the frame. Hemp bindings are wrapped around the joints and glued to create a strong bond. After adding a waterproof coating, the bike is ready for wheels, brakes, gears, and personal touches. James and Ian claim that their bamboo bikes are just as strong as metal ones. Ian has used his bike for over a year on a 16-mile commute, and James has tested his bike off-road for three months without breaking it.
While bamboo bikes may not look as polished as professional ones, they are unique. James and Ian believe that the individuality of each bike is important. Personally, I think bamboo bikes are best for relaxed rides rather than racing. I choose a 'Classic English' frame for a comfortable ride. 
I test James's bike, and it feels light and smooth, thanks to bamboo's ability to absorb vibrations. James says that while some people enjoy building the bike, the real joy comes when riding it. Bamboo bikes are light and fun to ride, and they cost less than £500."

**Self-help Books**  
Diane Reverend was an editor at Random House in New York when she first saw a manuscript by an unknown pop psychologist, Dr. John Gray. ""I took one look at the title and knew it would be a bestseller,"" she says, and she was right. Dr. Gray is now very successful, and Diane Reverend has her own company. Dr. Gray's book about improving communication between men and women is very popular and represents a growing self-help industry. This industry tries to meet many people's desires for self-improvement. However, it also creates new desires and supports the publishing industry in New York. In Britain, people are discovering that this genre can produce many books that are not very good, but there are even worse ones. For every self-help book published, many others are rejected because they are too similar or too specific. This is a good thing. As new editors look for the next big hit, the quality of writing is often not a priority. What matters most is how marketable the book is. ""How promotable is the author? What's the 'hook'? Is it universal enough?"" Ms. Reverend lists the important questions. She adds, ""If someone comes to me with a catchy title, that's two-thirds of the battle won. You know you can reach people.""
**Autobiographies**  
There should be an understanding between an autobiographer and the reader that the truth is being told. However, this understanding is often not fully respected. There are many reasons why a writer might not tell the whole truth. They may have thoughts or actions they feel are too shameful to share. They might also think some things are not important enough to write about. Sometimes, the writer may feel that telling a story that captures the truth is better than sticking strictly to the facts. They might even call their book an autobiography just to make readers believe it is true, even if it is mostly fiction. This can happen without any intention to deceive.
**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**  
Students of detective stories say that this genre reflects the conflicts of society in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The detective story often symbolizes deeper human desires like lust or greed, and solving the crime represents restoring order in society. In Hammett's stories, society is shown to be corrupt and false. The detective and the criminal are two sides of the same person. They understand each other and are somewhat comfortable together. The detective is seen as too honest by criminals and too shady by the law. He is both a criminal and a competitor. Sometimes, the detective feels guilty about his role, and this can make him more eager to punish the criminal.
**Science Writing**  
Stephen Jay Gould is one of the best scientific essayists today. To discuss his writing, I met him at the Grand Hotel while he was promoting his new book. Neither of us felt comfortable there. Gould said he could not write in such a fancy place. He believes that knowing the culture is important for a successful writer. Science is its own world, and only scientists can effectively explain it. If you do not understand the community and its rules, you will struggle. One of Gould's main ideas is to never write down to the reader. ""Make no concessions,"" he says. ""You can simplify the language but must never change the main idea. If readers feel you are talking down to them, they will lose interest."""
CPE_17,C2,"**Air-conditioning**  
At Cannons Gym, a popular place for City of London workers during lunch, the air feels very cold. To handle this summer's high temperatures, the gym has used a lot of air-conditioning. Sometimes, when it is quiet, the gym feels like it is in the Arctic. This shows how people often misuse air-conditioning today. It has become an important part of our work and leisure, showing how we can control the climate. However, many air-conditioned buildings could use other ways to stay cool. They could use natural light and fresh air, and have thicker walls that keep heat out during the day and let it go at night. These ideas may seem simple, but they can make a big difference and would reduce the need for air-conditioning.
**Sundials**  
It is interesting that as we start a new millennium, people are becoming more interested in sundials, which are tools that measure time based on the sun's position. A hundred years ago, sundials were important for keeping time accurately. But as clocks and watches improved, sundials became just garden decorations. Now, they are being taken seriously again. David Harber, a maker of sundials, believes their charm comes from their connection to the planets. He says there is a special moment when a sundial starts to work. They are calm and beautiful objects that remind us of our place in the universe.
**Paint Your Own China**  
My idea of china-painting came from a visit to an arts and crafts show long ago, where serious-looking older women showed how to paint delicate flowers on teacups with careful brushstrokes. It was fascinating to watch, as each stroke created a perfect petal or leaf. Their hands were steady, and the paint never smudged. I thought these women must have practiced for many years or had a special talent. Because of this, I wondered what kind of people would join a china-painting class. Would beginners have a natural talent? However, the atmosphere in the class was not scary at all. Everyone was there to have fun, and even the teacher did not want to paint flowers on teacups as quickly as I had remembered."
CPE_47,C2,"The Wrong Country**
Uncle chose a package holiday for Keith and Dawne at a good price: a flight from Gatwick Airport, twelve nights in Venice, the beautiful city, at the Pensione Concordia. When they went to the travel agency to book, the clerk told them that the other people in their package were a school group from the south coast, all learning Italian. But something went wrong. Either at the travel agency, the check-in desk, or in a computer, a small mistake happened. Dawne and Keith ended up in a hotel called the Edelweiss, in Room 212, somewhere in Switzerland.
At Gatwick, they gave their tickets to a girl in a yellow-and-red uniform. She called them by name, checked their tickets, and said everything was fine. An hour later, they were surprised to hear older people on the plane speaking with accents from the North of England. Keith thought there must have been a cancellation, or maybe the Italian class was on another plane. They ordered drinks, and then more drinks. 
When they landed, a stout woman with glasses said, ""The coach will take us on. Stay together now."" There was no mention of an overnight stop in the brochure, but when the coach arrived at its destination, Keith realized that this was clearly an unexpected stop. It was close to midnight, and tired from traveling, they did not question their right to the beds they were offered. But the next morning, when they found out they were being offered the beds for their entire holiday, they became worried.
""We have the lake and the water birds,"" the receptionist smiled and explained. ""And we can take the boat to Interlaken."" 
""An error has been made,"" Keith said calmly, trying to stay composed. He could feel his wife's nervous breathing beside him. ""We were supposed to be in Venice, at the Pensione Concordia."" 
""I do not know that name, sir. This is Switzerland,"" the receptionist replied. 
""A coach is supposed to take us on. An official said so on the plane. She was here last night,"" Keith insisted. 
""Your group is booked for twelve nights in the Edelweiss Hotel. If you have changed your minds—"" 
""We haven't changed our minds. There has been a mistake."" The receptionist shook his head, saying he did not know about any mistake. 
""The man who made the booking,"" Dawne interrupted, ""was bald, with glasses and a moustache."" She gave the name of the travel agency in London. 
""Is there a problem?"" a woman said, smiling at Keith. She was the stout woman he had seen as an official. They had noticed her talking to the girl at Gatwick. 
""My name is Franks,"" she said. ""I'm married to the man with the bad leg."" 
""Are you in charge, Mrs. Franks?"" Dawne asked. ""We are in the wrong hotel."" Again, she gave the name of the travel agency and described the bald clerk, mentioning his glasses and moustache. 
""It seems we got into the wrong group. We reported to the Your-Kind-of-Holiday girl and left it to her,"" Keith explained. 
""We should have known when they weren't from Dover,"" Dawne added. ""We heard them talking about Darlington."" 
Keith made an impatient sound, wishing she would let him talk. ""We noticed you at Gatwick,"" he said. ""We knew you were in charge."" 
""And I noticed you. I counted you, although you probably didn't see me. Let me explain. There are many places Your-Kind-of-Holiday sends its clients, with different holidays at different prices. There are villa holidays for adventurous people under thirty-five, and treks to Turkey and the Himalayas."" 
""What I am trying to say is that all tickets and labels look similar, yellow with two red bands,"" Mrs. Franks said, laughing. ""So if you just followed others with the yellow-and-red label, you might think you could end up anywhere! But of course,"" she added kindly, ""that couldn't happen."" 
""We're not supposed to be in Switzerland,"" Keith insisted. 
""Well, let's see,"" Mrs. Franks said unexpectedly, and then she walked away, leaving them standing there. The receptionist was no longer at the desk, and they could hear typing. 
""She seems quite nice,"" Dawne whispered. Keith was not listening. He tried to remember everything that had happened: giving the tickets to the girl, waiting, and then the girl leading them to the plane, and the pilot welcoming them aboard. 
""Nice to have some young people along,"" an elderly man said, interrupting Keith's thoughts. ""Nottage is the name."" His wife was with him, and they both looked like they were in their eighties. She said they had slept very well, thanks to the lakeside air. 
""That's nice,"" Dawne said. Keith walked out of the reception area, and Dawne followed him. Outside the hotel, they did not say that there was an irony in what had happened. On their first holiday since their honeymoon, they had ended up in a package tour with older people when the whole point of the holiday was to escape the needs and demands of the elderly. Uncle had said so himself when they tried to convince him to join them."
CPE_48,C2,"'HE WAS A PEOPLE PERSON'**
American business leaders are looking to the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a model for good management. Eluned Price reports.
Most people in Britain know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and what he did. However, America has only recently discovered him. The Wall Street Journal described Shackleton as ""an Antarctic explorer whose achievements went mostly unnoticed for most of the 20th century,"" which is an exaggeration. Now, Americans are showing great interest in him. Biographies and stories about the voyage of the Endurance are being published quickly. The American Museum of Natural History is preparing a big exhibition, and a film about Shackleton's life is in the works.
Some American managers have also chosen Shackleton as a role model. They share stories about his actions with admiration and find lessons in leadership and communication from his experiences. The determined and resourceful Shackleton, with his reindeer sleeping bag and blubber stove, has become a symbol for modern management consultants.
Jim MacGregor, a managing partner at Abernathy MacGregor Frank in New York, has looked up to Shackleton for years. His firm focuses on communication during mergers, acquisitions, and corporate crises. For example, they deal with situations like ""the plant exploded"" or ""half the workers have to be let go."" While Shackleton did work in public relations for a steel company in Glasgow, it may be hard to see how his experience in extreme conditions relates to managing a financial crisis.
""Even if a company handles its crises well, it can still harm itself by communicating poorly,"" says MacGregor. ""Shackleton is a model for management because of his leadership and communication skills. He had clear values and was at his best when he and his team had a lot to lose, like their lives. One of Shackleton's most interesting decisions was to turn back when he was only 97 miles from the South Pole. This choice showed his commitment to his men's safety.""
This refers to Shackleton's 1908 expedition to reach the South Pole. When he was 97 miles away, unexpected delays used up their supplies, and they had limited time to return to their ship. Shackleton made the brave decision to turn back. In a crisis, people want to know that someone is in charge. While many managers today avoid responsibility, Shackleton was willing to take charge.
His 1914 expedition became legendary. His ship, the Endurance, drifted in ice for nine months before being crushed. When the ship sank, Shackleton told his men, ""We should all reach safety if you do your best and trust me."" From the accounts and diaries kept during the journey, it is clear that Shackleton was always in control. 
""Shackleton thought everything through, planned for every situation, kept his men informed, and asked for their opinions,"" says MacGregor. ""He was flexible, willing to change plans when necessary. We have developed effective principles based on Shackleton's example. Clients can relate to his story without feeling criticized.""
Shackleton believed that an explorer needs optimism, endurance, and patience. ""One of the hardest things to do in tough situations is to wait, especially in America, where people often want quick solutions,"" says MacGregor. ""If you invest in bonds and guess wrong about interest rates, you should hold on and wait to get your money back. Selling too soon would mean a big loss. Also, don't be afraid to change your plans if they aren't working. If a new product isn't selling, don't keep pushing it.""
Shackleton led by example. On the way back from the Endurance, he saw Hurley, the expedition photographer, without gloves. He insisted Hurley wear his gloves, saying he would throw them overboard if he didn't. Someone else remembered Shackleton doing something similar with a biscuit when they were close to starving on the 1905 expedition: ""He said he would leave it in the snow. Millions of pounds couldn't have bought that biscuit.""
As Caroline Alexander, author of *Endurance*, says: ""The public's interest in heroic efforts is growing. Shackleton shows that there is little heroism today. Everything else fades away, and he stands out as a true example of the ideals we long for today."""
CAE_15,C1,"'Finding Food in Madagascar'**
In the forests of Madagascar, there is a special primate called the aye-aye. Its way of finding food is similar to that of a woodpecker. Both the aye-aye and the woodpecker dig into wood to find insect larvae. The woodpecker uses its beak to make holes and its long tongue to get the insects. The aye-aye, however, uses its sharp front teeth to chew into the wood and its long third finger to reach inside and scoop out the insects.
Although scientists first described the aye-aye's unusual feeding method over a hundred years ago, they have only recently learned how it finds the insects hidden in the wood. Dr. Carl Erickson from Duke University studied the hunting skills of two male aye-ayes named Nosferatu and Poe, a female named Samantha, and her baby, Annabelle. He wanted to see if they could find insects by looking for signs, like holes in the wood where insects might have entered.
Dr. Erickson gave the aye-ayes logs with narrow holes. Some holes led to food, while others were empty. The aye-ayes went straight to the holes with food, showing they did not need to see the surface holes to find it. It was thought they might find the mealworms by smell or sound, but further tests showed they did not use these senses either. They could find food even when the smell was blocked and when the mealworms were dead and silent.
So, how did the aye-ayes find the insects? Dr. Erickson found that they would chew into both empty spaces and those with food. It seems they can sense the hollow spaces. When looking for food, an aye-aye taps the wood with its long finger and moves its large ears forward to listen. Dr. Erickson believes the aye-aye is using echo-location, listening for sounds that show there is a hollow space below. It can also hear insects moving when they are disturbed by the tapping.
Some scientists think the aye-aye fills the role of woodpeckers in Madagascar's forests. However, there are also birds like the Sickle-billed and Nuthatch Vangas that look for insects in wood, so the woodpecker role may not be empty. The aye-aye is not only like a woodpecker and an echo-locating bat, but it also acts like a squirrel. Its front teeth grow continuously like a squirrel's, and it has been seen in the wild chewing through nut shells and using its long finger to get the nut meat inside."
CAE_19,C1,"Ordinary People, Ordinary Lives**
Many of us have photographs of our grandparents, but how many of us really know what their lives were like when they were young? The few diaries we find often do not tell the whole story, and family stories are often only partly remembered. What will our grandchildren know about us? We often plan to write things down, but we never seem to do it. We might leave videos instead of photographs, but videos are still just images.
Hannah Renier has found a solution: she writes autobiographies for other people. She creates a hardback book of at least 20,000 words, with pictures if needed. Her books tell the stories of ordinary people, not famous ones. The idea came to her when she spoke with her family and realized how much of the past was being forgotten. 
""When I started, I didn’t take it as seriously as I do now,"" she says. ""I have met people who really want to share their interesting lives. They say they are doing it for their children or for future generations, but they also enjoy the process.""
The promise of confidentiality helps her subjects feel free to share their true feelings. A 62-year-old man who has experienced both success and failure said, ""I was surprised at what came out. There were painful memories, like my divorce, and the hurt is still there."" He wrote his story for his family, but he hasn’t let his children read it yet because he feels they might be hurt by some details. He thinks it might be better for them to read it after he is gone.
He also noticed patterns from his childhood that led him to make the same mistakes in life. Ms. Renier has seen this in others too. ""Many people are influenced by their parents,"" she says. ""The lessons they learned as children affect them for the rest of their lives. They often repeat the same behaviors, marrying people their parents liked or choosing partners as a way to rebel.""
Many people express regrets about their past. Even after many years, they still feel unresolved issues with their parents. If someone had problems in their youth, they often still have them as adults. They may try to impress a parent who never noticed their efforts, and some even seek permission to say they dislike their mother.
Ms. Renier listens rather than asks too many questions. ""This is not for the public, and I am not a nosy person,"" she explains. Sometimes, people share something and then worry if it should be included. She includes it anyway, allowing them to remove things later. Most people want to be honest about their lives.
""This is not vanity publishing,"" she says. ""It’s not about people saying, 'Look at my interesting life.' Things are changing quickly in our world, and we are losing touch with our past. This work helps people connect with their roots. We need to remember our ancestors because families are not as close as they used to be. People want to feel a sense of immortality.""
Each book involves up to 30 hours of recorded interviews, which Ms. Renier uses to write the life story, organizing the events and interpreting them. Modern technology helps her create everything except the binding, which has gold lettering. Clients can choose the color of the cover and the title. The final product is well-organized and well-written, reflecting the life of the person it is about. 
The books are not cheap; they cost nearly £3,000, with extra copies available for £25 each. Ms. Renier receives about 10 inquiries a week, but the high cost stops many people from ordering. ""I thought it would be a more affordable product,"" she says. ""But the people I have worked with are often from wealthy backgrounds, readers of magazines like Harpers & Queen, which is where I advertise. They are the kind of people who would have had their portraits painted to pass down to their descendants."""
CAE_24,C1,"**A. The University Museum of Classical Archaeology**  
The Museum of Classical Archaeology is one of the few places in the world that has a collection of casts of Greek and Roman sculptures, with over six hundred pieces. It is important to note that none of the sculptures are real. All the sculptures are exact copies made from the originals, mostly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Museum is located in a specially designed gallery with great natural light. The benefits of plaster casts are many: groups of sculptures that were originally displayed together but are now in different museums across Europe can be seen together as they were meant to be. You can see almost all the famous works of Greek and Roman sculpture in just one afternoon.
**B. Cambridge Darkroom**  
Cambridge Darkroom is a center for photography that has community darkrooms and a gallery showing different photography exhibitions. We regularly offer courses and workshops for people of all ages and skill levels, including a popular Beginner's Course, a shorter Induction Course, and Master Classes with guest photographers. We have a membership program that allows all members to use our darkrooms. We also support young photographers (aged 12 to 16) to improve their skills through our Young Members program, led by our resident photographer. We sell photography books and magazines and have a full range of photographic materials.
**C. Sedgwick Museum of Geology**  
The Sedgwick Museum has a wonderful collection of fossil animals and plants, rocks, and minerals from all geological ages and parts of the world. It also has Britain's oldest complete geological collection, created by Dr. John Woodward (1665-1728). This collection includes nearly 10,000 rare and interesting specimens stored in their original cabinets from the early 18th century. Adam Sedgwick was a Professor of Geology and took care of the Woodwardian collection. Throughout his life, he greatly expanded the collections, creating a truly remarkable museum. The collection is organized by geological age, allowing visitors to see the major changes in life on Earth over time. The new Whewell Gallery displays beautiful minerals and gems, with full labels explaining their nature and modern uses.
**D. The Cambridge University Collection of Air Photographs**  
The collection has over 400,000 air photographs taken by university staff over the last 45 years. The University has its own aircraft based at Cambridge Airport and takes photographs all over Great Britain. These photographs are interesting as they provide a detailed record of the landscape, showing both the natural environment and the impact of human activity from prehistoric times to today. There is a small display in the entrance hall, and the helpful library staff can answer any questions. The photographs cannot be borrowed, but copies can usually be bought. These copies are made to order and typically take about a month.
**E. Cambridge Medieval Brass Rubbing Centre**  
The Cambridge Brass Rubbing Centre is the second oldest and longest-running center of its kind in the world, and it is one of the most unusual tourist attractions in the region. Visitors can enjoy creating wall hangings by rubbing one of over a hundred different brass plates from the tombs of medieval knights and ladies. By making resin copies, known as facsimiles, the center has preserved the originals while making brass rubbing an enjoyable activity for everyone. The brass plates, which serve as an alternative memorial to the tomb statues, spread from Germany across medieval Europe and Scandinavia. Many beautiful brasses were destroyed during various revolutions, but most of the remaining ones are in Britain, with the widest range available at the Cambridge Centre."
CAE_13,C1,"From Here to Fatherhood**
**A. The Theatre Director**  
I have had a strange personal life, but I have been lucky to spend 35 years with small children, and I have loved every moment. This morning, I enjoyed feeding the baby, which is what being a father means to me. I feel very fortunate with my children. We all enjoy the same things: opera, theatre, books, and music. This creates a strong bond, especially now that they are mostly grown up and I have become more like a friend than a father. I do not believe in physical punishment. I have slapped my children in anger before, but I do not support it. I may not have been the most attentive father, but I have always tried to be available. I am here for them if they need me, but I believe they should reach out to me. If I start asking them why they haven’t contacted me, it creates unnecessary guilt. My parents did that to me, and I would never do that to my children.
**B. The Advertising Executive**  
I was young when my children were born, around 25, and I found the responsibilities quite annoying. It made me feel older quickly, but it also kept me young, which I value. As they became teenagers, they introduced me to music, youth culture, and fashion, which helped me stay connected to my work. Because I was busy building my business when they were young, I missed some important events like their first concerts and sports days. I feel sad about that, but now I can take them on holidays to the south of France. They get along well with many of our friends and join us at parties and advertising award ceremonies without feeling out of place. I think it helps that my job is seen as interesting and glamorous.
**C. The Politician**  
My first child was born just as I was about to be elected to the Greater London Council, and the others came soon after. My wife and I promised to make time for them, but as I became more involved in politics, finding time became difficult. I only accept weekend meetings and public events where my children can join me. If I didn’t, they would feel left out. This way, they understand what I do when I am not with them, and they don’t feel like I am disappearing. I have noticed more politicians bringing their children to work. Maybe we are all realizing how important it is to include our children in our lives.
**D. The Writer**  
My first marriage ended when my daughters, Kate and Bonnie, were young, so I had to think more about fatherhood. I worked hard to stay connected with them. My ex-wife and I even tried living next to each other for a while, so they could visit easily, but I think that confused them. Kate has said in interviews that I was always there for her, but I am not sure I was a good father. I was around a lot, but like many parents in the Seventies, I treated my children like adults too soon. Kate recently said we were too lenient. I think I could have set more rules and structure. Instead, I took a very relaxed approach, and I regret that now. I still worry about my older daughters just as much as I do about my youngest. In that way, your children never really leave you.
**E. The TV Presenter**  
I was ready for kids. I was 30, had met my wife, and we had a nice house, so we thought, ""Why not have a child instead of just buying new furniture?"" Having my daughter Betty has made me think about who I am. It feels special to have a child, but it also means you become just one of many parents. It is a humbling experience. Sometimes I feel frustrated, but just one smile from her makes everything better. A baby's smile is the best way to feel happy again."

CAE_46,C1,"'Science Defying Gravity'**
Journalist Tom Mumford joins students who are using weightlessness to test their ideas. From the outside, the aircraft looked normal. The pilot told the 13 students from Europe and America that it was built in 1964 and was a Boeing KC-135 refueling tanker, based on the Boeing 707 passenger plane. However, inside, it was very different. The interior was a long white tunnel with few windows and bright lights along the padded walls. Most of the seats were removed, except for a few at the back where the nervous students sat.
For a year, these students had competed to take part in this flight, which was organized by the European Space Agency. They had to come up with creative experiments to do in weightless conditions. The best ideas won a spot on this special flight, which was like the most exciting roller coaster ride. 
For the next two hours, the Boeing would fly in a way that felt like a giant bird soaring up and then diving down. The goal was to create a moment of weightlessness at the top of each curve. When the pilot cut the engines at 3,000 meters, the plane would rise higher due to its speed before gravity pulled it back down. During the few seconds between rising and falling, everything inside the aircraft became weightless, and the students would feel as if they were closer to the moon than to Earth.
The flight took off smoothly, but any thoughts of a regular passenger flight disappeared when the pilot put the Boeing into a steep climb for about 20 seconds. The engines roared, and we felt the blood rush from our heads as we were pushed against the cabin floor. Then, the engines stopped, and we quickly experienced weightlessness. For 20 seconds, we floated in silence, as if the floor had turned into a trampoline. One small step sent us flying towards the ceiling. We floated around, and directions like left or right lost their meaning. Only gravity helps us understand where we are.
After ten seconds of falling, the pilot pulled the plane out of its dive. The return of gravity was sudden, and some students landed hard. After the first curve, some students felt sick thinking about the 29 more to come. Thirty curves gave us ten minutes of 'space time' for experiments. The Dutch students studied their robotic cat, Leonardo, to see how cats always land on their feet. They released a device they built to investigate this, and one student managed to turn it over using a remote control. 
However, during the next curve, another student accidentally landed on the device. Meanwhile, a German team from the University of Aachen studied how metal joints are affected by the lack of gravity, which could help in building future space stations. Another group from Utah State University worked on creating solar sails from thin liquid films that harden in ultraviolet sunlight. They believe that once perfected, these sails could help satellites use the sun's energy like a yacht uses wind.
After two hours of flying between heaven and Earth, breakfast felt unstable, but the main feeling was excitement, not sickness. This feeling would stay with us for a long time. ""It was an unforgettable experience,"" said one student. ""I already wanted to be an astronaut, but now I want it even more."""

**With the Trees, I Planted My Stake in New Zealand**  
**JONATHON PORRITT TALKS TO DANNY DANZIGER**  
Jonathon Porritt is the author of *Seeing Green - The Politics of Ecology*.
I had a strange time in my life when I didn’t have any summers. I went to New Zealand every summer, which was actually winter there. So, I experienced nine winters in a row, which I enjoyed because I like winter. My parents had the idea to buy a small piece of land for my brother, sister, and me to take care of. My mother said, “If you can plant trees on it, then you can have it.” The idea was that we would always have a connection to New Zealand, which is nice because my father grew up there. They found a piece of land about 20 miles north of Auckland in a place called Rangitoupuni. The land was not very good, but it was suitable for planting trees.
I have always been interested in land. I spent a year in Australia working on sheep farms and doing different farming jobs, so the idea of planting trees excited me. I started planting in 1968, and by the end of 1972, my siblings and I had planted the entire 70 acres. In New Zealand in 1968, it was a very rainy winter. It rained almost every day while we were planting, and I don’t think I have ever been so wet or cold for such a long time. Every morning was a challenge: getting ready to plant in the rain, coming out of the Land Rover warm and dry, but then getting wet again.
In that first year, I worked with an experienced tree-planter, which was helpful because I had never planted trees seriously before. You wear a planting bag around your neck, filling it with as many trees as you can. When the bag is full, it is heavy, but it gets easier as you plant. The hardest part was getting the lines straight. You decide how far apart to plant the trees, then you set up three poles in a straight line to guide you. Once you are in line, you plant all the way down and then come back.
I enjoy hard physical work, and it helped me get fit. After a while, planting trees becomes automatic. You get into a rhythm and use the least number of movements to dig the hole. This rhythm is important in many farming jobs. You learn to take the tree out of the bag, dig a hole, put it in, stamp it down, and move on. Mentally, it is interesting. My mind starts to think about many things, including nature and our place in it. These thoughts have influenced my life since then.
I have returned to New Zealand four times since planting the trees and have watched them grow, which is very satisfying. I feel a connection to what happens to them. I worry when I read news about strong winds or droughts in New Zealand. However, the trees are now 20 years old and doing well. 
I should add that I took a break from teaching and went back in 1984 for three months by myself. I wrote my first book, *Seeing Green*, there. There is a simple cabin on the tree farm with just a bed, a table, and a chair. In the mornings, I wrote; in the afternoons, I pruned the trees; and in the evenings, I did research. My connection to that area is still very strong. It is the place I feel most connected to in terms of the bond between people and the earth."
CAE_10,C1,"'CARING FOR BADGER CUBS'**
""What now?"" was my first thought when one of my helpers brought a cardboard box to me. My husband Derek and I have run an open dairy farm in Somerset for six years, and we are known for taking care of orphaned animals. But the noise from the box—a mix of a cackle and a bark—was unfamiliar. I looked inside and saw three small grey badger cubs, each about eight inches long. Their soft coats were covered in fleas, and their milky eyes looked up at me from their tiny black-and-white striped heads. I had never seen badger cubs before. Most badger cubs are born between mid-January and mid-March and spend their early lives underground. If they are orphaned, they usually die from hunger and are never found. These three cubs were brought to me by builders who accidentally disturbed their home while laying drain pipes. Their mother was found dead, with her babies still trying to suckle. I could see that the cubs were healthy but cold and whimpering. After removing the fleas, I took them into the farmhouse kitchen and placed them beside the stove for warmth. There were two females, named Primrose and Bluebell, and a male named Willow. At first, I used a syringe to feed them, but I had to wipe each cub with a warm cloth first to mimic the feeling of their mother licking them. This helped them to go to the bathroom. For the first few days, I fed them every four hours. Within a week, the cubs learned to drink from a bottle and started to move around, though a bit unsteadily. They were happy with each other and a heated pad as a substitute for their mother. 
However, three weeks later, I noticed that Willow seemed tired, even though he was still eating normally. This was a warning sign. I should have acted quickly, but I didn’t realize how serious it was. The next morning, I found him dead. The vet's examination showed that Willow had died from a lung infection. When bottle-feeding any animal, it is important not to let them drink too quickly, as liquid can go into the lungs. In Willow's case, this caused an infection that would have been hard to treat, even with antibiotics, because he was so small. Feeling sad about my loss, I continued to care for the other cubs. But then, six days later, a local farmer, who had heard about our cubs, came to see me. He had found another male cub, abandoned by its mother. He knew she would not return because the area was too disturbed, and the cub was cold and hungry. Willow II joined us. At six weeks old, he was about two weeks younger than the females, and I soon found out why his mother had left him. He was very difficult to feed. I had to keep moving the bottle's teat around and squeezing it to get him to drink. After ten minutes, he would finally latch on as if he hadn’t eaten all day. By the end of April, the females were eating creamed rice and anything else I offered. Willow II was happy to stop using the bottle but struggled to eat without making a mess. Eventually, I gave him a sausage, which he slowly chewed and finally ate. After a week of sausages, he was ready to try other foods. 
At nearly five months old, they were all eating cereals for breakfast, a meat and vegetable meal for lunch, and fruit, nuts, cheese, hard-boiled eggs, and sunflower seeds in the evening. Badgers usually eat 60 percent earthworms, plus beetles, baby rabbits, mice, and even plant roots. My badgers were better off than other cubs that year because the summer was very hot, making it hard to find earthworms. By August, my cubs had started to be active at night and would go for walks at dusk or late at night. We often walked through the cider orchard, where the tall grass made it easy for them to chase each other. The cubs would get excited, fluff up their fur, and chase their tails. As ""human badgers,"" we joined in their fun. I learned to avoid their playful nips, but Derek, who joined us less often, sometimes got caught and had colorful reactions. 
During two of these late-night walks, I saw other badgers in our field. They were likely looking for food because they had to expand their territory. Badgers are very territorial and can be aggressive towards others that enter their area. We were warned that they might come into our badger pen and harm the cubs, so we put sheet metal over the gate to keep it secure. The local press took pictures of me walking the badgers, and we started a campaign to build a sett for them on the farm. With help from others, we designed a new home for the badgers. My son Daniel drew the plans, and we built a sett with tunnels, an enclosure, and a badger gate that faced their usual walking path. It had three chambers, one larger than the others, with a glass side so people could see inside. As the sett was built, the badgers explored it before their walks. Eventually, they became more interested in the tunnels and bedding than in walking. The building costs were higher than we expected, but a local bus company called Badgerline helped fund part of it, and local businesses donated materials. Everyone wanted to see the badgers have a home. 
One evening, they finally moved in. After watching them for a while, we left them to settle. Half an hour later, I quietly returned to check on them and saw three badgers curled up in their chambers, sound asleep. Now, my walks with them are less frequent, especially since they don’t wake up until midnight. We see Primrose only occasionally because she has joined a nearby sett, but Bluebell and Willow II still come to greet me before running off into the night. This is their territory now, a place they know well and a home they have happily accepted."
CAE_67,C1,"In Search of True North - The Man Behind Halley's Comet**
Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, wants to follow in the footsteps of Sir Edmund Halley, who studied compass variations. Anjana Ahuja reports.
Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is famous for the comet named after him. However, one of his important achievements was to chart the 'variations of the compass' during his sea voyages on the warship Paramore. These variations, now called 'declination', refer to the angle between magnetic north and true geographical north. Understanding declination was crucial for sailors to correct their compasses and navigate the oceans accurately.
Halley, one of only two men in England at that time paid to do scientific research, set out for the Cape Verde Islands to study declination in the North and South Atlantic. His first trip was cut short due to crew problems, but he later sailed again. This second voyage took him to Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, Newfoundland, and back to England. From these travels, Halley published a chart in 1701 showing the variations of the compass in the Western and Southern Oceans. More advanced charts based on his work helped sailors for over a century until changes in the Earth's magnetic field made them less accurate.
Dr. Clark, who enjoys sailing, plans to celebrate the 300th anniversary of Halley's trip by retracing the Paramore's route. He needs to raise £70,000 before starting, and Sir Vivian Fuchs, who led the first expedition across Antarctica, is supporting him.
Dr. Clark became interested in Halley while working at Halley Station in Antarctica, where he read about Halley's life. ""Halley led a remarkable life,"" Dr. Clark says. ""He was a respected scientist and led expeditions. He was not just an astronomer; he also studied geophysics. While he was Astronomer Royal, he mapped the stars and worked on other projects.""
During this time, Halley invented a diving bell and advised Sir Isaac Newton on his famous work, Principia Mathematica, which is the foundation of classical physics. Dr. Clark believes that recreating Halley's voyage will give him the recognition he deserves. His expedition, called 'In the Wake of the Paramore', will also have scientific value. It will involve taking measurements that Halley made, but with much better instruments. These measurements are important because the Earth's magnetic field is always changing.
Dr. Clark explains, ""It is common to measure the size of the magnetic field but not its direction. You need to know true north to measure the direction. On our expedition, we can use global positioning satellites to find that."" The British Geological Survey and the United States Navy will provide instruments for the trip. A Danish satellite will also be taking similar measurements, and Dr. Clark hopes his data will fill in any gaps in the satellite's coverage of the Atlantic Ocean.
Halley's journey was significant because it was the first scientific expedition at sea, and he was the first civilian appointed as a naval captain to study declination. Does Dr. Clark have the right experience for this voyage? He has spent two years in Antarctica and worked in the geomagnetic group at the British Geological Survey. He has also sailed the 13,000 kilometers from Rio de Janeiro to England. He plans to complete the expedition in four stages with different crews.
Does he share Halley's passion? ""I am ready to give up my life for eight months to do this, so some might say I'm obsessed. But I wouldn't want to sail across the Atlantic again without a good reason. Halley and his fascinating life have given me a real sense of purpose."""

**POWER DRESSING**
Every summer, the peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show off their beautiful tail feathers to the hens. This behavior raises a question that Charles Darwin thought about until he died: how could birds develop such extravagant features in a world where survival is tough? How do they manage to do this?
Zoologist Marion Petrie and her team from the Open University are studying the peacocks at Whipsnade to find answers, more than a century after Darwin's death. Darwin believed that living things change over time through evolution, not by special creation. He thought that natural selection was the main way this happened. In a competitive world, the individuals best suited to their environment, or the ""fittest,"" are more likely to survive and reproduce. Usually, ""fittest"" means the strongest, fastest, or smartest. However, the peacock's tail seems to be a disadvantage, so Darwin suggested another idea called ""sexual selection."" He believed that females chose males based on their beauty.
Darwin's friend, Alfred Russel Wallace, had a different view. He thought that if peahens preferred males with the most impressive tails, there must be another reason for this choice that was not obvious to humans. According to Wallace, the tail was not just for show; it indicated some real quality that helped the males survive.
Now, 100 years later, researchers still have not fully resolved this question. Studying the natural behavior of peafowl is challenging. However, the 200 peacocks at Whipsnade, which live like wild birds but are used to people, provide a great opportunity for research. Marion Petrie and her team have two main questions: Do peahens really choose the males with the most impressive tails? And do these males have some other advantage, or is it just for show?
The adult male peacocks display in groups at different places in Whipsnade, and the hens compare them. Long observations and photographs suggest that the hens do prefer the males with the most eye-spots on their tails, which are related to the tail's length. Males with more eye-spots attract more mates. However, it is still unclear if these males are better in other ways.
William Hamilton from Oxford University has a theory that showy male birds are generally free from parasites, and their beautiful feathers show that they are healthy. There is some evidence for this in other bird species. However, Dr. Petrie and her team have not yet been able to check for parasites in the Whipsnade peacocks.
This year, Dr. Petrie is comparing the offspring of attractive males with those of less attractive males. Are the children of the attractive males growing faster? Are they healthier? If they are, it would support Wallace's idea that the females' choice is practical.
There is one more interesting idea in this story. The mathematician and biologist R A Fisher proposed a theory called ""Fisher's Runaway."" He suggested that if a female chooses a male with a slightly better tail, their sons will inherit the father's tail, and their daughters will inherit the mother's preference for long tails. This could lead to a situation where males with the longest tails have the most mates and produce the most offspring. Over time, this could create the peacock's tail. Interestingly, this would also support Darwin's idea that females might eventually choose beauty for its own sake."
CAE_66,C1,"**THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS**
Tom Cunliffe believes that the best boat design should mix old and new ideas. He has done this with his own boat, 'The Westerman'. This week, the Summer Boat Show in London is full of beautiful yachts with the latest technology. Most of these boats come from a big change in boat design that happened 25 years ago. In contrast, my boat is quietly resting in a tidal creek on the south coast. Although it was designed last year, it looks like it is 100 years old, which might make you think its owner is a romantic. Maybe I am, but I’m not sure.
My boat uses the best parts of traditional boat design, but modern technology has made it easier to build. However, it is important to note that advanced technology can sometimes keep sailors away from the real challenges of life at sea. These challenges are often what they wanted to experience by going sailing in the first place. I am not saying that sailors should go back to suffering through every difficulty. I believe it is important for my boats to have a coal stove for warmth and comfortable places to sleep. But why go sailing if every sail works automatically? Dealing with sails that flap in the wind is part of being a sailor.
Why should we change our steering positions from a safe place at the back of the boat to a less safe spot near the front? The sad truth is that this makes the cabin feel like a big ship, with a bed larger than the one at home. For me, a boat should be a boat, not a house on the water. When I bought my earlier boat, Hirta, to sail around Britain for a TV race, the previous owner said it had all the comforts but no luxury. During my time with Hirta, I learned how true this was. She had heavy sails, no running water, little electricity, no fridge, no central heating, no winches, and no electronics, especially for navigation. Yet, she was the easiest boat I have ever sailed.
However, classic boats like Hirta need a lot of care. When I hurt my back, I realized I could no longer keep her. I looked for a younger boat but found nothing good, so I decided to build a new one from scratch. The Westerman has never let me down. Although the designer, Nigel Irens, and his assistant, Ed Burnett, are skilled with computer design, Irens first sketched this boat on a paper napkin before using a computer. After creating a model, just like boat builders did in the past, we worked together to improve the design. The final version was perfect.
The completed boat has crossed the North Atlantic and won four out of her first six races. She looks timeless, moves beautifully in the sea, and her interior, made from reclaimed pitch pine, feels peaceful. This might be because she was designed purely as a sailing boat, without thinking about furniture. This is a traditional method of boat design. In her calmness, she shows that it is effective; there is no need to follow trends to be happy, and sometimes it is wise to learn from history. Built with special treated wood, she is completely waterproof. So, she has all the advantages of a fiberglass boat but looks, feels, and sails like a real boat."

Health farms and country house hotels with spa facilities are becoming very popular. We asked five journalists to visit some of these places.
**A. HENLOW GRANGE**  
I was happy to go to Henlow Grange for six days because I was tired and needed to relax. My room in the large 18th-century house was very comfortable, and I felt calm right away. On the first day, I did nothing and slept a lot. From the second day, I started attending body conditioning classes and other activities like yoga and stretching. The instructors are very well trained. I was surprised at how flexible I felt as the week went on. They offer many treatments, including aromatherapy, seaweed baths, manicures, and pedicures. The facial treatment, which lasts an hour, really makes you feel refreshed. The staff in the treatment rooms were friendly and professional. The atmosphere is full of energy and enthusiasm. Henlow is planning to renovate this year, adding a half-size Olympic swimming pool and a Light Diet Room. Bicycles are available to ride around the grounds. If you want to relax, you can read a magazine or take a peaceful walk in the garden. During my stay, I felt happier and had a better appetite. I left feeling wonderful and full of energy, which lasted a long time. I will definitely visit again. This is a perfect getaway for busy women. Save Room 5 for me!

**B. SHRUBLAND HALL**  
The calm and relaxing atmosphere of this stately home was clear as soon as I walked up the large staircase into the reception area. The Hall has a beautifully decorated library, a lovely conservatory, and plenty of space, so you can be alone if you want. When you arrive, everyone gets a medical check, which includes an examination and a check of weight and blood pressure. We were all called patients, which felt strange since I am healthy. However, I was impressed that a shoulder problem found during the check was quickly shared with the fitness instructor, and we worked on it in group workshops and individual sessions. Each patient follows a specific diet. I lost weight without starving, but I was still hungry enough to get a bad headache on the second day. My daily menu included grapefruit and honey for breakfast, salads for lunch, and a mix of exotic fruit, yogurt, and hot broth for dinner. If you are not on a light diet, you can eat in the main dining hall, where the food is tasty and well-presented. You can have a massage or water therapy every other day. All extra treatments are reasonably priced.  
*Liz Gregory*
**C. CAREYS MANOR**  
Careys is not a health farm and does not pretend to be one. It is a lovely old manor with cozy log fires and a spacious lounge. If you are counting calories, you might want to skip the gourmet food. The French chef makes rich sauces and delicious creamy desserts. Luckily, the hotel has a gym and a soft-water pool, so I could exercise after enjoying the food. (You can choose a 'health-conscious' diet if you want to lose weight.) There is a spa bath, steam room, sauna, and treatment rooms. A big attraction is the sports injury clinic. I got advice on an old shoulder injury. The physiotherapist suggested good posture, exercises, and massage. Careys is comfortable and luxurious, relaxed and calm. If you want to explore, there is beautiful countryside around.  
*Beverly D'Silva*
**D. CLIVEDEN**  
Cliveden is a grand country home and a five-star hotel that treats its guests like royalty. It offers health and beauty treatments, a gym, saunas, a swimming pool, tennis, horse riding, and more. There are beautiful woodland walks and gardens on the 376-acre National Trust estate. Waldo's, a famous restaurant, has amazing dishes. It took me half an hour to read the dinner menu because there were so many choices. The meal was fantastic, especially the sticky-toffee pudding with banana ice cream. I went to bed very happy! The next morning, I spent a few hours in the gym to burn off some calories before my next meal. In the Pavilion, I enjoyed a facial with gentle heat and essential oils, followed by an aromatherapy massage. I thought about all the other reports my fellow journalists would write about fitness assessments and beauty treatments. Cliveden has all these options if you want to use them before enjoying a meal at Waldo's.  
*Kay Letch*
**E. SPRINGS HYDRO**  
The best and worst thing about Springs Hydro is the carrot cake. It is the best because it is the most delicious I have ever tasted. It is the worst because it has 360 calories, which can be a problem if you want to lose weight. You have been warned! The second best thing is the wonderful aromatherapy massage. I chose a relaxing oil blend and fell asleep twice during the massage. I returned to my room and had the best night's sleep in years. The facilities are modern and well-organized, with luxurious bedrooms. There are many therapists and beauty rooms, so it is easy to book appointments. They offer a variety of treatments, from manicures and pedicures to deep-cleansing facials and body treatments. The guests are a mix of people, including football teams, mothers and daughters, best friends, and singles. Ideally, I would take a break here about once a month.

CAE_22,C1,"**NATURAL TALENTS**
In the seven million years since humans separated from chimpanzees, we have not developed many differences. Genetically, we are still more than 98% similar to chimps. This means that the differences between humans and animals are very recent. Our biological history suggests that our ability to create art and other unique human traits come from just a small part of our genes. This is a big responsibility for a few genes.
Recent studies of animal behavior show that many traits once thought to be unique to humans are now seen as differences in degree. For example, both humans and wild chimpanzees use tools. Chimpanzees use sticks to eat and as weapons, while sea otters use rocks to open clams. Monkeys also have a simple form of language, with different sounds for 'leopard', 'eagle', and 'snake'. These findings suggest that there are not many absolute differences between humans and animals, except for art.
If human art comes from a unique genetic trait, it is strange that our ancestors did not create art for almost 6.9 million years after separating from chimps. The earliest forms of art may have been wood carvings or body painting, but these materials do not last over time. The first clear evidence of human art appears around 35,000 years ago with cave paintings, statues, necklaces, and musical instruments.
If we believe that our recent artistic explosion makes us different, we need to consider how our art is different from that of animals. Three main differences are often mentioned: human art is not useful, it is created for beauty, and it is learned rather than instinctive.
First, as Oscar Wilde said, ""All art is quite useless."" This means that human art does not help us survive or pass on our genes, unlike many animal behaviors. While some human art communicates ideas to others, this is not the same as passing on genes. In contrast, birdsong serves clear purposes, like defending territory or attracting a mate, which helps them pass on their genes. By this standard, human art does seem different.
The second claim is that human art is motivated by a desire for beauty. We cannot ask birds if they enjoy their songs, but they mainly sing during the breeding season, suggesting they do not sing just for beauty. Again, this makes human art seem unique.
The third claim is that human art is learned, not instinctive. Each human group has its own art styles that are learned. For example, songs in Tokyo are different from those in Paris. However, these differences are not in the singers' genes. People from different cultures can learn each other's songs. In contrast, some birds are born knowing how to sing their species' songs, even if they have never heard them before.
The role of learning in human art is also clear because our art styles change quickly. For example, geese have made the same sounds for 2,000 years, but human art evolves rapidly. Even casual museum visitors can tell that a painting from the twentieth century is newer than the Mona Lisa. Art experts can often identify when a painting was made and who created it.
Interestingly, two chimpanzees named Congo and Betsy created paintings that some people might mistake for human art. Congo made up to 33 paintings in one day, seemingly for his own enjoyment. In 1957, they had an exhibition of their work in London, and many of their paintings sold, which is something many human artists cannot achieve.
These chimpanzee paintings challenge the idea that human art is completely different from animal behavior. Like human art, the paintings made by apes were not created for practical purposes; they were made for the satisfaction of the painter. Some might argue that human art is different because it is often meant to communicate with others, while the apes did not care about sharing their work. However, even some famous human art was created for personal satisfaction rather than communication."
CAE_39,C1,"An Amazing Adventure**
The Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last unexplored places on Earth. It is also one of the most dangerous. Charles Blackmore crossed it and lived to tell the story. There are very few big adventures left and very few heroes. Children's stories used to be about brave explorers with sunburnt skin and eyes focused on distant horizons during their journeys into the unknown. Nowadays, you rarely find such characters in stories or in real life. Or so I thought until I met Charles Blackmore.
Blackmore's great adventure was leading a team across the Taklamakan Desert. Its name means ""once entered, you never come out,"" but local people call it the Desert of Death. He remembered the dangers and excitement of that incredible journey while at home with his family. The team included four Britons (one was the medical officer), an American photographer, four Chinese experts, 30 camels, and six camel handlers. It later turned out that the camel handlers had never worked with camels before; they were long-distance truck drivers. This misunderstanding could have endangered everyone’s lives and the success of the expedition.
This diverse group set out to cross 1,200 kilometers of one of the world's harshest deserts, and Charles Blackmore wrote a fascinating account of their journey. At that time, he was about to leave the Army after 14 happy years. He started the expedition for fun, to fill a gap in his life, and to discover who he really was outside the Army. ""I had always thought I would spend my whole life in the Army. I had been offered a promotion, but suddenly I wanted to see who I was outside of that. It was a big risk. My wife, Tina, was very worried that I wouldn’t come back since nobody had ever done that route before; we went into it without knowing what to expect. In the end, it took 59 days to cross from west to east, and the desert was surprisingly good to us.""
Anyone reading his amazing story will wonder why he used the word ""good."" The team faced terrible challenges: sickness, extreme temperatures, severe thirst, and losing part of their water supply. ""But,"" Blackmore explains, ""when we were at our limits and the camels had gone without water for seven days, we managed to find some. We didn’t experience the desert's famous sandstorms, and we never faced the freezing cold that could have stopped us completely. That doesn’t mean we didn’t struggle the whole time. The fine sand got into everything, especially our blisters and wounds. The high dunes were hard to climb for us and for the heavily loaded camels, which often fell over onto us.""
""What pushed me on more than anything was the need to survive. We had no backup plan. Our budget and time didn’t allow for one. No aircraft ever flew over us. Once we entered the sandhills, we were completely on our own. I knew I had the mental strength for the trip, but I was very scared about my physical ability to do it. I remember the first day — we sat at the edge of the desert, and it was so hot that it was hard to breathe. I thought, 'We have to do it now!' At that moment, I was very scared.""
If it was tough at the beginning, how did they feel at the end? ""After walking for 1,000 kilometers, you’re not going to give up. You’ve endured so much; you have come so far. We were very thin but also very strong despite our exhaustion. My body was fit, and my legs felt powerful. I could walk over anything.""
Midway through the book, Blackmore describes lying in the desert, looking up at a full moon and thinking of his family. How aware was he of how hard it must have been for them? ""Inside me, there’s someone trying to find peace. When I have doubts about myself now, I think back to the image of the desert and remember that we managed to complete that journey. I feel prouder of that expedition than of anything else I’ve done. Yet, when I think of my life’s achievements, I think of my family and the happiness we share — by that measure, the desert does not compare.""
Has Charles Blackmore found peace? ""I long for the challenge — for the open spaces — the excitement of it all. We were lifted by our sense of purpose. I find it hard now to fit into the sameness of modern life."""

Life was getting out of control for Susan Harr, so she decided to unplug her gadgets and enjoy doing things by hand. Many people love technology because it gives us amazing devices that make life easier and give us more free time. However, this belief has made us think that technology is the best way to live. Using our fingers does not use up energy like machines do, and doing things by hand does not harm the environment. 
Recently, Susan had a bad experience with her broken word processor, which cost her a lot of money to fix. This made her question whether gadgets are really worth the cost and trouble. She started to let her household gadgets break down naturally. This made her think about what ""free time"" really means. Does it just mean we have more time to buy more gadgets? If that’s true, then the marketing experts are tricking us.
When her broken gadget started making strange noises, even when it was unplugged, she left it outside, where it now sits quietly. She enjoys not being tied to noisy machines and can take her time with her sewing. She was always a bit scared of electric machines that move quickly near her fingers. 
There are some gadgets she still values, like her washing machine, which she missed after a year without it. But losing some gadgets has made her happier. She felt that her family was spending too much time in front of the TV, so she returned their rented color TV and got a small black-and-white one instead. This change helped them spend more time walking their dog, reading, talking, and enjoying other hobbies. 
One of her hobbies is sewing, but her old sewing machine is now just a table for plants. Since she cannot afford a new one, she has started sewing by hand. People often think they cannot live without their gadgets, but Susan believes that life can be better without them. She feels sorry for those who had to do hard work without machines. 
Computers make our lives easier by doing fast calculations and providing entertainment. However, the time she spends sewing is enjoyable, and she can listen to the radio or talk with family while she works. If the task is simple, she can even watch TV without feeling guilty because she is also being productive. 
Sewing by the fire with a cup of tea feels cozy. She used to think that women who sewed by hand had a hard life, but now she finds it relaxing and satisfying. Watching her work become neater makes her happy. She realizes that things can be done quickly, and she can slow down her life to match her own pace. 
She also enjoys washing dishes by hand, which allows her to daydream. Now, she looks around her house and wonders if they really need things like a freezer, microwave, or electric lawnmower. She thinks they could save a lot of money by living without electric lights!"

Charles Hurst is a cabinet-maker who makes a living by creating beautifully crafted furniture. Joanna Watt meets him in his workshop, which is located under a railway arch in East London. When I arrive, he greets me with a quick handshake and says, ""Well, fire away then!"" It is not clear if he is really in a hurry or just acting tough. Looking around the workshop, I can see that Hurst is busy. The space is filled with unfinished furniture and pieces of wood in many natural colors.
Hurst has been a cabinet-maker for ten years and has a great reputation. His order book is always full for several months ahead, even though he does not advertise himself. People know that if they want a good cupboard, table, bookcase, or kitchen units, Hurst is the right person to contact. 
Finding a furniture-maker is not hard, but finding one who makes high-quality furniture with clean, simple designs is more difficult. Hurst says, ""There are few real cabinet-makers now. Many people call themselves furniture-makers."" He is often disappointed by the quality of modern furniture. ""I am amazed by what some furniture-makers get away with, and saddened by what people will accept,"" he says. Hurst is critical of poorly made, mass-produced furniture and craftsmen who create low-quality pieces. His desire for perfection is a big part of his success, along with his talent.
Hurst is confident about his skills. He says, ""I have a huge natural ability. I have always been good at making things."" He is self-taught and learned his craft by asking questions and observing. Most of his work comes from private clients, and some return to him for more projects. ""You end up doing the whole of their house. That is very satisfying,"" he explains. However, he admits that not all client relationships are easy. ""The most frustrating clients are those who don’t know what they want and change their minds too late. My favorite clients are the exacting ones.""
Although Hurst is proud of his work, he also respects others who are skilled. He says, ""There are people far better than me. I can admire other people."" He criticizes craftsmen who try to be artists and take too long to make one piece. He also does not like degree shows where students show their work while trying to make fashion statements. ""That can be pretentious. A piece of furniture should be something people can really use,"" he says.
Hurst may be confident and direct, but he is not pretentious. As I leave, he reminds me, ""After all, I am only making furniture."""
CAE_49,C1,"**Three Theories About Sleep**
People spend about one-third of their lives sleeping. This shows that sleep is very important. However, scientists do not fully agree on why we need to sleep. There are three main theories.
The first and most popular theory says that sleep is important for our bodies. It suggests that we sleep to keep our bodies healthy. While we sleep, our bodies work to repair any damage from the day and to help us feel better.
The second theory focuses on learning. It says that sleep helps us process the information we learn during the day. Without sleep, we would not be able to learn effectively.
The third theory is about energy. It claims that we need to sleep to recharge our energy, so we are ready for the next day."
CAE_31,C1,"**ECCENTRICS**
An eccentric is someone whose behavior is unusual and does not follow the accepted norms of society. This raises the question, ""What is normal?"" Most of us have our own quirks and odd habits. It could be a love for entering newspaper competitions, collecting beer mats, or writing letters to the press about various topics. Eccentricity shows our individuality. Inside us, there is often a struggle between two forces: individualism and conformity. Individualism wants us to be unique, while conformity wants us to fit in. For many, the desire to be accepted and liked is stronger than the desire to stand out.
People with unusual hobbies or strong opinions often come together. They form clubs and hold meetings to share their interests, which others might see as strange. The key word here is 'common.' They seek others who understand their oddities. Most of us feel a tension between wanting to fit in and wanting to be different. Even when we follow the crowd, we may feel the need to show our individuality. For example, a man at a bar might say, ""I say what I think,"" or a new acquaintance might declare, ""You must take me as you find me.""
Anyone can choose to embrace their individuality at any time. Many people succeed in their careers by doing just that. Bob Dylan, the American singer, once said, ""When you feel strongly about what you are doing, pursue it without giving up, and you will surprise many people."" However, this strong expression of individuality is not the same as eccentricity, especially in the beginning. If a pop singer wears strange clothes just to get attention, or a socialite makes shocking comments to be noticed, that is not eccentricity. But if they continue these behaviors until they become part of who they are, then they can be considered eccentric.
The most important aspect of eccentricity is that it is natural. Eccentrics do not try to be odd; they simply are. A true eccentric does not care much about what others think. They act according to who they are. This makes eccentrics different from enthusiasts, practical jokers, clever criminals, attention-seekers, and recluses. These people are aware of society and often react to it. Some want to impress others, while some want to escape from society. But eccentrics go about their lives without worrying about what others think."
CAE_58,C1,"**Natural Books**
We asked four well-known naturalists to share the wildlife book that has influenced them the most.
**A. Geoffrey Lean**  
Choosing the author was easy for me. As an environmental journalist, I have had the chance to meet some important figures in this field. One of the most significant is Barbara Ward, a small and delicate woman. She has been at the center of environmental issues in Europe after the war. She combined her experiences from different environmental movements into her own strong ideas. When I was a young journalist, she helped me understand these complex topics. Choosing her book was harder. It could have been *Only One Earth* or *Progress for a Small Planet*, but I believe *The Home of Man* is her most important work. It talks about the rapid growth of cities and covers the big themes she cared about. It is a powerful call for what we now call ""sustainable human development."" I have read many books since, but none compare to it.
**B. Linda Bennett**  
When I read *Signals for Survival* by Niko Tinbergen, I can hear the calls of herring gulls and remember the smell of their droppings in the sun. This book wonderfully explains the interesting world of animal communication through words and pictures. After reading it, if you watch a gull colony, you will see how their chaotic activity is actually a well-organized social structure. You can identify which birds are partners and recognize families later in the season. Niko Tinbergen was a respected behaviorist who wanted to share his findings with everyone. His work with talented wildlife artist Eric Ennion made this book special and interesting for anyone who loves wildlife. Ennion's simple yet effective paintings show how one gull can be aggressive while another is calm. This is the skill of a true naturalist.
**C. Lee Durrell**  
The book that has influenced me the most is *My Family and Other Animals* by Gerald Durrell. This book not only led me to a wonderful husband but also to an exciting career in conservation. It defined my love for the natural world. I was studying animal sounds in Madagascar when I first read it. After two years of challenges, opening this book made my day brighter. It beautifully connects animals, people, joy, and nature—a small world worth saving. Many people think humans are the worst because of the harm we have caused to other species. However, I remember Gerald as a boy in this book, seeing all living beings as a family, connected and inseparable. This is an important idea for everyone to understand.
**D. Bruce Pearson**  
I found *The Shell Bird Book* by James Fisher in my school library shortly after it was published in 1966. I was immediately attracted to it, especially the 48 colorful bird illustrations by Eric Ennion. These images caught my attention. I already had other bird books and had spent holidays learning to identify birds. They inspired me to start sketching what I saw. But *The Shell Bird Book* offered so much more. Along with the beautiful illustrations, it included chapters on bird migration, the history of birds in Britain, and even a chapter on birds in music, literature, and art. This wide range of information and exciting images encouraged me to appreciate birds and nature in a broader way. The book showed me that my emotional and creative connection to nature is just as important as a scientific one. Since art was my stronger subject, I began to see new opportunities for myself."
CAE_37,C1,"DO REVIEWS SELL BOOKS?**
We asked five British publishers about how book reviews affect sales. Here is what they said.
**Publisher A**  
Reviews are very important for publishers. They are the first thing we look at in newspapers. A study showed that many people said they bought a book because of reviews, more than any other reason like ads or recommendations from friends. Authors feel differently about reviews. Both authors and publishers are upset when there are no reviews, but publishers often feel okay about bad reviews. They believe that any mention of a book can help sales, as readers want to see for themselves. Publishers enjoy reviews that match their own opinions about a book since they are often the first to read it.
**Publisher B**  
Publishers and newspapers both care about book reviews, but they have different needs. Newspapers want to entertain their readers, while publishers want their books to be reviewed positively. Book reviews today are better and more varied than they were 40 years ago. However, there is still a problem with not enough attention given to paperbacks, which most people read. Even though publishers may complain, they still need reviews to help promote books and authors. A good review from a trusted source can really boost sales, especially if there are several positive reviews.
**Publisher C**  
Reviews are essential for literary publishing. Without them, we would struggle to promote our books. Most of our books are not by famous authors, so we rely on literary editors to give us space in their publications. Good reviews are much more valuable than ads because they show that the review is not influenced by money. Publishers often say they care more about the size of the review than its content. Good reviews can help launch a book and a writer's career, but they need support from other factors like recommendations and marketing.
**Publisher D**  
I wish I understood the relationship between publishing and reviewing in Britain! In the U.S., a single review in the New York Times can make or break a book. Here, bookshops often ignore reviews. Sometimes it takes many years of good reviews for people to notice a talented writer. Interestingly, some poorly reviewed books still sell very well. It’s unpredictable, but non-fiction reviews often focus more on the subject than the book itself.
**Publisher E**  
All publishers and writers hope for great reviews. But do they really sell books? I once published a biography that received excellent reviews, but it didn’t sell well because people felt they could just read the reviews instead of buying the book. Does the name of the reviewer matter? Thirty years ago, if certain reviewers liked a book, people paid attention. Now, it can also be the unexpected reviewer or the creativity of the review that encourages people to buy the book."
CAE_2,C1,"**WEATHERVANE MAKER**
The making of weathervanes is an old skill that dates back to ancient Egypt. Today, this craft is still alive in the workshop of Graham Smith. He is one of the few people in the country who makes hand-cut weathervanes. Graham's designs are unique and made to meet the specific needs of his customers. ""This way, I can create a special personalized item,"" he explains. ""Many of my customers are women buying gifts for their husbands. They want a unique present that reflects the man's work or hobbies.""
This is very different from the traditional cockerel, which is the most common design for weathervanes. The first weathervane Graham ever made was not a cockerel, but a witch on a broomstick. His friends liked the surprise gift he made for his wife and started asking him to make weathervanes for them. ""I realized that there are endless possibilities for designs,"" he says. Graham decided to focus on his weathervane business. He had trained as a precision engineer and worked in that field for 15 years when he and his wife, Liz, decided to change roles. She went to work as an architectural assistant, and he stayed home to take care of the children and grow the business. That was five years ago, and he has no regrets about this change. ""My previous job was not creative, but this work is exciting and artistic,"" he says. ""I really enjoy the design part.""
Graham has now created over 100 original designs. He pays close attention to detail and always gets the customer's approval for the design before he starts cutting it by hand. He also keeps many traditional designs in stock because they are just as popular as the unique ones. ""People seem to like handmade items,"" Graham says. ""They appreciate the chance to own something a little different.""
Graham does not plan to expand his business because he wants to keep it as a rural craft. ""I have found my place in the market. People love the uniqueness, and I feel satisfied when I see a simple shape turn into something almost lifelike,"" he says. ""For centuries, weathervanes have helped communities understand the weather by showing changes in wind direction."" He adds, ""Now, with more people moving to the countryside, they want to add a special touch to their homes. This has helped crafts like mine.""
Graham has become busier, supplying flat-packed weathervanes to customers around the world. Buyers from America and Denmark are particularly interested. ""The price,"" he explains, ""depends on how detailed the design is."" His most recent request was for a curly-coated dog. No matter the occasion, Graham can create a special gift."
CAE_68,C1,"'Beginner Takes All'**
Before it was published, *The Horse Whisperer* was already a very popular book. It is the first novel by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans, and it has made him a lot of money. Here, he talks about his inspiration and success.
At the beginning of the year, Nicholas Evans was having a tough time. A film project he had been working on, called *Life and Limb*, fell apart suddenly. He was worried because it had been two years since he had earned any money, and this film was his only hope to pay his bills. A sensible person in his situation would have found a job, perhaps returning to television. Instead, he made a surprising choice. He bought a ticket to America and spent three months researching for his first novel.
Although he acted on impulse, the idea for the story had been in his mind for a while. He had met a farrier on Dartmoor who told him about a gentle horse that suddenly became aggressive. The horse's owners were desperate until they heard about a gypsy who could calm the horse just by talking to it. These people were called ""horse whisperers."" This story inspired Evans. He started to research the topic, thinking about writing a screenplay since he was a filmmaker. However, after the failure of *Life and Limb*, he decided to write the story as a book.
During the spring, he traveled across the US, visiting ranches and learning about horses and the people who work with them. He later said, ""It was a strange time. I was watching people, but I felt very alone and worried about my life. I had tried for ten years to succeed as a filmmaker, and now I was in debt and unsure how to support my family.""
By the end of August, he had returned home and written the first half of the book. He was still worried about money, so he showed his work to a friend who was a literary agent. The agent said it was ""fine"" and thought Evans could get $30,000 as an advance for the book. Evans needed more than that to pay off some of his debts. He had spent seven months on *The Horse Whisperer* and still had at least two months of work left. 
In October, he sent the first two hundred pages of the novel, along with a 12-page summary of the rest, to seven UK publishers just before they went to the Frankfurt Book Fair. Soon, his agent called to say he had turned down the first offer of $75,000. Evans was shocked and asked, ""What?"" The agent replied, ""It's okay, I feel something good is happening.""
What happened next is now part of publishing history. Within a week of competitive bidding, the novel was sold to Transworld Publications in the UK for £550,000 and to Delacorte in the US for $3.15 million, both record amounts for a first novel. Evans said, ""We couldn't believe it; we were amazed. We never sent the manuscript to New York, and we still don’t know how it got there."" 
The major film studios also wanted the book. Evans's UK agent worked with an American agent, who called to say they could get $3 million for the film rights. They all laughed in disbelief. That October, Evans sat in his study while four famous filmmakers called one after another, asking to pay $3 million for an unfinished novel.
Evans shared this story while we drank coffee on his porch overlooking his garden. He mentioned that he had turned down an offer to write the screenplay for *The Horse Whisperer*. ""It's been like a fairy tale so far. I don’t want to ruin it. Writing at that level is very hard, and I don’t want to become just an employee of these people who have paid me so much money. I would hate to write a draft and then have them say, 'Thanks, Nick, but we’ll hire someone else now.'""
He said he would stay involved but from a distance. The success of his novel led to new support for *Life and Limb*, but he was unsure if he wanted to make it anymore. ""I think it would be foolish not to write another novel,"" he said."
CAE_23,C1,"'Young Masters'**
Bobby Fischer is facing challenges as he tries to return to chess. Chess is now more of a young man's game. After being away for 20 years, Fischer is back and playing against his old rival, Boris Spassky. Fischer won the first game, which was impressive, but he is not the same player he was in 1972. At 49 years old, he is out of practice and not in great shape. Spassky is even older. 
Chess has changed a lot in the last 20 years. Fischer helped make chess popular, leading to a new era of professionalism. Now, winning is the main goal for modern players. In international chess, a player’s nerves and stamina are just as important as their intelligence. The pressure in chess has always been high. Players use a chess clock to make sure they finish their moves in time, or they lose the game. Nowadays, games can last longer, and many are played without breaks. This increased pressure favors younger players. Over the last 30 years, each new world champion has been younger than the last. Currently, eight of the ten highest-ranked players are under 30.
The way chess is played has also changed. Much of it now happens off the board. Players must prepare seriously before matches, especially because computers have changed the game. A small computer can store one million chess games and provide quick access to many games of an opponent. In recent matches, players have used large teams to find weaknesses in each other's strategies. The opening moves of a game are analyzed in great detail, and being well-prepared can be the key to winning.
Today, there are more top players than ever before. Many grandmasters compete for modest prizes around the world. Success in chess requires both physical and mental effort. A single game can last up to eight hours, and players must stay focused. A moment of distraction can lead to losing. The chess clock adds to the stress, especially during the final moments of a game when players have only seconds to make their moves. In these intense moments, players must act quickly and decisively.
At the highest level of chess, losing is very painful. Winning brings great satisfaction and a chance to recover from the stress. However, one win is not enough to win a tournament. Chess tournaments usually last 9-11 days, with games played every day. World championship matches can be even tougher. For example, the 1984 match between Anatoli Karpov and Gary Kasparov in Moscow had to be stopped after several months because both players were exhausted. Karpov lost about 10 kg during the match.
Can Bobby Fischer overcome these challenges? He once said, ""All I want to do, ever, is play chess."" This makes his long absence from the game seem strange. But it also made him a legend. If he has returned for the money, he is in a good position, as both he and Spassky will earn millions from their match. However, if Fischer believes he can prove he is still the best player, the outcome could be very disappointing for him."
CAE_60,C1,"Fame and Fortune**
Imogen Edwards-Jones interviews some new British talents, from poets to pop stars, who are on their way to success.
A. Nick Grosso is in his early 30s and has written three well-received plays. He is now turning his first play, *Peaches*, into a movie script. ""It's low budget, but we don't know how low,"" he says. ""It won't be over £30 million, but it could be as low as £30."" The interesting thing about Nick is that before writing *Peaches*, he had never been to a play or read one. ""When I wrote the play, I never thought it would be performed,"" he explains. ""It's set in a car. I probably wouldn't do that now because I know the problems it can cause. I knew nothing back then."" He left school at 16 but returned a year later. After finishing his A-levels, he joined the Young People's Theatre. ""I realized I wanted to write for actors. I wanted my writing to be heard, not just read, because of the rhythm and rhyme,"" he says. ""Suddenly, I was with people who thought like me. It was the first time I enjoyed being in an educational setting. It was very inspiring.""
B. Comedian Simon Pegg, 28, has made great progress in his career since studying drama at Bristol University. He is currently writing a TV comedy series and has just finished a tough tour with comedy star Steve Coogan. He has always worked hard. Even back in Bristol, he was practicing his comedy in clubs. ""University was very theoretical,"" Simon remembers. ""It made me realize I didn't want to be a serious actor; I was always more interested in comedy. People think comedy is the hardest job, but it really isn't. If you have courage and good material, it's wonderful to make people laugh."" He has performed with the comedy group Funny Business, but his partnership with Steve Coogan has been the most successful. ""He saw my show, and since I was a big fan of his, he probably noticed I was imitating him,"" Simon admits.
C. Ciaran McMenamin, 24, became known to the public when he danced into their homes as the lead in the series *The Young Person's Guide To Becoming A Rock Star*. The response was very positive, and his career has taken off quickly. ""It's been a great opportunity for me,"" he says with a smile. ""Now I can choose what I want to do, which is what I've always wanted."" This is a rare and comfortable position, especially since he has just graduated. Looking back at Ciaran's early career, it's clear that such success was always possible. Encouraged by his mother, he went from leading roles in school plays to the Ulster Youth Theatre, where he stayed for four years. ""I was basically using acting to avoid doing homework,"" Ciaran laughs. ""But then I decided I wanted to pursue it because I had a talent and passion for it."" Now, he is waiting for the praise to come in, but when asked about fame, he becomes serious. ""When you're 18, you think you'll love the photos and interviews, but you soon realize that's not why you act. It's about earning respect for doing good work.""
D. Neil Taylor, 25, is the lead singer of the pop band Matrix, which has just signed a three-album deal with Domino Records. Neil and his bandmate Rick Brown are expected to be very successful when their single, *Chimera*, is released soon. ""The record company's idea of good sales is different from mine,"" he says. ""They want a big hit, but I just want two people to buy it and be happy."" Unlike many new pop stars, Neil has worked hard for his success. He left school at 16 and has been trying to enter the music industry ever since. ""It's funny how things happen,"" he says. ""I had been performing at student gigs for eight years and was starting to feel tired. I was about to give up when I met Rick Brown, who had connections at Domino, and we formed Matrix. It couldn't have come at a better time. There were moments when I felt very down, and I was in some terrible bands. But hopefully, it will all be worth it.""
E. Poet and author Stephen Richards is 27 years old and has won more awards and honors than many people twice his age. He is already well-known in the poetry world, where he has been touring and giving readings several times a week for the past six years. His first novel, *Hidden*, will be published in March. ""It's a story about obsessive love. It was a strong idea that I couldn't express as a poem."" Stephen loved creative writing in school but lost interest in education later. ""I chose not to go to university, but I became bored stuffing envelopes at a theater and decided I should go."" After university, he published his first work, a children's book, in 1992. ""I don't think my parents expected me to be a writer; they thought I would just be a reader because that's all I did as a child."" With his poetry receiving much praise, moving into novels is a brave step. ""My poetry has a structure, and there's less chance of making big mistakes,"" he explains. ""A novel can be any length, so there are more words that could be bad. My main goal is to avoid just producing work without caring about quality."""
CAE_1,C1,"
A. Isabel, a 31-year-old art student, thinks she looks good in jeans but rarely wears them because she doesn’t want to attract the wrong people. She is looking for Mr. Right and worries that her knobbly knees might ruin her chances. However, she remains hopeful, which helps her and others in the story. The author writes in a lively style, using chapter titles like ""Our Hero Feels Inspired,"" similar to the feel of an early silent film.
B. This story celebrates the rise and near-fall of a local radio station in America. It is told from the perspective of a smart, shy child named Francis With. Francis works for WLT (With Lettuce and Tomato) Radio, a station created by Roy and Ray Soderbjerg to promote their sandwich shop. The station broadcasts a mix of singers, preachers, and announcers. The small-town setting allows the author to use dry humor and simple writing, taking readers back to the gentler times of the 1940s and 1950s, with its old stores and classic cars.
C. In the author's world, it is normal for a second husband to talk to his wife's first husband. When professor Richard Vaisey falls for a beautiful Russian poetess, he shares his feelings with his wife's ex-husband. The poetess writes bad poetry, which bothers Richard, and she is also trying to get help for her wrongly imprisoned brother. However, the way the author untangles these issues is what makes the story interesting. He moves the plot forward with humor and carefully examines relationships, making it an enjoyable and clever read.
D. In 1960s London, two sets of best friends—two women and two men—are connected for 25 years through life and death. At the beginning of this long novel, James Hudson, a mysterious American businessman, is starting a newspaper that his friend Richard Blake is editing. The newspaper launch is important, but so is the fact that a woman they both loved (and one of them married) was killed years ago. The story includes murder, ambition, love, and jealousy, all written well. This book allows readers to really get to know the characters.
E. This story, written by a great American author, is funny and touching. It follows Ian Bedloe, who feels guilty about a past mistake and becomes a 'father' to his brother's three orphaned children. At 40, he is slowly becoming an eccentric bachelor. The story explores many emotions and highlights the special bond Ian forms with the youngest child, Daphne. It is a warm book that balances sadness and laughter perfectly."
CAE_53,C1,"**Volunteer Tourism**
Four academic writers discuss international voluntary work. 
A. It is difficult to say that volunteer tourists make a big difference in development. While they can help build homes or schools, they usually pay a large fee to participate in this work. This money, if given directly to a local community, could pay for more labor than the volunteer could provide. This is especially true for gap year volunteers, who often do not have the necessary skills or experience. Many studies question whether gap year volunteering is mainly about helping others or if young people are more interested in improving their own careers. However, these projects can help develop people who will act ethically in their future careers.
B. Volunteering can lead to better international understanding, improved conflict resolution skills, and greater participation in global issues through civic organizations. It can also help build international social networks among everyday people. In this way, the overall benefits can be greater than the individual contributions, helping both volunteers and local communities. However, if volunteering is mostly done by wealthy individuals, it may only benefit them and not the communities that need help.
C. At its worst, international volunteering can be seen as a form of charity that benefits wealthy Westerners more than the communities they aim to help. On the other hand, it can also provide valuable technical assistance for development. When done well, international volunteering can benefit both volunteers and the organizations they work with, while also allowing for the sharing of skills and cultural experiences in developing communities. Most importantly, volunteering can raise awareness of and commitment to fighting against poverty and injustice.
D. Volunteer tourism fits well with the growing trend of helping others. These small efforts to ""make a difference"" can seem positive, especially in a time when people are skeptical of big government and businesses. However, this approach can ignore the need for democratic government and reduce development to individual acts of charity, which may not truly help poor communities. While volunteering can be a good act, when it is promoted as sustainable development, it can misrepresent the real issues of global inequality and poverty faced by many in developing countries."
CAE_55,C1,"Sound the Alarm**
Stuart Harris reports
Many of us listen to the radio in the morning, and most of us need something to help us get out of bed. This is why we have clock radios. But how do you choose a good one? Our team, which included me, inventor Tom Granger, and broadcaster Paul Bridges, tested five clock radios that are currently available.
The 'dual alarm function' advertised with one model does not let you wake up with the buzzer, snooze for a while, and then get out of bed. The instruction booklet suggests using this function to set two different wake-up times: one for weekdays and one for weekends. But who really lives like that? Since this model costs about the same as the second one we tested, having a cassette player is a good deal—you can fall asleep to your favorite tapes and wake up without news. We all thought the radio quality was excellent, but we wished it was smaller. It is as big as a rugby ball. Paul Bridges said, ""Any clock radio I buy must leave enough space on my bedside table for my keys, wallet, glasses, and phone. Also, I always book a wake-up call just in case the alarm doesn’t go off.""
This model was voted the best-looking and overall winner. Paul Bridges said he was ""in love with it,"" even though the clock he tested ""kept getting stuck at 16:00."" I was impressed by the digital display, with its nice grey numbers on a soft green background. The wide snooze bar lets you tap it with your eyes closed. Unfortunately, the smooth buttons made me want to touch them like piano keys, which caused problems when I finally looked at the instruction booklet. The clock has a backup battery, so you don’t have to reset it if someone pulls the plug to use a hairdryer or vacuum cleaner; everyone liked this feature. However, we all found it difficult to set up, but once we figured it out, we felt ""cool"" and sophisticated.
Tom Granger called this model, which has a built-in lamp, ""unbelievably tacky"" because of how it is made. ""You have to pull the light out of its socket to make it work, which makes me question the quality of the rest of it."" He said he had to read the instruction booklet twice to get it to work; the clock kept jumping from 12:00 to 02:00. The light was hard to position; you could never read by it—it only shines on the clock, which is already lit. Paul Bridges found the lamp idea funny but agreed that the radio was hard to tune. The buzzer sounded like an alarm on a submarine and made me want to throw it across the room. Interestingly, this model is the third most popular on the market. Aimed at young people, with its bright colors and matching strap, it appealed to the child in Tom Granger and me. ""I would choose this one because it stands out,"" he said. In fact, the traditional design of the controls made it the only one we could set up without reading the instruction booklet. Unfortunately, the alarm has a funny 20-minute error margin; the manual says, ""the alarm may sound about 10 minutes earlier or later than the set time."" Paul Bridges laughed at this idea, saying this model was ""terribly fiddly"" and ""completely useless.""
The simplest and cheapest of all the models tested scored points with Tom Granger because it ""seemed very standard and took up little space,"" and it has old-fashioned dial tuning. ""It's easier to set up. With modern push-button tuning, you’re never sure if you pressed all the buttons correctly, so you can’t be confident it will work."" He agreed that manufacturers had to improve radio quality because of button-tuning. I thought the tuning was a bit rough, as did Paul Bridges, but we agreed that the radio quality was good. The buzzer on this model definitely works; it got me out of bed in just two beeps!"
CAE_50,C1,"**Hedgehogs**
A hedgehog is a small mammal known for the sharp spines on its body. Hedgehogs live in many parts of the world, but none are found in America or Australia. All types of hedgehogs can roll into a tight ball when they are attacked, which makes their spines stick out. This is a good way to protect themselves, but it works better if the hedgehog has many spines. Some hedgehogs that live in deserts have changed over time to carry less weight, so they have fewer spines. Because of this, they are more likely to run away from danger instead of rolling up, using their rolling ability only as a last option. Hedgehogs are mostly active at night and sleep during the day, often hiding under bushes or in holes in the ground. Although all hedgehogs can hibernate, not all of them do. In good conditions, some hedgehogs will stay awake all year."
CAE_25,C1,"Great Sportswomen on a Winning Streak**
Excelling in any sport is difficult, even for men, but women often face even more challenges. Training and competing take up a lot of time, leaving little room for a normal life, so sacrifices are necessary. Despite these challenges, women are overcoming prejudice and setting new records. Here, we talk to some amazing British sportswomen who are reaching their goals.
A. **Jill, 27, Skier**  
""It's a great feeling to fly through the air and land safely, but it can be scary. Sometimes I don’t feel well or it’s windy, and I can’t see well, but I just keep going. It’s hard to have a life outside of skiing because we train for ten months each year. I give up a lot of my social life and friends, but it was my choice. There are six men and three women on the British team. We all compete on the same courses and are treated equally - it’s a young sport.""
B. **Caroline, 22, Cyclist**  
""Two years ago, I borrowed a bike to join a charity race. I won because I cycled faster than everyone else, which was amazing since I had never cycled before! I earn a good salary as a professional cyclist, and there are many opportunities for sponsorship. However, I worry that people might think I succeeded because of my looks, not because I am a great cyclist. So, I focus on cycling instead of making money. I train for at least four hours every day on the bike, plus I do stretching, swimming, and running. My boyfriend is also a cyclist, so he understands how much time it takes.""
C. **Annabel, 26, Rower**  
""Rowing is hard for girls to start because very few girls' schools offer it. Most girls don’t begin until they are 19 or 20, which makes it harder to compete internationally. Also, coaches often change every year, so the women’s team lacks stability. But I love it, and being fit is great, plus there is a good social life.""
D. **Ffyona, 24, Long-Distance Walker**  
""When I was 13, I dreamed of walking around the world, not realizing how big it was! I felt trapped in Britain and wanted freedom. Each walk has been different. Walking across Australia was the hardest experience for me. I walked 50 miles a day with very little sleep and had many blisters on my feet. But I set a record! I had to because my sponsorship money would run out after 95 days. Some men think women are more likely to fail, so they see sponsoring us as a risk.""
E. **Lisa, 26, Saloon Car Racer**  
""Some men have big egos when driving. When I do well, they often ignore me. Being a woman has its challenges. When I reach a corner, some men think, 'I have to beat her,' so I’ve had many tough moments! You need to be competitive and aggressive. It’s hard to earn money, and what I do make goes back into racing. Women have been racing since the 1920s and have often been seen as unusual. It’s great that more women are joining racing every year. For me, the excitement of saloon car racing is always trying to achieve a perfect lap.""
F. **Alison, 28, Triathlete**  
""I wake up at 5:30 three mornings a week to swim. I need Tuesday and Thursday mornings to catch up on sleep. In the evenings, I either cycle or run. Yes, I sometimes fall asleep at my desk! There is a lot of nervousness before a race, and when I compete, I really push myself. I often ask myself why I do this. The answers are: a) I feel happier when I stay fit, b) I would be lazy if I didn’t push myself, and c) racing is very social. Men and women usually compete together, but when events are covered in the media, 90% of the articles focus on the men's events, and only 10% mention the women's events. The prize money is not as good either. But now we have formed an International Triathlon Women’s Commission to improve this."""
CAE_34,C1,"
The day I met Picasso, Richard Cork remembers how, as a 78-year-old student, he encountered one of the greatest artists of the century. Even from a distance, eating lunch at an outdoor restaurant in Cannes, Picasso was easy to recognize. I was an 18-year-old student, traveling around Europe and Morocco in an old, unreliable van while waiting to start university. After running out of money, I found a job painting boats by the waterfront. However, I spent a lot of time drawing and was lucky to have a sketchbook with me when I met the famous artist.
Picasso was known to be a private person who usually worked alone in the hills. So, I was very surprised to see him sitting at a table with his wife, Jacqueline, and three friends. Without my friend's encouragement, I would never have had the courage to walk over and ask for his signature. I was nervous as I introduced myself and offered my sketchbook, but to my surprise, he agreed. He wrote his name at the top of the page and then added a lively drawing below. Picasso's art, even when abstract, often connected to real things. The lines he drew might have represented a cloud, the sea, or the shape of Cannes harbor.
I thanked him and started a hesitant conversation. Since Picasso's English was worse than my French, an American woman at the table helped translate. She kept calling him ""the Maestro,"" which made it hard for me to speak. But I managed to tell Picasso about my strong interest in art and my admiration for his work. After a while, I went back to my boat and proudly showed my friend what I had. But my friend noticed that the lunch was still going on. ""Is that all?"" he asked, looking at the signature. ""Why don’t you go back and take advantage of this opportunity? You might not get another chance, and he probably wouldn’t mind if you drew his portrait.""
With my sketchbook under my arm, I returned to Picasso's table. I thought it was best not to ask if I could draw his portrait, as he might say no and ruin the moment. So, I just stood by the table, leaned my pad against a screen, took out a crayon, and started to draw. When he noticed, Picasso smiled playfully and made it hard for me to draw. He acted out funny expressions, rolling his eyes, sticking out his tongue, and making strange shapes with his hands. It was like he was a clown. I felt like giving up, but his playful spirit challenged me to keep going. 
Eventually, Picasso relaxed and let me study him without distractions. I saw how strong and alert he looked, wearing a blue-and-white striped shirt. He seemed more like a fit 60-year-old than a man about to turn 84. His dark eyes were youthful and intense, and I tried to capture that in my drawing. He seemed a bit distant and alone, even with friends around him. His playful behavior hid a serious side. He let his friends talk while he sat quietly, focused on his own thoughts.
When the American lady told me that Picasso wanted to see my portrait, I felt embarrassed and said it wasn’t good enough. But Picasso insisted, and when I showed him my sketchbook, he nodded approvingly. Then, to my surprise, he said it was his turn to draw. I quickly gave him my crayon, and he made a few quick strokes on the paper. In seconds, he drew a bearded face that looked very different from my careful drawing. He had moved one of my eyes onto my nose and captured my smile with a single lively line. I looked like a character from one of his playful artworks.
I thanked Picasso and asked if he would sign my drawing. The American lady explained that he said I already had his signature. So, there were limits to his generosity! Still, I look back now and feel very lucky. Meeting Picasso and receiving his attention meant a lot to me."
CAE_12,C1,"'Shopping Tricks'**
Have you ever gone into a store and bought more than you planned? Here are some tricks that shops use to make you spend more money.
A. **Freshness First**  
Supermarkets know that customers like fresh food. They often place fruits and vegetables at the entrance of the store or have displays of house plants to create a fresh feeling. They might also have a bakery that fills the store with the smell of fresh bread. The colors in the store, like green, are chosen because they remind people of fresh produce. However, most of what supermarkets sell, like frozen foods and cleaning products, is not fresh.
B. **Smart Product Placement**  
Where products are placed in the store is very important for sales. Supermarkets use computers to find out which areas of the store customers visit the most. In these areas, they place products that have high prices or sell quickly. Items at eye level are more likely to be bought, so manufacturers want their products on those shelves. Special offer bins attract customers looking for bargains. Another strategy is to place related items together, like desserts near ice cream.
C. **Spreading Essentials**  
Supermarkets often place low-priced items like bread and sugar far from the entrance. This way, customers have to walk past more expensive items to get to them. Chain stores also place popular products away from the entrance, hoping that loyal customers will search for them and see other tempting items along the way.
D. **Less is More**  
Chain stores have changed how they display their products. For example, the Next chain has moved away from the idea of stacking many items to sell them cheaply. Instead, they display fewer items, making them seem more exclusive. Their success comes from good store design as well as stylish clothing.
E. **Total Costs Matter**  
Food shoppers often pay more attention to the total cost of their shopping than to the price of individual items. Supermarkets mix low-priced essentials with higher-priced items. They sometimes sell certain low-priced items at a loss to attract customers, a strategy known as 'loss leaders.' They also get discounts from manufacturers by buying in large quantities or giving products good display space.
F. **The Price Tag**  
Customers tend to buy fewer items in chain stores and notice individual prices more. For example, pricing a blouse at £14.99 instead of £15 can make a difference. This pricing strategy also helps reduce theft, as staff must ring up sales to give change.
G. **Lighting Matters**  
Both supermarkets and chain stores think carefully about lighting. Chain stores aim for lighting that looks like natural daylight so customers can see the true colors of clothes. Supermarkets use special lighting to make fresh foods look more appealing.
H. **Guiding Shoppers**  
Many chain stores use different types of flooring to guide customers through the store. One pattern is for walking paths, and another is for sales areas. This strategy, called the 'Yellow Brick Road,' encourages shoppers to follow certain routes. For example, Marks and Spencer use wood or marble for paths to lead customers to more inviting carpeted sales areas.
I. **In-Store Promotions**  
As you enter a supermarket, you might see large, colorful pictures of delicious food, which can make you hungry if you haven't eaten. In the U.S., some supermarkets are testing 'video trolleys' that show ads for products while you shop. These trolleys aim to attract impulse buyers and can increase sales by about 30 percent."

**Sea, Ice & Rock**
Mountaineer Chris Bonnington (58) is famous for reaching the top of Everest in 1985. He has also created new climbing routes in Britain and the Alps and has written many books, such as *Quest for Adventure* and *Everest the Hard Way*. Robin Knox-Johnston (53) started his career at sea in the Merchant Navy. In 1968-1969, he was the first person to sail around the world alone in his yacht, Sunhaili. He set a record for crossing the Atlantic Ocean, taking just 10 days to sail from New York to the Lizard in England. 
Chris and Robin worked together to sail and climb in Greenland, and they wrote about their journey in their new book, *Sea, Ice and Rock*. In 1979, while I was working on *Quest for Adventure*, I called Robin to ask for an interview. He invited me to join him for a sail. I could teach him some climbing techniques, and he could teach me the basics of sailing. It was my first time on a yacht. We sailed for a while and then anchored. Robin's wife and daughter stayed on the boat while we paddled to the shore to practice climbing. The route was quite hard, but I was impressed by how steady Robin was in difficult conditions. 
After a while, we reached a big drop. I asked Robin if he had ever climbed before. He hadn’t, so I showed him how to do it. When I finished, Robin politely asked if he could go down the way he used to on his boat. He was used to using his arms, but I wanted him to use his legs. I was not very happy about it, but he lowered himself down safely. During that trip to Skye, Robin and I built a strong friendship. His idea to combine our skills for a trip to Greenland was a natural next step after our journey to Skye. 
I was very impressed by Robin as a leader. Normally, the captain makes all the decisions, but Robin always asked for everyone’s opinion first. Most of the time, people were too afraid to give him advice, but it felt good to be part of the decision-making. To be honest, I found sailing difficult and boring. The moments of crisis were easy to handle because of the adrenaline, but spending day after day in the middle of the sea was hard for me. I prefer being on land and am not very handy. Robin, on the other hand, is a natural sailor and enjoyed fixing the engine or repairing the toilet. I realized that Robin didn’t really need my help, which made me feel a bit useless at times. 
The crew was also very close together: six people on a 32-foot yacht that was meant for four. When you are on a mountain expedition, you can get away from each other. When we reached Greenland and it was my turn to lead the expedition, I found it hard to take responsibility for Robin’s safety. There were many times when, if Robin had fallen, he could have pulled me down with him. I had to be careful about that. I underestimated how hard climbing the Cathedral, Greenland’s highest mountain, would be. Robin is not a natural climber, which made his efforts even more impressive. 
The first time we tried to reach the top, we were climbing for 24 hours. On the way down, we were so tired that we almost fell asleep on steep slopes, 1,500 feet above the ground. Robin worked very hard, but he completely trusted me and just followed. When it became too difficult and I realized we had to turn back, he accepted it. I also knew that Robin was worried about the boat: whether we could get it through the ice and if it was okay. Still, he wanted to try climbing the mountain again. 
The only time we almost had a problem in our relationship was on the yacht on the way home. We were taking turns to keep watch. I was supposed to wake up at 4 am for my shift, but Robin decided not to wake me. He thought he could handle it alone. The night before, I had almost fallen asleep. I felt that he didn’t trust me, which made me feel insecure, and I told him so. Robin quickly reassured me that I was wrong to think that. While we enjoyed the trip to Skye, we didn’t really get to know each other until the end of the Greenland expedition. I found that beneath his tough exterior, Robin was a kind and sensitive person."
CAE_8,C1,"**A History of the Apple**
Apples have been part of human life for thousands of years, coming in many colors, shapes, and sizes. However, in the late twentieth century, we risk losing this important part of our history.
**Prehistoric Times (8,000 BC)**  
People have been eating apples since ancient times. In neolithic Britain, they would spit out apple seeds. About 10,000 years ago, they left apple remains near lakes in Switzerland and Italy. In these areas, early humans even stored dried apple halves for winter. These apples were wild crab apples, small and not like the apples we eat today.
**Norman Influence (1000 AD)**  
The French learned how to grow fruit from the Romans, and this knowledge spread to Britain. The Romans brought some apple varieties, but many did not grow well in Britain. After the Norman Conquest, new apple varieties became more popular. British monks continued to experiment and create new types of apples, which are the ancestors of many Western apples today.
**Medieval Favorites (1200)**  
In the thirteenth century, several apple types became common in Britain. The Old English Pearmain, known for its pear-like shape, was the main dessert apple until the eighteenth century. The Costard was a popular cooking apple sold in Oxford markets from 1296 until the late seventeenth century. However, due to droughts, the Black Death, and the Wars of the Roses, fewer apples were produced, and more were imported. This changed in the sixteenth century when King Henry VIII sent his fruit expert, Richard Harris, to France to learn about apple growing. Harris returned with many new apple varieties, including the famous Pippins, and started the first modern orchard in Kent.
**Settler Treasures (1750)**  
By the seventeenth century, apples were so popular in Britain that the first settlers to Canada, Australia, the US, South Africa, and New Zealand took apples and seeds with them. Captain Bligh of the Bounty brought apples to Australia, and Jan van Riebeeck took them to South Africa. The Pilgrim Fathers carried them to America. In North America, the famous apple planter was John Chapman, known as 'Johnny Appleseed'. Born in 1774, he planted apple nurseries from Pennsylvania to Indiana. He was seen as a kind man and became the subject of many stories.
**Modern Delicious (1850)**  
Around this time, a Quaker farmer named Jesse Hiatt in Iowa found a new apple tree growing from the roots of a dead tree. He named the apple 'Hawkey'. When a judge tasted it at a fruit show, he exclaimed, ""Delicious!"" In 1895, the apple was sold as 'Delicious' and became one of the most popular apples in the world.
**Granny Smith (1850)**  
Another famous apple, the Granny Smith, was discovered in Australia by Maria Anne Smith. She was the daughter of convicts and worked as a midwife in Eastwood, New South Wales. Known as 'Granny Smith', she took care of her family's farm. In 1868, she found a small tree growing from discarded fruit. She moved it, and soon she was harvesting green apples that became famous worldwide. When asked about the tree, she said, ""It's just like God to make something useful out of what we think is rubbish,"" referring to both the apple and her own background.
**Uniformity Issues (1950)**  
Today, apples are grown all over the world, from India to Africa. However, most apples come from just a few varieties, chosen for their appearance and ability to travel rather than their taste. This lack of variety is a problem, as it reduces the diversity of apples. While some gardeners in the UK have kept old apple varieties alive, many apples in the US have been lost over the past century. However, consumers are starting to want more variety. We cannot rely only on amateur gardeners to save apple diversity; we must work to protect and value the natural variety of apples for everyone's benefit."

**Activities and Interests**
It’s hard to describe Explore Worldwide because each trip is unique. We have divided our adventures into 8 categories, each highlighting special activities. These highlights are important parts of our tours, but many other factors also contribute to a successful trip, such as unique places, interesting encounters, and local customs.
**Cultural/Adventure**
Most trips have a strong cultural focus. Some tours emphasize local cultures and historical sites. For example, if you are interested in cultural and historical destinations, consider our trips to Egypt, Jordan, Turkey, Greece, India, and more. Many trips include short walks of 2-4 hours to visit less-known sites.
**Wildlife and Natural History**
Our wildlife safaris take you to some of the best game parks in the world, allowing you to see animals in their natural habitats. In Africa, you might even step outside your vehicle to explore the wild. You can track mountain gorillas in Zaire, hike with tribal guides in Uganda, or canoe on the Zambezi River. Most safaris involve camping, but some offer hotel stays.
**Ethnic Encounters**
A highlight of our adventures is meeting ethnic or tribal peoples, such as the Tuareg of the Sahara or the Maya of Mexico. Many of these cultures are under threat, and we aim to promote understanding and respect while minimizing cultural and environmental impact.

No experience is needed, and safety skills are taught quickly. Our river trips in India, Africa, and the Amazon provide a unique view of beautiful landscapes and wildlife."
CAE_30,C1,"Richard Nerurkar, a long-distance runner from Britain, visits a training camp in Kenya. This camp is located ten miles south of the equator, on a mountain path that leads to Mount Kenya, the highest peak in the country. For the past three years, this beautiful but isolated place, called Nanyuk, has been my base for winter training in Kenya's Central Highlands. However, I had never trained with Kenyan runners before. On my fourth trip to Kenya, I decided to change that. I participated in my first race in Kenya and stayed at the national team training camp, where the best runners prepare for the World Cross-Country Team Championships. I was invited by the national team coach after I finished fifth in the World Championship 10,000 meters race, behind three Kenyans and a Moroccan. It was an opportunity I could not miss. 
Training at high altitude helps produce more red blood cells, which improves how well the body carries oxygen. This has helped many generations of Kenyan runners succeed. My first race in Africa was also special because it was the first international cross-country race held on the continent, in Nairobi. It was a humbling experience for me, as 41 runners finished ahead of me, and all but three were Kenyan. I felt I had run well, but I know that Kenyan success is not just because of the altitude. Kenyan runners have a simple and effective approach to running. They run effortlessly, eat a simple diet, and enjoy competing.
During my time at the training camp, I learned how the Kenyan runners train. The camp is located at St Mark's College, 6,200 feet up the southern slope of Mount Kenya, surrounded by beautiful fields and tropical plants. The living conditions are basic; the athletes share rooms in dormitories with six people. Their daily routine includes three workouts: a relaxed morning run, interval training in the middle of the day, and a steady run in the late afternoon. Each day starts at six in the morning, and we gather to hear instructions from the coaches. We were told to ""run easy"" because we had a tough day ahead. We covered about 40 kilometers each day, which is just under a marathon distance. Sundays were easier, with only one run of 20 kilometers.
Life at the camp was simple. We only needed a splash of water on our faces and a quick brush of our teeth before breakfast. Breakfast included tea, bread, and boiled eggs, eaten in a small dining area. Lunch and dinner were similar, with ugali (a maize dish), stew, cabbage or spinach, and tea. After running, we would drive to a stream to wash off in the evening. By the end of my stay, I had a deeper understanding of why Kenyan runners are so successful. Their success cannot be explained by genetics, upbringing, or altitude alone. I began to think that the simple lifestyle in the mountains, the hard training, and their passion for running might be the true reasons behind Kenya's success in distance running."
CAE_7,C1,"The Challenges of Mass Marketing**
Almost everyone knows that advertising is struggling. This problem is not just because of the recession; advertising started to decline in early 1989, before the recession really affected the economy. The issues with advertising are more serious and are happening all over the world. The sad truth is that advertising has not kept up with changes in the economy. Advertisers often think about large markets and mass media, but as brands and media have increased, target markets have become smaller and more specific. Even campaigns for big brands should focus on smaller audiences, but they usually do not.
Think about your own shopping habits. When you go to a supermarket, you might buy 30, 40, or even 50 items. Most of these items are not from advertised brands, and you may buy several of the same brand. In total, you probably only buy a few advertised brands from the thousands available in the store. Over a year, you are unlikely to buy more than a few hundred different brands. For durable goods, you might buy about a dozen a year. If you buy a new car, it is likely provided by your employer, and if not, you may only buy one every three years. You also do not buy many clothes, and most of them are not from advertised brands. Even when you consider all the different products and services, it is very likely that you do not buy more than 400 different brands in a year. 
In comparison, there are about 32,500 branded goods and services that are advertised. If we ignore the 23,000 brands that spend less than £50,000 a year on advertising, we can focus on the 9,500 brands that are listed and analyzed. The average person buys about 400 of those 9,500 brands, and not all of these purchases are because of advertising. This means that only about 4 percent of advertising is effective. 
When you watch TV tonight, count how many commercials are for brands you buy or might buy in the future. For most people, this number is about one in 16, or 6 percent. This means that the commercials for the other 15 brands, or 94 percent, are likely wasted. You might think you are different and that you are not influenced by advertising, but most people feel the same way. The reality is that most people do not buy the brands they see advertised. 
There is always some waste in advertising because not everyone who sees an ad will buy the product. People only remember a small number of ads and ignore the rest, so waste is unavoidable. However, this does not mean that advertising is not effective. Many advertisements have shown that it can work. Advertising needs to reach a large number of people to connect with the smaller group that will respond, as advertisers cannot know in advance who will be interested. 
Even with careful targeting, advertisers can reduce waste but can never know exactly who will respond. Unlike face-to-face selling, where a salesperson might succeed with every potential customer, this is not possible with media advertising. If advertisers knew exactly who would respond, they would communicate with them directly instead of using mass media. 
Any advertiser who can attract one million new customers, which is about 2 percent of the adult population, is doing well. For popular products like soap powder, the top brands would be very happy with a million extra customers. Therefore, any advertising campaign that can reach 2 percent of the population would be considered very successful, and this is just a small part of the population. While mass media can be a cost-effective way to reach people, if advertising is to improve, its messages will need to be more focused than ever before."

**Solar Survivor: Charles Clover Visits Britain's Greenest Home**
Charles Clover explores one of the most environmentally-friendly homes in Britain, located in Southwell, Nottinghamshire. This area has some interesting features. First, it is home to Southwell Minster, a little-known ancient cathedral. Writers who care about the environment admire the 'green' men figures carved by medieval craftsmen in the cathedral's thirteenth-century chapter house. 
The second surprise is the 'autonomous house,' built by Robert and Brenda Vale. This house is known as Britain's greenest home. The Vales use rainwater for washing and drinking, recycle their sewage into compost for their garden, and heat their home using waste heat from their electrical appliances and their own body heat, along with that of their three teenage children and two cats, Edison and Faraday. 
You might not notice the traditional-looking house, which has a clay tile roof, located 300 yards from the Minster. It was designed to match the burnt-orange brick of the town's nineteenth-century buildings and received approval from planners, even though it is in a conservation area. When you ring the solar-powered doorbell, you will find complete silence. The house is very well insulated, with special triple-glazed windows that keep out noise. 
Once inside, and after taking off your shoes (as Robert asks), you will feel a peaceful atmosphere. On a sunny summer day, the windows are closed, and the conservatory warms the air before it ventilates the house. Robert opens clever ventilation shafts and windows to create air movement because the house is designed to be draught-proof. Even the cats have their own small air-locked door.
The Vales, who teach architecture at Nottingham University, have cared about the environment for many years. They wrote a book on green architecture in the 1970s called *The Autonomous House*. They started by designing a building that produced no carbon dioxide. Then they decided to also avoid using mains water. They created composting toilets, installed rainwater tanks in the cellar, and used copper gutters to keep the drinking water clean, filtering it before use. Water from washing goes into the garden, and they do not have a dishwasher because they believe using strong detergents is wrong.
Robert explains, ""We wanted to show that it is possible to design a house that is much better for the environment without living in darkness."" The only medieval feature of the house is its design: the hall, which includes the fireplace and staircase, goes up to the top of the building. The Vales do not pay water bills, and last winter, the house used only nine units of electricity a day, costing about 70p. This is much less than what other four-bedroom houses use for heating.
Soon, the house will use even less electricity when they install £20,000 worth of solar water heating panels and equipment in the garden. The house will still use mains electricity for cooking and appliances but will generate extra electricity, enough to charge an electric car in the future. The only heating source is a small wood-burning stove in the hall, which they say they only use during the coldest winter days.
When I visited in February, Robert was reading and said it was too warm to light the fire. The temperature on the first floor was 18°C, which is lower than what is usually expected, but he said it felt comfortable because there were no draughts and everything was at the same temperature. He mentioned that a woman from the early 1900s felt comfortable at 12.5°C because of her warm clothing. He suggested that people living in old houses should return to how people lived back then, but this idea might be hard for many to accept.
The secret of the house is that it is low-tech and simple, so there is little that can go wrong. Most materials were bought from a local builder's merchant and installed by local craftsmen, making the house affordable to build. It cost the same per square meter as low-cost rental housing. Unsurprisingly, commercial building companies are not interested in this idea."
CAE_51,C1,"'The Camera Never Lies
Arthur Conan Doyle, the writer of the Sherlock Holmes stories, thought of himself as a rational man and even a scientist. However, in 1920, he saw photographs of fairies taken in a garden and believed they were real proof that these tiny creatures existed. He published these photographs with an article where he accepted fairies as magical beings. It was not until 1939 that the two women who took the photos confessed they were fake. They had cut out pictures of fairies from a book and placed them among flowers. The results were very beautiful. But this simple trick challenges a basic idea about photography: that the camera cannot lie. In fact, it can, and always has been able to. Today, we often use computer software to change our digital images, and it is a myth that photography ever had a time when it was completely honest. From the moment cameras started capturing reality, that reality was being changed.'"
CAE_11,C1,"Blacksmiths**
Throughout history, iron has captured the human imagination, and the people who work with it have often been seen as more than just skilled workers. Before the Industrial Revolution, blacksmiths were respected like doctors and astrologers because they made weapons, armor, and farming tools. They were also celebrated as artists. In the 18th century, blacksmiths created beautiful ironwork for St Paul's Cathedral. The elegant metalwork in French and Belgian Art Nouveau buildings was also made by talented blacksmiths. However, by the late 1960s, the number of blacksmiths in Britain had greatly decreased because heavy industry no longer needed them, and modern architects rarely used beautiful wrought-iron designs.
In the last 10 years, there has been a revival of interest in decorative architecture and a more creative approach to interior design. Still, much of the work looks similar, with manufacturers of gates and balconies advertising their products as ""classical"" or ""Victorian-style."" You can find trendy design stores filled with rusty candlesticks with odd designs. Fortunately, there are alternatives, and a series of events in the coming weeks aims to promote the blacksmithing craft. The first event is an exhibition of forged ironwork by members of the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA), which opened last week at the Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey. Alan Dawson, the secretary of BABA, says, ""We could be at the start of a new Iron Age, because both the public and blacksmiths are seeing things differently.""
Power tools have made it easier for blacksmiths to work with metal, allowing them to bend, split, twist, and weld it more easily. ""In short,"" says Dawson, ""these artists now have a material that lets them express themselves."" About 250 pieces have been created for the exhibition, including bookends and a spiral staircase. Prices start at £90 and can go much higher. Most of the money will go to the individual makers, but a portion of each sale will be kept by the Association to promote good ironwork, according to Dawson. His own contributions include an eight-foot gate and a lamp with a glass shade. ""My style comes from letting steel bend and flow into shape when it's hot. It's like drawing with metal in space,"" he explains.
Many artists are fascinated by iron. Unlike most metals, which are soft when cold, iron and steel are tougher and more challenging to work with. Susan May, a jeweler, says, ""It's quite magical because it's very soft when hot, but as soon as it cools, it becomes hard and unmovable again."" Ann Catrin Evans creates mild steel door knockers and handles that seem inspired by the dark castles often seen in horror films. One of her designs looks like a ball and chain, and another resembles a Celtic cross. ""I love that steel is cold and hard,"" she says. ""It feels like it will last forever."" No other metal can provide as much visual pleasure or a greater sense of security. It is likely that iron will continue to be used decoratively for the next thousand years, as long as we don’t have to see any more rusty candlesticks!"
CAE_14,C1,"'THE DAY I GAVE UP SMOKING'**
I thought everyone would be happy when I stopped smoking, but one of my colleagues was very angry. ""What do you mean?"" she shouted. ""If it was that easy, why didn't you stop years ago?"" I found it hard to explain how I went from being a heavy smoker to not smoking at all in just a few hours. It was strange for me too. The stop-smoking session was a mix of group therapy and hypnotherapy, and it happened two months and three weeks ago. I had not planned to stop smoking, and I didn’t really want to. I felt annoyed by the constant pressure from anti-smoking groups, and I still do. I had low blood pressure and a healthy family. I didn’t cough or feel sick, and I seemed to recover from colds faster than my friends who lived healthier lives.
On that ordinary Thursday afternoon, I went to a session of The Easy Way to Stop Smoking to write an article about others trying to quit. I said, ""I won’t be trying to stop myself; that wouldn’t be fair."" I thought it was reasonable because I really enjoyed smoking. It gave me pleasure. The counsellor looked at me as if she understood. We were encouraged to smoke as much as we wanted, and the room was so full of smoke that we had to open the windows. I noticed that when I was told to smoke, I didn’t want to, and neither did the others. 
What happened was that the messages about stopping smoking made sense to me. Just as smoking had become a challenge because of the pressure to stop, the idea of quitting started to seem appealing. The thought of not being a smoker made me feel strong. It was a personal feeling that was just for me. Could I also achieve other things? In many ways, it was easy. The physical cravings for nicotine, which felt like hunger, went away after a minute or two and lasted only four or five days. I thought my work would be hard without cigarettes, but it was not a problem at all. I had believed I wouldn’t be able to meet deadlines without nicotine and that I would fail to write a story. Surprisingly, doing simple things at home on weekend mornings was the hardest part, and it still is. 
I am starting to think that smoking helped me deal with boredom; having a cigarette was an activity. Yes, I do miss smoking, but not too much. Every new experience as a non-smoker is something I have to get used to—eating out, waiting for a plane, checking into a hotel, or during a theatre break. All these moments were times when I would have smoked."
CAE_63,C1,"
Dorothy Hodgkin is the only British woman scientist to win a Nobel Prize, but many people in Britain do not know her name. For the past four years, I have been asking friends if they know about her. If they respond positively, I know they are aware of her achievements. 
Dorothy Hodgkin should be well-known because she won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1964. She was a remarkable person and her life shows important changes in the 20th century, such as the growth of women's education and the global sharing of scientific knowledge. 
When I started my research, I wanted to read biographies of scientists. A friend suggested a biography of Linus Pauling, who was a close friend of Hodgkin and also worked in science. However, I found that there were no biographies of Pauling in the local bookshop. I was surprised that he was not considered interesting enough for British readers, even though he was a very important chemist and won Nobel Prizes for both chemistry and peace.
Some scientists believe that biographies of scientists are not interesting. Peter Medawar, a Nobel Prize winner, said that the lives of scientists are often dull. If scientists think this way, it is not surprising that publishers and booksellers feel the same. This idea that scientists are less interesting than artists or writers is common, but it is not true. 
Some scientists are now appearing in public in different ways. For example, Professor Richard Dawkins gives out prizes on a TV quiz show, and geneticist Steve Jones appears in car advertisements. These activities help people see scientists as real people, not just researchers.
The way scientific biographies are written is also changing. In the past, they were often boring and focused only on work. However, books like Richard Feynman's ""Surely You're Joking, Mr Feynman?"" show that scientists can have interesting lives outside of their work. 
Dorothy Hodgkin was dedicated to her science. She solved the structures of penicillin and vitamin B12, which earned her the Nobel Prize, and also worked on insulin. She balanced her scientific career with her personal life, raising three children and being married to a husband who was often away for work. 
Her personal life may not seem directly related to her science, but it shows how she managed different parts of her life. There is much to learn from her story, including her passion for science. 
Communicating this passion is a challenge for biographers. Many readers may not understand complex scientific ideas without clear explanations. However, understanding science is not harder than reading Shakespeare or learning a new language; it just requires effort. 
It is unfortunate that many educated people do not recognize the important contributions of scientists like Dorothy Hodgkin, while they would feel embarrassed if they did not know famous writers or artists."
CAE_56,C1,"Margaret and Her Water-Finding Skills**
Margaret Wilkins is known for having a special ability, often called a ""sixth sense."" She can use a forked hazel stick to find water underground. Many farmers whose wells have dried up are now asking for her help. Along with her husband, Margaret runs a well-drilling business that uses modern tools like drilling rigs and air-compressed hammers. However, to find water, she only needs her hazel stick. The couple has a success rate of over 90%.
This ability to find water, minerals, and lost objects underground is called dowsing. There are many ideas about how it works, from physical explanations like magnetism to spiritual ones. One of the most believable ideas is that everything on Earth vibrates, and water vibrates more than other materials. Some dowsers believe they can sense these vibrations, while others say they can smell water, as smell is a very strong sense.
In recent years, due to drought, Margaret has been very busy, sometimes having a waiting list of almost six weeks. Most of her customers are farmers with dry wells. She explains, ""We usually see customers only once because wells last a long time."" Other customers include people with remote cottages or barns that are now holiday homes, where it is too expensive to run water pipes over long distances. There are also golf-course developers who need water for their clubhouses.
Margaret looks for water between 50 and 70 meters deep. She says, ""You can't drill a well where there is a risk of waste getting into the water supply. The water we find is in cracks of solid rock, and if we bring it up correctly, it should be clean. However, Cornwall has many minerals, so we need to be careful about iron.""
Another important factor is electricity to run the pump, which can be costly if the well is far from power sources. After considering these factors, Margaret begins her search for water. For large areas like golf courses, she starts with a map and a pendulum. ""I hold the pendulum still and move it gently over the map. It will swing when it is above an area with water.""
Once she has identified possible locations on the map, Margaret walks over the fields with her hazel stick, which is forked and equal in size on both sides. ""When I am above water, I feel a strange sensation; I sway a little. When that feeling goes away, I use the stick to find the exact spot to drill."" She holds the two forks of the stick with both hands and pulls them slightly apart to create tension. ""When water is directly below, the straight part of the stick rises. It is crucial to drill exactly where the stick points. If we drill even a little off, we might miss the water completely.""
Margaret's husband also checks the same area. Usually, but not always, they agree on the exact drilling spot. If they disagree, they will not drill until they find a common agreement.
Margaret Wilkins is not alone in her unique skill; many researchers and writers have been interested in this mysterious ability. She describes it as an ""intuitive perception of the environment,"" which is the best way to explain why she finds water so accurately. If she did not have this ""sixth sense,"" it would be hard for her family to continue their well-drilling business year after year."
CAE_36,C1,"'We Changed Lives for a Day!'**
Have you ever thought about living someone else's life for a day? It might be fun to try something new! We arranged this for four people - read about their experiences.
**A. Amanda's Story**
I had never been to a place like the restaurant where my friend works. It was dark, noisy, and full of people. It was very different from my hometown, and I was nervous! Being a mother is busy, but working as a waitress was even harder! I had only fifteen minutes to learn how to carry drinks on a tray. The other waitresses made it look easy, but when I tried, the drinks slipped off the tray and spilled everywhere. I felt so embarrassed, but the other waitresses laughed and said it happens to everyone.
By 11:30 am, there was a long line of customers waiting to get in, and I felt really nervous. I was worried about remembering all the orders, but luckily, everything was done with computers. After a few hours, my feet hurt, and I couldn’t get used to the loud music. Every time a customer spoke to me, I had to say, ""Pardon?"" which was embarrassing! By the end of my shift at 5 pm, I was completely tired and wanted to soak my feet in hot water. One waitress told me it had been a 'quiet' day, and I couldn’t believe how tiring waitressing was. I thought it was an easy job, but you need to be friendly and able to handle many customers at once. I’m quite shy, and I don’t think I could work on a busy Saturday night. I wasn’t happy with the pay either. I must have been a bad waitress because even the rich customers didn’t tip me! I was very glad to go back to my children. Taking care of them seems easy after waitressing!
**B. Cindy's Story**
I was a bit nervous about being a 'mum' for a day, but I was also excited. I had heard that Amanda's daughters were cheeky, but I thought I could manage. As Amanda left for the restaurant, I had to get the two girls dressed and fed. After dropping Sophie at school and Katie at nursery, I thought I would have three hours of peace. I was wrong! A note from Amanda reminded me that I still had to make the beds, clean the house, and do the laundry.
At 1 pm, I picked up Katie, quickly shopped at the supermarket, and took her home for lunch. But when I brought Sophie home from school, the real trouble began. They turned the couch into a trampoline and played a game that involved screaming loudly! I thought they would get tired, but I was wrong again. I thought I had a lot of energy, but they wore me out! After a lot of convincing, I got them to bed by about 8 pm, but then the fun started! How many glasses of water can a child drink? I knew they were just trying to come downstairs to watch TV, but it was exhausting to spend all evening negotiating with them. I never realized how tiring it could be to take care of two small children. You don’t have a moment to think about yourself, and the responsibility is overwhelming. Still, I really enjoyed the day.
**C. Rosemary's Story**
On the farm, I wake up at 5:30 am, so sleeping in until 7 was a treat! I was unsure how to dress for school. I hoped I wouldn’t stand out too much. At assembly, I looked at about 400 students and hoped I blended in. Then it was time for a math class. The children worked in small groups, which was different from my school days when we had to recite together! I helped with a nature project, identifying and feeding snails. By lunchtime, I was tired and looking forward to a break, but teachers only have about five minutes to eat. There is so much to do before classes start again. I attended a staff meeting and helped with athletics trials. After lunch, there was a silent reading lesson, which was nice, and then a French lesson where the children wanted to practice with me, showing how rusty my French was! Finally, we had Physical Education. I was exhausted, but the children had so much energy. The hardest part was speaking in front of the class, even for just two minutes. Teachers may have more holidays, but I think I will stick to farming!
**D. Hilary's Story**
I arrived at White House Farm at 8:30 am, only to find out that Rosemary had been up for three hours! Rosemary's farm has 100 Jersey cows, 15 calves, and about 800 sheep. She also makes ice cream, yogurt, and cream, which are sold in shops and restaurants. I spent most of the morning in the ice cream shop, filling milk containers, making ice cream, and putting on labels. It was hard not to eat some!
At lunchtime, I checked the sheep. I drove to one of the fields and helped a sheep that had fallen over. If sheep are left for more than 12 hours after falling, they could die, so they need to be checked every day. It must be tough in winter! After feeding the calves, I started milking, which took two and a half hours. Rosemary does this twice a day, starting at 6 am, every day of the year! I found it lonely and missed the children - animals don’t talk back! The hardest part of the job is that you can’t take time off. The cows need to be milked twice a day, so it’s hard to plan any time away. Rosemary will only get about three days off this year. Farming seems nice, but the reality is very different. The income is not steady, and I wouldn’t want to depend on the weather."
CAE_6,C1,"
A trumpet isn't just for Christmas. It is surprising how many musicians, even famous ones, come from families without music. Hakan Hardenberger, the only son of parents who do not play music, grew up in a rural area of southern Sweden. At the age of 30, he has become a unique trumpet player in the world. His recordings introduce new music, including concertos by forgotten composers from the baroque and classical periods, as well as new pieces.
When you meet him, he looks young and lively, just like the sound of the trumpet. Recently, he performed the Hummel Trumpet Concerto in one of London’s top concert halls. A television program was also made about his work and growth, filmed in both London and Sweden. Hakan was born near Malmo, and his music career began with a Christmas gift when he was eight years old. His father, who did not play music but liked Louis Armstrong, decided to give his son a real trumpet instead of a toy. The gift was a success, and Hakan never stopped playing.
His mother found the second trumpet player in the Malmo Symphony Orchestra and convinced him to give Hakan lessons. Bo Nilsson, the teacher, quickly recognized Hakan's natural talent. Hakan is grateful to have had such a passionate teacher from the beginning, someone who loved the trumpet and sought out players from around the world. 
Hardenberger explains that the trumpet is a simple instrument, and it is impossible to make a perfect one. There will always be some flaws, and no two mouthpieces are exactly the same. He believes it is important to understand these imperfections and learn to work with them. From the start, Hakan had a special ability to find the right balance and connect with the trumpet. He says that even as a child, his unique sound was already noticeable.
Unlike John Wallace, another famous trumpet player from Britain who started in brass bands and orchestras, Hakan has always seen himself as a solo artist. He admired the French trumpeter Maurice Andre, who also did not play in an orchestra. Hakan collected all of Andre's records, and his parents supported his dream of becoming a professional trumpet player.
When Hakan was 15, it was time to decide where he would study. Although Bo Nilsson wanted him to go to America, it was considered too far and dangerous. Instead, at 16, he went to Paris to study with Pierre Thibaud. Thibaud agreed with Hakan's view that playing in an orchestra was not for him, comparing it to gardening. Hakan knew he played better than many of his peers, but it was only after entering a competition at 17 that he realized he had a special talent for connecting with the audience.
Thibaud suggested Hakan enter the competition for experience. Hakan prepared only for the first round but made it to the second. Fortunately, he already knew most of the pieces for that round too. However, in the final round, he faced a concerto that made him nervous. He did not win first prize, but he enjoyed the performance and realized that even if he felt he played poorly, people still listened to him.
Hardenberger's honesty about his work might seem arrogant, but that is not true. He thoughtfully avoids trying to explain what makes his communication special, saying, ""You risk destroying it by trying to explain. The power of music is that it can always move people."""
CAE_33,C1,"**Text:**
**A.** The story of Tristan Smith, a citizen in the made-up republic of Efica, is a remarkable tale about human power, history, and humor. The author skillfully creates a world with its own history, traditions, and customs. The book is also known for its humor and the author's unique perspective, combined with deep psychological insight, making it a challenging but rewarding read.
**B.** Harriet is a confident middle-class woman with an architect husband and her own business. Normally, she would not have met Sheila, a traditional working-class woman who cares for her elderly father and has raised her grandson, Leo, since he was three. Their lives change dramatically when Leo violently attacks Harriet's son, Joe, in the street. After the court case, both boys refuse to discuss what happened. Leo, who had always been a good student and never fought before, cannot explain his actions, while Joe physically recovers but becomes withdrawn. Harriet is deeply affected by her son's situation, and caring for him takes over her life. Sheila feels so guilty that she asks to meet Harriet, leading to an unusual friendship. The author excels at showing how people respond to major changes in their lives and captures a mother's feeling that she can never do enough for her child.
**C.** This book, which was shortlisted for the Booker Prize, tells the story of one of the most isolated Scottish Orkney islands and its people over a long and quiet history.

He suddenly disappears in the story but returns after the Second World War, having learned to appreciate the simple lives of his ancestors.
**D.** After his recent success, the author has written a sequel that carries the same gentle irony and sharp observations of family life that made the first book popular. Fifteen years after her daughter's death, Aurora Greenway is nearing her seventies and has a lively companion, Rosie Sunlap. Aurora's approach to life remains a mix of vanity, charm, and reluctant kindness, while Rosie helps her navigate her relationships with suitors and friends. By the end of the book, Aurora must face the passage of time and the arrival of a new generation. The author skillfully reveals the sadness that lies beneath the ordinary moments of life, focusing more on the shadows than the bright spots of human experience.
**E.** Six very different people are brought together by millionaire Logan Urquhart to sail around the South Pacific islands on his yacht, the Ardent Spirit. The author uses beautiful descriptive language to explore the personal journeys of self-discovery that each sailor experiences, returning home with renewed spirits after their time at sea.

Rebecca Cripps meets five women who talk about their different jobs: the good parts, the bad parts, and what a typical workday is like for them.
**A. THE BRAIN SURGEON**  
**Name:** Anne  
**Age:** 34  
**ANNE'S DAY**  
""I wake up at 6:30 am, go to the gym at 7 am, and get to work by 8 am. I start surgeries at 8:30 am. I perform surgeries all day on Mondays and Wednesdays, and sometimes on Friday afternoons. Most brain surgeries take about three hours, but some can take all day. Sometimes, I work for ten hours without eating or taking a break. Deciding when to operate can be stressful. I don’t feel stressed while I’m operating, but I do worry about what I will do the next day. Brain surgery is often a last option for patients, but when it is successful, it feels amazing, which makes up for the times it doesn’t work. From 10 am to 1 pm, I see outpatients and explain the surgeries to them. I enjoy this and find it easy to talk to patients. If they get upset, I try to comfort them, but time pressure can make this hard. I usually leave work between 6 pm and 8 pm. Some nights and weekends, I am on call, and I always carry my pager. When I’m on holiday, I worry for the first few days about my patients, and I often dream about operating. I find it hard to relax.""
**B. THE SENIOR DESIGNER**  
**Name:** Marita  
**Age:** 31  
**MARITA'S DAY**  
""I wake up at 7:45 am, leave home by 8:20 am, take the train to work, and arrive at 9:15 am. At 10:30 am on Mondays, we meet to discuss our work, any problems, or if anyone needs help. I work in a team with three senior designers, a company partner, and a junior designer. My work is mostly about production, with only 10 to 15 percent being design. I receive a brief from the client, and if they have clear ideas, I spend three to four weeks designing and developing the project. After that, I present my ideas to the client. Once they agree, we work on budgets and I start hiring photographers and illustrators. I also work with printers to make sure everything is done on time. I spend a lot of time managing people, and it’s important to communicate well. When their work comes in, I put everything together and send it to the printers. Managing several projects at once can be very stressful. Deadlines are always close, and my days are not the same. I have lunch at 1 pm for an hour, and we often go to the pub. If a client likes my designs, it feels great, but it’s disappointing when a project gets rejected. I usually get home by 7:30 pm, but sometimes it’s 8:30 pm or later. I find it hard to relax when I’m busy.""
**C. THE CHAUFFEUR**  
**Name:** Linda  
**Age:** 42  
**LINDA'S DAY**  
""I wake up around 7 am most days, but two or three mornings a week, I have to get up between 4:30 am and 5 am for long-haul flights. At 10:30 or 11 am, I might go for a bike ride or swim. Since chauffeuring is a sitting job, I have to be careful about my diet and exercise. I usually have a big breakfast and just snacks during the day. People often ask me for restaurant or shop recommendations, so I need to know the area well. Many jobs are pre-booked, which helps me plan my routes. Not all passengers are polite; some can be rude. However, most are well-behaved, and I have a good relationship with my regular clients. Sometimes, I hear conversations in the car and have to focus on driving. I work seven days a week, up to fifteen hours a day, so I need to be careful not to get too tired. I try to go to bed by 11 pm.""
**D. THE LANDSCAPE GARDENER**  
**Name:** Tracy  
**Age:** 27  
**TRACY'S DAY**  
""I wake up around 7 am, leave home at 7:30 am, and go to my first job. My assistant and I mostly maintain gardens we designed. We do some commercial work, but most is in private gardens. We spend about an hour and a half at each house. Around 11 am, we get hungry and go to a local café for a big breakfast. In summer, I may work until 10 pm; in winter, until 4:30 pm. I have a home office, so when I get back, I check messages and return calls. If someone wants their garden designed, I usually set up a meeting in the evening around 7 pm or 8 pm. We focus on using old materials to make gardens look historic. Sometimes, clients have very specific ideas, which can be challenging. However, it’s very satisfying to see a garden we created bloom. I find it hard to relax in the evenings because I can hear the business phone ring. I sleep well because my job is physically demanding, and I’m always tired at the end of the day. I may not be very strong, but I am fit. It’s a tough job, but it allows me to be creative.""
**E. THE CIVIL ENGINEER**  
**Name:** Zena  
**Age:** 27  
**ZENA'S DAY**  
""I arrive at the construction site by 8:30 am. I am the assistant resident engineer, overseeing the building of bridges and a retaining wall. I check that the contractors are following the schedule and safety rules while minimizing environmental impact. I help coordinate the site workers and solve any problems. The contractors start work at 6 am, so my first task is to find out what happened since I left the night before. The rest of my day depends on what I learn from the clerk of works. I usually have paperwork to review or design questions to answer. I have lunch for about half an hour between 2 pm and 2:30 pm, but I often eat on the go. The contractors have set meal times, so when they are eating, I can check things on site. Since we check their work, it can create tension, so we need to maintain a good relationship. I see the duty resident engineer once a day, but if something urgent comes up, I act immediately. I usually leave the site around 6 pm and am on call all the time."""

**A. Credit Card Executive**  
I wake up at 6 am to reach the office by 7:30 am. I manage customer development programs for our credit card users. My job includes launching and managing the Membership Rewards scheme in major European markets. I keep in touch with current card users, find new ones, and build relationships with partner companies. I spend the first 45 minutes organizing my day and then respond to emails. I handle advertising for the membership program across Europe, so I meet with marketing staff and advertising agencies to create strategies and plan future projects. I have meetings most of the day, but I keep my door open for anyone who has questions. I travel to different markets in Europe once or twice a week to discuss any issues. When I’m in London, I usually leave work between 6:30 pm and 7:00 pm.
**B. Record Company Executive**  
I arrive at work by 10:00 am and go through the mail, which includes ten to twenty demo tapes, letters from producers, concert information, and invoices from musicians and studios. The phone starts ringing around 10:30 am with calls from producers and publishers, and I have meetings throughout the day to discuss campaigns or projects for artists. When I listen to demo tapes, I know that people are sharing their hard work, so I try to give helpful feedback. I can tell if the sound fits our record label. Once I sign a band, we start working on their first album, choosing songs, a producer, and additional musicians. I also share my vision of the album with the marketing team. I manage budgets and spending. I leave work by 7:00 pm at the earliest, and most evenings I go to concerts, sometimes seeing up to five new groups in one night. After a concert, I might visit an artist in the studio. Most of my social life is connected to my work, and I often don’t get home until 1:00 am, when I listen to a record to relax.
**C. Sales Director**  
I wake up at 8:00 am and drive to work, arriving by 9:30 am. I open the mail, check the schedule for client meetings, and wait to see who arrives. I enjoy showing people around the showrooms and love making sales, knowing the furniture is going to a good home. We sell antiques priced from £1,000 to £6,000, buying from auctions, country house sales, private clients, and overseas. Many items need restoration, and I work closely with restorers, gilders, picture framers, and paper repairers. I read the Antiques Trade Gazette while drinking coffee to stay updated on the business and often visit the Victoria and Albert Museum to compare furniture. I handle accounts once a month and do tax returns every three months. I go home at 5:30 pm and it usually takes me about an hour to relax.
**D. Air Traffic Controller**  
I work on a set shift pattern. When I have an early shift, I leave home at 6:00 am. At 7:00 am, I take over from the night shift and control one of the four positions in the tower. We have a rotating schedule, so I work for about an hour and a half at one station, take a half-hour break, and then switch to a different station. The air traffic controllers, a supervisor, and the watch manager work closely together to manage aircraft movements. In winter, we handle about 1,000 movements a day, and even more in summer. Night shifts are quieter, and I often read about new air traffic rules between 12:00 am and 4:00 am. It’s important to stay alert in this job, so if I feel unwell, I don’t hesitate to take a sick day. The work can be stressful, and it takes time to relax after a shift. I hope to become a watch manager and eventually the general manager of the airport.
**E. Shop Manager**  
If I have an early shift, I leave home by 8:00 am. The first thing I do is start the electronic point-of-sale system. I make sure someone is watching the register and coordinate lunch and break times for staff. In the morning, I help customers find and order books. I enjoy serving customers, but it can be frustrating when they come in with reviews and expect me to quickly gather many books for them. From 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm on weekdays, publishers’ representatives visit the shop, and I discuss new titles for the upcoming months. I need to think about how many copies of a title we might sell. When we want to feature a new title, I ensure it arrives on time. The early shift ends at 5:45 pm. Two days a week, I work a late shift, during which I close the computer system, lock up, and go home.
**F. Financial Analyst**  
I listen to the news at 7:00 am, then get up and take a taxi to work, arriving by 8:45 am. First, I contact our freelance reporters to find out what is happening in my region. I assess financial risks for multinational companies operating abroad, so I try to warn clients about potential problems in those countries. I provide three services: an online executive preview, a security forecast, and a travel information security guide. From 9:15 am to 9:30 am, I meet with our editors to discuss the stories I will follow. My first executive preview must be online by 10:00 am, and my second deadline is 11:00 am, so I need to work quickly. I type the stories, send them to my editor for approval, and then make any necessary changes before they are published. I travel to Africa about three times a year to report on events and stay updated. I leave work around 6:00 pm, and it can be hard to relax, so I often stay awake until 1:00 am."

A. **What makes a good leader?**  
A leader inspires others and helps create change. They guide people towards a common goal. Leadership is not about being tall or having a high IQ. According to Pat Dixon, author of *Making the Difference: Women and Men in the Workplace*, leadership is about ""making things happen through people who are as enthusiastic and interested as you are."" Enthusiasm is very important, and a good leader should be able to express their ideas clearly and confidently. Dixon says, ""It's having the confidence to say 'I believe' instead of 'I think.'""
B. John van Maurik, who runs a Leadership in Management course, believes that ""Most people have more potential for leadership than they realize."" Becoming a leader means recognizing and developing your hidden talents. In a way, we are all born leaders; we just need the right environment to grow. While it is easy to see leadership in famous figures like Emmeline Pankhurst or Mahatma Gandhi, it can be harder to see it in our own workplaces. However, leadership is now seen as essential for good management.
C. Think about the best and worst boss you have had. They might have been equally good at setting goals and meeting deadlines. But how did they achieve these goals? The best leader motivated you and provided support. The worst leader made you feel unimportant and kept information from you. When things went wrong, they blamed you. The first leader led well; the second just managed poorly.
D. Leaders and managers are different. Managers like to work within set rules, while leaders create new possibilities. Micheal Shea, author of *Leadership Rules*, writes, ""A good manager can keep a company running smoothly, but a good leader can change a discouraged organization, whether it’s a company, a sports team, or a country.""
E. Whether you are the boss or a middle manager, you can improve your leadership skills. Here are some lessons to learn:  
- Leadership works best when you choose to lead. Find out what you are passionate about. When you feel inspired, use that energy to take action.  
- Start seeing yourself as a leader. Your ability to lead is an important part of who you are.  
- Collaboration is good, but sometimes strong leadership is needed. Try different styles. If you usually negotiate, try taking the lead. Notice how this changes the results.  
- Set goals and strive to achieve them. Look at your job demands and identify where being a leader can improve your effectiveness and career.
F. Leadership does not just happen. It develops through taking the lead, taking risks, and learning from mistakes. Learn to delegate and motivate, organize and guide, praise and encourage.  
- Don’t assume your leadership style will always be accepted. It might even push people away. Keep improving your communication skills. You don’t need to be liked, but your ideas should be respected.  
- Be visible and approachable to those who matter. Remember, you don’t have to lead all the time. Know when your contribution is essential and how you can help others become leaders."

**Film critic Nick James reviews some recent releases**
**A. Abyss**  
Before Titanic, director James Cameron made a tense Cold War thriller about oil workers and navy experts trying to rescue a nuclear submarine deep underwater. The friendly banter and brave attitude of foreman Bud and his team remind us of tough heroes in movies by Howard Hawks. The film's design and special effects are very impressive, but the dialogue and characters are weak. Despite the skill in making the film, the story feels like a simple B-movie.
**B. The Thin Red Line**  
This video release of the James Jones novel about the battle for Guadalcanal, directed by Andrew Marton, is an interesting contrast to Terrence Malick's new film. While Malick's version is mystical and poetic, Marton's film is more traditional, focusing on one soldier and his difficult relationship with his tough sergeant. Malick's film is richer and more complex, but Marton's version has its strong moments. The flashback where the soldier dreams of his wife is done with a harshness that some may find more effective than Malick's softer images.
**C. On Guard**  
This film, based loosely on Paul Feval's 1875 novel, is a fun swashbuckler that stands out among musketeer adventures. Fabrice Luchini plays a clever villain who causes trouble behind the scenes. Vincent Perez is an energetic hero, and although Daniel Auteuil is a bit too serious for a light film, he also has his good moments as a swordsman. The filmmakers use costume-drama clichés with so much humor and charm that it doesn’t matter.
**D. Character**  
This serious story is set in early 1900s Rotterdam. The detailed production and costumes make the film look like a museum piece. Jan Decleir plays the harsh bailiff Dreverhaven, who is cruel when evicting tenants. His difficult relationship with his son is central to the story, but the filmmakers focus too much on the period details and not enough on the dark themes.
**E. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly**  
This newly remastered video release highlights director Leone's skill. The sound editing is especially good; every footstep, creaking floorboard, and barking dog is clear. The story is harsh, and whenever it slows down, Morricone's powerful music brings excitement. Morally, there is little difference between the good (Clint Eastwood), the bad (Lee van Cleef), and the ugly (Ell Wallach), as they all act selfishly in the post-Civil War West.
**F. The Longest Day**  
The publicity for this three-hour war epic boasts ""Forty-eight International stars."" With four directors and 23,000 extras, it feels overdone. The early scenes, where battle-hardened soldiers wait for news about the invasion, are slow for both the audience and the soldiers. While it is impressive in terms of logistics, it is best seen on the big screen. Watching it on video is a less exciting experience."

**BOOK A** Steve Martin's *Compelling Evidence* is very interesting. The main character is a lawyer who is trying to start a new practice after leaving a powerful law firm. He ends up defending his boss's wife when she is accused of murdering her husband. The trial scenes are exciting, and the ending has a surprising twist. This is a great first book in a popular genre.
**BOOK B** *Curtains for the Cardinal* starts with a lot of action. It follows Sigismondo, a problem-solver for the rich people of the Italian Renaissance, as he gets involved in politics, church secrets, and serious crimes. We always believe he will find out who is guilty. The story is complicated, and the book is a bit too long, but it is still very enjoyable.
**BOOK C** *File Under: Deceased* introduces a new detective, Leah Hunter, who is a tax inspector. She is in a good position to investigate when a strange man dies in front of her. Despite facing challenges and the disapproval of a handsome local detective, Leah is brave and skilled, making her a great character.
**BOOK D** *Double Deuce* by Robert B. Parker features Spenser, a smart private investigator. He helps his friend Hawk get rid of drug dealers in a poor area of Boston. The dialogue is quick and clever, and while there are not many deaths, there is more thinking than usual. Parker always provides high-quality entertainment.
**BOOK E** *False Prophet* by Faye Kellermann has her usual detectives, Pete Decker and Marge Dunn, looking into an attack and robbery at the home of a famous film star's daughter. The author's easy writing style and attention to unusual human behavior make this an enjoyable mystery.
**BOOK F** *Blood Red, Snow White* is written by husband and wife team Diane Henry and Nicholas Horrock. It features another lawyer and a female client, but the action takes place outside the courtroom. The lawyer becomes a victim as the story unfolds. It has all the classic elements of romance, money, and violence, making it a gripping suspense novel.
**BOOK G** *Dead for a Ducat* by Simon Shaw features actor Philip Fletcher as a target. A funny group of characters comes together to film a story about Robin Hood, but Philip feels this is not the right direction for his career. Simon Shaw usually entertains, but this time the story is not as strong as his usual work.
**BOOK H** *Fall Down Easy* is Lawrence Gough's best book in a while. Canadian police are searching for a clever bank robber who targets female bank tellers. The slow build-up of tension and the portrayal of the smart, troubled robber make this book stand out from other detective novels."

I might be too old for this adventure, but here I go! At 34, Tim Pozzi has left a good job to go backpacking. He thinks about why he and others his age have decided to take this big step. This summer, I quit my job and decided to rent out my flat to travel in South East Asia for a year. You might think I'm lucky, but I'm 34 years old and feeling nervous. I have traveled before. After university, I spent two years backpacking in North and South America, and I promised myself I would do it again someday. But then life happened. I fell in love, started a career, bought a flat, and got used to earning a salary. Slowly, I realized I was giving up my own happiness for my job. When I handed in my resignation, it felt like I was taking control of my life again. 
I have no ties now. Many of my friends are married with children, and while they wouldn’t want to trade places with me, they envy my freedom. I’m not in a relationship, and I don’t have strong career goals. I feel I should make the most of my freedom, at least for my friends’ sake! But why am I so nervous? First, I have to make all the necessary arrangements. How can I let someone else live in my home? How do I organize the rental? And I still need to decide where to go. I tend to procrastinate and am already behind my planned schedule. I thought, “I might as well enjoy the summer in England,” and then, “Why not wait for the start of the football season?” 
Letting go of emotional ties makes it harder. I’m delaying because I wonder if I can still handle backpacking. Will I be able to adjust to a simpler way of life? Will I feel out of place among younger backpackers? Maybe not. I’ve noticed that more Britons in their late twenties and thirties want to break free from their lives and travel abroad. Jennifer Cox from Lonely Planet says that more people are realizing that adventure is possible: “People who always say, ‘I wish I had that chance’ are now understanding they can have it anytime. They just need to be brave, organized, and confident enough to do it.”
For Danny, a 30-year-old accountant, and his girlfriend Tammy, a 28-year-old teacher, this trip is a chance to enjoy life before settling down. They bought a round-the-world ticket for a year. Danny says, “I’m willing to give up job security for this trip. There’s always a worry that I won’t move up in my career when I return, but I think it’s a risk worth taking. When I left the office, I threw my calculator into the river as a sign of defiance!” 
For Matt, who just left the Army, traveling for a year was a time of change. “In the military, there’s a strict way of doing things. I needed to change that to live well as a civilian.” There are many reasons for people my age to travel, but some common factors exist. Angela Baron from the Institute of Personnel Development says, “Today, we have a more flexible workforce. Many people work on short-term contracts, so if your contract ends, you have nothing to lose.” Larger companies are even allowing career breaks. “If you’ve invested time and money in training someone, it’s good to know they’ll return instead of going to a competitor.”
Dan Hiscocks, managing director of Travellerseye, a company that shares stories of ordinary travelers, says more thirty-somethings are reevaluating their lives. “If you’re not happy with your job – and many people aren’t – it’s no longer just about sticking it out. Now people know there are opportunities, and a job isn’t forever. Travel gives a chance to reflect and think about life.” 
Is wanting to travel just another sign that my generation struggles with adulthood? Jennifer Cox doesn’t think so. “It shows a better-educated, more stable society where we care less about paying bills and more about living a balanced life. We’re taking the time to ask, ‘Is this what I want?’” Ben, a 32-year-old picture researcher going to Central America for a year, doesn’t think he’s running away. “It’s more about running towards something. I want to grab the things I want for myself.” But he does feel some fear. “I’ll miss my comfortable routine – going to the office every day, saying ‘hi’ to everyone, and having coffee.” 
I share Ben’s worries about leaving behind a stable life with few challenges, and I’m not sure I would be going on this journey if I hadn’t found my boss so difficult. As Jennifer Cox points out, “This is common. There’s often a trigger, like a breakup or losing a job, that pushes people to travel.” It may have taken a push to get me moving, but I’m now looking forward to the next 12 months with excitement. No matter what happens, I’ll be proud to have taken control of my life. I believe many of us older backpackers feel the same way."
CAE_42,C1,"Plugging in the Home**
Georgina McGuiness took a long break from journalism and felt out of touch with new technology. In this text, she shares how she changed her home into a good workplace.
The Christmas before last, I turned 37 and realized that I needed to revive my journalism career, which I thought was lost because of technology. A quick look at my resume showed that I was stuck in the 1980s, when using a typewriter was normal. I felt that only a crazy person would let me use a computer in a newsroom. Many job ads asked for experience in desktop publishing, which I didn’t have. I thought I had a better chance of hosting a seminar in nuclear physics than learning to design a page on a computer. I was the family technophobe; even calculators confused me, and I still didn’t know how to use the timer on the video. I knew I had to act quickly to improve my career.
I thought leaving home before my children would be difficult, but then I entered a competition in a local newspaper. Like a success story that happens to other people, my family and I won a computer package. We received a laptop for my husband and a personal computer for the family. We jumped into this new world, and terms like cyberspace, Internet, and surfing became part of our everyday language. We started chatting online with strangers from around the world. The children stopped watching television, and I set up a small office in the kitchen with a phone, a fax machine, a CD-ROM, and a modem to connect to the Internet. I had everything I needed to work from home while still taking the children to school. They were already good with computers from school, but I was nervous, thinking I would lose my work if I pressed the wrong button. I was wrong. Although I was not very skilled, I learned the basic skills I needed. It was all logical and easy. With practice, I learned a little more each day.
I recently started freelancing for a magazine, writing about two articles a month, and I feel proud that I have the best of both worlds. So how has the computer helped me? Since school, I have always worked at a messy desk, often losing important papers. The computer has made me more organized, especially with office tasks. Spreadsheets help me keep track of money, and ready-made invoices and letterheads save me a lot of time. For a journalist, being online means I can research stories, ask for more information in journalism forums, and discuss working from home with people worldwide.
However, there are some downsides to working from home. You can feel isolated without real human contact. There are distractions, like doing urgent chores, and when the children are home, we sometimes argue over who gets to use the computer. Still, more people are buying multi-media PCs, not just for learning and entertainment. In my neighborhood, a new type of home business is growing because people don’t have to commute to the city every day.
So, what defines home workers as we move into the next century? A report called PC Usage in UK Homes gives this profile of the modern computer user: they are 38 years old and well-educated; 93% own a personal computer, and 32% have a CD-ROM; 38% have a laser printer, and 50% have a modem. Considering this, I feel I am ahead of the game. Who knows, one day I might be emailing a column to a newspaper in Melbourne or even publishing my own magazine from home. It seems that the possibilities are endless."
CAE_59,C1,"**The Tartan Museum**
The modern buildings of Scotland's national museum look very different from the historic city of Edinburgh where it is located. But are the exhibits inside just as impressive? Sally Varlow visited the museum just before it opened.
You cannot miss it. The new Museum of Scotland stands out on the corner of Chambers Street in Edinburgh, with its large yellow sandstone tower and unique buildings, topped by a hanging garden. Last winter, people had mixed feelings about the building. Some called it a ""masterpiece"" or ""stunning,"" while others were more cautious or even negative. Now that the inside is almost ready for visitors, the exhibitions may face similar opinions.
Forget the debates about whether it tells a nation's story or if it is organized chronologically. The answer is yes; it is a rich collection of stories, each connected to important historic objects. There is a timeline to help visitors understand, but it does not limit the displays. The museum does not let its beautiful national treasures, like Mary Queen of Scots' jewels and the silver from Holyrood chapel, be overshadowed by national pride.
The main question is whether people will find the museum interesting enough to return. Dr. David Clarke, the head of exhibitions, believes that a visit should be enjoyable and visually appealing, designed for those with little prior knowledge. Despite this openness, Clarke is strict about what is displayed. He does not want to include imaginary scenes from the past, as he believes they give a false idea of history. He insists that the public deserves the truth.
At this museum, what you see is based on what experts know. However, the challenge for visitors is whether the stories of the objects can be told clearly using explanation panels, captions, and multimedia, with only about 30 computers available throughout the museum. Just days before the opening, it is still hard to tell.
Some things are clear, though, and it is not just the stunning views of Edinburgh Castle. Inside, you notice the flow of spaces. Galleries connect to each other, each with different sizes and shapes, featuring pale walls that look like large stone blocks and deep display cases. Natural light comes through narrow windows and from the roof lights, allowing visitors to appreciate every item on display.
Thanks to a 12-member Junior board made up of 9- to 12-year-olds from all over Scotland, the museum also has a Discovery Centre. The group wanted to create a way for children to interact with the displays. Dr. Clarke admits they did not get that, but they did create a special hands-on center for children in what was supposed to be a temporary exhibition gallery. As a result, the Twentieth Century gallery on the top floor is the only temporary exhibition. It will change every three years and features objects chosen by Scottish people and other notable figures that have had a significant impact on life in Scotland during the twentieth century. Suggestions included an electric guitar, televisions, thermos flasks, and favorite toys. While this idea is fun, it feels a bit light and not a serious attempt to address important issues. It may seem more meaningful when the computerized collection of personal stories and memories goes live next week.
Overall, Dr. Clarke is right when he says that ""objects open windows on the past more vividly than anything else."" As for the modern architecture, it looks great from the inside and the top, but whether it fits well in this location is another question."
CAE_54,C1,"The Future of Newspapers**
The end of print newspapers may take a long time. ""Transition"" is a nice word that means moving from one place to another. Change can be scary for some people, but it can also be a good thing. However, the change from print newspapers to online news is not easy. Many people believe that this change will happen eventually. It is well-known that sales of print newspapers are falling, while visits to their websites are increasing. For example, the print sales of The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian have dropped by 8% to 10% each year, but their websites are getting more visitors.
However, there are some things that do not fit this picture. A recent survey by the World Association of Newspapers showed that global newspaper circulation actually increased by 1.1% last year, reaching 512 million copies a day. While sales in Western countries have decreased, Asia has seen a rise in sales. News magazines, which many think would be struggling, reported a 5.4% increase in sales.
The same is true for books. E-readers like Kindle are very popular, and their sales have increased a lot this year. But when booksellers looked at the sales of physical books, they found that the value had only dropped by 0.4%. This shows that people are buying both e-books and physical books.
The idea that young people are not reading newspapers is not completely true. The latest National Readership Survey shows that nearly 5 million people aged 15 to 35 still read the main national newspapers. Different countries in Europe have different trends. In Britain, print sales have dropped by 10.8%, but in Germany, the decline is only 7%, and in France, it is just 3.1%.
Media experts in America used to think that online advertising would help newspapers succeed. However, digital advertising on newspaper websites is now decreasing. Many US newspapers have started charging for online access. The best way to attract paying readers seems to be offering both print and digital subscriptions together. This means that print newspapers are still important for selling online subscriptions. Print advertising also earns much more money than online ads.
However, maintaining both a website and a print edition is challenging and expensive for newspaper companies. Despite this, print newspapers still have a strong presence, while being noticed online is much harder."
CAE_32,C1,"Photographing People**
People are the most interesting subjects to photograph. A picture with a person in it is usually more engaging than the same picture without anyone. However, photographing people can be challenging. Besides technical skills, photographers must pay attention to actions, gestures, and expressions. Sometimes, just having a camera can change how people act.
**A. Grouping People**  
When taking group photos, avoid straight lines. Ask people to stand at different angles and distances. If possible, have some people sit or kneel in front so you can see all their faces, or take the picture from a higher viewpoint.
**B. Posing for Pictures**  
People often feel stiff in front of a camera. Help your subject relax by suggesting a comfortable position, like folding their hands or putting them in their pockets.
**C. The Right Approach**  
Do not pretend you are not taking a picture when it is obvious. This can create tension. Most people will agree to have their picture taken, even if they are hesitant at first. They may feel self-conscious, so you might need to guide them. A picture can be less interesting if the subject looks away from the camera.
**D. Eye Contact**  
A picture is more powerful if the subject looks at the viewer. Ask your subject to look into the lens, but they don’t have to smile. They might not be able to do this for long, so remind them just before you take the picture. You can also say something funny to get a natural reaction.
**E. Candid Concentration**  
Instead of looking directly at the camera, your subject can focus on something else in the picture. This can make it easier for them and allows the viewer to see what the subject is looking at. Candid shots can be very interesting, and the subject's expression is important.
**F. Expressions and Gestures**  
Expressions and gestures tell us a lot about a person in a photograph. For example, a laughing child can make viewers smile, while a sad face can create sympathy. Look for common expressions like shrugs, winks, or smiles; they are a quick way to communicate feelings.
**G. Situation Interest**  
While close-up shots of a person can be powerful, the background can add more interest. When using a background, try to avoid distracting details. Make sure the subject stands out against the background. A wide-angle lens can help make the subject look larger compared to the background.
**H. Interaction**  
Good pictures often happen when two or more people are interacting, like talking or laughing together. Couples, mothers with babies, and teams can create appealing shots. Look for moments of connection, like eye contact or a friendly gesture.
**I. People and Places**  
Many pictures of people are taken during holidays or outings to show the places they visit. To improve these pictures, use a standard or wide-angle lens and step back to include the whole background, like a building or a mountain. Ask your subjects to stand close to the camera while ensuring the background is visible. A slightly higher camera position can help achieve this balance.
**J. To Pose or Not to Pose?**  
Decide why you want to take the picture. If you want a clear photo of someone you met on holiday, ask them to pose against a nice background. Family pictures can become boring if they are all formal poses. Candid shots of events are often more lively and can capture genuine moments. A spontaneous picture can bring back memories better than a posed one."
CAE_65,C1,"Under Sarah's Spell**
Sarah Janson is a trompe-l'oeil artist. Her paintings create the illusion of reality, making them look real. In this interview with Joanna Watt, we learn more about her.
Not many artists do not sign their work unless asked, but Sarah Janson is one of them. She does not care about being seen as a genius. She believes, ""It's not the artist who is important, but the work."" Sarah is very modest and would like you to think her paintings create themselves. This makes for an interesting magazine interview. ""I just don't like to talk about myself,"" she says, and she looks worried when asked if she minds being photographed.
After a while, Sarah becomes more comfortable, and the interview turns into a fun and entertaining conversation. She has been a trompe-l'oeil artist for sixteen years. Before that, she spent two years drawing at art school, which she calls the best training for any artist. She also has a degree in graphic illustration and worked at a publishing house. However, she was not satisfied with illustration and joined a specialist decorator named Jim Smart. He asked her to create one trompe-l'oeil, and that changed everything for her. ""Suddenly my interest got focused,"" she says. She started her own business, not knowing exactly where it would lead, but she felt she was on the right path.
Sarah's skills in observation and attention to detail, developed through her illustration work, are very important for a trompe-l'oeil artist. ""People often ask me where they can learn trompe-l'oeil. But no one can teach you. Trompe-l'oeil is about life experience. It's all about observation."" She believes she is still learning. ""The moment you think you've mastered something, you might as well give up."" She is honest about her weaknesses, saying, ""I can't paint bread; it always looks like grey concrete,"" and she admits she struggles with math. When she had a big project for the ceiling of Lulworth Castle, she got confused with the measurements. ""I thought to myself, 'You're not Michelangelo. Who do you think you are?'"" 
Sarah often questions herself and does not openly acknowledge her talent. She sometimes speaks about herself in the third person: ""When I finished that ceiling, I thought, 'Well, I didn't do it; she did.'"" However, her trompe-l'oeil works are impressive. Her art is unique and stands out from others who have tried to copy the style. She has many important projects for both businesses and private clients. Much of her work is inspired by architecture. For example, she created a trompe-l'oeil dining room based on a Venetian palace and a painting that makes it look like you can enter two more rooms at the end of a hallway.
There is a risk with trompe-l'oeil art that once you understand the trick, you lose interest. Sarah knows this well. ""Trompe-l'oeil has to do two things. First, it must draw you in; it has to trick you. Second, it must hold your attention and engage your imagination. That is the most important part."" She believes that trompe-l'oeil should also be personal to the client. ""I love working with clients; that is where the ideas come from,"" she says. ""Without a good relationship, creating a trompe-l'oeil becomes difficult."" Some clients have clear ideas, while others do not, so she listens carefully to them. Many clients become friends because Sarah spends a lot of time with them while working on their projects. 
Sarah appreciates her clients. ""I am very grateful for the adventurous ones who let me work on their walls,"" she says. They seem happy with her work, which is why she is always busy, even though she tends to downplay her talent. ""I really don't like to talk about myself,"" she repeats. ""Like my work, I am very modest. I don't want it to be loud. You get tired of things that are loud."" This may be true, but you could never get tired of Sarah or her art. Her work deserves to be more widely recognized, and I am willing to take the risk of making her uncomfortable by praising her."
CAE_61,C1,"**Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success**
Daniel Goleman looks at the 'people skills' that are important for success in our jobs.
A. The rules for work are changing. We are now judged by a new standard—not just by how smart we are or by our training, but also by how well we manage ourselves and interact with others. This new standard is increasingly used to decide who gets hired and who does not, and who gets promoted and who does not. It helps to show who is likely to be a top performer and who may not do as well. These new rules are important for our future job opportunities. They are different from what we learned in school, where doing well in exams was seen as the most important thing. The new standard assumes we all have enough intelligence and skills to do our jobs. Instead, it focuses on social skills and personal qualities, such as initiative, empathy, adaptability, and persuasiveness—what we now call emotional intelligence.
B. In a time when job security is low, personal qualities are becoming more important in the workplace. For many years, these qualities were called different names, like 'character' or 'soft skills.' Now, we have a clearer understanding of these abilities, which we call 'emotional intelligence.' This is defined as the ability to understand and manage our own feelings and the feelings of others, and to use these feelings to guide our thoughts and actions. In the workplace, emotional intelligence includes self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills. Some people think it just means 'being nice,' but sometimes it requires being direct and honest, even if it is uncomfortable. Emotional intelligence is not about expressing all our feelings freely; it is about managing our feelings so we can work well together towards our goals.
C. More businesses are realizing that developing emotional intelligence skills is an important part of good management. The more complex a job is, the more emotional intelligence matters. If someone lacks these skills, it can limit their ability to use their technical knowledge. Many people have succeeded despite having low emotional intelligence, but as work becomes more complex and requires teamwork, companies that encourage collaboration have an advantage. In today’s workplace, where teamwork and customer service are key, emotional intelligence is essential for success in every job around the world.
D. While a person's IQ does not change much, emotional intelligence can grow as we go through life and learn from our experiences. Studies show that most people become better at managing their emotions, motivating themselves, and understanding others over time. This growth in emotional intelligence is often called maturity. We can learn these skills and use them to help us succeed, especially when job stability is uncertain. Emotional intelligence is not a magic solution for struggling organizations, nor does it guarantee success. However, if we ignore the human aspect, nothing else will work as well as it could."
CAE_52,C1,"'Should the media make money from content they do not own? Digital cameras and camera phones have made it easier to capture important news events, but social media has changed how we share photos. With news often breaking on social networks, some journalists are now using these platforms to find images quickly during fast-moving events. Unfortunately, some reporters have shared user-generated content (UGC) without asking for permission. Although there are guidelines that say images on social media can be used without permission in special cases or when there is strong public interest, there is still debate about whether this is right. Research shows that about one in ten people would film or take pictures of a news event, which means UGC is important for the future of the media. However, to keep a good relationship with the public, the media must ensure that people are fairly rewarded for their work and that permission is always requested.'"

**Ancient Chinese Medicine in the West?**  
Acupuncture is a practice that is over two thousand years old. It comes from traditional Chinese medicine, which also includes herbal medicine, massage, diet, and exercise. Acupuncture is used to treat many health problems, but it is most known in the West for helping with pain. Some general practitioners (GPs), midwives, and physiotherapists use it regularly for pain relief.
**A. What is it about?**  
Traditional Chinese medicine believes that health is when the energy of the mind, body, and spirit are in balance. This energy, called Qi (pronounced ""chee""), flows through the body along pathways known as meridians. There are twelve main meridians, each connected to an internal organ, and many smaller meridians that carry Qi to every cell. When the flow of Qi is blocked or weak, it can cause weakness or illness. During a visit to an acupuncturist, they will check where the Qi is unbalanced by feeling your pulse, looking at your tongue, and assessing your overall health. They will ask about your medical history, current health, mental state, and your eating and sleeping habits. An acupuncturist uses fine needles that are inserted into the skin. They may also use warmth from burning herbs or apply pressure to points on the meridians to help the flow of Qi.
**B. Over three hundred points**  
The points used in acupuncture are connected to the meridians and may not be near the area that hurts. People often feel a mild ache or tingling when the needle is gently moved. This can be done by hand or with a machine. Acupuncturists say this feeling means the needle has reached the Qi in a meridian. There are over three hundred points on the main meridians, with many more that are used less often.
**C. Science explains how it works**  
Even though many doctors do not accept the ideas of traditional Chinese medicine, they agree that acupuncture can help with pain relief. They have found scientific reasons for how it might work. For example:  
- It is thought that stimulating certain nerves can block pain signals from reaching the brain.  
- Some scientists believe that acupuncture points can release natural pain-relieving chemicals in the body called endorphins.
**D. What types of pain can be treated?**  
Many people with long-term pain try acupuncture as a last option. Commonly treated pains include back pain, sports injuries, arthritis, headaches, and pain after surgery. Acupuncturists also claim to treat menstrual pain, facial nerve pain, and pain in terminally ill patients.
**E. Modern use for an ancient treatment**  
Although acupuncture has been used in China for over 2,000 years, using it instead of anesthesia during surgery started in the 1950s. This helped convince some doctors outside China that acupuncture is more than just a mental trick. In China today, acupuncture is used in many types of surgeries, from tonsil removals to heart surgery. Needles can be used alone, with electrical stimulation, or with medication. It is said that pain is greatly reduced, but this can vary from person to person. Many people might not like the idea of being awake during surgery, but acupuncturists say that acupuncture does not have the side effects of regular anesthesia (like nausea), and recovery is faster.
**F. Always effective?**  
Like many alternative therapies, it is hard to run clinical trials for acupuncture. However, studies show that 50 to 80 percent of people find it helpful for chronic pain. Acupuncturists often report a similar success rate. They know it does not work for everyone and that people respond differently. Traditional acupuncturists say that for long-term pain, it usually takes six to seven visits to feel real relief, but some improvement can be felt after just two or three visits.
**G. A different approach to pain**  
Western and Chinese medicine view pain differently. An acupuncturist looks at the whole person, not just the specific pain. They spend time diagnosing the problem and looking for weaknesses in the Qi. They also consider outside factors that may cause pain, such as weather conditions. They ask questions about the type of pain, like whether it feels sharp, dull, or constant. These details help them decide how to treat the pain, which is not something most doctors would consider.
**H. Traditional or not?**  
Some medical professionals have training in traditional acupuncture, while others, including many GPs, prefer scientific explanations. However, many traditional acupuncturists believe that using traditional Chinese medicine is necessary for deep healing, which is hard to measure in studies. It is important to choose a qualified acupuncturist, who should refer you to a medical doctor if needed."

P.D. James is a well-known crime writer. Her full name is Phyllis Dorothy James. She has a calm and confident presence, which makes it easy to imagine her as a headmistress of a girls' school if she had not become a writer. However, she is actually quite shy. She admits that her main character, Adam Dalgliesh, the detective in her books, is based on herself, or how she might have been if she were a man. Dalgliesh likes to solve crimes alone, just like P.D. James prefers to write alone. She needs privacy to write and can do it anywhere as long as she is alone.
P.D. James is modest and does not agree that she is the best-known crime writer in Britain, even though millions of people read her 12 major detective novels. She is a fan of her friend Ruth Rendell's books, especially those written under the name Barbara Vine. The books she enjoys most are often by women writers like Iris Murdoch, Anita Brookner, and Penelope Lively, but she also likes male authors such as Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh, whom she thinks were great novelists.
P.D. James found success later in life. She was 42 when her first crime novel, *Cover Her Face*, was published. She was born in Oxford and grew up in Cambridge. She met her husband there, who was a university student. She chose Cambridge as the setting for her book *An Unsuitable Job For A Woman*. 
Her life has had its challenges. Her husband, Connor Bantry White, returned from World War II very sick. She had to work long hours to support him and their two daughters, Clare and Jane. Although she had many ideas for stories, she did not have time to write. Her husband’s parents helped take care of the children during those tough years.
While working full-time for the National Health Service, she used her strong organizational skills. She managed five psychiatric clinics and then worked for 11 years at the Home Office, first in the Police Department and then in the Criminal Law section. While working in forensic science, she became used to seeing dead bodies, but she was not interested in death itself. Instead, she liked the structure of writing a crime novel. She has always enjoyed reading detective stories and wanted to be a writer.
P.D. James did not want to write about her own life experiences. She thought writing detective stories was a good way to learn how to be a serious novelist. She realized that it was possible to follow the traditional rules of a detective story and still write a meaningful novel about people. She believes that writing detective stories helps to bring order to chaos. Solving a crime shows that life is valuable, even if that life is not perfect. She thinks that nobody really likes violence."

**The Pen is Mightier than the Psychoanalyst**
The study of handwriting to understand a person's character is becoming more popular. In some countries, if you apply for a job, you will likely be asked to provide a sample of your handwriting. This handwriting sample can help decide if you are suitable for the job. Handwriting analysis, also known as graphology, is considered a real science in many places. Researchers believe it can help identify certain health issues, like heart disease and cancer, and can show psychological states and emotional problems. 
More companies are using handwriting analysis for job guidance and during interviews. Many large companies now hire graphologists to analyze the handwriting of job candidates. However, many doctors and psychiatrists are not convinced about the value of graphology. Patricia Marne, a professional graphologist for over 20 years, argues that they should take it more seriously. She believes handwriting can show psychological traits and some medical conditions. She says, ""Handwriting is a strong indicator of social class and intelligence. It can also help determine if a person should focus on arts or sciences and whether they have a manipulative or open character.""
According to Ms. Marne, graphology can help assess possible criminal behavior: ""Criminals often have disturbed handwriting, which is usually poorly shaped. Many criminals come from difficult backgrounds and have emotional issues. This can show in childish handwriting and in writing letters multiple times."" 
Ms. Marne claims she can tell if people are honest, manipulative, or reliable employees. She notes that young male offenders often have very high letters, which suggests they live in a fantasy world and dream of success. Graphologists can also predict if someone might become violent, if the writer is under a lot of stress, or if they have psychopathic traits. Handwriting can even help predict potential suicides. 
She explains that heart and lung problems can also be seen in handwriting. ""You cannot make a diagnosis from just one sample unless the writing is clearly shaky or disturbed. But if the handwriting changes over time or becomes disconnected, it could mean something serious has happened."" A major emotional upset can also change a person's signature temporarily.
Ms. Marne says handwriting can reveal other psychological traits. For example, people whose letters connect in 'threads' may be clever but manipulative. Those who write mostly in capital letters may be hiding their true selves. Very light pressure in writing shows sensitivity and low energy. Original handwriting, which differs from standard writing, shows confidence and creativity. Disconnected writing often indicates a person who is a loner. Very small signatures suggest insecurity, while circles over the letter 'i' show a need for attention. Crossing the 't' heavily can indicate intolerance and a condescending attitude.
Ms. Marne believes it takes six years of study and experience to analyze handwriting accurately, along with empathy and intuition. She thinks more research is needed to support graphology scientifically. She believes this will happen soon. ""It is actually more accurate than psychoanalysis because you can learn a person's entire history, including their emotional struggles, without asking them questions that they might answer incorrectly.""
Despite how interesting this may sound, there is little strong evidence to support these claims. Some psychiatrists are very critical of them. They argue that handwriting is influenced by education, artistic skill, and the type of writing taught, and does not have any other meaning."

**Is your office working well?** Fresh air and good chairs are important for a happy and healthy workplace, according to a new survey. We visited four different offices to see how healthy and happy they were as work environments. Our expert panel included a building health consultant, an ergonomist (who studies working conditions), and an occupational psychologist. Here are their opinions.
**Office A: Advertising Agency**  
**Building Health Consultant:** This office is very simple; it has no central heating or mechanical ventilation, and the windows open directly to the street. It is surprising that this space works, but the small team of seven people seems happy. They adapt to the seasons by opening doors and roof panels or using electric heaters, just like at home. This may be the key: they have created a comfortable working environment without too many rules.  
**Ergonomist:** The furniture here is mismatched and creates bad sitting positions. The chairs are old, most are not adjustable, and many are broken. However, the staff has a varied work schedule, which they control, including office work, client meetings, and presentations. This variety helps reduce fatigue and boredom.  
**Occupational Psychologist:** The staff enjoys the variety of work and the office space. They say it is 'just the right size'—small enough to know what colleagues are doing, but large enough to focus on personal work. I found the office attractive and fun, showing both efficiency and creativity.
**Office B: News Service**  
**Building Health Consultant:** This office may not be very exciting, but it is comfortable and the staff does not dislike it. The air quality and maintenance are good, helped by a No Smoking policy.  
**Ergonomist:** The company has hired an ergonomist, so the chairs are excellent, and the lighting and computer equipment are good. The space is well-organized, but the layout could be better. However, the environment feels impersonal, with grey, bare walls.  
**Occupational Psychologist:** The walls are mostly bare, except for year planners and a poster about maternity rights. Most staff have worked there for at least five years, and relationships are good. The office could improve if the desks were arranged to make sharing information easier. Success stories or project information could be displayed on the walls.
**Office C: Bank**  
**Building Health Consultant:** This office gets mixed reactions from the staff. It feels like being in a glass case, where people can see and be seen. Despite having both smokers and non-smokers in a small space, the air does not feel stale.  
**Ergonomist:** The office is very standard and uninspiring. The desks are just okay, and not all chairs meet the requirements for computer work, but this is the choice of the users. Computer screens are often on low desks, which is not suitable for modern equipment.  
**Occupational Psychologist:** The staff supports each other and uses technology well. Many awards for communication are displayed. The wood paneling and brown carpet make the office feel a bit serious, but it is busy with activity.
**Office D: Newspaper**  
**Building Health Consultant:** There is not much good to say about this building. The air conditioning is poor, causing big temperature changes. The space is cluttered, and most people do not have enough desk space. The office is very dusty, with many places for dust to collect.  
**Ergonomist:** The furniture looks more like it belongs in a workshop than in a modern office. Many chairs are not good for people using computers, especially those shorter than 1.75 m. Most chairs are old, do not adjust well, and have armrests that make it hard to get close to the desk.  
**Occupational Psychologist:** The office has old brown chairs, dirty carpets, and dust everywhere. There is a lot of room for improvement—the place needs cleaning, individual achievements should be recognized more, and the air conditioning needs to be fixed because there are many smokers. When we visited, there were few conversations; everyone seemed stressed and focused on deadlines. The company should encourage teamwork."
CAE_38,C1,"**Chewing Gum Culture**
Chewing gum is popular, affordable, and Americans chew 12 million sticks of it every day. This text explores how an old tradition became a big business. Chewing gum has fewer than ten calories per stick, but it is considered food and must meet the standards of the American Food and Drug Administration.
Today, most gum is made from synthetic materials, with added pine resins and softeners that help keep the flavor and improve the texture. However, this was not always true. The ancient Greeks chewed a gum-like resin from the bark of the mastic tree, which grows mainly in Greece and Turkey. Greek women especially liked mastic gum to clean their teeth and freshen their breath. American colonists learned from the Native Americans in New England and chewed the resin from spruce trees when the bark was cut. In the early 1800s, lumps of spruce for chewing were sold in the eastern United States, making it the first commercial chewing gum in the country.
Modern chewing gum began in the late 1860s with the discovery of chicle, a milky substance from the sapodilla tree found in Central America. Gum made from chicle was smoother, more enjoyable, and more elastic to chew, leading to the growth of a whole industry. However, attempts to grow sapodilla trees commercially have not been successful. As the chewing gum market has expanded, synthetic alternatives have been created.
Today, the few remaining chicle gatherers, known as chicleros, struggle to make a living. They trek for miles to collect sapodilla in very humid conditions. The environment is dangerous, with poisonous snakes and many insects. One of the most concerning is the chicle fly, which lays its eggs in the ears and nose of the gatherers. Despite these dangers, experienced chicleros can climb a mature tree quickly to cut a path in the bark for the white sap to flow into a bag below. They must carry the liquid back to a camp, where it is boiled until it becomes sticky and is made into bricks.
Life at the camp is also difficult, with a boring and often unhealthy diet based on maize, along with a local alcohol made from sugar cane. Even though this work is hard, chicleros worry about their jobs. Not long ago, the United States imported 7,000 tonnes of chicle each year from Central America. Last year, only 200 tonnes were collected in the entire Yucatan peninsula of Mexico.
As chewing gum sales have increased, manufacturers have turned to synthetic materials to lower costs and meet demand. Meanwhile, gum producers are finding clever ways to market their products. They claim that gum helps you relax, boosts your energy, and reduces stress (soldiers in both world wars were often given gum). The most important claim is that it helps reduce tooth decay. Plaque acid, which forms when we eat, causes tooth decay. Our saliva helps neutralize this acid and provides minerals like calcium, phosphate, and fluoride, which protect our teeth. Gum manufacturers say that chewing for 20 minutes can increase saliva flow.
Research continues on new textures and flavors. Glycerine and other vegetable oils are now used to mix the gum base. Most new flavors are artificial, but some still require natural ingredients. Additionally, 137 square kilometers of land in America is used to grow mint for the two most popular chewing gums in the world."

A. **INDIA: GHANERAO HOTEL, RAJASTHAN**  
Ghanerao Hotel is located at the edge of the Aravalli Hills in a small village known for its craftsmen. It combines the calm of an English country house with Indian culture. The Ghanerao family has lived here for 400 years, and now Sajjan Singh and his wife welcome guests into their home. The facilities are basic, with hot water provided by bucket, but this simplicity adds to the hotel's charm.
B. **NEW ZEALAND: HERMITAGE HOTEL, MOUNT COOK**  
One of my favorite hotels is the Hermitage Hotel on New Zealand's South Island. I found it by chance while climbing. After being flown close to the top of a glacier and climbing to the peak, we walked down. When we reached the bottom, I was surprised to find this hotel in a stunningly beautiful and wild area. It was amazing to go from the tough mountain climb to a luxurious hotel with a pianist playing Cole Porter.
C. **MAURITIUS: PARADIS HOTEL**  
On the south-west of Mauritius, the Paradis Hotel is located on a quiet peninsula. The road to the hotel goes along the coast past empty beaches where only fishermen are present. The hotel is large and offers many free water sports, but you can easily find peace along nine kilometers of private beach. If you swim a little way out into the Indian Ocean, you can hardly see the hotel for the palm trees. In the evening, when everyone has left, you can sit on the beach and feel far away from everything.
D. **ST LUCIA: LADERA HOTEL**  
The Ladera Hotel in St Lucia has one of the most beautiful views in the Caribbean. It is quiet and located at 1,000 feet above sea level, with open rooms that look out between the twin peaks of the Pitons to the Caribbean Sea. The hotel has a colonial style, with mahogany furniture and four-poster beds covered with muslin netting.
E. **TURKEY: THE SPLENDID HOTEL, ISTANBUL**  
The Splendid Hotel, located on Buyukada in the Princes Islands, is a great place to escape the noise of Istanbul. The islands are just an hour away by boat and are very peaceful. There are no cars, only horse-drawn carriages and beautiful wooden buildings. The Splendid Hotel is all made of wood, painted white with red domes, and is inspired by a hotel from the French Riviera. Although it is a bit old now, it still has a lot of charm.
F. **FRANCE: CHATEAU D'ETOGES, EPERNAY**  
In the small village of Etoges, in the Champagne region, there is a lovely seventeenth-century chateau. Surrounded by a moat with two swans, this chateau has 20 unique rooms, some with four-poster beds, and one even has a billiard table. They offer special weekend rates for two nights that include breakfast, dinner, and complimentary champagne.
G. **KENYA: THE FAIRVIEW HOTEL, NAIROBI**  
The Fairview Hotel is a comfortable place in Africa that does not have flashy luxury. It is a popular stop for travelers resting after a safari and planning their next adventure. Guests often arrive, see the beautiful gardens and rooms, and decide to stay for a week. There are even apartments for those who want to stay for a few months. The hotel is set on Nairobi Hill, away from the busy city center, making it a great place to enjoy the African sunset while sipping beer and looking forward to a hearty dinner.
H. **ITALY: HOTEL SPLENDIDO, PORTOFINO**  
The Duke of Windsor was the first to sign the guestbook at Hotel Splendido. Since then, many famous people have visited, including Lauren Bacall and Humphrey Bogart. Today, you might meet a billionaire or a wealthy heiress. This old monastery turned villa turned hotel is still splendid, with simple but delicious food in the restaurant and beautiful Persian rugs."

Sue Brown is a hotel inspector. Christopher Middleton watched her during an inspection. Just one minute into the inspection, things are already going wrong for the Globe Hotel, but the staff do not know it yet. The receptionist is busy talking on the phone to a potential guest and does not notice Sue and Christopher. ""She hasn't even acknowledged us,"" Sue whispers. ""Very poor."" This is a common mistake that Sue has seen many times in her 11 years as an inspector. ""But this isn't just any three-star hotel,"" she says. ""It has three red stars, and I expect better."" Having red stars means the Globe is among the top 130 hotels out of 4,000 in the guide published by Sue's organization.
Before they even enter, Sue feels uneasy. The entrance from the car park is through a door with no staff, just a buzzer, and a long, empty corridor leads to the hotel. ""This is not what I expected,"" Sue says. Things get worse when the receptionist says, ""We have no record of your booking,"" in a cheerful voice. It turns out that most of the hotel's 15 rooms are empty that night. One room is on the top floor, but Sue does not like it. It feels stuffy, and there is a big hole in the wall behind the wardrobe.
When Sue started her career, people called her ""The Woman in Black,"" even though she never wore black and did not think she was tough. The next morning, after paying her bill, she reveals her identity to the hotel’s manager, Robin Greaves. He looks scared when he sees her. He quickly apologizes for a bad smell in the main lounge, saying, ""We think there’s a blocked drain."" Sue suggests that he should guide guests to another lounge instead of the one with the smell. Greaves nods and takes notes. He has only been at the Globe for five months and seems unsure about Sue's advice.
Not everything is negative. Sue praises Emma, the assistant manager, and Trudy, the young waitress, who shared interesting information about the hotel’s 400-year history. The dinner also meets the hotel’s two-rosette food rating, which makes Greaves hopeful. ""What do we need to do to get three rosettes?"" he asks. Sue replies, ""Don’t serve a pudding that collapses."" Greaves looks disappointed.
Sue's job is to say what many customers do not have the courage to say. ""Sometimes it can be very sensitive,"" she explains. Once, a woman complained that Sue got her son fired. Sue could only say the truth: he served her apple pie with his fingers. She often receives angry letters with false claims about her. ""You get used to it, but it still hurts,"" she says.
Sue must tell the hotel owner her findings verbally and also send a full written report. The hotels pay for her services. However, being recognized with red stars makes it worth it. Greaves is relieved to hear that Sue will not recommend taking away the Globe's red stars. The bad news is that another inspector will return in the next two months to check if the problems have been fixed. ""Good,"" Greaves says with a forced smile. ""We’ll look forward to that."""

Doug Scott, a mountaineer, shares his experiences of climbing the highest mountains on each continent, known as the Seven Summits. He started this journey later in life and will describe each mountain in the order he climbed them.
A. **Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)**  
While climbing Mt. Everest, Doug and his partner, Dougal Haston, were in a snow cave below the summit. Dougal started talking about sleeping bags, which Doug found odd since they were alone. He thought it was due to low oxygen levels. Doug began to talk to his own feet, feeling the cold. He remembered other climbers who lost fingers and toes to frostbite. They were not just worried about surviving but also about how well they would survive. Over the next two days, Doug thought about their time on the summit ridge and felt confident climbing with Dougal. He focused on finding a better rhythm to reach the summit.
B. **Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)**  
Mt. McKinley is known as a very dangerous mountain. In April 1976, Doug and Dougal arrived at the Kahiltna Glacier and spent four days carrying equipment and food to the base. After the first day of climbing, they realized how difficult their task was. They followed a route from 1967 but decided to take a new route to the summit. They climbed with all their gear on their backs, which was a new way to climb this mountain. After three days, Doug's sleeping bag was wet, and they were both suffering. The low air pressure made it feel like they were higher than they actually were. Finally, they reached the summit and felt victorious.
C. **Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m)**  
In September 1976, Doug and his friend Paul Braithwaite flew to Nairobi to climb Mt. Kenya. However, they ended up climbing Kilimanjaro instead. They got lost in the jungles on the lower slopes, which was serious because water was hard to find. On the second day, they found arrows painted on trees and a trail of trash that led them to a rock pool. They were happy to find trash on the mountain. They tried to climb a steep wall but decided to take a safer route to the summit.
D. **Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)**  
In January 1992, Doug and his wife, Sharu, arrived at Punta del Inca to climb Aconcagua. They met a guide named Phil who suggested they join his group to climb a less crowded route. After waiting for bad weather to pass, they left base camp. The Polish Glacier was icy and dangerous, so they chose to take the standard route instead. The wind was strong as they walked to the summit, and they camped outside a refuge that night. At base camp, they met a group planning to climb the Seven Summits, and Doug realized he wanted to do the same.
E. **Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)**  
Doug learned that climbing Vinson Massif could be funded by guiding others. In November 1992, his team traveled to the South Pole. During this time, the sun stays above the horizon all day and night. On December 7, they set off for the summit. Despite strong winds and very low temperatures, they all reached the top in eight hours. However, they could only see a few meters due to a storm.
F. **Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)**  
In the summer of 1994, Doug's team gathered in St. Petersburg. After arriving at Terskol, they had to pay a fee to their guide for bringing foreigners into the area. After a few days of getting used to the altitude, they took a cable car up to 3,900m and then walked to a refuge at 4,200m. Two days later, they faced strong winds as they climbed. They thought they reached the summit but found there was still more to climb. They returned to the refuge and then descended the volcano.
G. **Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)**  
On their expedition to Carstensz, Doug and his team wanted to create a new climbing route and spend time with the local Dani people. They were warned about possible dangers from bandits but decided to continue. On May 12, the weather improved, and two team members climbed ahead while Doug and Sham took their time. They reached the summit by 11 am, and Doug received a standing ovation for completing his seventh summit. Mission accomplished!"
