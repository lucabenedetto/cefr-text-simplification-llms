CPE_15,"**Simplified Text: 'Garbage in, garbage out'**

Charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems like a good idea for the environment and the economy. However, it may not be. One common practice in many developed countries is municipal refuse collection: at regular times, rubbish bags or bins are taken away by a special truck to a local dump. Economists find this practice strange because, in most places, it is free. Households pay for this service through local taxes, but a family that produces a lot of rubbish pays the same as an elderly couple that produces very little. However, the cost of rubbish disposal is not zero. The more rubbish people throw away, the more rubbish collectors and trucks are needed, and the more local authorities have to pay for landfill and dumping fees. This creates a basic economic problem: if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. 

A possible solution is to make households pay for the disposal of their waste. This would encourage them to throw away less and recycle more, assuming local governments provide places to collect recyclable materials. However, as economists Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman discovered, what seems like a logical solution can lead to complicated and sometimes disappointing results. Their research looked at several American towns and cities that have started charging households for rubbish. The most common system is to sell stickers or tags that residents attach to their rubbish bags or cans. Only bags with these labels are picked up during the weekly collection.

In a paper published last year, Fullerton and Kinnaman studied a scheme introduced in July 1992 in Charlottesville, Virginia, a town of about 40,000 people. Residents were charged 80 cents for each tagged bag of rubbish. This may seem like a good use of market forces. However, the authors found that the benefits of the scheme did not cover the costs of printing materials, paying sellers, and the wages of the people running the program. While the number of bags or cans collected fell sharply by 37%, this was mainly due to a behavior called the 'Seattle stomp,' where people crammed more garbage into each container, sometimes jumping on it to fit more in. This method is less effective than using machines at landfill sites. The weight of rubbish collected, which is a better measure of disposal costs than volume, fell by only 14% in Charlottesville. In 25 other Virginian cities without a pricing scheme, the weight of rubbish also fell by 3.5%.

Worse still, some people chose to dump their rubbish illegally instead of paying for collection. Although this is hard to measure, the authors estimate that illegal dumping may account for 30-40% of the reduction in collected rubbish. A positive outcome from this experience was a 15% increase in the weight of materials recycled, suggesting that people preferred to recycle (which is free) rather than pay for rubbish removal. However, this increase in recycling may not be directly related to the fee, as many residents were already part of Charlottesville's voluntary recycling program.

In a more recent study, Fullerton and Kinnaman looked at the economics of rubbish in more detail. One conclusion from this broader study is that pricing does reduce the weight of rubbish, but not significantly. On average, a 10% increase in sticker prices only reduces rubbish quantity by 0.3%. This figure is lower than in other studies covering fewer towns. To significantly reduce rubbish output, people would need to buy less of almost everything. A small tax on garbage is unlikely to make a big difference. If this is true, it is important to consider whether other factors, such as income and education, are just as important as price. For example, in wealthier towns, people tend to throw out more rubbish and have less time for recycling.

Should we conclude that charging households for rubbish is a bad idea? Not necessarily; free disposal is likely too cheap. However, the effects of seemingly simple policies can be complex. Detailed economic models are often needed to understand them, and sometimes the results are not pleasant."

Theodore Zeldin explores how our work life might change. Do you feel respected and valued in your job? Success in a career is not enough anymore. Many professions feel they are not appreciated or understood, and even famous individuals often feel unhappy despite their success. Loving your job used to be enough to be part of a lucky few, but now you must consider how your job affects you as a person, your mind, character, and relationships. This question is very important. No matter how skilled you are, if your work makes you boring or unable to connect with others outside your field, then no amount of status or money can make up for that. 

I am trying to find ways for work to focus on personal fulfillment instead of just serving industrial needs. Work should not only create wealth but also provide a meaningful way of living, helping us discover new talents and connect with more people. However, this change will not eliminate unemployment. As more people get educated, they want jobs that are interesting and meaningful. A lifetime of work should be seen as a work of art, with the fulfilled individual at its center. 

Even middle-class jobs, like those of doctors and accountants, are not as appealing as they used to be. Doctors often feel more stressed than their patients, and accountants worry about their profession's ethics. Many architects do not get to use their creativity, and administrators are stuck in their own bureaucracy. Middle managers, who once felt proud of their status, are losing their confidence. Meanwhile, companies and public institutions are getting smaller. Efforts to improve decision-making and rewards have not succeeded in gaining employee commitment. In Britain, only 8% of employees feel their values match those of their organizations.

I have started to investigate different jobs to see how they shape or harm people. I have looked at what humans can achieve in various cultures and how courage can be developed. I have focused on important issues like happiness, love, friendship, and respect. Now, I am looking for better ways to earn a living. Many experts work to increase the profits of companies, but we also need to examine ourselves as human beings and think about the kind of people we want to be around.

How many of us feel truly alive at work? How many of us are like part-time slaves, feeling we have the option to leave our boring jobs but are really trapped by our qualifications and careers? For example, hotel workers make up 10% of the workforce. Many intelligent and lively people endure low pay and long hours because the idea of a hotel has not changed much since the days of the Ritz. A hotel is not just a place for travelers to sleep; it is a small version of the United Nations. People from all over the world meet in hotels, but they often do not interact. Many hotel staff are foreigners eager to learn a new language and culture, yet they have only superficial relationships with guests.

Hotels could be cultural centers, connecting guests with the city and each other. Hotel owners could use the knowledge of their many student employees instead of assigning them only simple tasks. If they paid attention to their staff's true ambitions, they would see many other services hotels could offer. However, they are often limited by accountants who say companies should focus on one main activity to maximize profits. 

It is time to rethink what this means from a human perspective, not just a financial one. For me, work is about relationships. Many people today want more than just obedience at work; they want to express their independence and personality. They should be allowed to design their own jobs and choose their colleagues and customers, within practical limits. This requires the ability to communicate across different professional languages and connect with people who may seem very different at first.

Everyone understands the importance of communication, but true conversation is different. Traditional conversation is not the same as the new kind of conversation that people feel is missing today. This new conversation is more personal and creates a bond of respect between people, allowing for a deeper understanding of each other. It is more than just relaxation; it is a powerful way to establish equality. Every meaningful conversation changes the world, even if just a little."
CPE_24,"**Text: 'BROADCASTING: The Social Shaping of a Technology'**

The term 'broadcasting' originally referred to the act of spreading seeds widely by hand. This idea is not just about farming; it also represents a hopeful view of modern progress. It suggests planned growth that can lead to a fruitful outcome if conditions are favorable. The metaphor implies that there are central resources available for spreading and reproducing this growth.

We need to explore why a new technology that sends words and images electronically was organized in a way that fits this farming metaphor. Although television is linked to two-way communication methods like the telegraph and telephone, it was designed from the beginning as a centralized 'mass' medium. This means that it transmitted content from a central source to private homes, which matched the social and economic structures of modern societies.

There were attempts to create different forms of television, but these remained just experiments. Two lesser-known alternatives are worth mentioning because they show what television could have been in a different social setting. In the early 1930s, radio enthusiasts in Britain experimented with two-way television as a possible replacement for regular telephones. Popular science magazines like Radio News published articles on how to build television transmitters and receivers, and many amateur experimenters were active across the country. However, in 1938, the British Radio Manufacturers Association established standards for television equipment and channel regulations, which pushed these grassroots innovators out of the picture. This marked the end of a potential counter-cultural development of television as a widely accessible and egalitarian form of communication.

Broadcasting was closely linked to strong economic interests and the fundamental structures of modern societies. Despite the efforts of TV amateurs, television was mainly a medium for public entertainment in the USA during the early 1930s and was seen as a competitor to the film industry. In fact, throughout the 1930s, most people experienced television in public settings, especially in Britain and Germany.

The idea of grassroots or amateur two-way television was unlikely to succeed, while systems based on collective public viewing were operating in several countries during the 1930s. These systems could have posed a greater challenge to the domestic use of television, but this threat did not materialize. Manufacturers recognized the potential for mass sales of home television sets once prices dropped. Given the division between public and private life in modern society, centralized broadcasting to a wide domestic audience was the most effective way to organize the medium.

As working-class people improved their living standards and joined consumer society from the 1920s onward, the dream of the home as a center for entertainment and cultural experiences became a reality for many in Western countries. This trend is now happening globally. There is a clear link between social modernization and the structures of broadcasting. While social and economic changes led to more centralization of power and capital, the breakdown of traditional communities created new lifestyles. People became more mobile, both socially and geographically, which often left them feeling isolated compared to those in more stable early communities.

Centralized broadcasting addressed the need for governments to efficiently inform all citizens and helped create a unifying 'imagined community' of the nation-state. The widespread nature of these processes made broadcasting the dominant form for both radio and television. However, it is important to also consider the positive view of broadcasting as a tool for democracy. During the period between the World Wars, many countries recognized broadcasting as a way to ensure equal access to resources necessary for informed participation in political, social, and cultural life.

Television is evolving, and there is a risk that the term broadcasting may become outdated or insufficient. If this happens, the metaphor will only refer to a specific organization of audio-visual technology during a certain centralized phase of social modernization."
CPE_13,"**Text: Clutter**

Sometimes, it feels like no matter how many things you own, you never feel secure. It is normal to want a comfortable home that meets your needs, but there comes a point when the desire to acquire more possessions becomes excessive. Modern advertising is designed to exploit our insecurities. A common message we receive is that if you don’t have certain items, you are somehow less valuable. To see how much advertising influences you, try not to read any billboards the next time you walk down the street. These expensive messages constantly shape our thoughts in persuasive ways, often without us realizing it. We are surrounded by them—on television, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, t-shirts, and the internet—all encouraging us to buy more.

**Caves**

Research institutions and universities around the world have spent years studying caves, focusing mainly on their origins, water systems, and living organisms. Caves are a small but intriguing part of the natural world, sparking our curiosity and desire for knowledge. Because they are natural features, they have been studied for a long time, especially in areas where caves impact our lives. However, visiting many caves requires physical skill, which means that cave research often involves both professional scientists and amateur explorers who visit caves for fun.

**Weather Watch**

Many observant people, using only their senses, laid the groundwork for meteorology, which has evolved since the 17th century into a complex science. Today, satellites and electronic devices provide us with quick weather information, and computers can solve complicated calculations much faster than humans. Meteorological terms can be difficult for non-professionals to understand. However, human experience remains essential in turning data into weather forecasts. Personal observations can still offer valuable insights that help professionals understand the mysteries of the atmosphere."
CPE_16,"**MUSIC AND THEATRE**

Until recently, I believed that opera was mainly theatre. However, after working at a national opera house, I realized that opera is primarily about music, with theatre being secondary. This makes sense, but I come from a theatrical background, where the words and the actors are the most important. In theatre, there is no one directing the action once it starts, and performers and audiences usually share a common language.

At any musical performance, whether in a concert hall or an opera house, there are often many people, like me, who do not have a deep understanding of music. Some may feel embarrassed about their lack of knowledge, while most are simply amazed by the performers' skills. A talented singer or a great string section is easy to admire. Even a decent musician shows the results of years of hard work. Watching top-class music is similar to watching athletes; we know they are doing something we can relate to, but we also see how much better they are than us.

In contrast, theatre audiences have different expectations. They often do not fully appreciate an actor's skill and may not be impressed by a long, difficult speech, even though actors frequently get asked how they memorize their lines. This does not mean that theatre audiences are less demanding than concert-goers; in fact, many are the same people. However, audiences and performers seem to connect more equally in theatre, regardless of how challenging the material is.

The question is whether music can learn from theatre about this relationship. I believe it can, as I have seen how a different approach can enhance the experience for concert-goers. Live music is inherently theatrical, filled with emotion, humor, and intimacy. It can also be unpredictable, engaging the audience's imagination both individually and collectively. 

The traditional ways of presenting music, such as strict dress codes and excessive respect for conductors and soloists, create a clear divide between performers and listeners, which can feel uncomfortable. On the other hand, contemporary music audiences sometimes interrupt performances with applause between movements or after impressive pieces. While this shows appreciation, it can disrupt the overall flow of the work.

Is there a solution? Yes, a lot is being done to attract new audiences to concert halls and opera houses and to break down barriers that make people feel that ""serious"" music is not for them. I remember a remarkable event, the community opera *In Search of Angels*, which took place in various locations within a cathedral and the surrounding town. It was a powerful musical experience where the skills and generosity of the musicians were central, and it changed many audience members' lives, as they were not just there to watch and listen but also to participate.

What I wish for in music is a bit more of the risk and creativity that the best theatre can show. This can come from using unusual or challenging locations that disrupt normal expectations, creating surprising effects for both performers and audiences. While some plays are presented in a conventional way, similar to concerts, I believe that music experiences can and should change.

I can only speak as an enthusiast: I love theatre and spend as much time and money as I can enjoying music. I want both to thrive and for more people to experience the joy I find in being part of the audience."

**Sand**  
While I appreciate sand's amazing ability to be turned into useful items like glass and concrete, I am not a big fan of it in its natural form. To me, it is mainly an annoying barrier between a seaside parking lot and the water. It blows into your face, gets into your food, and can swallow important items like car keys and coins. When you are wet, it sticks to you like glue and is hard to remove, even with a strong hose. However, the strange thing is that as soon as you step onto a beach towel, get into a car, or walk on a recently cleaned carpet, it falls off you easily. For days after, you find small amounts of it on the floor every time you take off your shoes, and you spread even more when you take off your socks. Sand stays with you longer than many illnesses. So, as far as I’m concerned, you can keep the sand.

**Lock and Key**  
The search for a safe home, privacy, and security has existed since humans first built permanent homes. The simple wooden beam behind the door has changed to an electronic lock that uses a plastic card with many combinations. However, the desire to keep out intruders remains. The appeal of a lock and key is partly psychological. Recently, some companies have tried computerized locking systems, where smart cards control electronic locks. But people do not like them. You might accept them at work, but at home, everyone wants the comfort of using a physical key. Therefore, when one locksmith company created a new electronic system, they made sure to include a real metal key.

**Modern Art**  
I was nervous about visiting the new Tate Modern gallery because, like many people, I find modern art confusing. I know I like some of it, especially furry items, neon light sculptures, and large photographs. Maybe if I knew more about it, I would have stronger opinions. However, you are not supposed to approach it like a school essay. The goal is not to fully understand art, but to let it speak to you. This is a great idea, but it has never worked for me. However, this new gallery has tried to give visitors real insight into the reasons behind the artworks. The first thing I noticed was the labels, which provided context and explained what the art was trying to convey. Instead of staring blankly at the pieces as I used to, these helpful pieces of information allowed me to understand better."
CPE_46,"**Every Picture Tells a Story**

**Adapting Novels for Film**

Turning novels into films often means reducing, condensing, and removing parts of the story. This can be frustrating for writers, but it can also be enlightening. While working on a script, I realized that I could cut much of the dialogue and description from a scene in the novel and still convey the same message. This does not mean that the original dialogue and descriptions were unnecessary. It relates to how each medium engages the audience and the type of repetition each uses. 

In this context, ""redundancy"" refers to the repeated mention of character traits and speech tags like ""he said."" A character's trait only needs to be described once, but reminding the audience helps with understanding. Usually, we can tell who is speaking in a dialogue scene from the content and layout, but speech tags make it easier to read. 

Stage drama, which mainly consists of dialogue, mimics real speech with varying levels of style. In some modern plays, this can go to an extreme, making the dialogue seem almost entirely repetitive, serving only to connect the speakers without clearly communicating anything.

**Watching Movies**

When watching movies, people can feel as if they are part of the film's world. This experience allows them to escape from reality, at least for the duration of the movie. However, once the lights come on, this illusion is quickly broken, and they return to the real world. People often do not feel responsible for the time spent in the film's world, and this unreality can prevent them from taking the film seriously. 

In the past, many people, including our parents and teachers, did not see movies as art but rather as ""mere entertainment."" They enjoyed being entertained but did not value films as an art form.

**The Film Studios**

The Leiper Film Company studios were a collection of many different buildings. The layout was confusing and unclear. There were a few permanent landmarks, like the Script Department, but most of the place consisted of small, similarly furnished rooms used for meetings. These rooms could only be identified by a strange system of letters and numbers, making it difficult to find any specific one.

The studio lacked a clear focus. There were three main entrances, all equally basic, with no clear way to ask for directions. For a stranger, it was very confusing. However, there were not many strangers around, as the organization did not encourage outsiders. It was assumed that employees could navigate the studio without help. Through their combined efforts, romance and adventure would reach audiences everywhere. Couples like Jane and George, or Sally and Dick, could escape their everyday lives for at least three hours, thanks to the studio's work.

**Film-Makers**

It seems that almost everyone wants to make a movie. Bookstores are filled with ""how-to"" books on scriptwriting and film production. Many universities offer courses, and there are competitions that provide equipment like the handheld camera used by Robert Rodriguez to make his film *El Mariachi*, which cost $7,000 and launched him into the spotlight of American independent directors. Rodriguez's dreams came true ahead of schedule. 

He recalls his 23rd birthday in his book about his *Mariachi* experiences, writing: ""Orson Welles made *Citizen Kane* when he was 25. Spielberg made *Jaws* at 26. So I've only got two or three years to make my breakthrough film."" 

This was not always the case. In the past, when studios were in control, filmmakers were expected to take their time to develop their skills. They often worked behind the scenes as editors, writers, or cinematographers, learning the craft by directing low-budget Westerns or short films. John Huston was 35 when he made his first film, *The Maltese Falcon*, and Fred Zinnemann, who directed *High Noon*, found his stride in his forties. Nowadays, without the support of studios or television, aspiring filmmakers often have to go their own way."
CPE_3,"In the past, the council houses were spread across the western side of the city, with many rows of small, worn-down homes made of orange brick or pale white stucco. In the summer, the chemicals from the May and Baker factory, located two miles away, created a strong smell of sulphur that lingered around the doors and gardens. One common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he walked along someone’s front path. I have forgotten much of my early life, but I remember sitting near an upstairs window, looking at the houses as they faded into the distance. 

Later, I have memories of other people—faces I cannot name, my mother ironing towels in a house that I don’t think was ours, and snow falling on the turrets of a large mansion at Earlham. It is not surprising that my mother appears in these early memories. I remember her as a small, precise, and often angry woman, and I never fully understood the reason for her anger, so I could not do anything to make it better. Even as a child, when I went with her to the small shops in Bunnett Square or on longer trips into the city, I sensed something unusual about her personality. She was the most solitary person I have ever known, feeling alone even in a crowded room. 

Her solitude was combined with a strict sense of propriety that was unusual for the West Earlham estate. This sometimes resulted in intense spring-cleaning sessions or strict instructions to ""behave properly."" I found this moral code hard to understand, and even now, I am not sure I fully grasp it. It meant not wandering into neighbors' gardens or damaging their rose bushes while walking down the street; it meant sitting quietly for long periods in a silent dining room, hands folded across my chest, listening to radio programs my mother enjoyed; it meant many rules and restrictions. 

Over time, other figures appeared in these serious early memories. Despite her solitude, my mother had friends. There was Mrs. Buddery, who was obsessed with the Royal Family; Mrs. Winall, who rarely spoke except to agree with others; and Mrs. Laband, who was more lively and not always approved of by the others. Later, I realized how poor their company was; they formed a gloomy group, often talking about bad legs, cold weather, and ungrateful children, a category I often felt I belonged to. Looking back, it felt like a heavy weight made up of the West Earlham houses, my mother, her friends, and the pressure to ""behave properly"" rested on my shoulders, and I felt it was my duty to grow up and free myself from it. 

Growing up in West Earlham followed a strict routine. Until you turned five, you stayed at home and got in your parents' way (I remember long, aimless days when I was about four, playing on a rug in the front room while my mother sat coldly in an armchair). Then, in September after your fifth birthday, you were sent to Avenue Road infants school, half a mile away. The lucky few had mothers with old bikes and child seats—these were unusual contraptions made of cast iron with makeshift safety straps. As far as I remember, my mother left me in the care of other children in the street for this journey. 

If I recall anything from those early years, it is the summer holidays, when I caught glimpses of the world outside West Earlham: a vague old man next door to Mrs. Buddery who told stories about his time in the Merchant Navy; a charity fair held at a house far away on Christchurch Road, where a kind woman offered lemonade and tried to interest me in something called the League of Pity—a kind of junior charity, I think—but my mother dismissed it, saying the organizers were ""only after your money."" My mother often spoke about mercenary motives, and she held politicians in deep contempt. If she thought of the House of Commons, it was as a place where wealthy people opened letters filled with five-pound notes sent by gullible citizens. I may exaggerate and overlook her good qualities while focusing on her flaws, but there was little kindness in my mother; it seemed to have been drained from her. 

To be fair, my mother was aware of her role in my education. Occasionally on Sundays, she would take me—in my ""good clothes""—on the 85 bus to the Norwich Castle Museum. Hand in hand, we would walk through rooms filled with paintings by the Norwich School of Artists. My mother was not completely against this activity and eventually developed some opinions about the art. I remember her stopping in front of a painting of a Roman soldier in full battle gear and saying, ""Well, I wouldn't want to meet him on a dark night!"" This was one of the few times I remember my mother trying to make a joke."
CPE_10,"**Text: Philadelphia Avenue**

I walked down the odd-numbered side of Philadelphia Avenue. The evening was getting darker, and the air was humid with a light drizzle that made my walk feel secretive. I knew this side of the street well; I remembered our neighbors, the Matzes and the Pritchards, Han Kieffer's grocery store, and the houses of my first playmates, all girls. Although I didn’t know everyone by name, each house was as familiar to me as the small troughs in the sidewalk that carried rainwater from the roofs to the street, which I often skated or scooted over. 

As the street sloped down, I noticed a slight decline in the social status of the houses: the porches were lower, and the front yards were smaller. Over the years, things changed: wooden porch railings were replaced with wrought iron in a style that reminded me of the South or Spain. In Shillington, houses I remembered as homes had turned into stores, and strangely, some stores, like Pep Conrad's and Han Kieffer's, had become homes again. I wondered how the residents used those open spaces and how they lived with the lingering smells of the goods.

**Bachelor Fads Furniture Designer Rick Gilbert**

Rick Gilbert's apartment used to be a curtain warehouse. It has the typical features of a loft, like exposed brick and large doors that once allowed curtains to be moved from trains on the nearby railway. However, Gilbert did not want a completely open space for both practical and aesthetic reasons. ""In my last place, my living and working areas were mixed. It was hard to relax or start working when everything was in view,"" he said. 

To create a more defined space, he used a large piece of corrugated plastic near the entrance. ""It hides the office, creates a hallway, and leads to the kitchen in the middle of the apartment. I wanted the kitchen to be a neutral space where I could cook for friends or make coffee for clients."" To balance the modern look of his plastic screen and stainless steel kitchen, Gilbert chose light wood for the floors. His apartment is filled with futuristic chairs and sofas, but it also has sentimental furniture from his parents or items he bought at markets.

**Bruce Chatwin**

Bruce Chatwin's life was a mix of adventure and mystery, making him a fascinating writer. His first book, *In Patagonia*, published in 1977, changed travel writing. It reads like a thrilling story, with the charm of romantic fiction and deep insights. However, even in this book, Chatwin mixed facts with fiction; he often changed details to make his stories more interesting or to highlight the deeper meanings of travel. He suggested that through travel, one could uncover histories that seemed to exist just to inspire future explorers.

**Swimming**

During a warm summer rain, I quickly crossed the lawn behind my house and jumped into the pool. As I swam breaststroke, my eyes were just above the water. Each raindrop created a small splash that turned into bubbles. The best moments were when the rain got heavier, drowning out the birdsong, and steam rose from the water as if the pool was reaching up to the sky. 

In the summer of 1996, during one of these heavy rains, I began to think about swimming across Britain. I wanted to follow the rain as it traveled across the land to the sea, escaping the frustration of swimming laps and feeling trapped like a tiger in a cage. Many of us live in a world where everything is labeled and explained, which makes reality feel more visual. This is why walking, cycling, and swimming are rebellious activities. They help us reconnect with the wild and old parts of our world by getting off the main paths and breaking free from the official stories. A swimming journey would allow me to explore the mysterious parts of our world, like dark woods or high mountains."
CPE_67,"**Text: 'CRYING** 

Charles Darwin believed that crying in humans did not have a clear purpose in evolution. However, he was likely mistaken. Recently, scientists have emphasized the social importance of crying. Psychiatrist John Bowlby pointed out that crying helps create a bond between a mother and her child. Many people think that tears, especially in children, mainly show feelings of helplessness. 

Understanding why adults cry is more complicated. It appears that the sound of crying is less important than the visual message it sends. Crying may have been beneficial for early human groups by helping to build trust and social connections. 

There are many reasons why we cry. We might cry to show sympathy for those facing great injustice. Additionally, we can cry unexpectedly, sometimes feeling embarrassed, when we hear touching music or powerful speeches. We often cry while watching emotional movies, and interestingly, this happens more often when we are with others than when we are alone. The social role of crying seems clear, but research is ongoing.'"
CPE_27,"**Text: The Heat is On**

We have all heard about global warming, but how much warmer will the Earth become, and how will it affect our lives? Most people have some understanding of global warming, but few know its consequences. A warmer climate is likely to change the weather in all parts of the world. Since the atmosphere is closely connected to every aspect of our planet, any climate changes will significantly impact plants, animals, water, and soil.

Humans have learned to use natural resources to our advantage, allowing us to produce food, build cities, and support billions of people. Therefore, any changes to these resources must be taken seriously. The challenge we face is understanding how the world will change and what is causing these changes. Over the last century, human actions have significantly increased the levels of certain gases in the atmosphere, which are closely linked to global temperature. These increased levels are likely already affecting the global climate, but our limited knowledge of the global heat balance makes the current and future situations uncertain.

We know that greenhouse gas levels have fluctuated in line with global temperatures over the past 40,000 years, suggesting a strong relationship between the two. Evidence indicates that the Earth's surface has warmed by about 6°C over the last century. Most scientists believe this trend is not entirely natural and is partly due to human pollution. 

A lot of research has been done to predict the conditions resulting from higher global temperatures. Most of this research uses computer programs called general circulation models (GCMs). These models analyze the interaction of temperature, pressure, solar radiation, and other climatic factors to predict climate conditions for the past, present, or future. However, they are simplifications of reality and have many limitations. Their results are only approximate, and they can be slow and expensive to run. 

Despite these challenges, most people agree on one important aspect of climate change: the rate of change will be faster than anything we have experienced before. The predictions from GCMs provide some insight into the world we will live in over the next few generations. Currently, they suggest that the average global surface temperature could increase by 1°C to 3.5°C by the year 2100. They also predict that global sea levels will rise by 15 to 95 cm and that changes in rainfall patterns will occur. Scientists expect extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, floods, and droughts, to become more common in some areas. 

These forecasts highlight the potential impact of climate change on the natural environment and humans. Changes in climate could affect the locations of ecosystems, such as forests and grasslands, the variety of species they contain, and their ability to provide essential benefits to society. This includes food production, water resources, and human settlements. Some effects may be irreversible and likely unfavorable in many regions, but not all impacts will be negative. In fact, some climate change effects may be beneficial. 

For example, in Australia, research has shown that wheat yields have increased by about 0.5 tonnes per hectare since 1952, partly due to climate trends. Warmer temperatures have led to fewer frosts, which has reduced damage to crops. However, many predicted effects of future climate warming are concerning. Even small changes in climate can affect water availability, especially in dry regions or areas already facing shortages. 

The Mediterranean Basin is one example where decreasing rainfall has been observed, particularly in western-central parts. In southern Portugal, rainfall has become more concentrated in autumn and winter, reducing spring totals. Another serious effect of climate change is the impact on glaciers, which will affect ice, vegetation, wildlife habitats, and human structures. There is a strong possibility that Arctic ice will melt completely, making marine transport and oil exploration easier but increasing the risk of icebergs.

Perhaps the most dramatic effect of global warming will be the rise in sea levels. This will occur due to the thermal expansion of oceans and melting ice. With about half of the world's population living in coastal areas, rising sea levels could have severe consequences. Increased flooding and inundation are likely, affecting cities like London, New York, and Tokyo. Many people could lose their homes and livelihoods, leading to millions of environmental refugees. 

The most severe consequences may be faced by small, low-lying island nations, which could disappear entirely if worst-case scenarios occur. This would be devastating not only for the people and cultures of these islands but also for the countries that would need to accommodate those displaced."
CPE_66,"Text: 'Mission to Mars Wanted: a middle-aged, married couple for a 501-day round trip to Mars. Applicants must be physically and emotionally strong. This will be the profile of the first Martian astronauts if multi-millionaire Dennis Tito's plans to launch a capsule on 5 January 2018 succeed. The capsule will take the crew to about 160 km above Mars. The spacecraft will use Mars' gravity to return to Earth without using extra fuel, as fuel efficiency is very important. The 2018 deadline is set because the next time Mars and Earth will be aligned for a launch is in 2031. It is a challenging task, but there is a race to develop new technologies. If these technologies are ready in time, the spacecraft might succeed. Even if it never leaves Earth, the efforts to reach these goals will still be valuable for future missions.'"
CPE_44,"**AESTHETICS**

Ironically, the existence of artworks, which is essential for developing aesthetic theory, can actually hinder our understanding of them. This is because artworks are physical objects, like buildings, books, paintings, or statues, that exist outside of human experience. People often think of a work of art as just the object itself, rather than what it does in our experience. This focus on the object can make it harder to understand its true meaning.

Moreover, the perfection and long-standing admiration of some artworks create conventions that block new insights. Once an artwork is considered a classic, it becomes disconnected from the human experiences that led to its creation and the effects it has on our lives. When artistic objects are separated from their origins and their impact on experience, they become isolated, making it difficult to grasp their broader significance, which is what aesthetic theory aims to explore. Art is then seen as separate from other human efforts and achievements.

A key task for anyone writing about the philosophy of fine arts is to reconnect the refined experiences that artworks provide with the everyday events and struggles that everyone recognizes as part of life. Just as mountains are not separate from the earth but are part of it, those studying fine art must also show how artworks relate to ordinary experiences.

If we accept this idea, we may reach a surprising conclusion: to understand artistic products, we must temporarily set them aside and focus on the everyday forces and conditions that we usually do not see as aesthetic. We need to take a detour to reach a theory of art, which is about understanding and insight. For example, while we can enjoy flowers for their beauty and scent without knowing about plants, understanding how they grow requires knowledge of soil, air, water, and sunlight.

To truly grasp aesthetics in its most recognized forms, we must start with raw experiences—those events and scenes that capture our attention and bring us joy. However, many people are so influenced by the idea that art is something separate and special that they might be surprised to learn that they enjoy their everyday activities partly because of their aesthetic qualities. 

Today, the arts that resonate most with the average person are often not seen as traditional art forms. For instance, movies, jazz, comic strips, and even sensational news stories are enjoyed without being classified as art. When art is confined to museums and galleries, people seek enjoyment in their daily lives instead. Many who oppose the museum view of art still hold onto the mistaken belief that separates art from ordinary experiences. The times when art is closely linked to everyday activities are when appreciation for it is strongest."
CPE_22,"**Text: Observing Lions**

In popular culture, lions hunting for food are often seen as a remarkable display of teamwork. As the sun sets, a group of stealthy lions emerges from the shadows and surrounds their unsuspecting prey. They appear to be perfect social animals, setting aside minor disagreements to work together for a common goal: their next meal. However, after many years of studying these animals in the wild, we have developed a different perspective. When we began our research in 1978, we wanted to understand why lions hunt together, raise cubs, and scare off rivals with their roars. If we measure an animal's success by how many offspring survive, then cooperation may not always be beneficial. If one animal is too generous, it may end up helping its companions at its own expense. So, why do lions seem to ignore the rules of self-interest? We thought we would solve this question in two to three years, but lions are very good at being inactive. We would add lions to the list of unreactive noble gases like krypton, argon, and neon. Therefore, we needed various research methods to find clues about their behavior. Since wild lions can live up to 18 years, we are only now beginning to understand the answers to our questions.

**Pop Music Review**

The release of Bedrock's third album was a significant moment for a talented band that had previously struggled. ""New Life"" started a movement that changed rock music in this country for the rest of the decade. Gone were the serious themes, dull clothing, and loud guitars of the past; instead, a lighter mix of melodic styles emerged. This album combined social commentary and strong emotions with sounds from fairground organs and brass bands. Humor and irony were prominent, and the singers proudly expressed their backgrounds. The album showed Bedrock as skilled collectors and observers, as well as versatile songwriters. They playfully addressed traditional English themes like sunbathing and Sunday afternoons. However, the album's true strength lay in its deeper, more melancholic tracks like ""So Low,"" a beautiful song loosely based on weather, and ""To the Brink,"" a serious ballad. The beauty of ""New Life"" is its consistently high quality—16 tracks with no filler, making it a standout record in an era of long CDs.

**Extract from an Autobiography**

As a child, I was always intrigued by stories of 'The Sibyl,' the wise women who had great influence in the ancient world. Initially, I only knew of one from a story my mother told me. An old woman from Cumae offered Tarquin, the King of Rome, nine books for 300 gold pieces. When he refused, she burned three of them and offered him six for the same price. After he refused again, she burned three more books. He eventually bought the last three for the full price. I realized there was a deep lesson in this story about salesmanship and life. As an only child, I often felt lonely. I would ask to play with other children, but they would refuse. My mother advised me to do something so interesting that the other kids would want to join me. It worked, and it’s a lesson I’ve never forgotten. When I had the chance to write a travel book, I needed to find a topic that mattered to me. I’m not a keen traveler; I even sent my editor a long list of places I didn’t want to visit. Ultimately, I’m only interested in ruins because I prefer to travel through time in my mind.

**What Happens to Your Manuscript?**

When you submit your manuscript, it will likely join a pile of other submissions waiting to be reviewed, known as the slush pile. The person sorting through these submissions is usually either a junior member of the editorial team (often under 18) or an experienced freelancer who works a few mornings a week. Neither has much power, but they are generally looking for something original. The junior member hopes to make a name for themselves, while the freelancer wants to justify their job. If they find your novel promising, they will pass it to a senior editor, and it may eventually be discussed in an acquisition meeting. The editor will need to justify accepting your novel based on its quality and potential sales, as well as whether you seem like a long-term author. They will also consider how marketable you are, which is important for promoting a new novel. For this reason, publishers often prefer to meet potential authors before making an offer."
CPE_39,"**Text: Advertising on Trial**

If you work in an advertising agency, the early 1990s may have been one of the hardest times in your career. The recession was worse than expected, affecting industrialized countries for thirty years. In Britain, in 1991, the economy shrank, interest rates were very high, consumer spending dropped on almost everything except basic needs, over half a million people lost their jobs, and around 75,000 homes were taken back by banks. Every business was impacted, with some industries, like vehicles and construction, seeing a 30% decline. Many people and companies around the world suffered.

Advertising professionals were not the only ones losing jobs during this tough time, but those who remained often felt a lot of pressure. They were seen as responsible for helping their companies make money, which meant they felt closely watched by their colleagues and bosses. Additionally, they were often asked to do more with smaller budgets. They were told that ""less is more."" Despite these challenges, the importance of marketing seemed to grow. Companies began to realize they needed to create products and services that customers actually wanted, rather than just what was easy for them to make. 

In the last ten to fifteen years, many companies have started to take marketing seriously. This has led to more attention on marketing activities, and some brands have begun to market themselves effectively. As a result, the status of marketing professionals has increased, but so has their workload. Marketing is often mistakenly seen as a solution to all problems. Since about half of marketing budgets go to advertising, it is often the advertising teams that are held responsible for results.

The 1980s were a great time for advertising, but the early 1990s brought the worst downturn in a generation. This was partly due to the economic situation, but there were also deeper changes that would not simply go away when the economy improved. The recession caused many clients to rethink their budgets and closely examine the effectiveness of advertising. Without clear evidence of success, many companies began to question the value of their advertising spending. 

During this time, companies wanted better strategies, targeting, creativity, media placement, and overall thinking from their advertising agencies. They aimed to have the best people working on their accounts and to motivate them to produce excellent work. While this situation may not inspire sympathy for the advertising industry, it does mean that many advertising professionals still face the same challenges as their clients: how to achieve more with less.

In addition to the economic issues, other factors have made effective advertising harder to produce. Some of these are direct results of the recession, such as debates over production costs and a reluctance to take risks, which are often essential for good advertising. Other changes, like demographic shifts, the growing power of retailers, changing consumer needs, the rise of sponsorship, and stricter advertising laws, have also played a role. For some companies, advertising in foreign markets has become a new challenge.

These factors have led many advertising professionals to reconsider the saying by Lord Leverhulme: ""Only half my advertising works. The trouble is I don't know which half."" Now, more than ever, there is pressure to increase the effectiveness of advertising. Unfortunately, help for those looking to improve is not readily available. Companies and advertising agencies have been too busy dealing with these challenges to share their experiences. Those who have managed to succeed often want to keep their strategies private. As a result, while conferences and seminars may offer some useful insights, the available books on advertising often do not provide practical guidance. Many of these books treat the advertising process with too much respect, suggesting that the work produced by advertising agencies is always of the highest quality and value, which is not true and does not help the employees responsible for the results."
CPE_18,"**The Lure of the Kitchen**

When I was at university, I decided I wanted to be a chef. This was an unusual choice among my peers. Cooking was not a popular career; it seemed unattractive. Chefs often have tough lives: the work is long, stressful, and poorly paid. However, these factors did not discourage me. I was unhappy at university. The work was difficult, and the social scene felt closed and self-important. Being a chef seemed like the perfect escape from the intellectual and social pretensions of college life. It promised a seriousness and integrity that I felt was missing in my studies.

My desire to cook was not just a reaction to my university experience; it also reflected an artistic ideal. I first realized this when I had a meal at a famous restaurant in London. It was a revelation. I still remember my starter clearly. After that meal, I felt so moved that I wanted to bow down and thank the chef. I felt light and happy for days. This experience sparked a strong desire in me to learn the secrets of this wonderful art. I changed my student life into a preparation for my future in cooking. My history degree became a distraction from my true passion. I learned about cooking by reading cookbooks, exploring markets, and preparing elaborate meals.

**Extract from a Novel**

The school's swimming instructor was a former drill sergeant, small and muscular, with tattooed arms. When I asked him to teach me how to dive, he told me to sit on the edge of the pool, raise my hands above my head, and roll forward, pushing off with my feet. I practiced this until the hour was over. The next time, he had me stand up and dive off the edge. The instructor was strict, and every time I surfaced, he looked at me with disapproval: ""Don't look down, look up!"" ""Keep your legs straight."" ""Point your toes!"" The following week, I went up to the high diving board. It was fixed and slightly bent down at the front. It seemed very high as I stood there, trying to gather my courage. Gradually, the noise faded, and I felt as if I were in a bubble of silence. I waved my arms as I had been taught, tried to look up instead of down, and jumped into the air. For a brief moment, I felt like I was flying. When I hit the water, I fell awkwardly, and my legs were everywhere. The instructor looked at me with disdain and shook his head. But even he could not take away my joy. That’s what they mean by ""free as a bird,"" I thought.

**The Traveller**

For those of us who value a comfortable bed, running water, and the chance to live at least until tomorrow, the idea of a traveller seems strange yet fascinating. These are people who have given in to the tempting call of the unknown. They choose to risk their lives by climbing dangerous mountains, sailing alone on small boats through huge waves, and eating insects if there is nothing else to eat. They can live for months in uncertainty. It is easy to see such people as oddities, and indeed they are, often considered eccentric: hermits, extreme divers, or writers. While their existence is undeniable, the unusual world they inhabit is far from our daily lives, and we can dismiss it as irrelevant. We can shrug and return to our lives with microwaves and answering machines, relieved that our own risks are predictable, like crossing a busy street.

**SAILING**

Jonathan Raban is afraid of the sea, which is probably why he spends so much time on it. He does not claim to be a top sailor, but he is clearly skilled. His main reason for sailing is that, as a writer, he enjoys writing about his sailing experiences. Sailing provides him with exciting stories to tell. Raban's small boat has a device that shows sailors their exact location anywhere on Earth. While he appreciates this tool, he also believes that the invention of the compass was a mistake. He thinks it has created a gap between people and the sea. Since the compass was invented, sailors have focused on it instead of observing the waves and feeling the ocean. The sea, once full of life, has become just a space to navigate. Because his job is simply to stay on course, a sailor can be replaced by an autopilot for long periods. This might be why Raban had time to observe the waves so closely."
CPE_62,"**Holiday Reading**

Summer brings us two great joys: escaping home and reading books. These joys are closely connected. Books can help us feel more at home in the wider world. We can relate our own experiences to those in great books written long ago or in faraway places because there are fewer types of people than there are individuals. In the stories of others, we find our own thoughts, embarrassments, and dramas. Authors can express feelings we thought we were alone in experiencing, using words we might struggle to find. What is shy and confused within us is clearly and confidently expressed by them, especially if the work was created by someone from a different time or place. We feel thankful to these strangers for reminding us of who we are. Through reading and travel, we break free from the dullness of routine. Our eyes are most open during the first few days in a new place, and perhaps also when we read a great book, which reveals things we had previously overlooked. Our minds become like radar, picking up on details we hadn’t noticed before, such as the colors of the sky, the changing expressions on a face, the insincerity of a friend, or a sadness about a situation we didn’t know we could feel sad about.

**Author's Note**

These reflections on travel were published as articles in the Observer newspaper over seven years. I have made some small edits to fit the articles to the page, but otherwise, I have added very little. I corrected a few obvious mistakes, but only if they were minor details I should have gotten right initially. With hindsight, I could have made more improvements, but that would have taken too long. For example, in the second article about China, it seemed likely at the time that the Hong Kong dollar would remain strong. A year later, it fell. If I rewrote the piece to predict this, it would no longer be a report from that moment. Like any traveler in Southeast Asia or elsewhere, I was there at that time, unaware of what would happen next, and focused on understanding what had already occurred. This is the true story of mass air travel: the world opening up to people who have no special qualifications to explore it except the price of a ticket. However, I have never believed that all my fellow travelers were completely unaware. Even a postcard can be written with intention.

**Ecotourism**

If there were awards for tourism phrases that have been misused, ""ecotourism"" would win first prize. The term first appeared in the early 1980s, reflecting a rise in environmental awareness and a realization by tour operators that many travelers wanted to ensure their presence abroad would not harm the environment. It quickly became a popular marketing term for holidays. Today, the ecotourism label includes everything from a two-week tour with remote tribes to a one-hour boat trip through an Australian gorge. Any tour that involves cultural interaction, natural beauty, wildlife, or a bit of adventure is likely to be labeled as ecotourism. While the original intentions behind the movement were good, the lack of regulations and a clear definition left many travelers confused in an ecotourism maze.

**Transylvanian Journey**

I lost the notebook from my journey in Transylvania for 50 years, but I was lucky to find it a few years ago. It has helped me remember that time and write about it, but it hasn’t been as reliable as I hoped. In Transylvania, I found it easier than expected, moving from one welcoming country house to another, often staying for weeks. When I settled down during those long stays, my writing stopped too; since I was keeping a travel journal, I mistakenly thought there was nothing to write about. I was often slow to start writing again when I moved on, and even then, quick notes sometimes replaced longer narratives. Worried that some details might be out of order when I began writing this book, I surrounded these sections with many warnings and hesitations. However, realizing that these pages were not meant to be a guidebook made me feel it didn’t matter much, so I allowed the story to unfold without unnecessary complications."
CPE_49,"**Text: Fashion**

Fashion is often thought of as a modern idea that relies on capitalism from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. However, many fashion historians argue that fashion, in terms of style and design, has a long history. They often begin their studies with the growth of trade in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. As societies have become more complex, populations have grown, and new technologies for making various types of clothing and accessories have emerged, the meanings of dress have also become more complex. Therefore, it is hard to determine what any piece of clothing or accessory truly means today. For instance, a man's suit, which is often seen as a symbol of uniformity, can have very different meanings depending on the context and the person interpreting it.

**Writer**

Reports about publishers competing for popular manuscripts can create a misleading picture of life for most novelists. In my experience, which is not exactly filled with best-sellers, there are two main ways to make a living. The smartest writers work in the evenings and have other full-time jobs that will still be there if their book is not quickly published or made into a film. Others, like me, take on various writing jobs, teaching, and occasional workshops to get by. I have heard of a writing job at a chocolate factory, but I have never found anything like that. Somehow, by balancing part-time jobs and using credit cards, and often thanks to the kindness of those mentioned in the Acknowledgements section of books, I manage to write my novel.

**Sudden Fame**

The small venues we performed at across the country were starting to sell out, and we needed extra security to manage the growing number of excited fans. We had to use secret entrances to avoid being overwhelmed by admirers at the village halls and ballrooms where we played. On the few nights we were not working, it was hard to leave the house without being followed by enthusiastic fans. In just a few days, we became celebrities. Our actions were closely watched by our fans, and our management took care of all our needs. Although my shyness never completely disappeared, it was replaced by a strange, naive confidence that only people who are naturally shy and find themselves in similar situations can understand. In short, I felt completely out of my depth emotionally."
CPE_31,"**Text: Music - The Challenge Ahead**

Technological advances are changing our lives at work, home, and during our free time. Susan Hallam discusses how these changes affect music in Britain. In the late 20th century, there was a rapid increase in ways to listen to music, such as through radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, videos, and new multimedia techniques. However, this has led to a decline in live music performances and full-time jobs for professional musicians. 

It is clear that access to music will continue to grow, as it meets many human needs. On a national level, no major state event is complete without music. For individuals, music offers many formal and informal activities. A society without music is hard to imagine. The real question is not whether there will be music in the 21st century, but what kind of music it will be and whether people will still feel the need to learn to play instruments. I believe that there will still be a demand for learning instruments. The music industry is a major source of income in Britain, and musical skills will remain important for various professions, especially in media.

Moreover, there is evidence that playing an instrument can help develop skills early on. Research in the USA suggests that listening to or making music positively affects spatial reasoning, which is one measure of intelligence. While these results need further confirmation, studies in Europe show that group music lessons can improve social relationships in schools and help children focus, especially those with behavioral issues. 

Current research is also exploring how playing an instrument might help develop transferable skills. For example, regular practice can lead to good study habits and concentration, while performing in concerts can teach punctuality and organization. For these reasons, there will likely be a continued demand for instrumental teaching in the near future.

What about the long-term future? Will there be a change in focus, and if so, what will it be? I believe two possibilities are likely. First, the types of music people listen to will become more diverse, with new genres combining different styles. Second, technology will play a bigger role in composing and performing music, making it easier for more people to create music without needing advanced technical skills. However, this may also reduce the need for live performances and musicians focused solely on that.

At the same time, more people of all ages will want to participate in making music. These activities will likely be community-based and reflect the musical traditions of those communities. If this vision for the future is to happen, the music profession must prepare. Instrumental teaching will need to change to help more people learn a variety of instruments throughout their lives. This will require adjustments to the instrumental curriculum and how progress is measured, making them relevant to a wider audience.

Training for musicians will be crucial. They will need to inspire and teach learners of all ages, work with diverse groups, and develop skills in communication, social interaction, entrepreneurship, and management for community work. This represents a significant shift from traditional methods and will require a response to demands for public accountability. 

Positively, this change offers an opportunity for everyone involved in music education to showcase the high quality of music teaching available. Finally, we must work to raise the profile of music itself. Music is essential in our lives, but it is often taken for granted. Those in the music profession at all levels need to collaborate to ensure this changes."
CPE_58,"**The Actor's Craft**

Actors sometimes face criticism and scorn. Much of this negativity comes from the actors themselves when they are asked to discuss their work in interviews. Instead of sharing their true feelings, they often resort to tired clichés or gossip. Paul Scofield once wrote to a friend that an actor's work is only alive when performed. He believed that discussing it makes it feel empty and theoretical. Each time an actor performs, they start anew, learning from the characters and the writer. After a play ends, they feel empty until the next performance, and this emptiness is often evident in discussions about acting.

**A Review of Hamlet**

Adrian Lester's portrayal of Hamlet captures the transition from boyhood to manhood with simplicity and confidence. His control over the text and his physical presence elevate him from a promising actor to a leading performer. Lester plays a young man filled with anger, yet he balances this with sharp wit and humor, making his character both intimidating and endearing. His physicality, such as the way his arms hang, suggests a character waiting to be brought to life. Similarly, Handy's portrayal of Horatio conveys a sense of being moved by an inner force.

**What is Acting?**

What does it mean to act? Is it merely copying behavior, or does it create something new? This question lies at the heart of theatre.

**One Director's Approach to Rehearsal**

This director's rehearsal process begins with a technique called ""dropping in."" The stage manager displays the script on a screen while the actors listen quietly. When it’s their turn to speak, they read the first line, reflect on its meaning, and wait for the impulse to speak. For example, if the line is, ""Queuing all night, the rain, do you remember?"" they take a breath and let the thought come to them. They might visualize a memory, like waiting in line for a concert. The director encourages actors to be open and trust that something will happen in the moment.

**The Perfect Theatre**

The ideal theatre should make you feel that your presence matters. Attending a live performance is a special event, and the staff should recognize this. It can feel isolating if the people working at the theatre seem indifferent. The theatre must create a connection between the performers and the audience. Everyone should feel engaged and not distant from the action on stage. The design of the auditorium is crucial; it should suit the human voice and body. If the space is too large, it can diminish the experience. Many theatres built in the late nineteenth century successfully created an intimate atmosphere. I appreciate theatres that show a sense of history, like worn stone steps in a church, which reflect the presence of many people over time. 

When it comes to plays, you cannot please everyone. You cannot predict what the audience will want to see. When you go to the theatre, you hope for something unexpected; otherwise, you might as well stay home."
CPE_37,"**Text:**

**Paul Simon**  
Rock and roll in the 1950s was mainly a music movement for young people, but it also had a significant effect on the middle class and older adults. It opened the door for the next generation of rock stars, who listened to it with admiration, knowing that this unique and exciting sound would be connected to their futures. For Paul Simon and other young people in the US, the best way to hear this new and lively music was through Alan Freed's radio show, Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party. Freed's show was essential listening for many young rock stars. Like the young John Lennon, who was 3,000 miles away in Liverpool, listening to Radio Luxembourg—the only European station playing rock and roll—Paul Simon was captivated by the music from Freed's show. He was getting ready for the next big step for a teenager obsessed with rock and roll: moving from listening to creating his own music.

**Snow**  
No path was visible, but I thought I would be okay if I walked carefully. The wind blew hard from above, pushing me over as I slipped on the icy ground. Suddenly, the snow that looked innocent gave way beneath me. I fell into a hole about four feet deep. The snow had formed a roof over the gap between two rocks, and when it melted, it left only a thin layer that I fell through. I pulled myself out, shaken and scared, wondering what I would have done if the hole had been thirty feet deep. I leaned against a pine tree that was sticking out of the snow to think about my situation. In an hour, I had only gone about half a mile. It was clear that I would have to give up my plan.

**Qualitative Research**  
There are now many books that try to help researchers understand qualitative research. While a lot has been written about how to collect data, these books often do not explain how to analyze that data. There is still much confusion about how researchers analyze their findings. Therefore, we invited various social scientists who have worked on qualitative projects to share the methods they used. The goal was to provide insight into the process of qualitative data analysis, rather than to create a guidebook for new researchers. This task involves making unclear processes clearer. While this may seem easy, we have found it quite challenging. We have allowed our contributors to present their work in different styles, including personal stories and more formal approaches."
CPE_2,"**Screen Learning**

Recently, I saw my six-year-old son eating noodles in a funny way. He was pulling them up with his teeth and pretending to be a dinosaur. ""I'm a little dinosaur,"" he said. He was acting out a scene from a TV show, so I asked him what he remembered about dinosaurs. He didn’t remember much. There is a trend to use the internet and computers for learning, but is learning from a screen effective? One writer shares his experience with an interactive program he tried with his son. The father read the words while the son played with the pictures. The father thought that if his son had spent ten minutes reading a book, he might have learned something. Research shows that learning happens best in environments where there is conversation with teachers or parents. While using new technology to teach children is good, traditional education still plays an important role.

**Hollywood**

By 1918, most of the world’s film-making moved to Hollywood. The local people were not happy, seeing their neighborhood in Los Angeles changed by these newcomers. However, they eventually accepted this change because of the American value of success, measured by box-office earnings. Hollywood can recognize a good film, one that can create stars and make money. In less than a century, Hollywood has transformed from a small village to a town as famous as New York, Rome, or Paris. Physically, it has changed a lot; a hundred years ago, you would walk through orange groves to get to the village store. Yet, in some ways, it still feels like a village, focused mainly on films: how much money they make, who is dating whom, and who is working on which project. Many successful people try to leave Hollywood to live elsewhere, but it remains the main place for anyone important in show business.

**Photography**

Photography was created by artists in the nineteenth century as a new form of art. These artists wanted a lasting record of what they saw, and they achieved this with new technology. The combination of light, lenses, shutters, and light-sensitive surfaces produced images that were more detailed and realistic than what painters could create in weeks or months. This innovation surprised other artists, and at first, they were pleased. However, art critics soon claimed that photography could not be considered art because it relied too much on mechanical processes. Despite this criticism, photographers recognized that they had discovered a new way to express themselves. They used photography like other artists use brushes and pencils—to interpret the world and present their vision of nature and people.

**Book Illustration**

During the black-and-white era of book illustration, it was clear that every children's book needed illustrations. This also applied to many novels for older readers, which saw a decline in print runs. Although children's publishing remained active, it was often low-budget, leading to many average works. However, the best artists always submitted their best work. As a result, the black-and-white collection is a mix of both valuable and less impressive pieces, making it a great place for research and discovery. The true treasures from this period are likely to be displayed again, either through reprints of classic titles or new publications about the artists. There are signs that interest in this period is growing, and we may soon see a publisher create a series of classic children's book illustrations, either as reprints or new editions using the original artwork."
CPE_68,"**Text: Blogging: Sharing Our Lives Online**

Not long ago, a website warned about the dangers of public check-ins, which are online updates about where you are. The message was clear: when you say, ""Hey, I'm at this place,"" you are also letting many people know your location, including those you might not want to meet. This reflects a growing understanding that sharing everything online can have negative consequences. 

The internet offers many exciting chances to share our lives with a global audience, leading to dreams of wealth and fame. However, as we dive into this online world, we often share personal stories and photos without thinking about the risks. Eventually, we may feel overwhelmed and lost in this crowded space. 

But there is hope. The path forward was shown to us years ago by early internet users who explored these challenges. In the beginning, they faced many difficulties, losing jobs and friends while navigating the temptations of fame, long before social media existed. These early bloggers experienced what many of us are now facing. It’s important to learn from their experiences.

In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started sharing his life online. At that time, the web was mostly used by graduate students and scientists. Hall saw a chance to share his personal story. He created a detailed online autobiography filled with his thoughts, photos, and art. In January 1996, he began a daily blog, attracting many readers who were fascinated by his boldness in using this new platform. Hall was open about everything; no topic was off-limits. While some might see this as attention-seeking, there was also a unique beauty to his work.

However, one day, visitors to his site found it replaced by a video called Dark Night. Hall shared that he had fallen deeply in love, but when he wrote about it, he was told to choose between his blog and his relationship. He felt that sharing his life online made people distrust him. The blog ended, but the issue remains: sharing online can be wonderful, but if you think it will always attract people to you, you might be disappointed.

In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a young woman in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, a colleague sent her blog link to the company’s vice presidents, including some she had criticized, which led to her losing her job. Researchers call this the ""online distribution effect,"" which describes how people often say things online that they would never say in person. However, our online lives are connected to our real lives, and ignoring this can lead to serious mistakes.

Armstrong's story had a positive outcome. Although she was upset and stopped blogging for a while, she later got married and started a new blog focused on her family. Today, she is a well-known ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her household. Once seen as an example of the risks of sharing too much online, she has now mastered the art of sharing her life wisely. 

What Armstrong teaches us is important: the internet allows us to say anything, but that doesn’t mean we should."
CPE_23,"**Text: Enough Sleep?**

Tiredness is often seen as a common problem in modern life. As wealthier and busier countries have developed, sleeplessness and anxiety have also increased. Research in the USA shows that 40 million Americans suffer from chronic sleep issues. Some popular novels in Britain have even featured characters who cannot sleep or have settings in sleep research labs. This growing interest in sleep includes its patterns, its importance, and the problems people face with it. A leading sleep researcher states, ""People need more sleep."" Many people reduce their sleep when they are busy, often waking up early to avoid traffic.

Recently, a sleep researcher conducted an experiment. He allowed participants to sleep for up to 14 hours a night for a month. After three weeks, they settled into an average of eight hours and fifteen minutes of sleep, showing a significant need for sleep that they had been missing.

In Europe, a university sleep research lab in the English Midlands has studied various topics, including how fatigue affects sailors, the impact of airport noise on sleep, and the risks of driving while tired. They recruit participants through student newspapers, offering them £5 an hour and asking them to change their sleep patterns as instructed. Dr. Louise Reyner reassures participants who worry about having electrodes placed on their heads, explaining that the lab focuses on physical aspects of sleep.

In a dark room, there is a motorway simulator with a car facing a large screen. Participants are told to arrive at 2 PM, during the body's natural afternoon slump, after a short night’s sleep or no sleep at all. They drive while answering questions as the projector shows a long road ahead with bright sunlight and warm air. The young men insist they will not fall asleep. Dr. Reyner has recorded one participant trying to stay awake. At first, he sits up straight, but soon he starts to blink more often and his head begins to droop. Eventually, he experiences brief moments of blackout, jerking awake each time. By the second or third time, the car veers off the road. Dr. Reyner suggests that two cups of coffee can help someone stay alert for at least half an hour. She also recommends various products like energy drinks and caffeinated gum, especially for shift workers.

But what else do we know about sleep? It is understood that humans, like other mammals, sleep in a daily cycle. While asleep, we go through four stages, from light sleep to deep sleep. Dreams usually happen during light sleep, and the brain temporarily paralyzes the body to prevent injuries. Beyond this, many ideas about sleep are still theories. Some believe sleep helps repair the body or restore muscles, but it might also happen during relaxed wakefulness, so it is unclear.

Scientists agree that women tend to sleep about half an hour longer than men, and older people generally need less sleep, though the reasons are unknown. When asked about the purpose of sleep, some researchers say, ""Sleep is a way to travel through time safely.""

Historically, sleep patterns have changed. A history professor studied British sleep habits from 1500 to 1850 and found that people went to bed early, woke up after midnight for a while, and then went back to sleep. This time was used for reflection, remembering dreams, or even stealing. The poorest people benefited most from this quiet time, escaping their daily struggles. However, by the 17th century, as artificial light became more common, wealthier people began to adopt the more efficient sleep patterns we have today. The industrial revolution later extended working hours for most people, except in rural areas.

In many non-western cultures, the old sleep patterns still exist. Some people go to bed for a few hours, then wake up again, and the idea of a full night’s sleep does not apply. In certain tribal societies, noises from humans and animals, along with the need to tend to fires and watch for predators, make continuous sleep difficult. It appears that people everywhere are in great need of more sleep."
CPE_60,"Text: ""We are talking about big cowboy boots. Really big boots. I stood in my expensive designer cowboy boots on the rocks in the Arizona desert. Money was not a problem. I wore a complete cowboy outfit, and if you have the outfit, you might be a cowboy. But I was not. It wasn't working for me. I squinted into the morning sun, looking at the Arizona mountains, and I had to admit, I did not feel at home. I flew in from Denver just after dawn, thinking I might look like a cowboy coming from the sky. That feeling disappeared when I saw a real cowboy in the luggage area of Phoenix airport. He wore a dirty shirt, needed a shave, and was lifting a worn bag off the conveyor belt when he noticed my new cowboy boots. He raised an eyebrow and walked out without looking back. 

There should be a set of clothes that an ex-racing driver can wear without feeling out of place. Something that allows him to feel comfortable wherever he goes, without feeling like everyone is speaking a different language and moving slowly. I loved being a racing driver and driving racing cars. I am addicted to it, and it is all I know how to do. But I don’t do it anymore. I couldn’t even if I wanted to. I wondered, looking at the rough, red rocks of the mountains, what I should do now. A racing driver should have one or two backup plans for when he stops racing. I thought I had some, but when I tried to reach for them, they vanished. 

How about: an ex-racing driver provides commentary from the trackside? 'We have fifteen former Indy and Formula One drivers ready to be commentators. We’ll call you.' Or: an ex-racing driver partners to sell classic cars? That plan lasted nearly all winter with phone calls, lunches, lawyers, and meetings with bankers. But it was a year when no one was buying old Ferraris, and Honda was changing its dealer list. So, I stepped back before there was nothing left to step back from. 

Being an 'ex' anything is hard. How much do you want to hear about how I was almost the World Champion? No one wants to hear a story that ends with 'almost.' Even if I had been the champion, you would probably only listen for five minutes before getting bored. Last year’s champion is just that—last year. Not that I want sympathy, which is good because I don’t get any. Why should I? I had a good career, made money, and saved enough. But I miss the thrill of getting into that powerful racing car with seven hundred horsepower. Zero to one hundred fifty miles per hour in 4.9 seconds. And yes, I miss the danger of almost crashing every race. I miss the exciting people and the reporters who acted like my words mattered. Being somewhat famous isn’t all bad. Businessmen and politicians liked to tell their friends they knew me. Little boys would sneak under fences to get my autograph. 

Now that I don’t drive anymore, I have a lot of free time. Just last week, the phone rang twice. I have time in the morning and afternoon. Tomorrow looks free too, so much empty time. I looked up at the clear blue sky. No buzzards flying above. Maybe Arizona doesn’t have buzzards. But a couple of small brown birds in a cactus nearby were warning me to leave their nest alone. I never thought the desert had songbirds. It made me realize that a fake cowboy in designer boots has a lot to learn."""
CPE_1,"**Text: Vancouver**

In the last ten years, many people from around the world have moved to Vancouver, in western Canada. In the evenings, residents walk through the city streets, and if you join them, you will likely hear different languages being spoken. People come to Vancouver for its mild weather, beautiful location between the ocean and mountains, clean and safe environment, and good educational and job opportunities. Although some locals may complain about the speed of new building developments, it is clear that the new residents and growing tourism have contributed to a vibrant city life. Vancouver was once called 'Terminal City' because it served as a gateway to other places. Although this name is less common now, Vancouver is still a major gateway.

**Putting Pen to Paper**

Journalists like me often struggle with writing letters. Some say this is because we dislike writing for free, but I think it is more about how we aim for the best effect in our work, which makes writing a letter feel different. A true artist, who may rewrite their work many times, does not face this issue. I believe that understanding the impact of their words is a key sign of a real artist. When Shakespeare wrote his famous lines, he likely did not think about how the use of longer words made them powerful and showed his talent.

**Supermarket Opening**

In Britain, the opening of a new supermarket used to be a big event. You could expect a celebrity, like a soap star or a member of the royal family, to cut the ribbon. Now, new supermarkets seem to open every day, and celebrities are no longer needed. Why pay a famous person when anyone can open it for free? Last week, waiting customers didn’t care who opened the new Superbuy store, as long as they were at the front of the line. According to one customer who knew someone working there, the first five men to enter would receive a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women would get a bunch of flowers. This news quickly spread through the crowd, making those at the front feel proud and causing envy among those who arrived later."
CPE_53,"**Text: Citizen Kane**

When the film *Citizen Kane* was released in 1941, it created a lot of excitement, but it was not a commercial success. The release was delayed because the distributors were worried about what William Randolph Hearst, the person the film was thought to be about, might do to them. Although it received very positive reviews, it was television that later brought it back into the public eye. This film has inspired many people to become filmmakers, which is impressive since it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles believed that its success came from his lack of knowledge about what he could or could not do; he simply went for it. He also had a talented team, including cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and special-effects expert Linwood Dunn. When Welles and Mankiewicz decided to create a story about a newspaper magnate who was both like and unlike Hearst, Welles realized he had found the perfect role for himself as both director and actor, and he took the opportunity with great enthusiasm.

**Dermot and Carmel**

That morning, Dermot thought Carmel seemed a bit strange. He had mentioned twice that he might be late and that he might stop by the golf club on his way home to talk to someone. Each time, she nodded as if she hadn’t really heard him. “Will you be okay? What are you going to do today?” he asked. She smiled and replied, “It’s funny you ask. I was just thinking I have nothing planned, so I’ll take a walk downtown and look at the shops. I feel like it’s almost wrong to waste the day like this.” Dermot smiled back, saying, “You deserve to enjoy yourself. And if I’m late, I won’t need anything to eat, so don’t worry about it.” “That’s fine,” she said.

**Title Race**

“Tea boy? Do you mind? I’m a mobile lukewarm beverage resource facilitator.” Human nature can be quite funny. A recent study showed that job titles often cause jealousy and problems at work. A survey by a well-known recruitment firm found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees believe that job titles create divisions among coworkers. Surprisingly, 70% of office workers said they would give up a pay raise for a more “motivational” or “professional” job title. If our desire for better titles is so strong that it overcomes our basic need for money, we are in trouble. In the early twenty-first century, no one wants to be called subordinate. The job titles being discussed focus on skills (like specialist or coordinator) but are really just fancy words."
CPE_55,"**The Vienna Assignment**

I was in Vienna to take photographs. This was usually the reason I traveled. Photography was not just my job; it was a big part of my life. The way light fell on different surfaces always inspired me. I believed that a single photograph could capture the essence of a moment, a place, or a person. I often thought that one day, I might take the perfect picture. As long as I had film in my camera, there was always a chance. My rule was simple: finish one roll, load another, and keep looking with open eyes. This had been my approach for a long time.

Once, I got lucky when a photo of a smoke plume from a burning oil well became very popular, and newspapers and magazines around the world wanted it. It was a brief moment of fame, but just luck. They say you create your own luck, both good and bad. After that, I decided to work freelance, which seemed smart, but life had other plans. The mid-nineties were not the series of successes I had hoped for after my photo made the cover of Time magazine. That’s why I found myself in Vienna instead of somewhere more exciting. Still, I was taking photographs and getting paid for it, which didn’t sound too bad.

The assignment came about by chance. I had taken photos for a coffee-table book called *Four Cities in Four Seasons*, which featured London, Paris, Rome, and Vienna. I had received a good commission for capturing my city in different seasons. I had my own unique take on the flowers in Hyde Park and the busy streets of Piccadilly. I also accepted that much of what I created would be ignored since it was just a picture book, not meant to challenge anyone’s views.

After a cold snap over Christmas, I submitted my winter photos of London and learned that the Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, had left his job in Vienna for reasons I wasn’t told. Instead of hiring someone new, they offered me the job. The Austrian publishers liked my work, and I was available, while the French and Italian photographers were not. I was happy to go. Things at home were not good, so a week in snowy Vienna sounded perfect.

They put me up at the Europa hotel in the old city. I had last visited Vienna with my wife for a busy weekend of sightseeing, which was hot and chaotic. I hadn’t taken many photos then. This time, alone in the cold January, I knew it would be different. As soon as I arrived and saw the beautiful light over the snow-covered roofs, I felt excited. I was ready to take great pictures.

On my first day, I didn’t rush to take photos. I rode the trams around the Ringstrasse, getting on and off to experience the city’s atmosphere. The weather was cold and still, like the grand buildings from the old empire. I hadn’t seen what Schussner had captured in the other seasons, and I didn’t want to. This was going to be my Vienna, and I was ready to let it reveal itself to me. 

A photograph captures a moment, but you must wait for the right moment. So, I took my time, observing until I could see clearly. The next morning, I was out at dawn. The fresh snow meant Stephansplatz would be beautifully white and almost empty. I struggled to find a way to photograph the cathedral, which towered high into the grey sky but appeared massive at ground level. I realized I might have to settle for a partial view. In that weather and at that time, it could still be magical. 

Photography has always had a sense of magic. Even the early photographers felt this before they fully understood the chemistry behind it. You can watch a blank sheet of paper turn into a photograph in a dark room. Even when you know how it works, the mystery remains. Perhaps that’s why what happened at Stephansplatz that morning didn’t surprise me in a strange way."
CPE_50,"**Text: Kinetic Art**

Exciting news: London's Hayward Gallery has changed into a place of wonder. This transformation is not due to a big-budget show, but rather a unique exploration of a lesser-known part of the last 60 years. A new exhibition looks at the history of kinetic art, which is art that involves movement, throughout the twentieth century. It shows that creating artworks that move on their own or explore the idea of movement has been a consistent, though often overlooked, theme in some of the most interesting creative work of this century. The exhibition features a wonderful collection of paintings, drawings, documents, and films about kinetic art, curated by Guy Brett, who has studied this subject for many years. The artworks are mostly presented without much text, allowing visitors to enjoy discovering connections and insights on their own.

**David Hockney**

David Hockney's art attracts many people who might not usually be interested in art. This could be because his work is figurative and easy to understand, or because it focuses on leisure and escape from daily life. Some people might even be drawn to Hockney's charming personality and his clever comments, making him popular for reasons unrelated to his art. However, this does not mean that his art lacks purpose. Some critics believe Hockney is an overrated artist, but one could argue that his popularity today makes it seem like his work is less significant. Hockney himself is realistic about his abilities and believes it is not fair to judge his work based on an abstract idea of greatness. He does not claim to be a great artist and understands that only future generations can truly judge his importance.

**Window-shopping - an Art Exhibition**

In recent years, I have seen many contemporary art exhibitions, some brilliant and others mediocre. What often frustrates me are shows that seem to push a specific agenda, suggesting a common viewpoint among certain artists. Sometimes this approach works, revealing new trends in seemingly unrelated works. More often, however, it highlights a questionable angle or a forced idea. This led me, as a curator, to create a show that opposes this trend. Along with seven artists, I took over a space in an empty warehouse. 'Window-shopping' was meant to be a collection of individual artworks that connected only by being labeled as art. For example, Sam Cole's knitted cats chased each other on a toy train track, while Matthew Crawley filmed a video camera, opened it, and poked around until it broke, creating flickering images on a monitor. These works did not fit into a specific theme and would not usually be shown together, but they complemented each other in their contrast. I did not make grand statements about contemporary art, but I believe that art is an individual activity where artists set their own rules.

**Art History**

People who enjoy paintings sometimes hesitate to analyze them, fearing it will ruin their enjoyment. Some believe that art historians, who focus on theory rather than practice, overlook the joy of viewing art and the special act of creating it. This idea is similar to thinking that knowing a recipe and cooking method takes away from the taste of a dish. Understanding the importance of enjoyment does not mean we cannot have a deep knowledge of what we are experiencing. In fact, knowing more about an artwork might enhance our pleasure. Additionally, pleasure is complex. How we sense and recognize pleasure is influenced by our history and society. Our preferences for certain characteristics in art are shaped not just by our genes or personalities, but also by the values of the society we live in. While we should not underestimate the importance of instinctive responses to art, the belief that intellectual understanding diminishes enjoyment comes from a past view that saw art as separate from thought."
CPE_25,"**Text: Metals**  
Stone Age people may have been interested in metals because they wanted to decorate themselves. While sitting by a river, waiting for fish, one of our early ancestors might have found a shiny yellow stone and picked it up. It felt different from regular stones and was very attractive. This could be how gold became important to early humans. Because gold is easy to shape, it quickly became a popular material. Copper might have also been discovered by chance, and once people realized how useful copper tools were, they actively searched for copper ores and ways to extract the metal. This led to the development of metalworking, which improved the lives of our ancestors.

**St Ives**  
We were quiet as we carried our bags down the narrow, cobbled street that led to the town center, struggling against the strong wind and trying to avoid the cold waves crashing over the walkway. The streets were empty, and all the windows in the waterfront cottages were tightly shut against the storm. We had seen the weather get worse as we arrived in St Ives on a small train. As the dark clouds gathered, visiting Cornwall in the off-season without a car didn’t seem like a good idea anymore. I had convinced my friend to come with me by promising beautiful walks along the Cornish coast and cozy evenings by the fire.

**Computer Modelling**  
Studying the past is challenging because it is gone. The people who lived in times of peace and those who faced hardships are no longer alive. The reasons they settled in certain places or formed families and communities have been forgotten. Archaeology gives us some clues, but we cannot test our ideas with experiments on past cultures. We cannot go back in time to see what happened. However, computer modeling allows us to recreate ancient landscapes and environments and fill them with virtual communities—digital people that have some of the needs and abilities of real humans. We can set rules for them and create social groups. Then, we can change the weather or increase the population and observe how these virtual cultures and their artificial people respond."

**Vervet Monkeys**  
Cheney and Seyfarth studied vervet monkeys and observed a dominant male in the group. One day, he saw a strange male nearby in another grove of trees. The stranger wanted to join the group, which could lead to the dominant male losing his position. To keep the stranger away, the dominant male cleverly made an alarm call that vervet monkeys use to warn of a leopard. This made the stranger retreat back into the trees. The dominant male repeated this tactic whenever the stranger approached. However, he made a mistake when he called out the alarm while walking across the open ground himself.

**What Cats Catch**  
In a survey in the village of Felmersham, people recorded what their cats caught over a year. Seventy cats caught over 1,000 prey items. An American professor estimated that this means cats in Britain kill about 100 million birds and small mammals each year. However, this number is misleading. Most cats live in towns and catch fewer animals than those in the survey. The important question is whether these numbers are sustainable. The answer seems to be yes. In winter, many people feed birds, and gardens provide nesting sites, keeping bird populations above natural levels. The survey showed that while cats are significant predators, they are not destroying Britain's bird population.

**Buffalo's Day**  
Buffaloes are very important to the marshmen, and they are treated with care. Each morning, the buffaloes, after sleeping on a platform or near the fire with their owners, slowly leave for the reed beds beyond the water. They take their time, groaning about the tiring day ahead, until the leader finally steps into the water. Once in the water, they seem to forget their purpose and relax, making low sounds of complaint. Their movements away from the house are slow and almost unnoticed, but eventually, they are swimming, barely keeping their noses above the water. They spend the day among the reeds, grazing on green shoots at their eye level.

**Picasso, Pablo**  
In early spring 1940, while in the fishing port of Royan, Picasso painted several still lifes of fish. One painting shows a fishmonger’s slab with a crab and some soles on scales. The fish appear almost alive despite their situation. The painting is complex, with overlapping transparent shapes and delicate colors, creating a calm underwater scene. However, there is tension as the fish seem to be preparing for a fight with the crab. The sharp shapes in the painting, including the scales and a chain around one fish, suggest a sense of danger and hidden violence, giving the artwork a deeper meaning."
CPE_12,"**Text: Photography**

Over the last 150 years, photography has been used to capture many aspects of human life. In this relatively short time, photography has improved its ability to record moments in time and space, allowing us to see both large and small details. It has given us images from faraway places, distant parts of the solar system, and the complex social issues of modern life. Photography has become one of the most important ways to express what it means to be human.

However, the idea of recording events visually has a much longer history. The earliest forms of visual recording date back to the Upper Paleolithic period, around 35,000 years ago. We cannot be sure why early cave paintings were created. They may have recorded actual hunting events, served as magic to help with hunting, acted as religious symbols, or simply brightened daily life. Nevertheless, visual images are deeply connected to human culture.

Throughout history, people have questioned how accurate visual images are and what role they play in society. The saying ""seeing is believing"" has always given special importance to visual images. When photography was invented in the mid-1800s, it seemed to promise a truthful visual record. The camera was seen as a tool that worked like the human eye, capturing fixed images that closely resembled what we see. The chemical process used in photography allowed for the capture of what we consider natural images.

At the same time, photography was viewed as a sophisticated cultural achievement, producing images that artists had long tried to create through skill and practice. Ironically, because photography seemed so realistic, it was thought that everyone could easily understand photographs. This led to the idea that photography might be a ""universal language."" For instance, in 1933, photographer August Sander suggested that even the most isolated person could understand a photograph of the sky, whether it showed the sun, moon, or stars.

However, as global communication increased in the late twentieth century, we must consider how well photographs can cross cultural differences. Is photography limited by cultural norms like any other form of communication, such as language? Has our familiarity with photographs made us overlook the complex ways they convey vivid impressions of reality? Photography is often seen as providing convincing evidence, making it seem like a clear reflection of our environment. It is common for someone to show a photograph and say, ""This is my grandson.""

Since its invention in 1839, photography and the attitudes towards it have changed significantly. This change may be partly due to photography moving into what we might call ""mythic time."" Its original role as a record-keeper has evolved, and photographs, once closely tied to the photographer and subject, have become historical documents. These images often reveal as much about the people and society that created them as they do about their subjects.

I aim to show that the camera is not just a silent recorder of events. Photography does not merely reflect culture; it can also inspire social and political change. For example, it is hard to imagine the cultural shifts of the Italian Renaissance without recognizing how the development of perspective changed visual representation. Similarly, photography has played a significant role in shaping the media culture of our time, while also bringing the harsh realities of the world into our everyday lives."
CPE_26,"**How to Write Poetry**

Teaching people how to write poetry can be tricky. It requires creativity, but one wrong move can lead to confusion. I won’t pretend to know everything, so I will say this: for beginners, nothing replaces reading a lot, writing often, and letting your imagination flow freely, as long as it doesn’t become chaotic. Some people need a stable life to write poetry, while others find comfort in writing through their struggles. Some writers follow a schedule, while others wait for inspiration to strike. All approaches are valid, as long as they don’t follow strict rules. The key is to find your unique voice, nurture it, and let it grow. Eventually, it will be strong enough to stand on its own.

**The Short Story**

In a short story, it’s important not to overcrowd it with too many characters or long descriptions. Flashbacks should be brief and only used when necessary to clarify something. One effective way to use flashbacks is through a character’s memory, which can help move the story forward at a critical moment, but it should never slow down the action. Dialogue is often more effective than many new writers realize. Two characters talking can show different perspectives much faster than explaining everything from one viewpoint. This keeps the reader engaged and avoids unnecessary words. Overwriting can ruin a short story, but being brief doesn’t mean it should feel like a summary. Conflict and action should be just as strong in a short story as in a novel, but the skill lies in making every word count in a limited space.

**Screenplays**

Anyone who knows how to play chess can understand how to write a screenplay. Most chess players make mistakes along the way. We may not know everything, but we know enough to play. We can often see a few moves ahead, and we feel good about that. As we learn more about chess, we realize that it’s more about long-term strategy than short-term moves. We start to see the game as a whole, not just a series of individual moves. We notice patterns, called gambits, and recognize different phases of the game, like openings, middle games, and end games. The more we play chess, the more we understand its complexities, just like in screenplay writing.

**Looking at Writing**

Humans naturally want to communicate, as seen in the chatter of young children; however, no child instinctively knows how to bake, brew, or write. Charles Darwin noted that language is a natural human instinct, but writing is not. Language exists in all societies, both past and present. While languages change, they do not necessarily improve; modern English is not better than the languages spoken by ancient tribes. All healthy children learn to speak without formal lessons. When children are together without a common language, they create their own. In contrast, writing systems have been created only a few times in history, starting in complex societies and evolving over time. Until recently, most children did not learn to read or write, and even today, many struggle. A group of children is unlikely to invent an alphabet, just as they wouldn’t invent a car engine. Children are naturally good at hearing sounds, but learning to read and write is a skill that takes time and effort. We need to understand how writing works, how children learn, and how to connect the two."
CPE_8,"Text: ""I have never started a novel with more uncertainty. If I call it a novel, it is only because I don’t know what else to call it. I have little story to tell and I do not end with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave my reader hanging. This book is about my memories of a man I met only occasionally, and I do not know much about what happened to him in between our meetings. I could invent details to make my story more complete, but I do not want to do that. I just want to write down what I know. To avoid embarrassing living people, I have given the characters in this story names I made up, and I have taken care to ensure that no one can recognize them. The man I am writing about is not famous. He may never be. When his life ends, he might leave no more trace of his existence than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the water's surface. If my book is read at all, it will be read for its own interest. However, it is possible that his way of life and the unique qualities of his character may influence others, so that long after he is gone, people may realize that a remarkable person lived in this time. Then it will be clear who I am writing about, and those who want to know a bit about his early life may find something useful in this book. I believe my book, despite its limitations, will be a helpful source of information for my friend’s biographers. I do not claim that the conversations I recorded are exact. I never took notes of what was said, but I remember well what concerns me. Although I have put these conversations in my own words, I believe they accurately reflect what was said. I mentioned earlier that I have invented nothing, but I have taken the liberty that historians take to create speeches for the characters that I did not hear. I did this to make the scenes more lively and believable, as they would be less effective if simply told. I want to be read, and I think I am justified in making my book engaging. The thoughtful reader will easily see where I have used this technique and can choose to ignore it. Another reason I feel nervous about this work is that the people I write about come from a different culture. It is hard to truly know people, and I believe you can only really know your own countrymen. People are shaped by their surroundings: the place they were born, the home they grew up in, the games they played, the food they ate, the schools they attended, the sports they followed, and the poets they read. All these experiences shape who they are, and you cannot understand them just by hearing about them; you must live them. You can only know them if you are one of them. Because you cannot fully understand people from a different nation except through observation, it is challenging to give them authenticity in a book. I have never tried to write about anyone but my own countrymen, and if I have done so in short stories, it is because you can treat characters more briefly in those. You give the reader general ideas and let them fill in the details. In this book, I do not claim that my characters see themselves as they truly are; they are seen, like my main character, through my own perspective."""
CPE_4,"**POETRY RECITALS**

At any time in history, the literary world can seem confusing to those living in it. It is only later that people can see clear patterns and important figures in literature. Right now, there is a complex mix of poetic styles, types of poetry, and different opinions on how poetry should be presented, criticized, and taught. 

The current debate in contemporary poetry mainly involves two groups: serious 'literary' poets, who write poems meant to be read on the page, and 'popular' performing poets, who prefer to share their work with an audience. However, this division is not strict. Over the past twenty years, public poetry readings have become more common in various forms. Small literary groups in towns hold readings in community centers or members' homes; schools and colleges invite poets to speak to students; and arts festivals often feature poetry readings by well-known authors.

The effects of these events, where poets often have to perform in public, are varied and uncertain. For 'pop' poets, whose work is designed for live audiences, public performance is beneficial. Their poems are usually simple in form and content, making them easy to understand in one hearing. However, the weaknesses in their thought and technique may become clear when read on the page.

On the other hand, poets who are dedicated to their craft and aim to continue the best traditions of poetry—compressing deep feelings, thoughts, and creativity into a small space—may not be appreciated by audiences who are hearing their work for the first time. The risk is that these poets might choose to read only their simplest work to connect quickly with the audience, which may not represent their true style.

Attending poetry readings cannot replace reading poetry on the page, but it can be enjoyable and educational. Hearing good poets read their work, even if they are not great speakers, helps the audience understand where to place emphasis. It is best if the audience has the text in front of them or knows the poems beforehand.

The main reason for popular poetry recitals, sometimes mixed with music (like jazz), is to help audiences enjoy poetry and see it as an art form for everyone, not just a select few."
CPE_30,"**Oral History**  
Historians increasingly use oral evidence, but this approach has challenges. It is overly simplistic to think that a person's testimony is a clear reflection of their past experiences. In an interview, both the interviewer and the interviewee influence each other. The historian chooses who to interview and what topics to discuss. Even if the historian only listens, their presence can change how the informant remembers and shares their past. The final account is shaped by the historian's social position and their understanding of history, which may be communicated to the informant. Therefore, historians must acknowledge their role in creating new evidence. The challenges continue even after the historian leaves. The informant's memories are not direct connections to the past; they can be influenced by other sources, like the media. Memories may also be colored by nostalgia or feelings of loss from childhood, which can distort the original experiences. Listeners may find the emotions in the testimony convincing, but these feelings might come from later experiences rather than the time being discussed.

**Animal Science**  
There are two main approaches to animal science: the physiological approach and the whole animal approach. Physiologists focus on how the body functions, including how nerves, muscles, and senses work together to create complex behaviors. Those who take the whole animal approach study the behavior of animals in their natural state and the factors that influence this behavior. Within this approach, there are psychologists and ethologists. Psychologists often work in labs studying a limited number of species, like rats and pigeons, while ethologists study animals in the wild and their natural behaviors. Although these distinctions still exist, there is now a blending of the two fields. Physiologists often claim that their methods are more fundamental. However, understanding how nerve cells work does not eliminate the need to study behavior at a broader level. Behavior has its own structure and units that must be considered. Trying to explain a bird's nest-building behavior by only looking at individual nerve cells would be like trying to read a book with a microscope.

**The Social Sciences**  
Students studying social sciences for the first time face a dual challenge. They need to learn both the content of their new subject and the methods used to study it. This means they must understand not only the knowledge and research findings in textbooks but also the methods used to gather and organize this knowledge. These two aspects are closely connected. While we all have experience with social life, social sciences go beyond common sense. Each discipline focuses on specific aspects of social life, uses particular research methods, and has its own set of concepts. These basic ideas form the logical foundation of the subject, allowing social scientists to move beyond everyday understanding and differentiate one discipline from another.

**Classical Architecture**  
In the classical world of Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building structures. According to the Roman architect Vitruvius, architecture involves Order, Arrangement, Proportion, Symmetry, Propriety, and Distribution. He also provides Greek equivalents for some of these terms, likely based on earlier Greek sources that are now lost. While utility and function are not part of his initial definition, Vitruvius later discusses the best forms and arrangements for different types of buildings. At the start, the focus is on the artistic aspect of architecture. The origins of classical architecture are complex, with a long history of simple structures, like huts, in Greece and Italy that did not meet Vitruvius' artistic standards. Although these early structures may seem basic, they contributed important elements that influenced later architectural designs. Essentially, despite its elaborate appearance, the classical temple is rooted in the simplicity of a single-roomed hut."
CPE_7,"The two sisters kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for a while. She would drive around the gardens and the railway line, jumping over a small bridge with all four wheels in the air, which was Lily's only mistake. After that, they would pass the gasworks, where there was a strong smell of sulphur. Chen, however, found it funny that his wife was driving without him knowing. ""So you can really drive, Lily? Well done!"" he said. Mui thought men were strange. Her brother-in-law should have been upset, but instead, he was excited and made plans with Lily for a trip. They decided to go on a Monday at the start of next month, the quietest day of the week, leaving early in the morning and returning by midday to avoid losing customers. In the meantime, Lily would practice driving. Despite her doubts, Mui bought a road map and got a ten percent discount, which impressed Chen, but Lily felt a bit insulted by Mui's lack of trust in her navigation skills.

Within an hour of leaving home, they were looking at the English Channel. Lily drove very well. Even Mui, who was in the back seat ready to give directions, had to admit this. On the road, Lily overtook a couple of slow cars with great skill, making Mui hold back her protests. Chen even applauded her. After passing the gasworks in the seaside town, they drove smoothly along the empty promenade. Lily parked in a small street off the seafront, where there were many empty parking spaces. She was unsure about the road markings and preferred to pay for parking rather than risk being towed or getting a ticket. Would this show Mui that she was being careful? 

On the way down, Lily noticed her sister's worried face in the driving mirror. She thought it might be best not to add to Mui's worries. Lily locked all the van doors and checked each one carefully. ""Don't worry,"" Chen joked. ""No one will want that old thing."" The sisters were annoyed. Lily accused Chen of being ungrateful, and Mui scolded him for being too quick to judge by appearances. Surprised, Chen took Man Kee ahead of the sisters to look at the grey sea. He lifted his son onto the railing and held him close. Man Kee was warm and responsive, placing his tiny hand on his father's sleeve. In that moment, Chen decided to raise his son his way. He wanted Man Kee to have a good education and to grow up owning many restaurants, learning all about the business along the way. The gloomy sea made Chen feel thoughtful as he planned Man Kee's future.

There was a trail of smoke on the horizon, and then, sparkling in the morning sun, he saw a ship. Chen put a coin in a telescope and tried to find the ship. At first, he couldn't see it, but then he spotted it—a large, rusty tramp steamer. He lifted Man Kee to the eyepiece. ""Do you see the ship, Son?"" he asked gently. ""It’s a special little ship for people like us. It may be small and old, but that’s just what strangers see. We know better, don’t we, Son? It will take us back home when we are done here. It will take you to your homeland, which you have never seen."" Chen kissed the top of Man Kee's head. Behind them, Lily and Mui were watching. Lily put her arm around Chen's shoulders. ""The little old ship,"" Chen said. ""Let your mother see, Son."" Man Kee didn’t want to let go of the telescope, and when he finally did, the whirring stopped, leaving Lily with just a blurry circle of light. By the time Chen found another coin, the ship had disappeared over the horizon, and Lily was left watching seagulls searching for food in the water."
CPE_43,"**THE WELL**

I had read that if you dig a deep enough hole, you could see the stars on a clear day. I convinced you to help me with my plan. You watched, eyes wide, as I pulled up the well bucket, steadied it on the wall, and then climbed in. I told you to let me down. I didn’t think about how heavy the bucket was or that you might not be strong enough to hold it. You held the handle, trying to help as I pushed the bucket off the side of the well. As soon as it was free, I fell. You screamed and tried to stop it, but then you let go. I fell into the well and hit my head. At that moment, I didn’t realize I had achieved part of my plan. I saw strange lights, like the stars I usually saw in cartoons when a character got hurt. At first, I was dazed, then scared, then relieved, and finally angry at you for letting me fall and worried about what Mother would say. You called down to check if I was okay. I opened my mouth to shout, but then I heard panic in your voice, and I couldn’t speak. I lay still, just able to see you through my eyelashes. You disappeared, calling for help. I waited a moment, then climbed back up and pulled myself over the edge, landing on the courtyard stones. I heard alarmed voices coming from the castle's main door. I ran the other way, down to the passage leading to the moat bridge, and hid in the shadows. Mother and Father appeared with you and old Arthur; Mother was screaming, waving her hands. Father shouted for Arthur to pull on the winch handle. You stood back, looking pale and shocked. I was hidden in the shadows, feeling a rush of excitement. Then I noticed the drops of water I had left from the well to where I stood. I looked in horror at the dark spots of dirty water on the dry stones. At my feet, the water had formed a small pool. I looked back into the courtyard, where Father was shining a flashlight down into the well. The drops sparkled in the sunlight. I couldn’t believe no one had seen them. Mother was now screaming loudly, a sound I had never heard before. It shook me deeply. What should I do? I had gotten back at you, but what now? This had quickly become more serious than I expected, turning from a fun prank into something that would lead to serious punishment, likely for me. I regretted not thinking this through. In just a few minutes, my clever plan had turned into a disaster. Suddenly, a new idea came to me, like a lifeline to a drowning person. I gathered my courage and left my hiding place, staggering out and blinking. I called out softly, one hand on my forehead, then yelled louder when no one heard me. I stumbled a bit further and then fell dramatically on the stones. Sitting up, comforted by my crying mother, I sighed and said, ""Oh dear,"" smiling bravely. I claimed that I had found a secret tunnel from the bottom of the well to the moat, and crawled through it until I got out, climbed up the bridge, and walked through the passageway. I thought I was almost getting away with it until Father squatted in front of me. He made me repeat my story. I hesitated. His eyes narrowed. Thinking I was covering up a mistake, I said the secret passage had collapsed after me; there was no point in sending someone to look for it. I insisted the well was dangerous and that I had barely escaped with my life. Looking into my father's eyes felt like looking into a dark tunnel with no light at the end. It seemed like he was seeing me for the first time, and I was seeing how my lies would look to me when I was his age. My words got stuck in my throat. ""Don't be ridiculous, boy,"" he said, sounding more contemptuous than I thought possible. He stood up and walked away. Arthur looked down at me, his expression sad and troubled. He seemed to want to shake his head, not because I had a scary adventure and was unfairly disbelieved by my father, but because he could see through my sad lie and worried about my character and future. His pity felt like a harsh rebuke, confirming that this was the mature judgment of my actions and my father's, not something I could ignore. It affected me deeply."
CPE_51,"**REMOVAL DAY**

Now that her children are grown, Susan, who is a widow, must leave her family home. The van had 'Removers of Distinction' written on it, and indeed, everything that made the house special was being taken away. Fred, the removal man, with his large fingers, carefully handled the fragile items, while his team was not as gentle. The house was beautiful, a four-story building overlooking a small harbor. The memories of her children growing up there lingered in the air, like dust. When they first bought the house, her son Robert, who was five at the time, had asked, ""Mum, how do you get a house home?"" It was easy to miss the little boy he used to be; now he was here, helping, especially making sure she didn’t forget about the piano. Francesca, her daughter, was also helping, insisting that only she could take care of the fine Steinway piano.

Fred commented, ""She doesn’t look like she’s going to cry."" Susan asked, ""Do people cry?"" Fred replied, ""You’d be surprised. They seem happy while packing, but then they cry in an empty room. They’re fine once they get to the new place; it’s just hard to see everything taken apart."" Susan understood that feeling. If it were up to her, she would have warned the movers about the piano before accepting their estimate. Robert insisted it was the movers' responsibility to notice any issues. The piano stood alone in the upstairs sitting room, the best room in the house. They would move it last.

Sitting on the bottom stair, with all the chairs gone, she remembered the day they moved in. Today felt like that day played in reverse—the piano had been the first thing brought in, and it got stuck on the stairs. The removal team struggled for nearly two hours, trying to get it up the stairs while little Robert watched in awe, and Francesca cried, ""We can’t live in a house without a piano!"" They had to find a way to get it inside, and Peter, her late husband, had solved the problem. The piano was left in the garden while the other furniture was moved in. The next day, a builder was hired to remove the first-floor window. A crane was borrowed from the quay below, and the piano was carefully lifted through the window while the children cheered with joy. However, it cost so much that it took months before they could afford to have it tuned.

""That’s that,"" Peter had said. ""That’s there forever."" But forever is a long time. The children were too busy to visit on weekends, and Susan found it harder to move around the house. The thought of the stairs interrupted her memories. The banister rails were still not perfectly aligned; she should have warned the movers about that. But now it was too late. Any moment now, they would discover it. She looked around, feeling dazed and anxious. ""Are you all right?"" Fred asked. ""Just the piano left, and then we’ll be on our way."" She stepped away from the stair, her heart racing. Robert and Francesca appeared in the hallway to watch. ""No tears then?"" Fred asked casually. Truthfully, she was close to tears. It was strange how moving things made them feel so important. Chairs, cups, and countless items that seemed unimportant while they were in place now felt full of emotion, begging to be cared for. She felt she might cry at any moment.

Just then, the piano appeared, being carefully brought down the stairs by Fred and another mover. ""Easy does it!"" Fred called out as they carried it smoothly out the front door and set it down behind the van. Robert was the first to laugh, and soon they were all laughing, relieved that it was over. They leaned against each other, gasping for breath and laughing uncontrollably. ""What’s the joke?"" Fred asked, but his question only made them laugh more. So, as they walked down the path for the last time, the only tears Susan shed were tears of laughter."
CPE_11,"**Text: Online Literary Criticism for Everyone**

**Do-it-yourself literary criticism: Is it just harmless fun?**

From the beginning, one of the main ideas behind the Internet was open access. In theory, anyone could publish their thoughts or share music online. However, in the early days, some technical skills were needed. Still, there was one area that became truly accessible to everyone: literary criticism. By visiting Amazon.com, the first popular online bookstore, anyone could try writing book reviews. 

Amazon's approach to book reviews was simple: anyone could share their opinion and give a book up to five stars. Each book had its own page, and when a reader wrote a new review, it appeared automatically. This allowed Amazon to fill its site with free reviews, and potential buyers could see what other readers thought, rather than just relying on publisher descriptions or professional critics.

Other online bookstores, which also had physical stores, offered similar features. However, Amazon was the largest, controlling over 80% of the online market. This meant it had the most customers and received the most reviews, but it also faced many issues. With thousands of reviews submitted each day, it was impossible to check them all. Instead, a team of editors looked for reviews that followed the company's rules. For example, single-word reviews or personal attacks on authors were not allowed. Reviews that revealed the ending or referenced other reviews were also banned. However, since reviewers could remain anonymous, inappropriate reviews were only removed if Amazon's editors noticed them. This created opportunities for mischief.

For instance, there was nothing stopping authors from writing positive reviews of their own books. One author, Lev Grossman, was upset by the negative reviews of his first novel, so he wrote several anonymous positive reviews to balance things out. His trick worked until he wrote an article about it, and then the fake reviews were removed.

Authors had a way to share their thoughts too, by clicking a link that said, ""I am the Author, and I wish to comment on my book."" Most authors used this feature to encourage readers to buy and enjoy their books. Some even shared their email addresses for direct communication. However, while Amazon checked these messages, it did not verify that they were really from the authors. This was different for well-known authors. A lesser-known writer once submitted a comment pretending to be famous author John Updike, claiming to be an ""over-hyped middlebrow author."" Unsurprisingly, it was removed as a fake.

The real drama began with reader reviews, not author comments. When James McElroy's book, *We've Got Spirit*, about a small-town cheerleading team, was published, it received good reviews from the mainstream press. However, many people mentioned in the book felt hurt, and they used Amazon to express their anger. Many critical reviews appeared but disappeared a few days later. Despite this, Amazon saw the large number of people writing and reading reviews as good for business. 

Amazon wanted reviews to be a place to discuss books, not just a chat room. Therefore, they paid special attention to bestselling books to ensure all reviews followed the rules. This meant that silly reviews were more likely to appear on pages for less popular books. For example, *The Story about Ping*, a classic children's book about a duck, inspired some humorous reviews because ""ping"" is also a term used in Internet technology. One long review compared the book's plot to Internet architecture, claiming it provided a ""good overview"" of networking concepts. However, such silliness was rare.

Most reader reviews on Amazon were taken very seriously. Overall, these reviews gave a surprisingly accurate idea of whether a product was worth buying. The writer George Orwell once said that reviewing too many books meant constantly pretending to have feelings about books he didn’t care about. This makes the open access to writing reviews a positive development."
CPE_14,"**Text: Art in Modern Times**

In recent years, especially over the last two hundred years, we often think that every artist must go against the art of their time. Art is celebrated for being unique, revolutionary, and sometimes shocking. We enjoy admiring artists whose work was not valued a hundred years ago. However, when it comes to contemporary art, we often hesitate and claim that some artists have gone too far, suggesting that their work is no longer art. The media often expresses these views for us, and we tend to agree because we expect art to always be new and puzzling. This expectation makes us overlook the old themes, methods, and qualities that are still present in today’s art. We want artists to be different from us, with special talents and energy that break free from traditional norms. In the past, people commissioned artists for specific purposes, and art was part of everyday life. Today, we leave artists to work on their own and often get frustrated if they try to connect with us.

**Picture This**

I will describe a situation and then ask an important question about it. I hope it makes sense. Here’s the situation: An artist picks a piece of text from an art book. The text talks about the variety of pictures and asks, “What are they all about?” It then concludes, “There is no end to the different kinds of pictures.” This language seems childish, and it reflects simple thinking. But stay with me. After choosing his text, the artist asks someone to prepare a canvas for him and then to take it to a sign painter. He instructs the sign painter to write the chosen text on the canvas in a simple way, without any fancy designs. The sign painter follows these instructions and writes the text in plain black letters on a white canvas. My important question is: Is this finished piece a painting?

**Underground Encounters**

At the Mercury Gallery in London until June 26, there is an unspoken rule for painters: once you find a successful style, you should stick to it. Collectors expect artists to keep producing similar work, and if they try something new, it often leads to disappointment among the public. I’m not sure why this is the case. Gallery owners prefer safe choices, and perhaps art buyers feel more secure with familiar styles. However, some artists break this pattern and succeed. Picasso and Hockney are two well-known examples. Eric Rimmington is another artist who is now trying something different, and it will be interesting to see if he succeeds. His new exhibition replaces the still lifes that made him famous with paintings inspired by the London Underground. Rimmington finds a unique charm in railways. His sketches from the 1980s of Kings Cross Station led him to explore what happens underground. These sketches have become the basis for ""Underground Encounters,"" an exhibition of 40 paintings and drawings that capture the fascinating world beneath the city, designed for people in transit.

**Extract from a Novel**

I have come to this island with a few books. I’m not sure why I use the word “escape.” The villagers joke that only a sick person would choose such a remote place to recover. So, I have come here to heal myself, if you want to see it that way. Besides an old peasant who comes daily on her mule to clean my house, I am quite alone. I feel neither happy nor sad; I am suspended in a mix of memories. I mentioned the uselessness of art but did not speak about its comforts. The comfort of my work, both mental and emotional, lies in the fact that only in the quiet moments of a painter or writer can reality be reshaped and shown in a meaningful way. Our everyday actions are like a rough covering that hides the true beauty underneath. For us artists, art offers a joyful way to deal with the pain or struggles we face in daily life. This allows us not to escape our fate, as ordinary people might try to do, but to realize its true potential through imagination. Otherwise, why should we hurt one another?"
CPE_63,"**Family Business**

""Look, this isn't good!"" said my Dad. We were in the car heading back to London. My father, with my brother Maurice beside him, had just picked me up and my trunk from the fancy girls' school I attended. He had also just been to Parent's Day, where I received the Latin prize and the award for the best end-of-school exams. He had a long talk with my headteacher, and now we were on our way home for the holidays.

""What isn't?"" I asked, though I had a feeling I knew what he was thinking because he was unusually quiet. Normally, he talked a lot. ""You can't fool me. You'll do what you want now,"" he said. ""With all those certificates, I heard you will get a scholarship to Oxford."" 

""So?"" I replied, trying to act tough. ""Mightn't that be useful?"" 

""I also understand,"" he continued, and I knew a confrontation was coming, ""that you want to be a barrister. A barrister!"" My father knew a lot about barristers and the law. 

""I just said that,"" I replied. ""I couldn't think of anything else!"" 

""And apparently,"" he went on, ""you have the right personality - you can quickly understand complex information, you are good at speaking, and you enjoy performing."" 

""I don't know about that,"" I said. ""All I know is what I see on TV."" 

""Regardless,"" he said, gathering himself, ""I feel like your heart won't be in the family business. Obviously, you'll go to Oxford University, and after that, I can't see you wanting to join us."" 

The problem was that, like many children of family businesses, I felt trapped by my family's expectations. I could see many career options, and I wanted to explore them. At the same time, I didn't want to upset my father. I wasn't as scared of him as Maurice was - I was the favorite - but I still found him intimidating. 

""It's too soon to know,"" I said weakly. 

""I tell you, you're not going to want to join us,"" said my father, who often turned out to be right about such things. ""It's a shame because you have the talent - the intelligence, the courage, the vision."" 

""There's still Maurice,"" I said, feeling down. My father scoffed. We both knew Maurice disliked the business. 

""Anyway,"" I continued, ""you could always use me as a consultant."" My mother had passed away when I was young, and my father had raised me and Maurice. Maurice was two years younger than me, and since he was motherless, I had taken care of him from an early age. It wasn't hard; I loved Maurice. 

Because the business was successful, we lived comfortably - in a big house in London, attended nice schools, wore good clothes, and enjoyed parties, theaters, and operas. My father knew many people - politicians, actors, businessmen - and our home was full of interesting conversations. 

""I tell you what,"" my father continued. ""You can help us during the holidays until you leave Oxford, and then if you decide to leave us, you can. It will give you some pocket money and really help me."" 

""Okay,"" I said, relieved to avoid immediate choices and especially the sadness my father would feel if I disagreed with him. This was how he controlled us. 

So it happened. In my last term at school and during university breaks, I helped out, never more than twice a year, and always with the easier tasks. I became one of the top students, with a small house, a nice white car, designer clothes, and a black dress from Paris that I planned to wear for my final exams. 

In my last term, my father came to see me and took me to a village for a meal and a chat. There were only a few weeks left. My tutor predicted I would get a First Class degree in Law, and I knew that if I focused and organized my thoughts, he might be right. I felt ready, confident, and focused. 

But then my father told me that in about a week, he needed me to do one last important task for him, the biggest project the family business had ever attempted, and he promised it would be worth my while. 

""But Dad,"" I protested, ""I have my final exams coming up, and I need to focus on that. It's really important that I do well, and I don't want to think about anything else right now."" 

I could tell that my father couldn't understand the pressure I was under (or maybe he was jealous of my life away from him), and he would see my refusal as a betrayal in his time of need. As he explained the task, I saw more clearly than ever his determination - the clarity and resourcefulness with which he approached his work, his energy, and his self-control. In his way, he was a genius, and I respected that in him. It made my own plans seem less important. 

""All right,"" I said. ""I'll do it."""
CPE_56,"Simon Costello realized that buying the house in Pembroke Square was a mistake within a year of moving in with Lois. A possession that requires strict budgeting is often not worth having at all. At the time, however, it seemed like a sensible and desirable choice. He had been successful in his work, and cases were coming in regularly. Lois returned to her job at the advertising agency just two months after giving birth to their twins and received a raise that brought her salary to thirty-five thousand. She had strongly pushed for the move, and Simon had not resisted her arguments, which seemed convincing at the time: their flat was not suitable for a family, they needed more space, a garden, and separate accommodation for an au pair. These needs could have been met in a suburb or a less trendy part of London, but Lois wanted more than just extra space. Mornington Mansions was not a suitable address for a rising barrister and a successful businesswoman. Even saying the name made her feel that it lowered her social and economic status. Lois decided that one of them should save money by using public transport, and since her firm was on the other side of London, Simon had to be the one to cut costs. The crowded tube ride became a frustrating thirty minutes of brooding over his dissatisfaction. He remembered his grandfather's house in Hampstead, the smell of dinner, and his grandmother's insistence that the tired breadwinner should be given peace and comfort after a long day in court. She had been a supportive 'lawyer's wife', active in legal causes and present at all lawyer events, seemingly happy in her role. But that world was gone. Lois had made it clear before they married that her career was just as important as his. This was a modern marriage, and both their jobs were crucial for their lifestyle. Their whole way of living depended on two incomes. Now, what they had worked hard to achieve was at risk because of Venetia, who had come to their office in a bad mood. Something had upset her, and she confronted Simon with intense anger. He cursed himself for not leaving his room earlier; if he had, the confrontation might not have happened, and she could have had time to think things over. He remembered her angry accusations clearly. ""I defended Brian Cartwright today. He told me that when you were his lawyer four years ago, you knew he had bribed three jurors before the trial. You did nothing. Is that true?"" ""He's lying. That's not true."" ""He also said he gave shares in his company to your fiancée before the trial. Is that true?"" ""I tell you, he's lying. None of it is true."" His denial felt instinctive, like raising an arm to block a blow, but it sounded unconvincing even to him. He felt guilty, and the cold horror on his face was replaced by a hot flush, bringing back memories of being punished in school. He looked into her eyes and saw her contempt. If only he had been warned. He now knew what he should have said: ""Cartwright told me after the trial, but I didn't believe him. I still don't believe him. That man will say anything to make himself look important."" Instead, he had told a more direct and dangerous lie, and she knew it was a lie. But why was she so angry? What did his past actions have to do with her? Who had made Venetia the judge of their legal practice? Was her own conscience so clear? Was she right to threaten his career? He wasn't sure what she could do or how far she would go, but if this rumor spread, it could ruin him."
CPE_36,"Text: 'I chose this place to live because I thought I would be anonymous among people who didn’t mind if their rented houses were falling apart or if their gardens were messy. I was wrong. The shopkeepers, who are living their real lives, soon start to recognize you, even if you don’t know them. The beautiful roses from next door remind me that gardens were once cared for. Usually, I stay inside to forget about the summer outside, but tonight, I am watching the swifts flying between the trees and roofs. I have trimmed the rosemary and lemon balm to make space for a chair, and my arms are tingling from the scratches. It is a small London garden, where plants must grow tall or spread out to survive. 

“Been doing some clearing, I see,” says my upstairs neighbor, Jaz, leaning out of her window. She has written several unpublished manuscripts, and I sometimes have to pretend to know about them as an English teacher. I have her latest manuscript with me now. “How’s the work going, Jaz?” I ask. “For goodness sake. In no other job do people ask you about your work so many times a day,” she replies, her voice trailing off before she continues, “I have something to drink in the fridge. I’ll bring it down.” I don’t want Jaz in the garden, and I realize it looks messy and sad. The only way to access this garden is through my flat, and Jaz is knocking on my door. 

“So, you’re on holiday now, you lucky person,” she says, sitting in shorts and a tank top on the chair while I drop a cushion onto what used to be a small lawn. “Cheers,” she says, acting young. “I should’ve gone into teaching – a writer doesn’t have holidays. But you know what they say, those who can, do; those who can’t, teach.” And then there are those who can do neither. “So, what are your plans for the holidays?” All my worries about the end of the school year come rushing back. Empty days. Hot sidewalks covered in melting gum. The walk to the shops and back. The little park with its fountain, and loneliness sitting beside me on the bench. 

“Actually, I’m going to Stonebridge tomorrow. I need to ask if you could feed the cats.” My heart races as I say this. “Of course I will,” Jaz replies, knowing she will be around. “Where will you stay? A fancy bed and breakfast?” “No, I’ll be staying with my oldest friend, Ruby, at the Rising Sun. We’ve known each other since we were eight.” This isn’t true, but I often deal with fiction. “Going back to your roots. So what do you think of my work so far?” My silence makes Jaz ask about her manuscript, The Cruelty of Red Vans, which is half-read on my desk. I like the title and tell her so. I can see how red vans could be cruel, always bringing gifts to other houses and returning her manuscripts in silly bags. 

Something makes me speak honestly for once. “Let me give you a little tip,” I say. “What?” she asks, looking offended. “Try writing about nice people for a change, people who want to be good: a little less self-centeredness, a bit more fiction…” “Teachers!” Jaz replies, like a rebellious student about to take back a poorly graded paper. “I keep a journal, I have for years, where I write something good, no matter how small, about each day.” My words sound as old-fashioned as my dress. “Keep a journal! Nice people! Get a life, Ann.” Oh, I have a life. I have my work, and I go out sometimes and read on the tube. When we finally go inside, my calm kitchen gives me a moment of comfort, but suddenly I remember my school geography teacher, Miss Tarrantine, who was about my age now, closing one eye in a strange wink as she told us, “I’ve had my moments.” We nearly died laughing.'"
CPE_6,"**Heritage**

Heritage is important because it connects people and communities to their past. We often feel connected to our personal heritage, knowing about our grandparents and hearing stories about their lives. However, there is also a broader need to understand our history to help us shape our individual and national futures. Heritage represents a desire for continuity; knowing about the past helps us feel secure about the future. Just as we inherit our genes, we also inherit a culture passed down through generations. There may be parts of our national heritage that we do not like, but it is still a part of us, and it is comforting to feel connected to something larger. Heritage teaches us a lot and is essential for our well-being, influencing everything from traditions to material culture. Traditionally, we learned about the past through stories and legends from our ancestors. However, in modern Western society, many of these oral traditions have been lost due to the breakdown of communities and families. Now, we often rely on places and historical buildings to understand our past. It is crucial to preserve and restore these connections as a tribute to our ancestors' identities.

**The Fens**

Some time ago, I started writing a novel called *Waterland*, where the landscape of a region in England known as the Fens became very important. After the book was published, people often asked why I, a Londoner with no personal ties to the area, chose to write about it. The simple answer is that I found the Fens interesting because they seemed like a flat and empty backdrop for my story. However, I soon realized that the Fens are not flat or empty at all. They are uniquely English yet also strangely captivating. It is surprising that in the heart of England, there is a place that many English people find unfamiliar, especially since many other distinct areas of Britain have become part of the national culture. The Fens are both empty and full, cultivated yet wild, seemingly simple but deeply mysterious. My own research while writing was not extensive; I have never visited Wisbech or Prickwillow. As a fiction writer, I prefer to imagine worlds rather than seek strict evidence. However, trying to ""imagine"" the Fens has its own logic, as shown in Edward Storey's scholarly work, which suggests that the Fens are not just a landscape but also a state of mind.

**Museums**

Museums need to make their collections easy to access. In the past, this meant simply putting items in display cases with long labels that were hard for the average person to understand. Today, accessibility should involve more than that. Displays can be engaging and use creative techniques to attract visitors and evoke emotions. However, museums should be about more than just displays; they should reach out to the widest community possible. For example, some museums provide loan boxes of objects for teachers, and recently, similar materials have been made available for elderly people with memory loss. Museums focus on real artefacts and specimens, not replicas. They exist to provide an authentic experience, showcasing items that have historical significance. This authenticity is what sets them apart from heritage centers, theme parks, books, and digital media. Museums that embrace this challenge and offer exciting displays and outreach programs will find that their competitors in ""virtual history"" can actually help create a desire for the real experiences that only museums can provide.

**Architecture and Environment**

The desire to preserve things is not new, but changes in our towns happen so quickly and on such a large scale that they affect most of us. This can make some people very protective of what they want to preserve, while others may think more deeply about the nature of our towns and their future. It can be argued that people who have lived through significant events, like world wars, are more inclined to value preservation than previous generations, as anything that represents stability becomes important. If there is a psychological need for preservation, planners must consider it. Change is not necessarily bad if we learn how to manage it. Physical changes in our towns reflect social changes, such as population growth, welfare, and our needs."
CPE_33,"**Text: Einstein**

If you stop someone on the street and ask them to name a scientist, they will likely say Albert Einstein. His image is often used to sell products that seem smart, like computers and encyclopedias. Most people know little about what Einstein actually did, except that he created some complex theories called 'relativity', which are known for being hard to understand and for making strange predictions that go against common experience. Einstein was part of a major change in scientific thought, a revolution that led to the development of modern science in the twentieth century. Physicists and mathematicians were trying to create a new, clearer description of the universe by studying how matter and natural forces interact. Einstein made significant contributions by rethinking the basics: time, space, matter, and energy. Earlier ideas were based on Isaac Newton's view of a universe where stars and planets moved in a fixed space and time. Einstein changed this idea, saying that time and space are not fixed but relative.

**Young Readers**

As children, Lydia and I often distrusted any book that won awards because we thought it would be boring. Our mother disapproved of our attitude, while our father would give us small coins as rewards to encourage us to read better books. He sometimes included a few good books in our Christmas and birthday gifts, marked with a note saying, 'This Book is NOT Literature'. Although we often dismissed his choices as 'boys' books', he did introduce us to some shorter works of good fiction and, once, to a famous collection of poetry.

**Language**

Jacob Grimm wrote in 1851, 'The origin of human language is truly secret and marvellous.' This mystery has led to many strange ideas. For example, Charles Caller suggested in 1928 that early humans made sounds like ""meuh"" when they sensed danger. This sound is sad. The early human who traveled through dangerous lands made desperate noises, and some words have kept a trace of this, like 'malaria', which means ""fever"", or the Latin word 'mors', which means ""death"". Many people avoided discussing the origin of language, thinking it was a topic for odd theories, but recently, the study of how language began and evolved has become very important. Language likely developed in East Africa about 100,000 years ago. Initially, speech was mainly used for friendly communication and was a key tool in struggles for power. Sharing information was probably not the main purpose of early language, which goes against the ideas of philosopher John Locke, who described language as a 'great conduit' for sharing knowledge."
CPE_20,"**Text: Writing Reviews**

Frank Kermode discusses the art of writing reviews from the perspective of someone who practices it. Most reviews are created and shared in ways that limit their lifespan. They often have strict deadlines and length restrictions, and once published, they are only relevant for a short time—usually a day, a week, or at most a month. The temporary nature of reviews often affects how they are viewed. Many people, including writers, believe that reviewing is not a desirable job and is often done out of necessity, such as needing money or because writers cannot spend all their time on a novel or serious book.

However, writing reviews is a skilled and complex task. Writing a concise review of six to eight hundred words for a newspaper is different from writing a detailed review of six to eight thousand words for an international journal. The length of the review is not the only factor to consider. Reviewers must think about their audience, which can range from casual readers to those deeply interested in the subject.

A good reviewer needs to have knowledge about various topics and must write in a way that is clear and enjoyable for intelligent readers. It is common for reviewers to also write other types of work. For example, American novelist John Updike, who is not particularly fond of criticism, still writes reviews between his novel projects. He collects all his reviews, no matter how short, into books with modest titles. 

Some might think that less prominent writers should accept the temporary nature of their reviews, but it is understandable if they want their work to have some lasting value, especially if they feel their best writing is found in reviews. I share this sentiment about my own work. My main focus has been academic writing, and my serious books are typically academic in nature, which is what professors are expected to produce.

In the English-speaking world, there is no strict separation between reviewing and literary study, unlike in some other cultures. It is common for the same individuals to engage in both activities. The days when academics criticized their peers for writing reviews are mostly over. Complaints from non-professors about professors taking opportunities away from them are also less frequent, partly because there are more reviewing opportunities now, and partly because the rewards are often minimal.

I believe this situation benefits both readers and professors. Readers can trust that reviewers have some expertise, and for professors, reviewing helps maintain their sanity. It also serves as a reminder that they should communicate clearly with non-professors. While they may feel the need to use complex language among themselves, they must ensure they are understandable when addressing a broader audience. Ultimately, reviewing is a secondary activity; it is something that can only be done well if one is also engaged in other work effectively."
CPE_40,"Ralph unlocked the door to his apartment and, as he stepped into the dark, still hallway, he felt a brief sense of ownership that still surprised him after three years of living there. When he first bought the flat, he would come home excited and curious, wondering what had happened while he was away. The flat felt like a welcoming place, a space where he could focus without distractions. He thought he should worry about possible intruders or broken pipes, but his flat always seemed to be waiting for him, either looking independent or neglected, depending on how tidy he had left it.

Over time, he began to see it as an extension of himself, a place where his thoughts and feelings spilled out. He grew frustrated with its inability to change. There were always a few letters piled up by the door and the answering machine sometimes blinked with messages when he returned. He was thankful that his windows were intact and that nothing had been stolen, though he often wondered what the flat would look like if something bad happened.

From his dull office on the third floor, Ralph looked forward to his quiet evenings at home. After leaving the busy office and starting his bus ride home, he realized he didn’t want to be alone anymore, even though he often thought he did. Sitting at his desk, he craved solitude and time to himself, but once he escaped, he felt empty and lost. He suspected that the work he did, which didn’t suit him, had changed him, moving him away from who he thought he was.

He would read or listen to music at night, but he began to wonder for whom or what he was doing these things. His sense of direction in life had faded, and his thoughts would come and go without making sense. He remembered a time when he felt more in control, when he might have recognized his own worth and found a way out of his situation. But he had been so eager to find something that he had followed the first opportunity that came his way, as if it was meant to be.

After university, he had tried to make a plan for a better life, but when he looked for ambition, he only found a quiet wish to get by. He applied for jobs he had heard about from friends, trailing behind them as they rushed toward their goals, unable to see how he could find happiness in his work. He went to one job interview, grateful for the chance, but didn’t think to evaluate the job itself—a vague editorial position at a local free newspaper. After a pleasant conversation with Neil, his future boss, he didn’t consider the long-term implications of the job. Neil offered him the position on the spot, saying he was the only graduate who had applied, which Ralph took as a compliment at the time."
CPE_45,"**Goat Racing**

I was about to see goat racing on Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. I pushed my way through ice-cream vans, large crowds, food stalls, and loud music. Although everyone was moving towards the racecourse, I tried to find a good spot to watch. An area was blocked off to create a course for the goats. It wasn’t as fancy as regular racecourses, but the idea was similar: spectators lined both sides of a stretch of ground where the goats would run. Keeping a few selected goats in line was not easy, especially since goats are known for eating almost anything they find.

**Canoe Trip**

As the day ended, I began to worry about the night ahead. The canoe was too wet to sleep in, there was nowhere to stop, and we hadn’t seen any villages or huts since early morning. In the dim moonlight, we could barely see the cliffs. Our torch batteries were dying, so we replaced them, but the new ones didn’t work. Clearly, we wouldn’t be able to find a place to camp. A few miles later, Lesley shouted that she saw a distant flickering light, and we felt hopeful. However, the light turned out to be moonlight reflecting on the waves. Soon, we could hear the loud sound of rushing water, but we couldn’t see what was happening. Time seemed to stop as we continued on.

**How to be Presentation Perfect**

I am not naturally good at making presentations, but as managing director, I often need to present to my colleagues and major shareholders. How can I improve my presentation skills and confidence? You are not alone. Giving a presentation requires different skills than running a company, yet many senior executives are expected to be good at it. If you want to convince your audience, you must believe in what you are saying. Show your belief through the passion and enthusiasm you bring to your presentation. This means you need to prepare well. Test your ideas beforehand and ask colleagues to help identify the tough questions your audience might ask. You should also create a positive atmosphere from the start. Begin with something everyone can relate to and gradually lead to the conclusion you want to reach."
CPE_64,"Text: 

Some activities cannot be rushed; they take the time they need. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you are impatient with mayonnaise and add the oil too quickly, it will curdle. If you pull on a tangled fishing line in frustration, the knot will only get tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some functions happen very quickly, while others take seconds, minutes, hours, days, or even years. Some tasks can be sped up, like solving crossword puzzles or doing math in your head. However, others cannot be rushed, and if you try, they may fail, like the mayonnaise or the fishing line.

The idea of ""Think fast; we need results"" can sometimes be as unhelpful as trying to shorten a night's sleep. We learn, think, and understand in various ways, and these different modes of thinking work at different speeds and are suited for different tasks. There are sayings like ""He who hesitates is lost"" and ""Look before you leap,"" and both have truth in them.

Generally, the mind has three different processing speeds. The first is faster than thought. Some situations require an immediate, instinctive reaction. For example, when my motorbike skidded on a wet road in London, my body and brain quickly coordinated movements to keep me safe, and only afterward did my conscious mind catch up. A concert pianist or an Olympic fencer also does not have time to think about their next move. This quick physical intelligence can be called our ""wits.""

Next is thought itself, which involves reasoning, weighing options, and solving problems. A mechanic figuring out why an engine won’t start, a scientist interpreting an experiment, or a student working on an assignment are all using this logical thinking, often referred to as ""intellect."" People who excel at these tasks are often called ""bright"" or ""clever.""

Finally, there is a slower mental process that is less focused and more relaxed. In this mode, we reflect or daydream. When we are at the beach, listening to the waves, or just on the edge of sleep, we are in a different mental state than when we are planning a meal or writing a letter. This slower, seemingly aimless way of thinking is just as valuable as the faster types. Allowing the mind to wander is not a luxury; it is essential, especially when life gets busy. We need both the ""tortoise mind"" and the ""hare brain.""

Some everyday problems are better approached with a slow mind. Certain mysteries can only be understood with a relaxed attitude. Recent studies show that patient, less deliberate thinking is especially good for understanding complex situations. Deliberate thinking works well for clear problems. For example, deciding where to go on holiday may have obvious factors. But when the situation is unclear or complex, we need the tortoise mind. 

If the issue is how to manage a difficult team at work or whether to change careers, it may be wiser to sit and think rather than rush for answers. This type of intelligence is linked to creativity and wisdom. Poets have long recognized the limits of conscious thinking and have tried to nurture these slower ways of knowing. Philosophers have discussed the parts of the mind that go beyond conscious thought. Recently, scientists have begun to study these slower, less deliberate ways of knowing. The field of cognitive science is showing that the unconscious mind can accomplish many interesting and important tasks if given time. It can recognize patterns that conscious thought cannot see, make sense of complex situations, and solve difficult problems more effectively than quick thinking."
CPE_29,"**Text: Surviving in a Foreign Land**

I have been welcomed warmly. It’s a friendly and well-equipped base camp in a very isolated area. At any time, there are about forty people—scientists, students, weather experts, satellite trackers—in a close community where everyone helps out. My basic French is just enough to communicate, but not to have casual conversations. I miss the subtleties of the language, and my phrasebook is not helpful at breakfast. This isn’t a practical problem for me, but at first, I struggled with self-confidence. I found myself a bit anxious about mealtimes. I would hesitate, worried about which table to choose, scared of the silence that followed when I spoke, and feeling anxious in a way I haven’t felt since my early school days. I still smile awkwardly or feel nervous when people talk to me. I think this occasional sadness is not about missing company or communication; it’s because I’ve lost the social confidence that my ability to talk easily has always given me.

**Elliot**

When I first met Elliot, I was just a young author like many others, and he didn’t pay much attention to me. He always remembered faces, though, and when I saw him here and there, he would shake my hand politely but didn’t seem interested in getting to know me better. If I saw him at the opera, for example, he would often ignore me if he was with someone important. But then I had a surprising success as a playwright, and I noticed that Elliot started to look at me more warmly. One day, I got a note from him inviting me to lunch, and I thought he was testing me. After that, since my success brought me many new friends, I began to see him more often.

**Alfred Hitchcock**

The film director Alfred Hitchcock always said that he didn’t care about the story of his films or the acting, but he did care about the visuals and the sound. For Hitchcock, it wasn’t a message that moved the audience, nor was it a great performance; he believed that people respond to pure film, regardless of their cultural background. So, if a film is made well in terms of its emotional effect, the Japanese audience should react at the same time as the Indian audience. Hitchcock’s self-assessment was always clear and logical; he was a reasonable man and a brilliant craftsman who enjoyed hearing an audience react. He didn’t focus on speculation, abstract ideas, or intellectual references, and his view of his own characters was straightforward. He concentrated on film—pure film—and the most objective, measurable beauty of what a film can do to an audience."
CPE_57,"**Text: Amateur Astronomy**

Many things have changed in astronomy over the last fifty years. Until about thirty years ago, there were not many charts and catalogues available. Telescopes were limited, and there were few books on practical astronomy. Today, there is a wide variety of telescopes and equipment available for everyone. Electronic calculators and computers have changed how almanacs and charts are made, and they have made it easier to analyze observations and publish results. This could be seen as the golden age of amateur astronomy. However, a lot has also been lost. Now, you may have to travel 80 kilometers to find a dark sky, which was easier to find in urban areas fifty years ago. Daytime skies are now often filled with airplane trails that can last for hours and spread out into clouds, making it hard to observe the sun and stars at night.

**Too Much Choice**

Society is becoming overwhelmed by choices. There are too many things to do, too many options, and too many opportunities. In today’s economy, the desire for new products and services has become an addiction, and technology speeds up the pace of change. The constant noise and the flood of new goods and services create more choices. Just as a new product is released, another one is ready to launch. This can be overwhelming and tiring, leading to a feeling of disconnection from life. While choice is celebrated in the new economy, having more choices can lead to more stress, less time, and more complexity. As a result, people are looking for 'simplexity'—the simple things that bring meaning in a complicated world. However, simplifying life is not easy in a time of excess. There are more basic brands of detergent and breakfast cereals than we need, and more software updates and plans than we can keep track of.

**McAndrews Hotel**

Every summer, we spend two weeks at McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. This is a family tradition started by my grandmother, and it has become very important to us. Nothing is allowed to disrupt this ritual. We are a specific type of guest at McAndrews: old-fashioned and perhaps a bit snobbish. I dislike the bad manners and rudeness of shop assistants that some people see as equality; I do not appreciate the overly friendly behavior of waiters who seem to struggle to keep from being too familiar. I know the names of most of the other guests—like me, they have been coming here since childhood—but I can be sure that when I see them in the hotel, we will only exchange polite greetings. This respect for dignity and personal space is hard to find in commercial places today."

**Othello**  
The move of a remarkable production of Shakespeare's play *Othello* from Stratford to London gives me a chance to correct an unfair review I wrote when the show first opened last spring. At that time, I said that Ray Fearon was too young for the title role and I criticized his acting. I still believe it changes the tragedy to ignore the age difference between Othello and Desdemona, but I take back my comments about Mr. Fearon's outstanding performance. The entire cast is excellent. Memorable scenes include the one where Cassio's competitive games with other young officers become dangerous, and the moment when Iago starts to lose control and struggles to regain it. I challenge anyone not to be moved to tears during the scene where Emilia helps Desdemona get ready for bed. The pace and tension throughout the play are fantastic. Do not miss this production.

**Lake Vostok**  
In the center of Antarctica, there is nothing alive. On the edges of the continent, there are many penguins, seals, and birds. But in the vast white area in the middle, life cannot survive. However, there is a large hidden body of freshwater called Lake Vostok, which is under nearly 4 kilometers of ice, directly beneath the coldest place on Earth. The water has been cut off from air and sunlight for up to 25 million years. Biologists are eager to explore its mysterious depths and find out what strange organisms might be there. Geologists and glaciologists are also interested. For two years, researchers around the world have been planning ways to uncover the lake's secrets, and if they succeed, we will soon see a lot of discoveries about Lake Vostok.

**Scientists**  
Last week, I heard something interesting on the radio. A group of scientists is discussing what motivates them to be scientists; the phrase ""because it's there"" comes to mind. We all know it is the long-standing quest for knowledge, the wish to understand everything from atoms to black holes. But these scientists want to know why we have this desire for knowledge and why science cannot explain this desire. I think it is more important to know if what we scientists are doing is right, rather than getting stuck in debates about the purpose of it all. I believe the key issue is not why we pursue science, but to understand that science is a tool, and we should decide how, where, when, and why to use it."

**Food**  
Our relationship with food is very basic and fulfilling. Many people who enjoy cooking buy cookbooks like this one. However, we often think that cooking is only worth it for special occasions or complicated dishes. This is not true. By simply chopping some carrots, a leek, celery, and herbs and boiling them in water, you can make a delicious soup. This is much more satisfying than buying a pre-packaged soup. Instead of purchasing a sweet chocolate mousse filled with preservatives, you can quickly make a tasty dessert that both adults and children will enjoy. Cooking is also a way to show care and love by sharing your own creations, no matter how simple. Sharing food symbolizes our basic human needs, which is why we celebrate events like birthdays and anniversaries around tables. No one would choose to have takeout for a wedding or anniversary party, nor would many people want to discuss a business deal over canned soup.

**In the Elevator**  
This morning, Alistair tried to tidy up his office, but papers were still everywhere. Tax forms were overflowing from drawers and boxes, waiting for a day when he felt like organizing them. He also had a lot of paperwork from owning an apartment building. The many books and journals were only near the new bookshelves. As the elevator took him closer to his floor, he knew Mallory would arrive on time for their meeting. She would knock on his office door exactly on the hour. She was very punctual and neat. How would she react to the mess? She might think someone had broken in. He could walk in behind her and pretend to be shocked. Mrs. Wilson, his cleaning lady, had come while he was trying to clear some space on the floor. When he peeked out of his office as she was unlocking his apartment, he smiled at her, hoping for a good response. But her expression was cold. She seemed to think there was no way she would go into his messy office, which was not her responsibility. He knew Mrs. Wilson saw him as someone from a different world, not part of her familiar Brooklyn neighborhood.

**KAREN**  
Karen had a simple wish: not to be like her mother. This desire led her to create her own story, one of strength and difference. In her story, there were important moments, like when she was twelve and her brother accidentally hit her in the eye with a golf club. At first, she thought she would go blind, but the bone protected her, as the doctor later confirmed. The club had missed her eye, and she only needed a few stitches that healed over time. When she opened her eyes in the doctor's office and saw her mother there, complaining about both miracles and small mercies, she felt she was saved for a reason.

**Miss Fogerty**  
Miss Fogerty was hurrying back to her work across the wet grass of the village green. She felt both excited and sad about what she had just seen. It is always thrilling to be the first to know something important, especially in a small community, where her life was usually quiet. However, she was deeply saddened by Dr. Bailey's condition. He had been her doctor for many years, and she appreciated his care during her yearly throat problems, which were her only health issues. Miss Fogerty valued his ability to make patients feel like there was always enough time to talk and that he genuinely wanted to hear about their worries. This quality made him very loved in the village. He was always willing to share his time, knowledge, and humor, and in return, he received great loyalty and affection from the community."
CPE_59,"**Joanna's Lessons**

Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist. So why has she decided to write books for young children learning the piano? Even someone who cannot hear music well would be moved by her performances. Watching her play the piano, quickly moving her hands across the keys, is like seeing a musician push their abilities to the limit. However, at a recent concert for children, even her amazing skills were not enough to impress one small boy. Like the other kids, he had seen her play many different styles of music from her large collection, including classical, jazz, and blues. He watched as she did something surprising, reaching inside the piano to pluck the strings, which usually excites children. But when she asked if anyone had questions, he simply asked, ""Can you play Match of the Day?"" Many experienced musicians would be caught off guard by such a request, but for Joanna, it was funny. She realized that until she played that tune, the boy did not think she was a real pianist. Of course, she played it and likely remembered this moment for her next children's concert.

Joanna is unique among top concert pianists because she cares about how young children learn to play. She has just published her own beginner piano book for children called *Joanna MacGregor's Piano World*. She accomplished this despite her busy schedule, which includes many festivals and collaborations with young composers. She also runs her own recording label, Sound Circus, and loves to suggest new projects whenever she meets other artists. So why take on the extra work of writing a book? ""People who know me are surprised,"" she says. ""But I believe the first lessons are very important. The music world often focuses on the most talented children, but most people enjoy music in a more everyday way. I find that much more interesting!""

In writing her first three books, Joanna draws from her own experiences. From ages 18 to 25, before she became a concert pianist, she taught many beginners. Most importantly, she grew up in a home where her mother taught piano, and many children came to learn. ""I was not part of a system that only focused on exceptional talent. I grew up believing that music should be available to everyone, no matter their skill level."" Just as everyone should learn to swim or speak a little French, she believes everyone should have the chance to learn the piano. Some children are naturally talented and progress quickly, while others take their time and may give up. This can happen at any stage. Some find the beginning too hard, while others feel pressure to perform like the talented children they see on television.

""I worry that some people use music, like sports, to push their children to achieve, instead of just enjoying it. Children often quit because they feel they cannot meet their parents' expectations."" When asked if she thinks poorly of other piano teaching methods or books, she replies, ""I am hesitant to criticize others."" She acknowledges that her colorful and engaging books are not the only ones available to help beginners enjoy learning. To attract young learners, she includes stories in her books and CDs. The challenge at this early stage is to make learning fun. From the first lesson, there are musical accompaniments for teachers or parents to play along with the child. For those whose parents do not play the piano, the accompaniments are available on the CDs.

Learning should be enjoyable, Joanna insists. ""You must let children improvise and encourage them to explore the entire keyboard."" As they progress, they need to be encouraged to read music instead of just playing by ear. Joanna understands this struggle because she relied on her ear when she was young. However, she believes that practice is the most important factor in learning. How can children be motivated to play a piece more than once? She admits that she did not practice seriously until she attended the Royal Academy of Music, where she began to build a challenging repertoire that required dedication. Now, she loves practicing. She spends about eight hours a day on it, which she considers essential to her musical life, even more than performing. ""I have great sympathy for those who find it hard. People do not talk about this enough."" 

The key, whether practicing for twenty minutes or five hours, is to have a clear goal, she says. Other tips include rewarding yourself by playing through a piece, even if there are mistakes, and mixing difficult pieces with easier ones."
CPE_54,"**Text: Writing by Hand and on Screen**

Dr. Johnson believed that ""what is written without effort is usually read without pleasure."" This means that good writing often requires hard work. When I look back at my handwritten school essays, I notice they had very few corrections. Today, I would rewrite them many times. I think this is because writing by hand was physically challenging. The slow pace of writing helped me think carefully. In contrast, typing on a computer can lead to careless mistakes. Many writers find that the time spent fixing early drafts on a computer is about the same as the time spent on handwritten work. 

Also, emails, unlike handwritten letters, often lack emotional depth. However, they have revived the art of love letters, with millions of these messages now being sent instead of just casual chats. At least these emails are written in a form of English and grammar. But words on a screen can feel dull. Writers may not realize the impact of their words and often exaggerate their meaning. Words typed quickly can lack the care and personality of handwriting.

**The CD**

I put down my cup and went to look at the CD. The case was disappointing, but the shiny disc inside looked interesting. ""Wonderful little things, aren't they?"" Mr. Warriston said as he entered the room. I agreed, carefully handing the disc to him. ""It's amazing they can fit seventy minutes of music on these,"" he continued, bending down to the hi-fi. He turned it on, and lights lit up. He pressed a button, and a small drawer opened. He placed the disc inside, pressed the button again, and the tray slid back in. ""Some people say they sound sterile, but I think they..."" 

""Do you have to turn them over, like records?"" I asked. 

""What? No,"" Mr. Warriston replied, standing up. ""You only play one side."" 

""Why?"" I asked. He looked confused and then thoughtful. ""You know, I have no idea. I don't see why you couldn't make both sides playable and double the capacity..."" He stared at the machine. ""You could have two lasers, or just turn it over by hand... hmm."" He smiled at me. ""Yes, good point."" He nodded toward my wooden chair. ""Anyway, come on, let's get you sitting in the best spot for the stereo effect, okay?"" I smiled, happy to have asked a technical question that Mr. Warriston couldn't answer.

**Books vs. Electronic Text**

In comparing books and electronic text, the author Malcolm Bradbury made a good point when he said that if matches had been invented after cigarette lighters, we would have admired the improvement. Many people excited about new technology claim that electronic text is as important as the invention of printing and that it is almost complete. They forget that changes in how we think take generations, and this view is a form of egotism, believing that our generation is at a crucial moment in history. 

For example, a book from 1979 predicted that ""the 1980s will see the book as we know it begin to fade away."" So far, this has not happened. Reading long texts on a screen is often unpleasant, so most people avoid it. Additionally, the way information is organized on computers encourages people to skim through texts. Supporters of technology argue that this quick reading leads to new forms of storytelling. However, many books have never been read from start to finish, such as religious texts, dictionaries, and poetry collections. What is new is not the way electronic text branches out, but that computers do not encourage the deep thinking that comes from reading something completely.

**The Office**

Charles walked through the office door and into a perfectly organized space. The carpet was clear of the paper mess that had covered it when it was first laid down, and the dark wooden desk looked just as he remembered from the Sotheby's auction five weeks ago. Neat file holders were being placed in their proper drawers. Twelve years of trade journals filled the shelves on one wall. Kathleen struggled to close the filing cabinet and then turned to him. ""You have to use computers, Charles. This is just too much."" 

""Hello, Kathleen. Oh, this is amazing,"" he said, admiring the room and its antique furniture. He was not thinking about a computer or any other machine in it, not even a pencil sharpener. ""Simply amazing,"" he said, avoiding the topic of computers. Over the two years he had known her, they had discussed this many times. She could never understand why he resisted technology when he was skilled with computers and had even published an important paper on computer-based giftedness. She had inspired that paper. Through the keyboard, she could explore any software and create something new that could do amazing things."
CPE_32,"Text: ""You don’t take sugar, do you?"" shouted his secretary, not really asking but stating a fact. She had been making Lancelot coffee for many months. Her excuse for forgetting was that he wasn’t usually supposed to be there. However, he was now there all the time, having realized that staying away only caused more problems. He thought about how he had gone from being a valued advisor, meeting authors and playwrights over lunch, to a stressed worker trying to avoid disasters, with no place to park when he arrived at work.

""This came,"" she yelled, waving a manila folder before placing it in front of him. ""From that guy in Los Angeles. You said you wanted to see it."" A label read: ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert."" Below that, it said ""An Expanded Synopsis."" Lancelot did not want to see the word ""synopsis."" He preferred to see a label that said ""A First Draft."" He had already seen a synopsis of this book and did not want to see another one, even if it was revised. Ian Cuthbert had received a large advance for this book when Lancelot had bought the company. Ian was one of several old friends Lancelot had mistakenly commissioned books from. Ian was a clear example that someone with a difficult personality often becomes even harder to manage when given a chance.

Lancelot skipped the introduction he had read many times and looked at the synopsis. He recognized almost every phrase. He closed the folder and pushed it aside. Clearly, at this rate, Ian's manuscript would never arrive. The synopsis lacked the brilliance Ian was known for, and beneath its playful tone, it felt empty of real ideas. Lancelot remembered stories of a famous author whose last book was published incomplete after his death, written chapter by chapter, with payments made one at a time. In that case, the payments were small parts of an advance that had never been given. Ian's advance had been huge, breaking the usual rule that authors must deliver a manuscript before getting paid.

Lancelot, who had studied modern languages at Oxford, remembered when Ian Cuthbert was seen as a great talent in Cambridge, a place full of promise. Ian's peers aimed to take over British theatre, and they succeeded quickly. But Ian seemed lazy compared to them. He wore his overcoat like a cape and spoke about what a famous French writer had said as if he had been there. Yet, for some reason, Ian's creative talent remained hidden. While less talented people succeeded, Ian withdrew further. At the peak of his influence, he was already known to be very difficult to work with. Officially appointed to edit a major arts magazine, he was like a general stuck on the beach with too many resources but no action. The magazine used up the budget for many issues without being published.

Similarly, his renewed contract with a fashion magazine led to stories about his high pay, which was increased in hopes of getting him to produce more, and then even more in hopes of getting him to produce anything. At editorial meetings, where famous photographers were always present, Ian criticized others' ideas harshly. Ten years later, he could hardly be counted on to show up for his own funeral. Lancelot was close to admitting that ""A World History of the Short"" had been a mistake from the start."
CPE_65,"Text: 'England's Breakfast Revolution

Health experts agree that a good breakfast is very important. However, in history, breakfast is a relatively new concept in England. There are few mentions of breakfast in medieval literature. There are some references to travelers eating a meal at dawn before long journeys and to sick people having breakfast for health reasons, but most people did not eat breakfast unless they were kings or nobles. 

In the sixteenth century, breakfast started to become common for everyone. Some writers believe this change happened because food became more available. However, they may not have considered other important social changes. For instance, new work patterns meant that more people had jobs with set hours, often starting very early in the morning. As a result, having a meal in the morning became necessary and was no longer just for the wealthy.'"
CPE_61,"**Photography**  
When a photographer takes a picture, they choose visual information based on their technical skills, personal views, and experiences, along with social and cultural norms. In this book, we will explore how these factors influence the style, content, and expression of a photograph, as well as how viewers perceive and respond to these images. For instance, a casual newspaper reader may have an understanding of the photographs printed on the page. However, instead of accepting the photograph as it is, we might ask if it truly captured the scene as it appeared at that moment. Alternatively, does it express the photographer's perspective? Is the exact moment captured particularly important, or should the photograph be seen as a symbol representing a situation in the world?

**More than a Game**  
For me, sport has always been more than just a game. The most successful athletes have strong self-belief. To succeed in sports, you need to focus completely. There is only one way to be the best, and you must set aside everything else. Sports can be harsh, and no one will do the work for you. It’s a matter of survival. Sports have taught me discipline and determination, but they also show the value of teamwork. My sport allows me to excel individually, yet it is still a team effort, and I must balance both aspects. This is similar to life – you can achieve as an individual, but you must remember the people around you. Sports have given me a lot, not just financially. They have opened doors for me and broadened my perspective, allowing me to see things around the world that many others will not. However, you also have to sacrifice a lot for these rewards.

**Tuning In**  
Some experiences are so vivid that they create clear memories. For me, such a moment happened one night in California many years ago when I lay awake, listening to the beautiful song of a mockingbird from a hidden spot in one of the tall trees in the neighborhood. I do not have insomnia; it was the bird's amazing singing that kept me awake. As I listened to its complex melodies, I found myself in an unexpected artistic experience. To understand the bird's patterns, I drew on my knowledge of jazz and Indian classical music. The bird made me feel as if I was enjoying a stunning improvisational performance. I reacted with groans and cheers as one surprising musical variation followed another through the open window until I finally fell asleep."
CPE_52,"Text: 

""People have always had strong feelings about birds, whether they love, fear, or admire them. But what does this say about us? Paul Evans reports. 

In a greenhouse, a little brown bird called a wren is bumping against the glass. This bird is often seen as a sign of something important. Is it trying to send a message from a mysterious world, or is it just a bird trapped inside? Depending on how you look at it, both ideas could be true. 

Wrens have been part of British culture for a long time. In medieval times, people believed that the direction in which wrens flew could predict their luck. Today, images of wrens can still be found in many British homes, even if the old beliefs have faded. The wren still holds a special place in our hearts. A place without wrens feels empty and sad. 

This connection to birds comes from a time when people relied more on nature for survival. They developed a way of understanding the significance of other creatures. However, these meanings can change over time. For example, the red kite was once admired in London for taking bread from children. But soon, it was seen as a pest and nearly disappeared from many areas. Now, red kites are valued again and are being protected and reintroduced to help them thrive.

Our bond with birds goes back to our early human history. The first birdwatchers were likely very aware of bird behavior because it helped them survive by warning them of danger or bad weather. Birds also connected them to their dreams. When we wonder why birds matter to us, we are also exploring what it means to be human. The ideas of flight, song, and freedom reflect our own identity in relation to nature.

Some people might think these feelings are outdated, but they are still part of who we are. Losing this connection would be painful. That is why, in recent years, birds have become symbols of environmental change. In Britain, conservationists are worried about 30 endangered bird species. This is not just about losing interesting birds; it also represents a significant cultural loss. 

Birds carry a lot of cultural meaning. For instance, the skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing represent different kinds of love and magic. Anyone familiar with the poems of Shelley, Shakespeare, or Robert Graves would feel sad about losing these birds. However, the loss of other birds that are not mentioned in literature is often overlooked.

Folklore is very important. The stories and legends that have survived over time create a strong connection to their subjects, more so than scientific terms. This connection evokes feelings that are often hidden beneath the surface of modern life. Whether we watch wildlife documentaries or observe birds in our gardens, the joy we feel cannot be fully explained by science. Birds engage us in ways that are difficult to express, and the stories we tell about them help us understand their significance.

The wren in the greenhouse connects the present with a distant past, holding onto its song and moving into the future—a mystery that keeps me curious."""
CPE_28,"**Maps**

The purpose of a map is to visually show the relationships between points and features on the earth's surface. These relationships are based on distance and direction. In ancient times, distance was often described in terms of time, such as ""a few hours' walk"" or ""a day's journey by river."" These descriptions provided more information about how easy it was to travel through local areas rather than the actual distance. Direction was also important, but for most travelers, the main questions were ""Where do I go from here?"" and ""How far away is it?"" Therefore, precise direction was not always crucial. For a long time, written itineraries were as popular as maps. Even today, some maps, like those showing train systems, do not always represent true directions. 

Landmarks along a route were initially marked by signs, which could be realistic or symbolic, and their size indicated their importance. The conventions used in maps varied based on their purpose and location, so understanding these conventions is essential when studying early maps. The history of map-making, or cartography, is mainly about improving the accuracy of distance and direction and expanding the content of maps. 

To achieve this, cartography has incorporated knowledge from other sciences. For instance, instead of determining direction by observing shadows or stars, people began using the magnetic compass and developed tools to measure angles accurately. The application of astronomy and exploration helped map the known world. Astronomers later discovered that the earth is not a perfect sphere but slightly flattened at the poles, leading to further improvements in mapping large areas.

Over time, the needs of map users changed. Travelers and merchants were no longer the only users of maps. Soldiers, especially after the introduction of artillery, required accurate representations of the land's features. This need for precision led to the invention of contour lines. Other users, like archaeologists, historians, and modern geographers, also had specific mapping needs. To meet these demands, today’s cartographers have developed methods to map various distributions, such as geological layers, climate zones, and land use.

The current recognition of the map's value in many scientific fields has sparked a modern revival of cartography. However, it is important to note that the development of cartography has not been a smooth or continuous process. There have been times of decline or stagnation, followed by periods of rapid progress, where old ideas coexisted with new ones. Cartographers have often understood the theoretical basis for advancements but had to wait for better tools to implement their ideas. Since copying old maps is the easiest way to create a new one, and because map publishers have sometimes resisted change, maps should not be taken at face value as evidence of current knowledge and techniques.

The many thousands of maps we have today are the result of significant human effort and thought. They provide an invaluable record for those studying human history. This aspect makes the study of historical cartography both fascinating and educational."
CPE_35,"**Simplified Text:**

I was taken into a young man's living room, which was a calm and cultured space surrounded by a messy collection of rooms where the less ambitious family members lived. Moving from the kitchen to his room felt like going from economy to business class. This room had the largest collection of records I had ever seen, the first stereo record player I had encountered, and the surprising fact that a teenager had spent money on Georgian wine glasses, pictures, and furniture. His name was Andrew Lloyd Webber. He had received a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford, to study history, and he had nine months before starting, during which he wanted to become England's version of the composer Richard Rodgers. My own dreams were just as unrealistic; I wanted to be a pop star for the usual reasons: women, money, and fame. The difference between Andrew and me was that my dreams were not life or death, although they might have felt that way if I had failed. So, when Andrew suggested that I try to become a famous lyricist like Oscar Hammerstein, I was open to the idea. This was partly because, within ten minutes of meeting him, he played me three of his own tunes, and I could tell he was very talented. As he confidently played selections from the many shows he had created at school, I was reminded of the best show albums from my parents' collection. He needed a new lyricist for the outside world. I didn’t have much to impress him with, except for my praise for his music and a seven-inch single of a song I had written that had recently been recorded by an unknown pop group. We said we would meet again and write something together. I was still more interested in pop charts than in West End theatre, but I told myself on the bus back to my flat that I had just met someone with rare talent and determination, and I would be foolish to miss the chance to work with someone who was likely to succeed in musical theatre soon. Even if we didn’t succeed in challenging the top musical composers, we could try to compete with the Beatles and Rolling Stones later in the summer. The Everly Brothers had just made a comeback and would need new material. 

The next day, back at my desk in the office where I was training to be a lawyer, the excitement I had felt about a life in show business with Andrew Lloyd Webber had faded a bit. I would still look at small ads in Melody Maker for groups needing a singer and write a few more simple songs that wouldn’t show off my limited singing ability. However, it was likely that I would finish my exams and become a respectable lawyer by the time I was twenty-five. By then, I would probably have outgrown pop music, as my father had predicted I would by twenty-one. This worried me—if he was right, I only had a few more months to enjoy it. But for now, I felt I had nothing to lose by seeing Andrew again. It would be fun to go to a musical with him and write lyrics that imitated musical lyricists instead of pop stars. Andrew was an interesting person who talked about Good Food Guides and Victorian architecture and supported the Leyton Orient football team. I wasn’t sure about the idea for a musical he had been working on for the past year, but in 1965, I was rarely sure about anything. His talent was undeniable, and he claimed to have all the right contacts. I soon found myself back in his living room. The idea was about the life of Dr. Thomas Barnardo, a nineteenth-century philanthropist who started the orphanages that carry his name. His story was important, but it didn’t really inspire me. The hero seemed too perfect, at least in Andrew's version, and the idea felt unoriginal, too similar to Lionel Bart's hit show, Oliver. However, Andrew's strong belief in his music's brilliance was contagious and somewhat justified. What did I know about musicals? As David Land, who would later be my agent for over twenty-five years, often said, if there is a demand for one hamburger bar on the block, there is room for two. We could be the second hamburger joint. I began working with great enthusiasm, especially on the funny songs. Andrew explained the plot, played me the tunes, and often gave me the titles, most of which had likely been thought up by his former school friend. I even skipped a day at the law office, pretending to be sick, to write my first set of theatrical lyrics. I didn’t realize it that day, but I had changed my career."
CPE_5,"**Text:**

**Language**  
You and I are part of a species with a unique ability: we can influence each other's thoughts with great accuracy. Language is so deeply connected to human life that it is hard to imagine living without it. If you see two or more people together anywhere in the world, they will likely start talking to each other. When there is no one to talk to, people often speak to themselves, their pets, or even their plants. I like to think of language as an 'instinct.' This means that people know how to communicate in a way similar to how spiders know how to spin webs. Web-spinning was not created by a brilliant spider and does not require special education or skills in building.

**Climate and Weather**  
Climate and weather, which are mainly influenced by the air around us, greatly impact the lives and locations of animals and plants. Climate can strongly shape the appearance of landscapes. For instance, warm and wet conditions throughout the year allow tropical jungles to grow, which are rich in different species. In contrast, cold and windy areas can only support a limited variety of life. The daily weather patterns that contribute to the overall climate are caused by large air masses rising and mixing, as the atmosphere is always in motion. Some of this movement is because the layer of gases sits on a spinning Earth. Since air is light, it does not move at the same speed as the Earth and tends to lag behind. However, a more significant cause of air movement is the sun.

**Coffee**  
As a barista, my job included serving drinks, but more importantly, I was responsible for making coffee. In Lygon Street, Melbourne, a restaurant's success can depend on its coffee quality. I underwent several days of intense training in coffee-making, where I learned more than I ever wanted to know about cleaning and maintaining the restaurant's shiny espresso machine. I also learned the key principles for making the perfect rich, frothy cappuccino. By the end of the first week, I realized that making a good cup of coffee was not as simple as it seemed, and I feared I would be assigned to less important tasks again. Fortunately, my boss was patient. ""Making coffee is both an art and a science,"" he said, ""and you need time to develop the skill."""
CPE_41,"**Art on TV**

Why does television often struggle with programs about visual arts? Painting and sculpture are perfect subjects for the camera, which can show an entire artwork and then zoom in on the details. However, there are few TV series that successfully capture both the enjoyment and complexity of viewing art. A good example of this issue is Robert Hughes's eight-part series on American art, *American Visions*. Hughes is a trusted critic with a strong personality, and he has nearly eight hours to introduce British viewers to an art movement that British galleries have largely overlooked. I expected the series to focus on famous artworks, but instead, it explored how American history and culture are reflected in its art and architecture.

**Dealing in Metals**

For 20 years, I worked as an international metals dealer and gained a reputation as a speculator. The metals market is less regulated than other markets. With some luck, a willingness to take risks, and a good understanding of the market, it is possible to make a lot of money. Risk-taking is a normal part of this industry. This adventurous culture fits well with a free-market global economy. However, the free-trade economists who believed that the market would keep the prices of scarce metals stable have found the opposite is true. More minerals are being extracted, and the cost of raw materials is going down. When considering inflation, the prices of most metals are about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to investigate claims made against one of the multinational companies that benefit from these low-cost raw materials.

**Extract from a Holiday Brochure**

Abaco and its offshore cays are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas, which stretch from Florida past the Tropic of Cancer to Cuba. Each island has its own character and offers something unique. The best way to explore the islands and cays of Abaco is by boat. If a boat is not included with your accommodation, don’t worry. There are many ferries and water taxis available. You can also rent boats if you prefer to explore on your own. Sailing is the most popular way to get around here. Abaco is known as 'The Sailing Capital of the World' for good reason. The calm, protected waters are also perfect for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The cays and their beaches stretch for 200 miles like a string of pearls. Gems can be found not only at sea; at night, the lights of the restaurants and cafes in Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay sparkle beautifully."
CPE_69,"**Text: Build Your Own Bamboo Bike at the UK’s First Workshop**

Join a course at the Bamboo Bike Club, led by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan, where you can create your own custom bamboo bike frame and enjoy a fun weekend of bike-building. It’s Saturday morning in Hackney Wick, east London, and the Bamboo Bike Club is busy with activity. This is the only bamboo bike-building course in Britain.

Bamboo is becoming a popular material for bike construction. Companies like Calfee Design from California and Bamboo Bikes from Yorkshire have brought back this method, which dates back to 1894. However, many cyclists find ready-made bamboo frames too expensive, costing around $2,995 or £1,868. This high price motivated James and Ian to spend years working in a shed in Brecon, Wales, to create a bamboo bike business that is affordable for average cyclists. They wanted to share the joy of making something unique and sustainable, rather than just selling bike frames.

The Bamboo Bike Club is more of a community than a traditional business. James works on wind turbines, and Ian is a civil engineer. They run monthly courses where participants can build their own bikes at a reasonable price. 

On the first day of the course, James and Ian teach how to choose strong bamboo and create sturdy joints. Participants start by assembling the front triangle of the bike using 40 mm diameter bamboo, followed by the thinner parts for the seat and chain assembly. Alloy tubes are added for the handlebars and other parts that need extra strength. This process can be challenging, especially for those who are not experienced with DIY projects. However, James and Ian are there to help, checking every cut and joint, and stepping in if someone struggles.

The chance to build your own bike is a big draw for many participants, most of whom are engineers. Ian reassures everyone that mistakes are normal, and it’s easy to try again with new pieces of bamboo. Each piece has been checked for quality, allowing participants to choose the look of their bike: plain bamboo, black, or mottled.

On Sunday, the focus shifts to building the lugs, which are the joints of the bike. Participants wrap hemp bindings around the joints and use epoxy resin to create a strong bond. After adding a waterproof coating, the bike is ready for wheels, brakes, gears, and personal touches. James and Ian claim that their bamboo bikes are just as strong as metal ones. Ian has used his bike for over a year on a 16-mile commute, and James has tested his bike off-road for three months without breaking it.

While bamboo bikes may not look as polished as professional frames, they are unique. James and Ian emphasize that individuality is important. Personally, I think bamboo bikes are best for relaxed rides rather than racing. I choose a 'Classic English' frame for a comfortable ride. 

I test James’s bike, and it feels light and smooth, thanks to bamboo’s ability to absorb vibrations. James believes the workshops are most rewarding when the bikes are being ridden. They are light and fun to ride, and the price is less than £500."

**Self-Help Books**  
Diane Reverend was an editor at Random House in New York when she first saw a manuscript by an unknown pop psychologist, Dr. John Gray. ""I took one look at the title and knew it would be a bestseller,"" she says, laughing, and she was right. Dr. Gray is now a multimillionaire, and Diane Reverend has her own company. Dr. Gray's small book on improving communication between men and women is a symbol of a large and growing self-help industry that claims to meet many of Americans' desires for self-improvement. This industry also creates new desires and supports the entire New York publishing world. In Britain, the genre can fill shelves with books that are often silly and dramatic, but there are worse ones. For every self-help book published, thousands are rejected for being too similar or too specialized. This is a small mercy. As a new type of powerful editor searches for the next big hit, writing style is often ignored. Marketability is the main focus. ""How marketable is the author? What's the 'hook'? Is it universal enough?"" Ms. Reverend lists the important questions and admits, ""If someone comes to me with a catchy title, that's two-thirds of the battle won. You know you can reach people.""

**Autobiographies**  
There must be an unspoken agreement between an autobiographer and the reader that the truth is being shared. This agreement is often not fully kept. There are many reasons why a writer might not tell the whole truth. They may have thoughts or actions they feel are too shameful to share. They might also think some details are not important enough to include. There are also more complex reasons for breaking this agreement. The autobiographer might believe that the ultimate goal of their work, which is to reveal the truth about themselves, can be better achieved by inventing stories that express the truth more clearly than sticking strictly to the facts. Alternatively, they may decide from the start not to follow this agreement. They might label their book an autobiography just to create a sense of trust in the reader, which helps them in their storytelling. Some readers may finish the book thinking they have read a true story, when in fact, they have read fiction. This can happen without any intention to deceive.

**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**  
Students of detective stories say that this genre reflects the conflicts of society in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The detective story is essentially a metaphor. The crime symbolizes a basic human desire, like lust or greed, and its solution represents the return of the individual to society, calming their lawless impulses so that society can function smoothly again. In Hammett's unique version, society returns to its previous state, but that state is shown to be corrupt and false. The hunter and the hunted in Hammett's stories are two sides of the same character. The private detective and his target understand each other and, in a strange way, are comfortable with one another. The private detective belongs to both worlds. From the criminal's perspective, he is too honest, and from the law's perspective, he is too shady. He is both a criminal and a competitor. The private detective's mission is sometimes influenced by his sense of guilt, and sometimes his desire for punishment is heightened by his worry about this confusion.

**Science Writing**  
Today’s leading scientific essayist is Stephen Jay Gould. To discuss his writing and hear his advice, I met him in an unfamiliar setting: the Grand Hotel, where he was staying while promoting his new book. Neither of us felt very comfortable there. Regarding writing in such a pretentious environment, Gould said, ""I couldn't do it; Trollope might, but he understood the culture. Knowing the culture is essential for being a successful writer. Science, for example, is its own world. Therefore, only scientists can effectively present it. If you don’t belong to the community and don’t understand its rules, you are at a disadvantage from the start."" One of Gould's principles is: never write down to the reader. ""Make no concessions,"" he says. ""You can simplify the language but must never dilute the ideas. Above all, you cannot simplify the argument. Once readers feel they are being talked down to, your piece is finished."""
CPE_17,"**Text: Air-conditioning**

At Cannons Gym, a popular spot for City of London workers during lunch, the air feels very cold. To cope with this summer's high temperatures, the gym has used a lot of air-conditioning. At quiet times, it can feel like being in the Arctic. This shows how the modern world often misuses air-conditioning. It has become a common part of our lives, symbolizing humanity's ability to control the climate. However, many air-conditioned buildings could use other cooling methods. They could use natural light and ventilation, and have thicker walls that keep heat out during the day and release it at night. These ideas may seem simple, but they can be very effective and would greatly reduce the need for air-conditioning.

**Sundials**

It is interesting that as we enter a new millennium, there is a growing interest in sundials, which measure time based on the sun's position. A hundred years ago, sundials were essential for keeping time accurately. As clocks and watches improved, sundials became less important and were seen mainly as garden decorations. Now, they are being appreciated again. David Harber, a maker of sundials, believes their charm comes from their connection to the planets. He says there is a magical moment when a sundial starts to work. They are calm and beautiful objects that remind us of our place in the universe.

**Paint Your Own China**

My idea of china-painting came from a visit to an arts and crafts show where serious-looking older women showed how to paint delicate flowers on teacups with skillful brushstrokes. It was fascinating to watch, as each stroke created a perfect petal or leaf. Their hands were steady, and the paint never smudged. I thought these women must have practiced for years or had a special talent. I wondered what kind of people would join a china-painting class. Would beginners have a natural talent? However, the atmosphere in the class was friendly and relaxed. Everyone was there to enjoy themselves, and even the teacher did not want to paint flowers on teacups as quickly as I had remembered."
CPE_47,"**Text: The Wrong Country**

Uncle chose a package holiday for them at a good price: a flight from Gatwick Airport, twelve nights in Venice, the beautiful city, at the Pensione Concordia. When Keith and Dawne went to the travel agency to book, the clerk told them that the other travelers were a school group from the south coast, all learning Italian. But something went wrong. Either at the travel agency, the check-in desk, or in a computer, a small mistake happened. Dawne and Keith ended up in a hotel called the Edelweiss, in Room 212, somewhere in Switzerland.

At Gatwick, they gave their tickets to a girl in a yellow-and-red uniform. She called them by name, checked their tickets, and said everything was fine. An hour later, they were surprised to hear older people on the plane speaking with accents from the North of England. Keith thought there must have been a cancellation, or maybe the Italian class was on another plane. They ordered drinks, and then more drinks. 

When they landed, a stout woman with glasses said, ""The coach will take us on. Stay together now."" There was no mention of an overnight stop in the brochure, but when the coach arrived at its destination, Keith realized that this was clearly an unexpected stop. As they got off the coach close to midnight, tired and dirty from travel, they did not question their right to the beds they were offered. But the next morning, when they found out they were being offered the beds for their entire holiday, they became worried.

""We have the lake and the water birds,"" the receptionist smiled and explained. ""And we can take the steamer to Interlaken."" 

""An error has been made,"" Keith said calmly, aware of his wife's anxious breathing beside him. ""We were supposed to be in Venice, at the Pensione Concordia."" 

""I do not know that name, sir. This is Switzerland,"" the receptionist replied. 

""A coach is supposed to take us on. An official said so on the plane. She was here last night,"" Keith insisted. 

""Your group is booked for twelve nights in the Edelweiss Hotel. If you have changed your minds—"" 

""We haven't changed our minds. There has been a mistake."" The receptionist shook his head, saying he did not know about any mistake. 

""The man who made the booking,"" Dawne interrupted, ""was bald, with glasses and a moustache."" She named the travel agency in London. 

""Is there a problem?"" a woman said, smiling at Keith. She was the stout woman he had seen talking to the girl at Gatwick. On the plane, she had walked up and down the aisle, smiling at people. 

""My name is Franks,"" she said. ""I'm married to the man with the bad leg."" 

""Are you in charge, Mrs. Franks?"" Dawne asked. ""We are in the wrong hotel."" Again, she gave the name of the travel agency and described the bald clerk, mentioning his glasses and moustache. 

Keith interrupted, ""It seems we got into the wrong group. We reported to the Your-Kind-of-Holiday girl and left it to her."" 

""We should have known when they weren't from Dover,"" Dawne added. ""We heard them talking about Darlington."" 

Keith made an impatient sound, wishing she would let him speak. ""We noticed you at Gatwick,"" he said. ""We knew you were in charge."" 

""And I noticed you. I counted you, although you probably didn't see me. Let me explain. There are many places Your-Kind-of-Holiday sends its clients, with different holidays at different prices. There are villa holidays for adventurous people under thirty-five, treks to Turkey, and treks for singles to the Himalayas."" 

""What I am trying to say is that all tickets and labels look similar, yellow with two red bands."" Mrs. Franks suddenly laughed. ""So if you just followed others with the yellow-and-red label, you might think you could end up in a wildlife park! But of course,"" she added kindly, ""that couldn't happen."" 

""We're not supposed to be in Switzerland,"" Keith insisted. 

""Well, let's see,"" Mrs. Franks said unexpectedly, and then she walked away, leaving them standing. The receptionist was no longer at the desk, and they could hear typing. 

""She seems quite nice,"" Dawne whispered. Keith was not listening. He tried to remember everything that had happened: giving the tickets to the girl, waiting, and then the girl leading them to the plane, and the pilot welcoming them aboard. 

""Nice to have some young people along,"" an elderly man said, interrupting Keith's thoughts. ""Nottage is the name."" His wife was with him, and they both looked like they were in their eighties. She said they had slept very well, thanks to the lakeside air. 

""That's nice,"" Dawne said. Keith walked out of the reception area, and Dawne followed him. Outside the hotel, they did not say that there was an irony in what had happened. On their first holiday since their honeymoon, they had ended up in a package tour with older people when the whole point of the holiday was to escape the needs and demands of the elderly. Uncle had said so himself when they tried to persuade him to join them."
CPE_48,"**Text: 'HE WAS A PEOPLE PERSON'**

American business leaders are looking to the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a model for good management. Eluned Price reports.

Most people in Britain know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and have a general idea of his achievements. However, America has only recently discovered him. The Wall Street Journal described Shackleton as ""an Antarctic explorer whose feats went largely unnoticed for most of the 20th century,"" which is an exaggeration. Now, Americans are making up for lost time with great enthusiasm. Biographies and stories about the voyage of the Endurance are being produced quickly; the American Museum of Natural History is organizing a major exhibition, and Columbia Tristar is making a film about Shackleton's life.

Some American managers have also adopted Shackleton as a role model. His supporters share stories of his actions with admiration, drawing lessons in leadership and communication from his experiences. They even refer to each other as ""speaking Shackleton."" The determined and resourceful Shackleton, with his reindeer sleeping bag and blubber stove, has become a symbol for modern management consultants.

Jim MacGregor, the managing partner of Abernathy MacGregor Frank in New York, chose Shackleton as a role model years ago. His firm focuses on communication during mergers, acquisitions, and corporate crises. For example, they handle situations like ""this firm's plant exploded"" or ""half the workforce has to be laid off."" While it may be hard to see how Shackleton's experience of surviving in extreme cold relates to managing a financial crisis, MacGregor believes Shackleton is a great model for management because of his leadership and communication skills. Shackleton had clear values and was at his best when he and his team had a lot at stake, including their lives.

One of Shackleton's most interesting decisions was to turn back when he was only 97 miles from the South Pole. This decision showed his commitment to the safety of his men. In a crisis, people want to know who is in charge. While many managers today may avoid responsibility, Shackleton was willing to take charge. His 1914 expedition became legendary when his ship, the Endurance, was trapped in ice for nine months and eventually sank. When the ship went down, Shackleton told his men, ""We should all eventually reach safety if you do your best and trust me."" From the accounts and diaries kept during the expedition, it is clear that Shackleton was always in control.

""Shackleton thought everything through, planned for every situation, kept his men informed, and asked for their opinions,"" says MacGregor. ""He was flexible, willing to change plans when necessary. We have developed effective principles based on Shackleton's example. Clients can relate to his story without feeling criticized.""

Shackleton believed that an explorer needs optimism, endurance, and patience. ""One of the hardest things to do in difficult times is to be patient, especially in America, where there is a strong desire to fix problems quickly,"" says MacGregor. ""If you invest in bonds and guess wrong about interest rates, you should hold on and wait to get your money back. Selling too soon would result in a big loss. Also, don't hesitate to change your plans if they are not working. If a new product is failing, don't keep selling it.""

Shackleton led by example. On the return journey from the Endurance, he noticed Hurley, the expedition photographer, without gloves. He insisted that Hurley wear his gloves, saying he would throw them overboard if he didn't. Someone else remembered Shackleton doing something similar with a biscuit when they were near starvation on the 1905 expedition: ""He said he would leave it in the snow. Millions of pounds couldn't have bought that biscuit.""

As Caroline Alexander, author of *Endurance*, the human account of that expedition, says: ""The public's interest in heroic efforts is growing. Shackleton shows that there is little heroism in today's world. Everything else fades away, and he stands out as a true embodiment of the ideals we long for today."""
CAE_15,"**Simplified Text: 'Finding Food in Madagascar'**

In the forests of Madagascar, there is a unique primate called the aye-aye. Its way of finding food is similar to that of a woodpecker. Both the aye-aye and the woodpecker dig into wood to find insect larvae. The woodpecker uses its beak to make holes and its long tongue to get the insects. The aye-aye, however, uses its sharp front teeth to chew into the wood and its long, thin third finger to reach inside and scoop out the insects.

Although scientists first described the aye-aye's unusual feeding method over a hundred years ago, they have only recently learned how it finds the insects hidden in the wood. Dr. Carl Erickson from Duke University studied the hunting skills of two male aye-ayes named Nosferatu and Poe, a female named Samantha, and her baby, Annabelle. He wanted to see if they could find insects by looking for signs, like holes in the wood where insects might have entered to lay eggs.

Dr. Erickson gave the aye-ayes logs with several narrow holes. Some holes led to spaces with mealworms, while others were empty. The aye-ayes went directly to the holes with food, showing they did not need to see the surface holes to find the insects. It was thought they might be using their sense of smell or hearing, but further tests showed this was not the case. They could find mealworms even when the smell was blocked and could locate dead mealworms that made no sound.

So, how did the aye-ayes find the insects? Dr. Erickson found that they would chew through the wood to reach both empty spaces and those with mealworms. It seems they can sense the hollow spaces. When looking for food, an aye-aye taps the wood with its middle finger and moves its large ears forward to listen closely. Dr. Erickson believes the aye-aye is using a method similar to echo-location, listening for sounds that indicate a hollow area below. It might also hear insects moving when disturbed by the tapping.

The idea that the aye-aye fills the role of woodpeckers in Madagascar's forests is interesting. However, there are birds like the Sickle-billed and Nuthatch Vangas that also search for insects in wood, so the woodpecker role may not be empty. The aye-aye can be seen as a mix of a woodpecker and an echo-locating bat, but it also acts like a squirrel. Its front teeth grow continuously like a squirrel's, and it has been seen in the wild chewing through nut shells and using its long finger to get the nut meat inside."
CAE_19,"**Text: 'Ordinary People, Ordinary Lives'**

Many of us have photos of our grandparents, but how many of us really know what their lives were like when they were young? The few diaries we have are often incomplete, and family stories are only partly remembered. What will our grandchildren know about us? We often plan to write things down but never do. We might leave videos instead of photos, but those images are still flat.

Hannah Renier has found a solution: she writes autobiographies for other people, creating a hardback book of at least 20,000 words, with illustrations if needed. Her focus is not on famous people, but on ordinary lives. The idea came to her when she spoke with her family and realized how much of the past was being forgotten. ""When I started, I didn't take it as seriously as I do now,"" she says. ""I met people who really wanted to share their interesting lives. They often say they are doing it for their children or for future generations, but they enjoy the process too.""

The promise of confidentiality helps her subjects feel free to share their true feelings. ""I felt confident to be honest,"" says a 62-year-old man who has experienced both success and failure in his life. ""I was surprised by what I revealed. There were painful memories, like my divorce, that still affect me.""

""I did it for my family, so they could learn something, but I haven't let my children, who are in their thirties, read it yet. They were hurt by things in my life, and there are details I don't want them to know right now. If they really want to read it, I might let them, but I think it’s better if they read it after I’m gone."" He also noticed patterns from his childhood that led him to repeat the same mistakes. Ms. Renier has seen this in others too. ""It's surprising how many people are influenced by their parents,"" she says. ""The messages they received as children affect them for the rest of their lives. They often repeat the same behaviors, marrying people their parents liked or choosing partners as a form of rebellion.""

""Many people express regrets. Even after sixty years, they still feel unresolved issues with their parents. There is no specific age when people stop being affected by their past. If they had problems in their youth, they still carry them into middle age. They often try to impress a parent who was never impressed, and if that fails, some seek permission to say, 'I can't stand my mother.'""

As a recorder rather than an interrogator, Ms. Renier maintains a respectful distance. ""This is not for public sharing, and I'm not a nosy person. Sometimes people share something and then say, 'I'm not sure if that should be included.' I include it anyway; they can remove things later. But usually, people want to be honest, flaws and all.""

""This is not vanity publishing; it's not about people saying, 'Look at my interesting life.' Things are changing quickly in our world, and we are losing touch with our past. This work helps people connect with their roots. We need a link to our ancestors because families are not as close as they used to be. People want a sense of immortality.""

Each book involves up to 30 hours of recorded interviews, which Ms. Renier uses to write the life story, organizing the events and interpreting them. Modern technology allows her to create everything except the binding, which features gold lettering. Clients can choose the color of the cover and the title. The final product is appealing to the intended audience and is not a cheap version of a life story. Ms. Renier organizes her material well and writes skillfully, making the final content as good as the person’s life story. Each book costs nearly £3,000, with additional copies priced at £25 each. She receives about ten inquiries a week, but the high cost discourages many. ""I thought it would be a more affordable product,"" she says. ""But the people I've worked with are often from affluent backgrounds, readers of magazines like Harpers & Queen, which is where I advertise. They are the kind of people who would have had their portraits painted to pass down to their descendants."""

The Museum of Classical Archaeology is one of the few collections of casts of Greek and Roman sculptures in the world, with over six hundred pieces. It is important to note that none of the sculptures are original; they are all replicas made from the originals, mostly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Museum is located in a specially designed gallery with great natural light. The benefits of plaster casts are many: sculptures that were originally displayed together but are now in different museums across Europe can be seen together as they were meant to be. You can see nearly all the most famous works of Greek and Roman sculpture in just one afternoon.

The Sedgwick Museum has a wonderful collection of fossil animals and plants, rocks, and minerals from all geological ages and regions of the world. It also contains Britain's oldest complete geological collection, created by Dr. John Woodward (1665-1728). This collection includes nearly 10,000 rare and interesting specimens stored in their original 18th-century cabinets. Adam Sedgwick was a Professor of Geology and the keeper of the Woodwardian collection. Throughout his life, he greatly expanded the collections, establishing a remarkable museum. The collection is organized by geological age, allowing visitors to trace the major changes in life on Earth over time. The new Whewell Gallery displays beautiful minerals and gems, with full explanatory labels to describe their nature and modern uses.

**D. The Cambridge University Collection of Air Photographs**  
The collection contains over 400,000 oblique and vertical air photographs taken by university staff over the past 45 years. The University has its own aircraft based at Cambridge Airport and conducts photographic work across Great Britain. The photographs are of great interest as they provide a detailed, year-by-year record of the landscape, showing both the natural environment and the impact of human activity from prehistoric times to today. There is a small display in the entrance hall, and the knowledgeable library staff are available to answer questions. The photographs cannot be borrowed, but copies can usually be purchased. These are made to order and typically take about a month.

**E. Cambridge Medieval Brass Rubbing Centre**  
The Cambridge Brass Rubbing Centre, the second oldest and longest-running center of its kind in the world, is one of the region's most unique tourist attractions. Visitors can enjoy creating wall hangings by rubbing one of over a hundred different brass plates from the tombs of medieval knights and ladies. By making resin copies, known as facsimiles, the center preserves the originals while making brass rubbing an enjoyable activity for everyone. The brass plates, which serve as an alternative memorial to tomb statues, spread from Germany across medieval Europe and Scandinavia. Many beautiful brasses were destroyed during various revolutions, but most of the remaining examples are found in Britain, with the widest range available at the Cambridge Centre."
CAE_13,"**Text: From Here to Fatherhood**

**A. The Theatre Director**  
I have had a unique personal life, and while I can't say I'm proud of everything, I have enjoyed 35 years with small children. This morning, I fed the baby, and that is what being a father means to me. I feel very lucky with my children. We share many interests: opera, theatre, books, and music. This creates a strong bond, especially now that they are mostly grown up and I have become more of a friend than just a father. I do not believe in physical punishment. I have slapped my children in anger before, but I do not support it. I may not have been the most attentive father, but I have always tried to be available. I am here for them if they need me, but I believe they should reach out to me. If I start asking them why they haven't contacted me, it creates unnecessary guilt. My parents did that to me, and I would never do that to my children.

**B. The Advertising Executive**  
I was quite young when my children were born, around 25, and I found the responsibilities challenging. It made me feel older quickly, but it also kept me young, which I appreciate. As they became teenagers, they introduced me to music, youth culture, and fashion, which helped me stay connected in my work. I missed some important moments, like their first concerts and sports days, and I feel sad about that. However, now I can take them on vacations to the south of France, and they enjoy spending time with our friends and attending parties and advertising events without feeling out of place. I think it helps that my job is seen as exciting.

**C. The Politician**  
My first child was born just as I was about to be elected to the Greater London Council, and the others came soon after. My wife and I promised to make time for them, but as my political career grew, finding time became difficult. I only accept weekend meetings and public events if my children can come with me. This way, they can see what I do when I am not with them, and they don’t feel like I am disappearing. I have noticed more politicians bringing their children to work, which shows we are becoming more aware of the importance of including our children in our lives.

**D. The Writer**  
My first marriage ended when my daughters, Kate and Bonnie, were young, which made me think more about fatherhood. I worked hard to stay connected with them. My ex-wife and I even tried living next to each other for a while so they could visit easily, but I think that confused them. Kate has said in interviews that I was always there for her, but I wonder if I was a good father. I was around a lot, but I treated my children like adults too soon. Kate recently said we were too lenient. I wish I had set more rules and structure. I still worry about my older daughters just as much as my youngest. In that way, your children never really leave you.

**E. The TV Presenter**  
I was ready for children. I was 30, had met my wife, and we had a nice home, so we thought, ""Why not have a child instead of just buying new furniture?"" Having my daughter, Betty, has helped me understand who I am. Creating a child feels very special, and it is. But it also makes you just one of many parents. It can be frustrating at times, but any irritation disappears with just one look at her. A baby's smile is incredibly powerful; it can melt anyone's heart."

CAE_46,"**Text: 'Science Defying Gravity'**

Journalist Tom Mumford joins students who are using weightlessness to test their ideas. From the outside, the aircraft looked like any other. The pilot informed the 13 students from Europe and America that it was a Boeing KC-135 refueling tanker, built in 1964 and based on the Boeing 707 passenger plane. However, the inside was very different. It resembled a long white tunnel with few windows and lights along the padded walls. Most of the seats were removed, leaving only a few at the back where the nervous students sat, feeling anxious. 

For a year, these students had competed to take part in this flight, which was organized by the European Space Agency. They had to come up with creative experiments to conduct in weightless conditions. Those with the best ideas earned a spot on this unique flight, which was like the most thrilling roller coaster ride imaginable. 

For the next two hours, the Boeing would fly in a way that felt like a giant bird soaring upwards before diving back down. The goal was to create a moment of weightlessness at the top of each curve. When the pilot cut the engines at 3,000 meters, the aircraft would rise higher due to its own speed before gravity pulled it back down. During the brief moments between rising and falling, everything inside the aircraft would become weightless, and the students would feel as if they were closer to the moon than to Earth.

The flight took off smoothly, but any thoughts of a regular passenger flight vanished when the pilot put the Boeing into a steep climb for about 20 seconds. The engines roared, blood rushed from our heads, and we were thrown around the cabin. Then, the engines stopped, and we quickly experienced weightlessness. For 20 seconds, we floated in silence, as if the floor had turned into a trampoline. One small step sent us flying towards the ceiling. We floated without direction; up or down no longer made sense. Only gravity helps us understand where we are.

After ten seconds of freefall, the pilot pulled the aircraft out of its dive. The return of gravity was sudden, causing some students to land hard. After completing the first curve, some students felt uneasy about the 29 more to come. Thirty curves allowed for ten minutes of 'space time' for experiments. The Dutch students studied their robotic cat, Leonardo, to see how cats always land on their feet. They released a device they built to investigate this, and one student managed to flip it over using a remote control. 

However, during the next curve, another student accidentally landed on the device, nearly damaging it. Meanwhile, a German team from the University of Aachen studied how the quality of metal joints is affected by the lack of gravity, which is important for building future space stations. Another group from Utah State University worked on creating solar sails from thin liquid films hardened by ultraviolet sunlight. They hoped that once perfected, these sails could help satellites use the sun's energy like a yacht uses wind.

After two hours of flying between heaven and Earth, breakfast felt unsteady, but the main feeling was excitement, not sickness. This feeling would last a long time. One student said, ""It was an unforgettable experience. I already wanted to be an astronaut, but now I want it even more."""
CAE_3,"**Text: 'With the Trees, I Planted My Stake in New Zealand'**

**JONATHON PORRITT TALKS TO DANNY DANZIGER**

Jonathon Porritt is the author of *Seeing Green - The Politics of Ecology*. 

I had a strange time in my life when I didn’t experience any summers. I went to New Zealand every summer, which was actually winter there, so I had nine winters in a row. I enjoyed it because I like winter. My parents had the idea of buying a small piece of land for my brother, sister, and me to take care of. My mother said, “If you can take the time to plant trees, then you can have it.” The idea was that we would always have a connection to New Zealand, which is nice because my father grew up there. They found a piece of land about 20 miles north of Auckland in a place called Rangitoupuni. The land is not very good, but it is suitable for planting trees. I have always been interested in land. I spent a year in Australia working on sheep farms and doing various farming jobs, so the idea of planting trees excited me, and I was eager to start. My family became enthusiastic as we went along. I began planting in 1968, and by the end of 1972, the three of us had planted the entire 70 acres.

In New Zealand in 1968, it was one of those rainy winters. It rained a lot, almost every day we were planting. It seems strange to remember it as a happy time since I was often wet and cold. Every morning was a challenge: getting ready for planting. I would come out of the Land Rover warm and dry, but then the rain would start, and I would have to deal with my damp jacket and wet boots. “The brain begins to take over and allows for many strange thoughts and reflections about life.” In that first year, I had a skilled tree-planter working with me, which was helpful since I had never planted trees seriously before. You wear a planting bag around your neck, filling it with as many trees as possible. When the bag is full, it’s heavy, but it gets easier as it gets lighter.

The hardest part of the job was getting the lines straight. You decide how far apart to plant the trees, then set up three poles in a straight line. These poles guide your planting. Once you are in line, you plant all the way down and then turn around and come back. I enjoy hard physical work, and it helped me get fit. After a while, you can plant trees almost automatically, finding a rhythm and using the fewest spade strokes needed to dig a hole. This rhythm is important in many farming jobs; you train your body to perform a series of standard moves, making the work easier. You develop a regular process: taking the tree from the bag, digging a hole, placing it in the ground, stamping it down, and moving on. 

Mentally, it’s interesting. My mind starts to wander, allowing for many thoughts and reflections about life. A lot of my ideas about nature and our place in it began during those days. I have returned to New Zealand four times since then and watched the trees grow, which is satisfying because I planted them and feel a connection to their success. I always worry when I read news about strong winds or droughts in New Zealand. Such headlines make me anxious. However, everything turned out well, and those trees are now 20 years old and healthy.

I should add that I took a break from teaching and went back in 1984 for three months, completely alone. I wrote my first book there, *Seeing Green*. There is a simple cabin on the tree farm with just a bed, a table, and a chair. In the mornings, I would write; in the afternoons, I would prune the trees, and in the evenings, I would do research. My connection to that area is still very strong. In many ways, it is the place I feel most connected to in terms of the bond between people and the earth. It is a powerful connection."
CAE_10,"**Text: 'CARING FOR BADGER CUBS'**

""What now?"" was my first thought when one of my helpers brought a cardboard box to me. My husband Derek and I have run an open farm in Somerset for six years, where we care for orphaned animals. The noise from the box—a mix of a cackle and a bark—was unfamiliar, so I looked inside and found three small grey badger cubs, each about eight inches long. Their soft coats were covered in fleas, and their milky eyes looked up at me from their tiny black-and-white striped heads. I had never seen badger cubs before. Most are born between mid-January and mid-March and spend their early lives underground. If they are orphaned, they often die from starvation without being found. These three cubs were brought to me by builders who accidentally disturbed their sett while laying drain pipes. Their mother was found dead, with her babies still suckling. Although the cubs were healthy, they were cold and whimpering. After removing the fleas, I took them into the farmhouse kitchen and placed them beside the stove for warmth. There were two females, named Primrose and Bluebell, and a male named Willow. At first, I used a syringe to feed them, but I had to wipe each cub with a warm cloth to mimic the feeling of their mother licking them. This helped them to relieve themselves. For the first few days, I fed them every four hours. Within a week, they were drinking from a bottle and moving around, though a bit unsteadily. They were happy with each other’s company and a heated pad as a substitute for their mother. 

However, three weeks later, I noticed that Willow seemed weak, even though he was still eating normally. This was a warning sign. I should have acted quickly, but I didn’t realize how serious it was. The next morning, I found him dead. The vet's examination showed that Willow had died from a lung infection. When bottle-feeding any animal, it is important not to let them drink too quickly, as liquid can enter the lungs. In Willow's case, this caused an infection that would have been hard to treat, even with antibiotics, because he was so small. Feeling sad about my loss, I continued to care for the other cubs. 

Then, six days later, a local farmer, who had heard about my cubs, came to see me. He had found a single male cub abandoned by its mother behind some silage bags. He knew she would not return because the area had been disturbed, and the cub was cold and hungry. I named him Willow II. At six weeks old, he was about two weeks younger than the females. I soon discovered why his mother had left him; he was very difficult to feed. I had to keep moving the bottle's teat around and squeezing it to get him to drink. After ten minutes, he would finally latch on as if he hadn’t eaten all day. By the end of April, the females were eating creamed rice and anything else I offered. Willow II was happy to stop using the bottle but struggled to eat without making a mess. Eventually, I gave him a sausage, which he slowly chewed and finally ate. After a week of sausages, he was ready to try other foods. 

At nearly five months old, all the cubs were eating cereals for breakfast, a meat and vegetable meal for lunch, and fruit, nuts, cheese, hard-boiled eggs, and sunflower seeds in the evening. Badgers usually eat 60% earthworms, along with beetles, bugs, baby rabbits, mice, voles, and even plant shoots or roots. My badgers were better off than other cubs that year because the summer was very hot, making it hard to find earthworms. By August, my cubs had started to become nocturnal and would only go for walks at dusk or late at night. We often walked through the cider orchard, where the long grass made it easy for them to chase each other. The cubs would get excited, fluff up their fur, and chase their tails. As ""human badgers,"" we joined in their fun. I learned to avoid their playful nips, but Derek, who joined us less often, sometimes got caught and had colorful reactions to being nipped. 

During two of these late-night walks, I saw other badgers in our field. They were likely searching for food because they had to expand their territory. Badgers are very territorial and can be aggressive towards others that enter their area. We were warned that they might come into our badger pen and harm the cubs, so we put sheet metal over the gate to keep it secure. The local press took pictures of me walking the badgers, and there was such interest that we started a campaign to build a sett on the farm for the badgers to live in. With help from others, we designed a new home for them. My son Daniel drew the plans, and we built a sett with tunnels, an enclosure, and a badger gate that faced their usual walking path. It had three chambers, one larger than the others, with a glass side so people could see inside from a darkened area. As the sett took shape, the badgers explored it before their walks. Eventually, they became so excited about the tunnels that they forgot about their walks. 

The cost of building was higher than we expected, but a local bus company called Badgerline sponsored part of the project, and local businesses donated materials. Everyone wanted to see the badgers have a home. One evening, they finally moved in. After watching them for a while, we left them to settle. Half an hour later, I quietly returned to check on them and saw three badgers curled up in their chambers, sound asleep. These days, I don’t walk with them as often, especially since they don’t fully wake up until midnight. We see Primrose only occasionally because she has joined a nearby sett, but Bluebell and Willow II still come to greet me before they dash off into the night. This is their territory now, a place they know well and a home they have happily accepted."
CAE_67,"**Text: In Search of True North - The Man Behind Halley's Comet**

Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, wants to follow in the footsteps of Sir Edmund Halley, who studied compass variations. Anjana Ahuja reports.

Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is famous for the comet named after him. However, one of his most important achievements was charting the 'variations of the compass' during his sea voyages on the warship Paramore. These variations, now called 'declination', refer to the angle between magnetic north and true geographical north. Understanding this angle was crucial for sailors to correct their compasses and navigate accurately.

Halley, one of only two men in England at that time paid to do scientific research, set out for the Cape Verde Islands to chart declination in the North and South Atlantic. His first trip was cut short due to crew problems, but he later sailed again. This journey took him to Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, Newfoundland, and back to England. In 1701, he published a 'New and Correct Chart showing the Variations of the Compass in the Western and Southern Oceans'. More advanced charts based on his work helped sailors for over a century until changes in the Earth's magnetic field made them less accurate.

Dr. Clark plans to celebrate the 300th anniversary of Halley's journey by retracing the Paramore's route. He needs to raise £70,000 before starting, and Sir Vivian Fuchs, who led the first expedition across Antarctica, is supporting his efforts. Dr. Clark became interested in Halley while working at Halley Station in Antarctica, where he read about the scientist's life. ""Halley led a remarkable life,"" Dr. Clark says. ""He was a respected scientist and led expeditions. He was not just an astronomer; he also researched geophysics. While he was Astronomer Royal, he mapped the stars and had other interests.""

During this time, Halley invented a diving bell and advised Sir Isaac Newton while he wrote *Principia Mathematica*, a key work in physics. Dr. Clark believes retracing Halley's voyage will give him the recognition he deserves. His expedition, called 'In the Wake of the Paramore', will also have scientific value. It will involve taking measurements similar to Halley's but with more accurate instruments. These measurements are important because the Earth's magnetic field is constantly changing. The data collected will help improve the current model of the Earth's magnetic field, known as the international geomagnetic reference field.

""It is common to measure the size but not the direction of the magnetic field,"" Dr. Clark explains. ""You need to know true north to measure the direction. On our expedition, we can use global positioning satellites to find that."" The British Geological Survey and the United States Navy will provide instruments. A Danish satellite will also be taking similar measurements, and Dr. Clark hopes his data will fill in any gaps in the Atlantic Ocean coverage. Ground-based measurements will also be useful for comparison.

Halley's Atlantic journey was significant as it was the first scientific expedition at sea, and he was the first civilian appointed as a naval captain to pursue his interest in declination. Does Dr. Clark have the qualifications to succeed in his voyage? He has spent two years in Antarctica and worked in the geomagnetic group at the British Geological Survey. He has already sailed the 13,000 kilometers from Rio de Janeiro to England. He plans to complete the expedition in four stages with different crews.

Does he share Halley's obsessive nature? ""I am willing to give up my life for eight months to do this, so some might think I'm obsessed. But I wouldn't want to sail across the Atlantic again without a good reason. Halley and his fascinating life have given me a real sense of purpose."""
CAE_27,"**Text: 'POWER DRESSING'**

Every summer, the peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show off their beautiful tail feathers to the often critical hens. This behavior raises a question that puzzled Charles Darwin: how could birds develop such extravagant features in a competitive world? How do they manage to survive with such a burden? 

Zoologist Marion Petrie and her team from the Open University are studying the peacocks at Whipsnade, a century after Darwin's death, to find answers. Darwin believed that living beings evolved through natural selection, meaning that the individuals best suited to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce. However, he thought that being the ""fittest"" usually meant being the strongest or fastest. In contrast, the peacock's tail seemed to be a disadvantage, leading Darwin to suggest a different process called ""sexual selection."" He argued that females are attracted to beauty for its own sake.

Darwin's friend, Alfred Russel Wallace, had a different view. He believed that if peahens preferred males with the most impressive tails, it must be because those males had some other important quality that helped them survive, even if it wasn't obvious to humans. According to Wallace, the tail was not just for show; it was a sign of something beneficial.

Today, researchers still debate these ideas. Studying the natural behavior of peafowl is challenging, but the 200 birds at Whipsnade, which live in a semi-wild environment and are used to people, provide a unique opportunity for research. Petrie and her team are investigating two main questions: Do peahens really choose the males with the most impressive tails? And do these males have any real advantages, as Wallace suggested, or is it just for show, as Darwin believed?

Observations show that the hens do seem to prefer the males with the most eye-spots on their tails, which are related to tail length. Males with more eye-spots attract more mates. However, it is still unclear if these attractive males are better in other ways. William Hamilton from Oxford University proposed that showy male birds are often free of parasites, and their bright feathers signal their health. There is evidence for this in other bird species, but Petrie and her team have not yet been able to study the internal parasites of the Whipsnade peacocks.

This year, Petrie is comparing the offspring of attractive males with those of less attractive ones. Are the children of the attractive males healthier and growing faster? If they are, it would support Wallace's idea that female choice is based on practical benefits.

There is also an interesting theory from mathematician and biologist R A Fisher, known as ""Fisher's Runaway."" He suggested that if a female chooses a male with a slightly better tail, her sons will inherit that tail, and her daughters will inherit her preference for long tails. This could lead to a cycle where males with the longest tails attract the most mates, reinforcing the preference for long tails in females. Modern computer models suggest that this process could explain the evolution of the peacock's tail, supporting Darwin's idea that females might eventually select beauty for its own sake."
CAE_66,"**THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS**

Tom Cunliffe believes that the best boat design should mix traditional and modern elements. He applied this idea in his own boat, 'The Westerman'. This week, the Summer Boat Show in London showcases many beautiful yachts filled with new technology. Most of these boats are descendants of a major design change that happened 25 years ago. In contrast, my boat rests quietly in a tidal creek on the south coast. Although it was designed last year, it looks like it is 100 years old, which might make you think its owner is a romantic. Perhaps I am, but I’m not sure. 

This boat benefits from the charm of classic design, but modern technology has made the process easier. However, it is important to note that advanced technology often separates sailors from the real challenges of life at sea. These challenges are often what they wanted to experience by going sailing in the first place. I am not saying that sailors should go back to facing every difficulty. I believe it is essential for my boats to have a coal stove for warmth and comfortable sleeping areas. But why go sailing if every sail operates automatically? Dealing with a flapping sail is surely part of a sailor's experience. 

Why should we give up common sense and move our steering positions from the safe back of the boat to a less secure spot near the front? Unfortunately, this change creates a cabin that resembles an ocean liner, with a bed larger than one at home. For me, a boat should always be a boat, not a house on the water. When I bought my previous boat, Hirta, to sail around Britain for a TV race series, the previous owner noted that it had all the comforts but no luxuries. During my time with Hirta, I learned how true this was. 

Hirta had heavy sails, no pumped water, little electricity, no fridge, no central heating, no winches, and no electronics, especially for navigation. Yet, she was the kindest and easiest boat I have ever sailed. However, classic boats require a lot of maintenance, and when I injured my back, I realized I could no longer care for her. I looked for a younger boat but found none that met my needs, so I decided to build a new one from scratch. 

The Westerman has never let me down. Although designer Nigel Irens and his assistant Ed Burnett are skilled with computer design programs, Irens first sketched this boat on a paper napkin before moving to the computer. After creating a set of lines, he carved a model, just like boat builders did in the past. We reviewed the initial design and then made adjustments using the computer. The next version was almost perfect, and by the time we finished, the design was just right. 

The completed boat has crossed the North Atlantic and won four out of her first six races. She has a timeless look, moves beautifully at sea, and her interior, made from reclaimed pitch pine, creates a peaceful atmosphere. This may be because she was designed solely as a sailing boat, without considering any furniture we might add. This traditional approach works well. In her calm presence, she proves that you don’t need to follow trends to find happiness, and sometimes it is wise to learn from history. Built with wood treated with a special glue, she is completely waterproof. Therefore, she has all the advantages of a fiberglass boat but looks, feels, and sails like a true sailing vessel."

Health farms and country house hotels with spa facilities are becoming very popular. We asked five journalists to visit some of these places.

**A. HENLOW GRANGE**  
I was excited to spend six days at Henlow Grange because I was tired and needed to relax. My room in the large 18th-century house was very comfortable, and I felt calm right away. On the first day, I did nothing and slept a lot. From the second day, I started attending body conditioning classes and tried as many classes as I could, like stretch and tone, yoga, and body alignment. All the instructors are very well trained. I was amazed at how flexible I felt as the week went on. They offer many treatments, including aromatherapy (which helped me relax), seaweed baths, manicures, and pedicures. The facial, which lasts an hour, truly makes you feel rejuvenated. The staff in the treatment rooms were incredibly friendly and professional. The atmosphere is full of energy and enthusiasm. Henlow plans to renovate this year, adding a half-size Olympic swimming pool and a Light Diet Room. Bicycles are available for riding around the grounds. If you prefer to relax, you can read a magazine or take a peaceful walk in the garden. During my stay, my mood and appetite improved. I left feeling wonderful and full of energy, which lasted a long time. I will definitely return. This is the perfect getaway for a stressed working woman. Save Room 5 for me!

**B. SHRUBLAND HALL**  
The calm and relaxing atmosphere of this stately home was clear as soon as I walked up the large staircase into the reception area. The Hall has a beautifully decorated library, a lovely conservatory, and plenty of space, so you can avoid talking to others if you wish. Upon arrival, everyone receives a medical check-up, which includes an examination and a check of weight and blood pressure. We were all called patients, which felt a bit strange since I am healthy. However, I was impressed that a shoulder issue found during the examination was quickly shared with the fitness instructor, and we worked on it in group workshops and individual sessions. Each patient follows a specific diet. I lost weight without fasting, but I was still hungry enough to get a bad headache on the second day. My daily menu included grapefruit and honey for breakfast, salads for lunch, and a mix of exotic fruit, yogurt, and hot broth for dinner. If you are not on a light diet, you can eat in the main dining hall, where the food is tasty and well-presented. You receive a massage or water therapy every other day. All extra treatments are reasonably priced.

**C. CAREYS MANOR**  
Careys is not a health farm and does not claim to be one. It is a lovely old manor with cozy log fires and a spacious lounge. If you are counting calories, you might want to skip the gourmet food. The French chef prepares rich sauces and delicious creamy desserts. Luckily, the hotel has a fully-equipped gym and a soft-water pool, so I could work off some of the tempting treats. (You can choose a 'health-conscious' diet if you want to lose weight.) There is a spa bath, steam room, Swiss shower, sauna, and treatment rooms. A major attraction is the sports injury clinic. I received expert advice on an old shoulder injury. The physiotherapist suggested good posture, exercises, and massage. Careys is both comfortable and luxurious, relaxed and calm. If you want to explore, there is beautiful countryside nearby.

It offers health and beauty treatments, a well-equipped gym, saunas, a swimming pool, tennis, horse riding, and more. There are beautiful woodland walks and gardens on the 376-acre National Trust estate. Waldo's, a highly-acclaimed restaurant, serves dishes that are absolutely delightful. It took me half an hour to read the dinner menu because there were so many choices. The meal was fantastic, especially the sticky-toffee pudding with banana ice cream. I went to bed feeling very happy! The next morning, I spent a few hours in the gym using exercise equipment to burn off some calories before my next meal. In the Pavilion, I enjoyed a facial with gentle heat and essential oils, followed by an aromatherapy massage. I thought about the other reports my fellow journalists would write about fitness assessments, workouts, and beauty treatments. Cliveden offers all these if you want to use them before enjoying a meal at Waldo's.

**E. SPRINGS HYDRO**  
The best and worst thing about Springs Hydro is the carrot cake. The best because it is the most delicious I have ever tasted. The worst because it has 360 calories, which can be a setback if you want to lose weight. You have been warned! The second best thing is the amazing aromatherapy massage. I chose a relaxing oil blend and fell asleep twice during the massage. I returned to my room and had the best night's sleep in years. The facilities are modern and well-organized, with luxurious bedrooms. There are many therapists and beauty rooms, making it easy to schedule appointments. A variety of treatments are available, from manicures and pedicures to deep-cleansing facials and body treatments. The guests are a diverse mix, including football teams, mothers and daughters, best friends, and singles. Ideally, I would take a break here about once a month.

CAE_22,"**NATURAL TALENTS**

In the seven million years since humans separated from chimpanzees, we have not developed many differences; genetically, we are still over 98% similar to chimps. This suggests that the traits that make us human are a recent development in our evolutionary history. Our ability to create art and other unique human traits likely comes from just a small number of our genes. This is a significant responsibility for such a limited set of genes. 

Recent studies of animal behavior have shown that many traits once thought to be unique to humans are now seen as differences in degree rather than kind. For instance, both humans and wild chimpanzees use tools; chimpanzees use sticks to eat and as weapons, while sea otters use rocks to crack open clams. Regarding language, monkeys have simple warning calls for predators like leopards, eagles, and snakes. These findings suggest that the differences between humans and animals are not as clear-cut as once believed, with art being one of the few significant distinctions.

However, if human art comes from a unique genetic trait, it is curious that our ancestors did not create art for almost 6.9 million years after separating from chimps. The earliest forms of art may have been wood carvings or body painting, but these materials do not last over time. The first clear evidence of human art appears around 35,000 years ago with cave paintings, statues, necklaces, and musical instruments created by Cro-Magnons.

If we argue that our recent artistic explosion sets us apart, we must consider how our art differs from that of animals. Three common claims are made: human art is non-utilitarian, it is created for aesthetic pleasure, and it is learned rather than instinctive. 

First, as Oscar Wilde said, ""All art is quite useless."" A biologist might interpret this to mean that human art does not help us survive or pass on our genes, unlike most animal behaviors. While some human art serves a purpose in communication, it is not the same as passing on genes. In contrast, birdsong has clear functions, such as defending territory or attracting mates, which help transmit their genes. By this measure, human art does seem different.

The second claim is that human art is motivated by aesthetic pleasure, which also seems reasonable. We cannot ask birds if they enjoy the beauty of their songs, but they mainly sing during mating season, suggesting they do not sing just for pleasure. Again, this makes human art appear unique.

The third claim is that human art is learned rather than instinctive. Different human groups have distinct art styles that are learned. For example, songs sung in Tokyo are different from those in Paris. However, these differences are not genetically inherited. People from different cultures can learn each other's songs. In contrast, some bird species are born with the ability to sing their specific songs, even if they have never heard them before.

The role of learning in human art is evident in how quickly our art styles change. Roman writers described geese honking 2,000 years ago, and they still do today. However, human art evolves rapidly; even a casual museum visitor can tell that a twentieth-century painting is more recent than the Mona Lisa. Art experts can often identify when a painting was made and who created it, but they might confuse two mid-twentieth-century artists named Congo and Betsy, who were actually chimpanzees. Congo created up to 33 paintings in one day for his own enjoyment and became upset when his pencil was taken away. Congo and Betsy had a show of their paintings in 1957 at London's Institute of Contemporary Art, and many of their works sold, which is something many human artists cannot claim.

These paintings by our closest relatives blur the lines between human art and animal behavior. Like human art, the ape paintings did not serve a specific purpose; they were created for the satisfaction of the painter. One might argue that human art is different because most human artists intend their work as a means of communication, while the apes did not care to share their paintings. However, this argument is not entirely convincing, as some famous human art was also created for personal satisfaction rather than communication."
CAE_39,"**Text: An Amazing Adventure**

The Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last unexplored places on Earth. It is also one of the most dangerous. Charles Blackmore crossed it and lived to tell the story. There are very few big adventures left and very few heroes. Children's stories used to be full of brave explorers with sunburnt skin and eyes squinting to see far away on their journeys into the unknown. Nowadays, you rarely find such characters in stories, or even in real life. Or so I thought until I met Charles Blackmore.

Blackmore's great adventure was leading a team across the Taklamakan Desert, which means ""once entered, you never come out."" Local people call it the Desert of Death. He remembered the dangers and excitement of that incredible journey while sitting calmly at home with his family. The team included four Britons (one was the medical officer), an American photographer, four Chinese experts, 30 camels, and six camel handlers. It later turned out that the camel handlers had never worked with camels before; they were long-distance truck drivers. This misunderstanding could have endangered everyone’s lives and the success of the expedition.

This diverse group set out to cross 1,200 kilometers of one of the world's harshest deserts, and Charles Blackmore wrote a fascinating account of their journey. At that time, he was about to leave the Army after 14 happy years. He started the expedition for fun, to fill a gap in his life, and to discover who he really was outside the Army. ""I had always thought I would spend my whole life in the Army. I had been offered a promotion, but suddenly I wanted to see who Charles Blackmore really was. It was a big risk. My wife, Tina, was very worried that I wouldn’t come back since nobody had ever done that route before; we went into it without knowing what to expect. In the end, it took 59 days to cross from west to east, and the desert was surprisingly good to us.""

Anyone reading his remarkable story will be surprised by the word ""good."" The team faced terrible hardships: severe stomach illness, extreme temperatures, intense thirst, and the loss of part of their water supply. ""But,"" Blackmore explains, ""when we were at our limits and the camels had gone without water for seven days, we managed to find some. We didn’t experience the desert's famous sandstorms, and we never faced the freezing cold that could have stopped us completely. That doesn’t mean we didn’t struggle the whole time. The fine sand got into everything, especially blisters and wounds. The high dunes were hard to climb for us and for the heavily loaded camels, which often rolled over onto us.""

""What pushed me on more than anything was the need to survive. We had no backup plan. Our budget and time didn’t allow for one. No aircraft ever flew over us. Once we entered the sandhills, we were completely on our own. I knew I had the mental strength for the trip, but I was very scared about my physical ability to do it. I remember the first day — we sat at the edge of the desert, and it was so hot that it was hard to breathe. I thought, 'We have to do it now!' At that moment, I was very scared.""

If it was tough at the beginning, how did they feel at the end? ""After walking for 1,000 kilometers, you’re not going to give up. You’ve endured so much; you have come so far. We were very thin but also very strong despite our exhaustion. My body was fit, and my legs felt powerful. I could walk over anything.""

Midway through the book, Blackmore describes lying in the desert, looking up at a full moon and thinking of his family. How aware was he of how hard it must have been for them? ""Inside me, there’s someone trying to find peace. When I have doubts about myself now, I think back to the image of the desert and remember that we managed to complete that journey. I feel prouder of that expedition than of anything else I’ve done. Yet, when I think of my life’s achievements, I think of my family and the happiness we share — by that measure, the desert does not compare.""

Has Charles Blackmore found peace? ""I long for the challenge — for the open spaces — the excitement of it all. We were lifted by our sense of purpose. I find it hard now to fit into the sameness of modern life."""

Life was becoming overwhelming for Susan Harr, so she decided to unplug her gadgets and enjoy the benefits of manual work. Many people love technology because it provides us with amazing devices that make life easier and give us more free time. However, this reliance on technology has led us to believe that it is essential and acceptable. The truth is clear: using our hands does not consume energy or harm the environment. 

After a frustrating experience with a broken word processor, which cost me a lot to fix, I began to question whether gadgets are really worth the money and hassle. Am I as dependent on technology as I think? Gradually, I have stopped using household gadgets as they break down. This makes me wonder what ""time"" technology actually gives us. Is it just time to engage in more activities that require even more gadgets? If that’s the case, then the marketing experts have tricked us.

When my broken gadget started making strange noises, even after being unplugged, I left it outside, where it now sits quietly like a ghost. I no longer feel tied to a noisy machine, and I can take my time with my sewing. I have always been a bit scared of electric machines that move quickly towards my fingers. The best part is that I can easily carry my sewing supplies with me wherever I go.

Of course, there are some gadgets I appreciate. After a year without a washing machine, I realized how valuable it is. However, losing some gadgets has brought me unexpected joy. Feeling that we were spending too much time in front of the television, I returned our rented color TV and switched back to a small black-and-white one. This change has made us focus more on what is truly worth watching, and we now spend more time walking the dog, reading, talking, or enjoying other hobbies. One of my hobbies is sewing, and I no longer use my old Singer sewing machine, which has become a plant table. Since I cannot afford to replace it, I have started sewing by hand.

We often think we cannot live without our gadgets, and while we may resist the idea of living without them, we should remember the hard lives of those who worked long hours without machines. Computers now do many tasks for us quickly and even entertain us. However, the time I spend sewing is not boring; it has many benefits. I can sew while listening to the radio, talking to family and friends, or even watching TV if the task is simple. I feel good sitting by the fire with a cup of tea while I sew.

I used to think with dread about women who spent hours sewing by hand. I imagined it was tiring and difficult. But now, I find it calming and satisfying to create something with my hands. I am surprised at how quickly I can finish projects, and my life feels slower and more relaxed. I no longer feel the pressure to rush from one task to another. I have also taken back control of my kitchen, where I can wash dishes and daydream, enjoying this simple activity.

Now, I look around my home and wonder if we really need all our gadgets, like the freezer, microwave, or electric lawnmower. In fact, we could save a lot of money by doing without electric lights!"

When I arrive at his workshop, located under a railway arch in East London, he greets me with a quick handshake and says, ""Well, fire away then!"" It is not clear if this brusque manner is genuine or if he is hiding a shy side. However, looking around the workshop shows that Hurst is very busy, with good reason not to waste any time. The arched space is filled with half-finished furniture and wooden planks in many natural colors. Hurst has been a cabinet-maker for ten years and has built a strong reputation. His order book is always full for several months ahead, even though he does not actively promote himself. People know that if you want a good cupboard, table, bookcase, or kitchen units, Hurst is the right choice. 

Finding a furniture-maker is not difficult, especially in the countryside where the craft is thriving. However, it is harder to find a cabinet-maker who focuses on creating beautifully crafted furniture with clean, simple designs. ""There are few real cabinet-makers now. Many call themselves furniture-makers,"" Hurst says tiredly. As a craftsman with high standards, he is often disappointed by some modern furniture. ""I am amazed by what some furniture-makers get away with, and saddened by what people accept."" He criticizes poor-quality, mass-produced furniture and craftsmen who produce second-rate items. This pursuit of perfection is clearly a key to Hurst's success, along with his talent. He is not shy about his skills. In fact, his strong self-confidence is surprising given his initial brusque manner. ""I have a huge natural ability,"" he says seriously. ""I have always been good at making things."" If it were not for his modesty towards the end of our conversation, I would have thought he was completely serious.

Hurst is self-taught. So how did he learn his craft? ""I asked the right questions and picked it all up,"" he says casually. Most of his work comes from private clients. ""I used to do some commercial work for companies, but it was soul-destroying."" Some clients come back to him repeatedly. ""You end up doing their whole house. That is very satisfying."" However, he honestly admits that not all client relationships are easy. ""The most frustrating clients are those who don’t know what they want, and then decide too late. My favorite clients are the exacting ones."" 

While Hurst has every reason to be proud, he is also generous in praising others when it is deserved. With a sudden touch of modesty, he says, ""There are people far better than me. I can admire other craftsmen. After all, I wasn't trained at Parnham,"" which is a leading college of furniture design. However, he is also very critical of those craftsmen who ""try to be artists and take a year to make one piece."" He has little patience for degree shows, where students display their work while trying to make fashion statements. ""That can be pretentious. A piece of furniture is not about making a statement. It has to be something people can really use."" 

Hurst may be confident and brusque, but you could never call him or his work pretentious. In fact, his final words show a practical approach to his craft and a humility that contrasts with his earlier self-confidence. ""After all, I am only making furniture,"" he says as I leave.'"
CAE_49,"**Three Theories About Sleep**

People spend about one-third of their lives sleeping. This suggests that sleep is very important. However, scientists do not fully agree on why we need to sleep. There are three main theories.

The first and most popular theory says that sleep is mainly for our physical health. It suggests that while we sleep, our bodies work to repair any damage from the day and to help us feel better.

The second theory focuses on learning. It claims that sleep helps us process the information we learn during the day. According to this theory, without sleep, we would not be able to learn effectively.

The third theory is about energy. It states that we need to sleep to recharge our energy, so we are ready for the next day."
CAE_31,"**ECCENTRICS**

An eccentric is someone whose behavior is unusual and does not follow the accepted norms of society. This raises the question, ""What is normal?"" Most of us have our own quirks and odd habits. It could be a love for entering newspaper competitions, a habit of collecting beer mats, or a tendency to write letters to the editor about various topics. Eccentricity is a way of expressing our individuality. Inside us, there is often a struggle between two opposing forces. One is called individualism, which represents our desire to be unique, and the other is conformity, which represents our need to fit in. For many, the desire to be accepted and liked by others is stronger than the desire to stand out and be different.

People with unusual hobbies, strong opinions, or unconventional behavior often come together. They form clubs, hold meetings, and organize events to share their interests or concerns. The key word here is 'common.' They seek others who understand what their friends and family might see as odd. Being part of a group, even a small one, can be comforting. Most of us feel a tension between individualism and conformity. While we often follow the crowd, we may also resist the idea that we are doing so. We feel a need to express our individuality, like when a man at a bar declares, ""I say what I think,"" or when a newcomer insists, ""You must take me as I am.""

At any moment, we can choose to embrace our individuality. Many people succeed in their careers by doing just that. For example, Bob Dylan, the American singer, has said, ""When you feel strongly about what you are doing and pursue it with determination, you will surprise many people."" However, this assertion of individuality is not the same as eccentricity, especially in the beginning. When a pop singer wears strange clothes for attention, or a socialite makes shocking comments to be noticed, that is not eccentricity. But if they continue these behaviors until they become a part of who they are, then they may be considered eccentric. 

The most important aspect of eccentricity is its naturalness. Eccentrics do not try to be odd; they simply are. A true eccentric is not focused on what others think; they act according to their true selves. This sets eccentrics apart from enthusiasts, practical jokers, clever criminals, exhibitionists, and recluses. These individuals are aware of the world around them and often act in response to it. Some want to impress society, while others want to escape from it, but they are all conscious of societal expectations. In contrast, eccentrics live their lives freely, without concern for others' opinions."
CAE_58,"**Natural Books**

We asked four well-known naturalists to share the wildlife book that has influenced them the most.

**A. Geoffrey Lean**  
Choosing the author was easy for me. As an environmental journalist, I have had the chance to meet some of the great thinkers in this field. Among them, Barbara Ward stands out. She has been at the center of environmental issues in post-war Europe. She combined her experiences from various environmental movements into a powerful philosophy. As a young journalist, I found that she helped me understand these complex issues better than anyone else. Choosing her book was more difficult. It could have been *Only One Earth* or *Progress for a Small Planet*, but I believe *The Home of Man* is her most important work. It focuses on the rapid growth of cities worldwide, while also addressing the larger themes she cared about. It is a passionate call for what we now call ""sustainable human development."" I have read many books since, but none have matched its impact.

**B. Linda Bennett**  
When I read *Signals for Survival* by Niko Tinbergen, I can hear the calls of herring gulls and remember the smell of guano in the sun. This book wonderfully explains the fascinating world of animal communication through words and pictures. After reading it, watching a gull colony becomes a different experience; what seems chaotic turns out to be a well-organized social structure. You can see which birds are partners and recognize families later in the season. Niko Tinbergen was a respected behaviorist who wanted to share his findings with everyone. His collaboration with talented wildlife artist Eric Ennion made this book special and interesting for anyone who loves wildlife. Ennion's paintings, created from years of observing birds, show how one gull can be aggressive while another is calm. This is the work of a true naturalist.

**C. Lee Durrell**  
The book that has influenced me the most is *My Family and Other Animals* by Gerald Durrell. This book not only led me to a wonderful husband and a career in conservation, but it also defined my love for the natural world. I was researching animal sounds in Madagascar when I first read it. After two years of challenges, opening this book made my world brighter. It beautifully connects animals, people, joy, and beauty—a small version of a world worth saving. Many believe humans are the worst because of the harm we have caused to other species. However, I remember Gerald as a boy in the book, viewing all living beings as a family, intertwined and inseparable. This is a concept we all need to understand.

**D. Bruce Pearson**  
I discovered *The Shell Bird Book* by James Fisher in my school library shortly after it was published in 1966. I was immediately attracted to it, especially the 48 color plates of birds by Eric Ennion, which were described as being painted ""with particular skill and charm."" These images caught my attention. I already had other bird books and had spent holidays learning to identify birds. They inspired me to start sketching what I saw. However, *The Shell Bird Book* offered much more. Along with the beautiful paintings, it included chapters on bird migration, the history of birds in Britain, and even a chapter on birds in music, literature, and art. The wide range of information and exciting images encouraged me to appreciate birds and nature more broadly. The book showed me that my emotional and creative responses to nature are just as valid as scientific ones. Since art was my stronger subject, I began to see new possibilities for myself."
CAE_37,"**Text: DO REVIEWS SELL BOOKS?**

We asked five leading British publishers about how book reviews affect a book's success. Here is what they said.

**Publisher A**  
Reviews are very important for publishers; they are the first thing we look at in newspapers. A study by the Book Marketing Council showed that many people said they bought a book because of reviews, more than any other reason like ads or recommendations from friends. Authors feel differently about reviews. Both authors and publishers are upset when there are no reviews, but publishers are usually more accepting of bad reviews. They believe that any mention in the press can help sales, as readers will want to see for themselves. Publishers enjoy reviews that match their own opinions about a book since they are often the first to read it.

**Publisher B**  
Publishers and newspapers both care about book reviews, but they have different needs. Newspapers want to entertain their readers, while publishers want their books to be reviewed, ideally in a positive way. Book reviewing is better now than it was 40 years ago, as it is more varied and less exclusive. However, there is still a tendency to overlook paperbacks, which many people read. Weekly summaries of reviews are often not enough, and original paperbacks rarely get serious attention. Still, publishers need reviews because they are a cost-effective way to promote a book and an author. A good review from a trusted source can boost sales, especially if there are several positive reviews. Fame helps get books into readers' hands.

**Publisher C**  
Reviews are essential for literary publishing; without them, we would struggle. Our books are usually not by well-known authors, so we rely on literary editors to give our books space in their publications. Good reviews are much more valuable than ads because readers trust them. Publishers often say they care more about the size of the review than its content. The impact of reviews on sales is complex. Good reviews can launch a book and a career, but they need to be supported by other factors like recommendations from readers, strong responses from booksellers, and smart marketing.

**Publisher D**  
I wish I understood the relationship between publishing and reviewing in Britain! In the United States, it is straightforward: a single review in the New York Times can make or break a book. In Britain, however, booksellers often ignore reviews. Sometimes it takes many years of great reviews for people to notice a good writer. Interestingly, some poorly received books or those without reviews can still sell very well. The situation is unpredictable, although non-fiction reviews often focus more on the subject than the book itself.

**Publisher E**  
All publishers and writers hope for great reviews. But do they actually sell books? I once published a biography that received excellent reviews, but it failed to sell because people felt they could just read the reviews instead of buying the book. Does the reviewer's name matter? Thirty years ago, if certain reviewers praised a book, people paid attention. Today, it can be just as effective if an unexpected reviewer writes a clever or original review, which can encourage readers to buy the book."
CAE_2,"**WEATHERVANE MAKER**

The craft of making weathervanes is very old, dating back to ancient Egypt. Today, this skill is still practiced in the workshop of Graham Smith. He is one of the few people in the country who makes hand-cut weathervanes. Graham creates unique designs based on what his customers want. ""This way, I can make a special personalized item,"" he says. Many of his customers are women looking for gifts for their husbands. They want something unique that reflects the man's interests or profession.

Graham's work is quite different from the traditional cockerel design, which is the most common type of weathervane. The first weathervane he made was not a cockerel, but a witch on a broomstick. His friends liked the surprise gift he made for his wife and started asking him to create weathervanes for them. ""I realized that there are endless possibilities for designs,"" he explains. Graham then decided to focus on making weathervanes as a business.

Before this, he trained as a precision engineer and worked in that field for 15 years. Five years ago, he and his wife, Liz, decided to switch roles: she became the main breadwinner while he took care of their children and built the weathervane business. He has no regrets about this change. ""My previous job was not creative, but this work is exciting and artistic,"" he says. ""I really enjoy designing.""

Graham has now created over 100 original designs. He pays close attention to detail and always gets the customer's approval on the design before he starts cutting it by hand. He also keeps many traditional designs available, as they are still popular. ""People seem to appreciate handmade items,"" Graham says. ""They like the chance to own something a bit different.""

Graham does not plan to expand his business because he wants to keep it as a rural craft. ""I have found my place in the market. People love the uniqueness, and I feel satisfied when a simple shape becomes something almost lifelike,"" he explains. ""For centuries, weathervanes have helped communities understand the weather by showing changes in wind direction."" He adds that with more people moving to the countryside, many want to add a special touch to their homes, which has helped crafts like his.

Graham is now busier than ever, sending flat-packed weathervanes to customers around the world, especially in America and Denmark. ""The price depends on how detailed the design is,"" he explains. His latest request was for a curly-coated dog. No matter the occasion, Graham can create a unique gift."
CAE_68,"**Text: 'Beginner Takes All'**

Before it was published, *The Horse Whisperer* was already the most talked-about book of the year. This first novel by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans made him a lot of money. Here, he shares his inspiration and success.

The beginning of the year was tough for Nicholas Evans, who was a screenwriter, producer, and hoping to be a director. Things started badly when a film project he had been working on, *Life and Limb*, fell apart suddenly. He felt disappointed and worried because it had been two years since he had earned any money, and that film was his only hope to calm his angry bank manager.

A sensible person in Evans' situation would have found a job. He could have returned to being a television executive or started a television project that was on hold. Instead, he made a decision that many, including himself, thought was crazy. He bought a ticket to America and spent three months researching his first novel.

Although he acted on impulse, the idea for the story had been in his mind for a while. It was inspired by a farrier he met in Dartmoor while visiting a friend. The farrier told him about a gentle horse that suddenly became aggressive for no reason. Its owners were desperate until they heard about a gypsy who could calm the horse just by talking to it. These people were known as ""horse whisperers."" Evans was fascinated and began to research this topic, initially planning to write a screenplay since he was a filmmaker. However, after feeling disillusioned with the film industry, he decided to write the story as a book.

Throughout the spring, he traveled across the US, visiting ranches and learning about horses and the people who work with them. ""It was a strange time,"" he recalls. ""I was watching people, but I felt very alone and thought my life was falling apart. I had tried for ten years to succeed as a filmmaker, and here I was, deeply in debt and worried about how to support my children, wondering if it was all a mistake.""

By the end of August, after returning home and writing the first half of the book, he felt the pressure from his bank manager. He needed to know if it was worth continuing. He bravely showed the manuscript to a friend who was a literary agent. The agent read it and said it was ""fine."" When asked for an estimate, he suggested Evans might receive $30,000 as an advance for the book. Evans thought about how much he needed to pay off some of his debts, and it was more than that. He had spent seven months on *The Horse Whisperer*, with at least two more months of work ahead. $30,000 was a challenging amount to consider. He was also advised to write a 12-page summary of the rest of the book.

In October, along with the first two hundred pages of the novel, he sent this summary to seven UK publishers just before they left for the famous Frankfurt Book Fair. Within days, his agent called to say he had turned down the first offer of $75,000. ""I said, 'What?' And he replied, 'It's okay, I just feel something good is happening.'""

What happened next is now part of publishing history. Within a week of competitive bidding, the novel was sold to Transworld Publications in the UK for £550,000 and to Delacorte in the US for $3.15 million, both record amounts for a first novel. ""We couldn't believe it; we just sat there in shock. We had never sent the manuscript to New York, and we still don't know how it got there,"" Evans says. They also did not send it to Hollywood, but soon major studios were competing for it. ""My UK agent wisely involved an agent in the US, and when he called to say, 'I think we can get $3 million outright,' we laughed in disbelief."" 

As they all agreed to this amount, they decided to present their case to Evans. One night in October, he sat in his study while four famous filmmakers called one after another, asking for the chance to pay $3 million for an unfinished novel. Evans shared this story with me while we enjoyed coffee on the wooden porch of his home, surrounded by a beautiful garden. He mentioned that he had turned down an offer to write the screenplay for *The Horse Whisperer*. ""It's all been like a fairy tale so far. I don't want to ruin it. Writing at that level is very challenging, and I don't want to become an employee of these people I like who have paid me so much money. I would hate to write a draft or two and then hear them say, 'Thanks, Nick, but now we’ll bring in someone else.'""

He said he would stay involved but from a distance. The success of his novel led to new support for *Life and Limb*, but he was no longer sure he wanted to make it. ""I think it would be foolish not to write another novel,"" he said."

Bobby Fischer is facing challenges as he tries to return to the world of chess. Chess has become more of a young person's game. After being away for 20 years, Fischer is back and playing against his old rival, Boris Spassky. Fischer won the first game, which was impressive, but he is not the same player he was in 1972. Now, at 49 years old, he is out of practice and not in great shape. Spassky is even older. 

The game of chess has changed a lot in the last 20 years. Fischer helped make chess popular, leading to a new era of professionalism. Now, winning is the main goal for modern chess players. In international chess, a player’s nerves and stamina are just as important as their intelligence. The pressure in chess has always been high, as players must make their moves within a set time using a chess clock. If they don’t, they lose immediately. Nowadays, games can last longer, and many are played without breaks, increasing the pressure on players. 

In the last 30 years, each new world champion has been younger than the last. Currently, eight of the ten highest-ranked players are under 30. The way chess is played has also changed. Much of it now happens off the board, including psychological strategies. Players must prepare thoroughly before matches, especially since computers can store millions of chess games and provide quick access to information about opponents. In recent matches, players have used teams of assistants to analyze each other’s strategies. 

Preparation for the opening moves of a game is crucial and can determine the outcome. Today, there are more top players than ever before, with many grandmasters competing for modest prizes worldwide. Success in chess requires both mental and physical effort. A single game can last up to eight hours, and players must maintain focus throughout. A moment of distraction can lead to losing the game. The presence of the chess clock adds to the stress, often leading to a frantic rush at the end of the game, where players have only seconds to make their moves. 

In these moments, players must act quickly and decisively, showcasing skills that any athlete would admire. The game can become a fierce battle where determination and the will to win are key. For top players, losing is very painful, while winning brings great satisfaction and a chance to recover from the stress. However, one win is not enough to secure a tournament victory. Chess tournaments usually last 9-11 days, with games played every day, and there are competitions throughout the year. World championship matches can be even more demanding. 

For example, the 1984 match between Anatoli Karpov and Gary Kasparov in Moscow had to be stopped after several months due to exhaustion, with Karpov losing about 10 kg. Can Fischer overcome these challenges? He once said, ""All I want to do is play chess."" This makes his long absence from the game seem even more puzzling. If he has returned for the money, he is in a good position, as both he and Spassky will earn millions from their match. However, if Fischer believes he can prove he is still the best player, the outcome could be very disappointing for him."

Imogen Edwards-Jones interviews some new British talents, from poets to pop stars, who are on their way to success.

A. Nick Grosso, in his early 30s, has written three well-received plays. He is now turning his first play, *Peaches*, into a movie script. ""It's low budget, but we don't know how low,"" he says. ""It won't be over £30 million, but it could be as little as £30."" Despite his talent, the most surprising thing about Nick is that he had never seen or read a play before writing *Peaches*. ""When I wrote the play, I never thought it would be performed,"" he explains. ""It's set in a car. I probably wouldn't do that now because I understand the challenges. I knew nothing back then."" He left school at 16 but returned a year later. After completing his A-levels, he joined the Young People's Theatre. ""I realized I wanted to write for actors. I wanted my writing to be heard, not just read, because of its rhythm and rhyme,"" he says. ""Suddenly, I was with people who thought like me. It was the first time I enjoyed being in an educational setting. It was very inspiring.""

B. Comedian Simon Pegg, 28, has made great progress in his career since studying drama at Bristol University. He is currently writing a TV comedy series and has just finished a demanding tour with comedy star Steve Coogan. He has always worked hard. Even back in Bristol, he was practicing his comedy in clubs. ""University was very theoretical,"" Simon remembers. ""It made me realize I didn't want to be a serious actor; I was always more interested in comedy. People think comedy is the hardest job, but it really isn't. If you have courage and good material, it's wonderful to make people laugh."" He has performed with the comedy group Funny Business, but his partnership with Steve Coogan has been the most successful. ""He saw my show, and since I was a big fan of his, he probably noticed I was imitating him,"" Simon admits.

C. Ciaran McMenamin, 24, became well-known when he starred in the series *The Young Person's Guide To Becoming A Rock Star*. The response was very positive, and his career has taken off quickly. ""It's been a great opportunity for me,"" he says with a smile. ""Now I can choose what I want to do, which is what I've always wanted."" This is a rare and comfortable position, especially since he has just graduated. Looking back at his early career, it's clear that such recognition was likely. Encouraged by his mother, he moved from leading roles in school to the Ulster Youth Theatre, where he spent four years. ""I was basically using acting to avoid doing homework,"" Ciaran laughs. ""But then I decided I wanted to pursue it because I had a talent and passion for it."" Now, he is waiting for the praise to come in, but when asked about fame, he becomes thoughtful. ""When you're 18, you think you'll love the photos and interviews, but you soon realize that's not why you act. It's about earning respect for doing good work.""

D. Neil Taylor, 25, is the lead singer of the pop band Matrix, which has just signed a three-album deal with Domino Records. Neil and his bandmate Rick Brown are expected to be successful when their single, *Chimera*, is released soon. ""The record company's idea of good sales is very different from mine,"" he says. ""They want a big hit, but for me, if two people buy it, I'll be happy."" Unlike many new pop stars, Neil has worked hard for his success. He left school at 16 and has been trying to enter the music industry ever since. ""It's funny how things happen,"" he says. ""I had been performing at student gigs for eight years and was starting to feel tired. I was about to give up when I met Rick Brown, who had connections at Domino, and we formed Matrix. It couldn't have come at a better time. There were moments when I felt very down, and I had been in some terrible bands. But hopefully, it will all be worth it.""

E. Poet and author Stephen Richards is 27 years old and has won more awards and honors than many people twice his age. He is already well-known in the poetry world, where he has been touring and giving readings several times a week for the past six years. His first novel, *Hidden*, will be published in March. ""It's a story about obsessive love. It was a strong idea that I couldn't express as a poem."" Stephen loved creative writing in school but became disillusioned with education later. ""I chose not to go to university, but I realized I needed to after I got bored stuffing envelopes at a theater."" After university, he published his first work, a children's book, in 1992. ""I don't think my parents expected me to be a writer; they always thought I would just be a reader because that's all I did as a child."" With his poetry receiving much praise, his move into novels is indeed bold. ""My poetry has a structure, and there's less chance of making a big mistake,"" he explains. ""A novel can be any length, so there are more words that could be bad. My main goal is to avoid falling into a routine where I just produce work without caring about its quality."""

A. Isabel, our main character in this quirky novel, thinks she looks good in jeans but rarely wears them because she doesn't want to associate with the wrong people. She is a 31-year-old art student who loves historical romance novels and is looking for Mr. Right. She worries that her knobbly knees might ruin her chances. However, she remains hopeful, which helps her and others in the story. The author writes with great energy, using a style similar to early silent films, with chapter titles like ""Our Hero Feels Inspired.""

B. This story celebrates the rise and near-fall of a local radio station in America. It is told from the perspective of a clever, shy child named Francis With. Francis works for WLT (With Lettuce and Tomato) Radio, a station created by Roy and Ray Soderbjerg to promote their sandwich shop. The station broadcasts a mix of singers, preachers, soap-opera stars, and announcers. The small-town setting allows the author to use dry humor and simple writing, taking readers back to the gentler times of the 1940s and 1950s, filled with dime stores, old cars, and radios.

C. In the author's world, it is normal for a second husband to talk with his wife's first husband. When professor Richard Vaisey falls for a beautiful Russian poet, he shares his feelings with his wife's ex-husband. The poet writes poor poetry, which bothers Richard, and she is also trying to get his help for her wrongly imprisoned brother. However, the way the author resolves these issues is even more interesting. He moves the story forward with a strong sense of humor and carefully examines relationships, making it an enjoyable and clever read.

D. In 1960s London, two sets of best friends—two women and two men—become connected for 25 years through life and death. At the beginning of this long novel, one of the friends, James Hudson, an American businessman, is starting a newspaper that his friend Richard Blake is editing. The newspaper launch is important, but so is the fact that the woman they both loved (and one of them married) was killed years earlier. The story includes murder, ambition, love, and jealousy, all written well. This book allows readers to really get to know the characters.

E. This touching and funny story, written by a top American author, follows Ian Bedloe, who feels guilty about a past mistake. To make up for it, he becomes a 'father' to his brother's three orphaned children. At 40, he is slowly becoming an eccentric bachelor. The story explores deep emotions and highlights the special bond Ian forms with the youngest child, Daphne. It is a warm book that perfectly balances sadness and humor."
CAE_53,"**Volunteer Tourism**

Four academic writers discuss international voluntary work. 

A. It is difficult to say that volunteer tourists make a significant contribution to development. While they can help build homes or schools, they usually pay a large fee to participate in this work. This money, if given directly to a local community, could pay for more labor than the individual volunteer could provide. This is especially true for gap year volunteers, who often lack the technical skills or professional experience needed. Therefore, many studies question whether gap year volunteering is mainly driven by a desire to help others or if young people are more interested in gaining experience that will benefit their careers. However, these projects may help develop individuals who will act ethically in favor of those who are less fortunate in their future careers.

B. Volunteering can lead to better international understanding, improved conflict resolution skills, active participation in global issues through civic organizations, and the growth of international social networks among everyday people. In this case, the overall benefits for both volunteers and host communities can contribute to the greater good. However, if volunteering is mostly done by wealthy individuals, it may provide them with a broader perspective and career advantages, but it will not significantly help those who lack access to international volunteer opportunities. Volunteers will continue to benefit personally while using host organizations and communities to advance their own goals.

C. At its worst, international volunteering can be seen as a form of imperialism or self-serving charity by wealthy Westerners. At its best, it can provide benefits and challenges to volunteers and the organizations they work with, while allowing for the exchange of skills, knowledge, and cultural experiences in developing communities. Most importantly, volunteering can raise awareness and foster a lifelong commitment to addressing unequal power relations and the root causes of poverty, injustice, and unsustainable development.

D. Volunteer tourism aligns with the growing trend of personal strategies to help others. These limited strategies, focused on making a small difference, can seem positive in a time when political action is less popular. The personal aspect appears appealing as it avoids large government and business involvement. However, it also overlooks the need for representative government and reduces development to individual acts of charity, which often do not address the deeper issues faced by poor rural communities. While skepticism about volunteering is often misplaced, volunteer tourism can sometimes involve simple, commendable charity. However, when it is promoted as sustainable development and gap-year companies market their programs as such, it reflects a decline in the understanding of development issues. The politics of volunteer tourism can distract from recognizing global inequalities and the poverty experienced by many in developing countries."

Stuart Harris reports

Many of us listen to the radio in the morning, and most of us need something to help us get out of bed. This is why we have clock radios. But how do you choose a good one? Our panel, which included myself, inventor Tom Granger, and broadcaster Paul Bridges, tested five models currently available.

The 'dual alarm function' advertised with one model does not let you wake up to the buzzer, snooze for a bit, and then finally get out of bed, as I first thought. The instruction booklet suggests using this function to set two different wake-up times: one for weekdays and one for weekends. But who really lives their life like that? Since this model costs about the same as the second one we tested, having a cassette player is a good deal—you can fall asleep to your favorite tapes and wake up to a day without news. We all agreed that the radio quality was excellent, but we wished it was smaller. It is as big as a rugby ball. Paul Bridges said, ""Any clock radio I buy must leave enough space on my bedside table for my keys, wallet, glasses, and phone. Also, I'm a bit paranoid and always book a wake-up call just in case the alarm doesn't go off."" This model was voted the best-looking and overall winner. Paul Bridges said he was ""in love with it,"" even though the clock he tested ""kept getting stuck at 16:00.""

I was impressed by the digital display, with its stylish grey numbers on a soft green background. The wide snooze bar lets you tap it easily with your eyes closed. Unfortunately, the smooth buttons, which felt like pebbles, made me want to touch them like piano keys, which caused problems when I finally looked at the instruction booklet. The clock has a backup battery, so you don’t have to reset it if someone pulls the plug to use a hairdryer or vacuum cleaner; we all liked this feature. However, we found it difficult to set up, though completing it made us feel ""cool"" and sophisticated.

Tom Granger described this model, which has a built-in lamp, as ""unbelievably tacky."" He said, ""You have to pull the strange light out of its socket to make it work, which makes me question the quality of the rest."" He complained that he had to read the instruction booklet twice to get it to work; the clock kept jumping from 12:00 to 02:00. The light was hard to position; you could never read by it—it only shines on the clock, which is already lit. Paul Bridges found the lamp idea amusing but agreed that the radio was hard to tune. The buzzer sounded like ""action stations"" on a submarine and made me want to throw the whole thing across the room. Interestingly, this model is the third most popular on the market. Aimed at young people, with its bright colors and matching strap, it appealed to the child in Tom Granger and me. ""I would choose this one because it stands out,"" he said. In fact, the traditional design of the controls made it the only one we could set up without reading the instruction booklet. Unfortunately, the alarm has a funny 20-minute margin for error; the manual says, ""the alarm may sound about 10 minutes earlier or later than the set time."" Paul Bridges laughed at this idea, saying this model was ""terribly fiddly"" and ""completely useless.""

The simplest and cheapest of all the models tested scored points with Tom Granger because it ""seemed very standard and took up little space,"" and it has old-fashioned dial tuning. ""It's easier to set up. With modern push-button tuning, you're never sure if you've pressed all the buttons correctly, so you can't be confident it will work."" He accepted that manufacturers had to improve radio quality because of button-tuning. I thought the tuning was a bit rough, as did Paul Bridges, but we agreed that the radio quality was good. The buzzer on this model definitely works; it got me out of bed in just two beeps!"
CAE_50,"**Hedgehogs**

A hedgehog is a small mammal known for the sharp spines that cover its body. Hedgehogs are found in many parts of the world, but none are native to America or Australia. All species of hedgehogs can roll into a tight ball when threatened, with their spines pointing outward. The effectiveness of this defense depends on how many spines the hedgehog has. Some desert hedgehogs have adapted to their environment and have fewer spines, making them more likely to run away from danger instead of rolling up. Hedgehogs are mainly active at night and sleep during the day, often hiding under bushes or in holes in the ground. Although all hedgehogs can hibernate, not all do; some will stay awake all year if conditions are suitable."
CAE_25,"**Text: Great Sportswomen on a Winning Streak**

Excelling in any sport is challenging, even for men, but women often face even greater difficulties. Training and competition leave little time for a normal life, requiring many sacrifices. Despite these challenges, women are overcoming prejudice and setting new records. Here, we highlight some remarkable British sportswomen who are achieving their goals.

A. **Jill, 27, Skier**  
""It's an amazing feeling to fly through the air and land safely, but it can be frightening. Sometimes I don't feel well or the weather is bad, but I push through. Having a career outside of skiing is tough because we train for ten months each year. I have to give up a lot of my social life and friends, but it was my choice. There are six men and three women on the British team. We all compete on the same courses and are treated equally—it's a young sport.""

B. **Caroline, 22, Cyclist**  
""Two years ago, I borrowed a bike to join a charity race and ended up winning because I cycled faster than everyone else, which was incredible since I had never cycled before! I earn a good salary as a professional cyclist, and there are many opportunities for endorsements. However, I worry that people might think I succeeded because of my looks rather than my skills. So, I focus on cycling instead of making money. I train for at least four hours every day, plus I do stretching, swimming, and running. My boyfriend is also a cyclist, so he understands the commitment needed.""

C. **Annabel, 26, Rower**  
""Rowing is difficult for girls to start because very few girls' schools offer it. Most girls begin at 19 or 20, which makes it harder to compete internationally. Additionally, coaches often change frequently, leading to a lack of stability in the women's team. However, I enjoy it and love staying fit, plus there is a good social aspect.""

D. **Ffyona, 24, Long-Distance Walker**  
""When I was 13, I dreamed of walking around the world without realizing how vast it is! I found Britain too small and safe. I was very determined and disliked being controlled by others. Each walk has been unique. My walk across Australia was the hardest experience due to the pain. I walked 50 miles a day with very little sleep and many blisters, but I set a record! I had to succeed because my sponsorship money would run out after 95 days. Some men believe women are more likely to fail, so they see sponsoring us as a risk.""

E. **Lisa, 26, Saloon Car Racer**  
""Some men have big egos when driving, especially on highways. When I perform well, they often ignore me. Being a woman has its challenges. When I approach a corner, men think they must beat me, so I've faced many tough moments! You need to be competitive and assertive. It's hard to earn money, and what I do make goes back into racing. Women have been racing since the 1920s and have often been seen as unusual. It's great that more women are joining the sport every year. For me, the thrill of saloon car racing is striving for perfection and aiming for the perfect lap.""

F. **Alison, 28, Triathlete**  
""I wake up at 5:30 three mornings a week to swim. I need Tuesday and Thursday mornings to catch up on sleep. In the evenings, I either cycle or run. Yes, I sometimes fall asleep at my desk! There is a lot of pressure before races, and I really push myself—if I don’t, I don’t feel good. I’ve often wondered why I do this. The answers are: a) I feel happier when I stay fit, b) I would be lazy if I didn’t push myself, and c) racing is very social. Men and women usually compete together, but when events are covered in the media, 90% of the focus is on the men's events, with only 10% mentioning the women's results. The prize money is also less for women. However, we have now formed an International Triathlon Women's Commission to address these issues."""
CAE_34,"**Simplified Text:**

The day I met Picasso, Richard Cork remembers how, as a 78-year-old student, he encountered one of the most famous artists of the century. Even from a distance, eating lunch at an outdoor restaurant in Cannes, Picasso was easy to recognize. I was an 18-year-old student, traveling around Europe and Morocco in an old, unreliable van while waiting to start university. After running out of money, I found a job painting boats by the waterfront. However, I spent a lot of time drawing and was lucky to have a sketchbook with me when I met the elderly artist.

Picasso was known to be a private person who usually worked alone in the hills. So, I was very surprised to see him sitting at a table with his wife, Jacqueline, and three friends. Without my friend's encouragement, I would never have approached him to ask for his signature. I was nervous as I introduced myself and offered my sketchbook, but to my surprise, he agreed. He wrote his name at the top of the page and then added a lively drawing below. Picasso's art, even when abstract, often connected to real things. The lines he drew might represent a cloud, the sea, or the shape of Cannes harbour, which he could see from where he was sitting.

I thanked him and started a hesitant conversation. Since Picasso's English was worse than my French, an American woman at the table helped translate. She kept calling him the Maestro, which made it hard for me to speak. Still, I managed to tell Picasso about my strong interest in art and my admiration for his work. After a while, I went back to the boat and proudly showed my friend what I had. But he noticed that the lunch was still going on. ""Is that all?"" he asked, looking at the signature. ""Why don’t you go back and take advantage of this opportunity? You might not get another chance, and he probably wouldn’t mind if you drew his portrait.""

With my sketchbook under my arm, I returned to Picasso's table. I thought it was best not to ask if I could draw his portrait, as he might say no and ruin the moment. So, I just stood by the table, leaned my pad against a screen, took out a crayon, and began to draw. When Picasso noticed, he smiled playfully and made it hard for me to draw. He acted out funny and strange expressions—rolling his eyes, sticking out his tongue, and making silly shapes with his hands. It was like he was a natural clown. I felt like giving up, but his playful spirit challenged me to keep going. Despite his antics, I sensed he was testing my determination.

Eventually, Picasso relaxed and allowed me to study him without distractions. I saw how strong and alert he looked, wearing a blue-and-white striped shirt. He seemed more like a fit 60-year-old than a man about to turn 84. His dark eyes were youthful and intense, and I tried to capture that in my drawing. He seemed distant and alone, even with friends around him. His playful behavior hid a serious side. He let his friends talk while he sat quietly, focused on his own thoughts.

When the American lady told me that Picasso wanted to see my portrait, I felt embarrassed and said it wasn’t good enough. However, Picasso insisted, and when I showed him my sketchbook, he nodded approvingly. To my surprise, he then said it was his turn to draw. I quickly handed him my crayon, and he made a few quick, confident strokes on the paper. In seconds, he sketched a bearded face that looked very different from my careful drawing. He had moved one eye onto my nose and captured my smile with a single lively line. I looked like a character from one of his playful artworks.

I thanked Picasso and asked if he would sign my drawing. After checking with the American, she explained that he said I already had his signature. So, there were limits to his generosity! Still, I look back now and feel grateful. Meeting Picasso and receiving his attention meant a lot to me."
CAE_12,"**Text: 'Shopping Strategies'**

Have you ever gone into a store and ended up buying more than you planned? Here, we explain the techniques that shops use to encourage you to spend more money.

A. **Freshness Appeal**  
Supermarkets understand that customers value fresh produce. They often place fruits and vegetables at the entrance of the store or display house plants to create a fresh atmosphere. In-store bakeries that fill the air with the smell of fresh bread also attract shoppers. The colors used in the store, like green, are chosen because they remind people of fresh food. However, most items sold in supermarkets, like frozen foods and cleaning products, do not match this fresh image.

B. **Product Placement**  
The placement of products in a store is crucial for sales, especially in supermarkets. With advanced stock-control systems, supermarkets can identify which areas attract the most shoppers. High-profit items are often placed in these areas, while 'eye-level' shelves are highly sought after by manufacturers. Special offer bins, known as 'dump bins', attract bargain hunters. Another strategy is 'complementation', where related items, like desserts next to ice cream, are placed together.

C. **Strategic Layout**  
Supermarkets often place low-cost staples like bread and sugar far from the entrance. This forces shoppers to walk past more expensive items, increasing the chances of impulse buys. Chain stores may also position their popular products away from the entrance, hoping loyal customers will search for them and encounter other tempting items along the way.

D. **Less is More**  
Chain stores have changed how they display their products. For example, the Next chain has moved away from the idea of selling many items cheaply. Instead, they create a 'boutique' feel by showcasing a limited selection of fashionable clothing, making it seem exclusive. Their success comes from both good store design and stylish clothing.

E. **Total Costs Matter**  
Food shoppers often focus more on the total cost of their shopping trip rather than the price of individual items. Supermarkets mix low-cost staples with higher-priced items, so not everything is cheap. They may even sell some staples at a loss to attract customers, a strategy known as 'loss leaders'. They achieve low prices by buying in bulk or offering prominent displays, which can lead to discounts from manufacturers.

F. **Pricing Strategies**  
In chain stores, shoppers tend to buy fewer items and pay more attention to individual prices. For example, pricing a blouse at £14.99 instead of £15 can influence buying decisions. This pricing strategy also helps reduce theft, as employees must ring up sales to give change.

G. **Lighting Effects**  
Both supermarkets and chain stores carefully consider lighting. Chain stores aim for lighting that resembles natural light, helping customers see the true colors of clothing. Supermarkets use special lighting and mirrors to highlight fresh produce.

H. **Store Navigation**  
Many chain stores use different carpet patterns to guide shoppers through the store. These paths, known as the 'Yellow Brick Road', encourage customers to explore. Some stores, like Marks and Spencer, use wood or marble for pathways, leading shoppers to more inviting carpeted sales areas.

I. **In-Store Promotions**  
As you enter a supermarket, large colorful images of delicious food catch your eye, especially if you are hungry. In the U.S., some supermarkets are testing 'video trolleys' that display advertisements as you shop. Sensors trigger ads related to the products nearby, aiming to attract impulse buyers and potentially increasing sales by about 30%."
CAE_26,"**Text: Sea, Ice & Rock**

Mountaineer Chris Bonnington (58) is famous for reaching the summit of Everest in 1985. He has also created new climbing routes in Britain and the Alps and has written many books, such as *Quest for Adventure* and *Everest the Hard Way*. Robin Knox-Johnston (53) started his career at sea in the Merchant Navy. In 1968-9, he became the first person to sail around the world alone in his yacht, Sunhaili. He set a record for crossing the Atlantic, taking just 10 days to sail from New York to the Lizard in England. 

Chris and Robin worked together to sail and climb in Greenland, documenting their journey in their new book: *Sea, Ice and Rock*. In 1979, while I was working on *Quest for Adventure*, I called Robin for an interview. He invited me to join him for a sail. I could teach him some climbing techniques, and he could show me the basics of sailing. It was my first time on a yacht. We sailed for a while and then anchored. Robin's wife and daughter stayed on the boat while we paddled to shore to practice climbing. The route was challenging, and I was impressed by how steady Robin was in difficult conditions. 

After a while, we reached a steep drop. I asked Robin if he had ever climbed before. He hadn’t, so I showed him how. When I finished, Robin politely asked if he could descend using the ropes from his boat. He was used to using his arms, but I wanted him to use his legs. I was a bit worried, but he lowered himself down safely. During that trip to Skye, Robin and I formed a strong friendship. His suggestion that we combine our skills for a trip to Greenland was a natural extension of our Skye adventure. 

I was very impressed by Robin as a leader. Normally, the captain makes all the decisions, but Robin always consulted the crew first. Most of the time, no one dared to give him advice, but it felt good to be part of the decision-making. To be honest, I found sailing challenging and quite boring. The moments of crisis were easy to handle because of the adrenaline, but spending day after day in the middle of the sea was hard for me. I prefer land and am not very handy. In contrast, Robin is a natural sailor and enjoyed fixing the engine or repairing the toilet. I realized that Robin didn’t really need my help, which sometimes made me feel useless.

The crew was also cramped: six people on a 32-foot yacht designed for four. At least on a mountain expedition, you can get some space from each other. When we reached Greenland and it was my turn to lead the expedition, I found it hard to take responsibility for Robin’s safety. There were many times while climbing when if Robin had fallen, he could have pulled me down with him. I had to be very careful. I underestimated how difficult the Cathedral, Greenland's highest mountain, would be. Robin is not a natural climber, which made his efforts even more impressive. 

The first time we tried to reach the top, we were active for 24 hours. On the way down, we were so tired that we almost fell asleep on steep slopes, 1,500 feet above the ground. Robin faced many challenges, but he completely trusted me and just followed my lead. When it became too difficult and I realized we had to turn back, he accepted it. I also knew that Robin was worried about the boat: whether we could get it through the ice and if it was still intact. Yet he supported our decision to try climbing the mountain again.

The only time we had a serious issue was on the yacht on the way home. We were taking turns keeping watch. I was supposed to wake up at 4 am for my shift, but Robin decided not to wake me, thinking he could handle it alone. The night before, I had almost fallen asleep. I felt he didn’t trust me, which made me feel insecure, and I expressed this to him. Robin quickly reassured me that I was misunderstanding the situation. While we enjoyed the trip to Skye, we didn’t truly get to know each other until the end of the Greenland expedition. I discovered that beneath his tough exterior, Robin was a kind-hearted and sensitive person."
CAE_8,"**A History of the Apple**

Apples have been part of human life for thousands of years, existing in many colors, shapes, and sizes. However, in the late twentieth century, we risk losing this rich heritage.

**Prehistoric Times (8,000 BC)**  
Humans have eaten apples since ancient times. In neolithic Britain, they would spit out apple seeds. About 10,000 years ago, they left apple remains that turned to carbon near their homes by lakes in Switzerland and Italy. In Switzerland and areas near the Caucasus mountains, early humans even stored dried apple halves for winter. These apples were wild crab apples, small and shriveled, which in Ancient Britain were called 'windings.' They were very different from the apples we eat today.

**Norman Influence (1000 AD)**  
The French learned advanced fruit-growing techniques from the Romans, which were further developed in monasteries. This knowledge included cider-making and was brought to Britain during Roman times, along with dessert apples like Decio, introduced by the Roman general, Etio. However, many Roman apple varieties did not thrive in Britain, and Norman varieties quickly became more popular. British monks continued to experiment and create new apple types, which are the ancestors of most Western apples today.

**Medieval Favorites (1200)**  
Several apple varieties became common in Britain during the thirteenth century. The Old English Pearmain, noted in 1204 for its pear-like shape, was the main dessert apple until the eighteenth century. The Costard was a popular cooking apple sold in Oxford markets from 1296 until the late seventeenth century, giving rise to the term 'costermonger,' meaning a street seller of fruits and vegetables. However, the country faced challenges like droughts, the Black Death, and the Wars of the Roses, leading to fewer apples being produced and more being imported. This trend continued until the sixteenth century when King Henry VIII sent his chief fruit expert, Richard Harris, to France to learn about apple growing. Harris returned with many grafts, including the famous Pippins, and established the first modern orchard in Teynham, Kent.

**Settler Treasures (1750)**  
By the seventeenth century, apples were so popular in Britain that the first settlers to Canada, Australia, the US, South Africa, and New Zealand took apples and seeds with them, considering them valuable possessions. Captain Bligh of the Bounty brought the first apples to Australia, Jan van Riebeeck took them to South Africa, and the Pilgrim Fathers carried them to America. In North America, the well-known apple planter was John Chapman, or 'Johnny Appleseed.' Born in 1774, he planted apple nurseries from Pennsylvania to Indiana. Native Americans saw him as a medicine man, and his love for apple trees, unique clothing, and religious beliefs led to many folktales about him, including one that said he was so kind to animals that he even slept with bears.

**Modern Delicious (1850)**  
Around this time in Iowa, a Quaker farmer named Jesse Hiatt found something growing from the roots of a dead tree. This shoot became an apple tree that produced a new type of apple, which Hiatt named 'Hawkey.' After he showed it at a fruit exhibition, a judge tasted it and exclaimed, ""Delicious!"" In 1895, this apple was introduced to the market as 'Delicious' and became one of the most widely grown apples in the world.

**Granny Smith (1850)**  
Another famous modern apple was discovered in Australia by Maria Anne Smith. The daughter of convicts, Maria was independent and rejected her parents' criminal past. She worked as a midwife in Eastwood, New South Wales, and was known as 'Granny Smith' because she managed the family farm and orchard, which provided their income. In 1868, she found a small tree growing among discarded fruit. She moved it, and soon she was harvesting the first major crop of green apples, which became famous worldwide. When asked about the tree's origin, she said, ""Well, it's just like God to make something useful out of what we think is rubbish,"" referring to both the fruit and her own background.

**Uniformity Issues (1950)**  
Today, apples are grown all over the world, from Himachal Pradesh in northern India to luxury orchards in Africa. However, most apples are grown commercially and come from only a few varieties, often chosen for their red skin or ability to travel well, rather than for their taste. This trend of uniformity is reducing the variety of apples and affecting their flavor. While amateur gardeners in the UK have preserved many old apple varieties, the US has lost most of its apples from a century ago. However, consumers are starting to ask for more variety. We cannot rely solely on amateur gardeners to save the diversity of apples or any other food. We must advocate for a world that values and protects natural diversity for everyone's benefit."

CAE_30,"Text: 'Richard Nerurkar, a long-distance runner and one of Britain's best 10,000-metre runners, visits a high-altitude training camp in Kenya. Located ten miles south of the equator, a sunny mountain path leads off a quiet road from Nairobi. This path marks the beginning of the climb up Mount Kenya, the country’s highest peak. This beautiful but isolated place is called Nanyuki. For the past three years, it has been my base for winter altitude training in Kenya's Central Highlands. However, I had never trained with Kenyan runners on their home ground until my fourth winter training trip to Kenya. On this trip, I participated in my first race in Kenya's thin air and stayed at the national team training camp, where the best runners prepare for the World Cross-Country Team Championships. I was invited by the national team coach after finishing fifth in the World Championship 10,000 meters race, behind three Kenyans and a Moroccan. It was an opportunity I could not miss. Training at high altitude increases the number of red blood cells, which helps carry more oxygen. This has been proven by the success of many Kenyan runners. My first race in Africa, which took place before my time at the training camp, was also significant. It was the first international cross-country race ever held in Africa, in Nairobi. It was a humbling experience, as of the 41 runners who finished ahead of me, only 3 were not Kenyan. I felt I had run well, but I believe Kenyan success is not only due to altitude. Kenyan runners are known for their simple approach to the sport. Their running style looks effortless, their diet is straightforward, and they seem to enjoy competing. However, the most basic question about their success is how they train. My time with the Kenyan runners at their training camp provided some answers. The camp is at St Mark's College, 6,200 feet up the southern slope of Mt Kenya, surrounded by beautiful fields and tropical plants. It is quite basic, with few comforts. The athletes live with regular students and share rooms with five others in simple dormitories. Their daily routine includes three workouts: a relaxed morning run, interval training mid-morning, and a steady run in the late afternoon. The day starts at six. We would wake up and gather for a briefing from the coaches before the morning run. ""Run easy, you have a hard day ahead,"" the coach would say. Each day, we covered about 40 kilometers, which is just under a marathon distance. The only exception was Sunday, when we only ran 20 kilometers, which was a welcome break from the rest of the week’s training. Outside of running, life was simple. A splash of water on the face and brushing teeth was enough for morning preparations. Breakfast included tea, bread, and boiled eggs, eaten in a small, dimly lit dining area. Lunch and dinner were similar: ugali (a maize dish), stew, cabbage or spinach, and tea. After running in the evening, we would drive to one of the streams from Mt Kenya's melting glaciers to bathe. By the time I left the camp, I had a deeper appreciation for Kenyan success. It cannot be explained by genetics, upbringing, or altitude alone. I began to think that the simplicity of life in the mountains, the hard training, and the passion for success might be the real reasons behind Kenya's dominance in distance running.'"
CAE_7,"**Text: The Challenges of Mass Marketing**

Almost everyone knows that advertising is struggling. This issue is not just due to the recession; advertising began to decline in early 1989, before the recession really affected the economy. The problems with advertising are more serious and are happening all over the world. The sad truth is that advertising has not kept up with changes in the economy. Advertisers often think about mass markets and mass media, but as brands and media have increased, target markets have become more divided. Even campaigns for well-known brands should focus on smaller audiences, but they usually do not. This is a major reason why advertising is not working well.

Think about your own shopping habits. When you go to a supermarket, you might buy 30, 40, or even 50 items. Most of these items are not from advertised brands, and you may buy several of the same brand. In total, you probably only buy a few advertised brands from the thousands available in the store. Over a year, you are unlikely to buy more than a few hundred different brands. For durable goods, you might buy about a dozen each year. If you buy a new car, it is likely provided by your employer, and if not, you may only buy one every three years. You probably do not buy many clothes either, and most of them are not from advertised brands. Even when you consider all the other products and services, it is very likely that you do not buy more than 400 different brands in a year. 

In comparison, there are about 32,500 branded goods and services that are advertised. If we ignore the 23,000 brands that spend less than £50,000 a year on advertising, we can focus on the 9,500 brands that are individually listed and analyzed. The average consumer buys about 400 of these 9,500 brands, and not all of these purchases are due to advertising. This means that only about 4 percent of advertising is effective. 

When you watch TV tonight, count how many commercials are for brands you buy or might buy in the future. Most people find that only about one in 16 commercials (6 percent) are relevant to them, meaning that 94 percent of the commercials are likely wasted. You might think you are different and that you are not influenced by advertising, but most people feel the same way. The reality is that most people do not buy the brands they see advertised. 

There is always some waste in advertising because not every person who sees an ad will buy the product. People only remember a small number of ads and ignore the rest, so waste is unavoidable. However, this does not mean that advertising is not effective. Many advertisements have shown that it can work. Advertising needs to reach a large number of people to connect with the smaller group that will respond, as advertisers cannot know in advance who will be interested. 

Even with careful targeting, advertisers can reduce waste by reaching more people who will respond, but they can never know exactly who will. Even the best direct mail campaigns do not achieve a 100 percent response rate. This is a key difference between media advertising and personal selling. A salesperson might succeed with every potential client they meet, but this is not possible with media advertising. If advertisers knew exactly who would respond, they would not need to use media at all; they could contact those individuals directly.

Any advertiser who can attract one million new customers (about 2 percent of the adult population) is doing well. For popular soap brands, gaining a million extra customers would be a great success. Therefore, any advertising campaign that can win over 2 percent of the population would be considered very successful, and this is just a small part of the population. While mass media can be a cost-effective way to reach people, if advertising is to improve, its messages will need to be more carefully targeted than ever before."

**Solar Survivor: Charles Clover Visits Britain's Greenest Home**

Charles Clover explores one of the most environmentally-friendly homes in Britain, located in Southwell, Nottinghamshire. This area has some interesting features. First, it is home to Southwell Minster, a little-known ancient cathedral. Writers who care about the environment admire the pagan 'green' men figures carved by medieval craftsmen in the cathedral's thirteenth-century chapter house. 

The second surprise is the 'autonomous house,' built by Robert and Brenda Vale. This house is designed to be very eco-friendly. The Vales use rainwater for washing and drinking, recycle their sewage into compost for their garden, and heat their home using waste heat from their electrical appliances and their own body heat, along with that of their three teenage children and two cats, Edison and Faraday. 

You might not notice the house at first because it looks traditional, with a clay tile roof, and is located 300 yards from the Minster. It was designed to match the burnt-orange brick of the town's nineteenth-century buildings and received approval from planners, even though it is in a conservation area. When you ring the solar-powered doorbell, you will find it very quiet inside. The house is well-insulated, with special triple-glazed windows that keep out noise. 

Once inside, you must take off your shoes, as Robert insists. The atmosphere is calm and peaceful. On a sunny summer day, the windows are closed, and the conservatory warms the air before it circulates through the house. Robert opens clever ventilation shafts and windows to create airflow because the house is designed to be draught-proof. Even the cats have their own small air-locked door.

The Vales, who teach architecture at Nottingham University, have cared about the environment for many years. They wrote a book on green architecture in the 1970s called *The Autonomous House*. They aimed to create a building that produced no carbon dioxide and eventually decided to eliminate the need for mains water as well. They designed composting toilets, installed rainwater tanks in the cellar, and used copper gutters to keep drinking water clean, filtering it before use. Water from washing goes into the garden, and they do not use a dishwasher because they believe it is wrong to use strong detergents.

Robert explains, ""We wanted to show that it is possible to design a house that is much better for the environment without living in darkness."" The only medieval feature of the house is its design: the hall, which includes the fireplace and staircase, goes up to the top of the building. The Vales do not pay water bills, and last winter, their house used only nine units of electricity a day, costing about 70p. This is much less than what other four-bedroom houses use for heating.

Soon, they will install £20,000 worth of solar panels in the garden, which will help the house generate more electricity. The house will still use mains electricity for cooking and appliances but will produce extra electricity, enough to eventually charge an electric car. The only heating source is a small wood-burning stove in the hall, which they claim to use only during the coldest winter days. 

When I visited in February, Robert was reading and said it was too warm to light the fire. The temperature on the first floor was 18°C, which is lower than what is usually expected, but he said it felt comfortable because there were no draughts and everything was at the same temperature. He noted that a woman in the early 1900s felt comfortable at 12.5°C because of her warm clothing. He suggested that people living in older homes should adapt to living like people did in the past, but this idea might be hard to accept.

The secret to the house's success is its simple design, which means there is little that can go wrong. Most materials were bought from a local builder's merchant and installed by local craftsmen, making the house affordable to build—costing the same per square meter as low-cost rental housing. Unsurprisingly, commercial building companies are not keen on this idea."
CAE_51,"Text: 'The Camera Never Lies

Arthur Conan Doyle, the writer of the Sherlock Holmes stories, thought of himself as a rational person and even a scientist. However, in 1920, he saw photographs of fairies taken in a garden and believed they were real evidence that these tiny creatures existed. He published these photos with an article where he accepted fairies as magical beings. It was not until 1939 that the two women who took the photos confessed they were fake. They had simply cut out pictures of fairies from a book and placed them among flowers. The results were undeniably beautiful. However, this simple trick challenges a basic idea about photography: that the camera cannot lie. In fact, it can, and always has been able to. Today, we often use computer software to change our digital images, and it is a myth that photography ever had a time when it was completely honest. From the very beginning, when cameras started capturing reality, that reality was being changed.'"
CAE_11,"**Text: Blacksmiths**

Throughout history, iron has captured human imagination, and blacksmiths have often been seen as more than just skilled workers. Before the Industrial Revolution, blacksmiths held a status similar to that of doctors and astrologers because they were the only ones who made weapons, armor, and farming tools. They were also celebrated as artists. In the 18th century, blacksmiths created beautiful ironwork for St Paul's Cathedral. The elegant metalwork in French and Belgian Art Nouveau buildings was also crafted by talented blacksmiths. However, by the late 1960s, the number of blacksmiths in Britain had greatly decreased, as heavy industry no longer needed their skills, and modern architects rarely used graceful wrought-iron features.

In the last ten years, there has been a revival of interest in decorative architecture and a more open approach to interior design. Still, much of the work produced looks quite traditional, with manufacturers of gates and balconies promoting their products as ""classical"" or ""Victorian-style."" You can hardly enter a trendy design store without seeing rusty candlesticks with decorative elements. Fortunately, there are alternatives, and a series of events in the coming weeks aims to promote the blacksmithing craft. The first event, an exhibition of forged ironwork by members of the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA), opened last week at the Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey. Alan Dawson, the secretary of BABA, states, ""We could be at the start of a new Iron Age, as both the public and blacksmiths are seeing things differently.""

Power tools have freed blacksmiths from the hard work of using a hot anvil, allowing them to bend, split, twist, and weld metal more easily. ""In short,"" says Dawson, ""these artists now have a material that lets them express themselves."" About 250 pieces have been created for the exhibition, ranging from bookends to a spiral staircase. Prices start at £90 and can go up to several thousand pounds. Most of the money will go to the individual makers, but a portion of each sale will be kept by the Association to promote good ironwork, according to Dawson. His own contributions include an eight-foot gate and a lamp with a mouth-blown glass shade. ""My style comes from letting steel bend and flow into shape when it's hot. It's like drawing with metal in space,"" he explains.

Many artists are fascinated by iron. Unlike most metals, which are soft when cold, iron and steel are tougher and more challenging to work with. Susan May, a trained jeweler, says, ""It's quite magical because it's incredibly soft when hot, but as soon as it cools, it becomes rigid and unmovable again."" Ann Catrin Evans creates mild steel door knockers and handles inspired by the dark castles often seen in horror films. One of her designs looks like a ball and chain, while another resembles a Celtic cross. ""I love that steel is cold and hard,"" she says. ""It feels like it will last forever."" No other metal has given people as much visual pleasure or a greater sense of security. The chances of iron being used decoratively for the next thousand years are high, as long as we don't have to see any more rusty candlesticks!"
CAE_14,"**Text: 'THE DAY I GAVE UP SMOKING'**

I thought everyone would be happy when I stopped smoking, but one of my colleagues was very angry. ""What do you mean?"" she shouted. ""If it was that easy, why didn't you stop years ago?"" I found it hard to explain how I went from being a heavy smoker to not smoking at all in just a few hours. I still find it strange. The stop-smoking session I attended was a mix of group therapy and hypnotherapy, and it happened two months and three weeks ago. I had not planned to stop smoking, and I didn't really want to. I felt pressured by anti-smoking groups, which I still resent. I also had low blood pressure and a healthy family. I didn't cough or feel sick, and I seemed to recover from colds faster than friends who lived healthier lives.

On that ordinary Thursday afternoon, I went to the Birmingham session of The Easy Way to Stop Smoking to write an article about others trying to quit. I said, ""I won't be trying to stop myself; that wouldn't be fair."" I thought it was reasonable because I enjoyed smoking. It gave me real pleasure. The counsellor seemed to understand me. We were encouraged to smoke as much as we wanted, and the room was so full of smoke that we had to open the windows. I noticed that when I was told to smoke, I didn't want to, and neither did the others. 

What happened was that the messages about stopping smoking made sense to me. Just as smoking had become a challenge because of opposition, the idea of quitting started to feel appealing. The thought of not being a smoker made me feel strong. It was a personal feeling. Could I also achieve other things? In many ways, it was easy. The physical cravings for nicotine, which felt like hunger, went away after a minute or two and lasted only four or five days. I thought my work would be hard without cigarettes, but it wasn't a problem at all. I had believed I wouldn't be able to meet deadlines without nicotine and that I would fail to write a story. Surprisingly, the hardest part was doing things at home on weekend mornings, and it still is. 

I am starting to think that smoking helped me deal with boredom; having a cigarette was an activity. Yes, I do miss smoking, but not too much. Every new experience as a non-smoker is something I have to get used to—eating out, waiting for a plane, checking into a hotel, or during a theatre break. These are all moments when I would have smoked before."
CAE_63,"Text: 'Dorothy who? The only British woman scientist to win the Nobel Prize should be well-known in her own country, says Georgina Ferry, but she is not. For the past four years, I have been asking friends and acquaintances about Dorothy Hodgkin. It’s simple: when I tell them I am writing her biography, if they respond positively, they have passed the test. Why should people in Britain know about Dorothy Hodgkin? The fact that she is the only British woman scientist to win a Nobel Prize should be enough. Anyone with the same achievement in literature would be famous. But Hodgkin, who died in 1994, was an extraordinary person, as complex as the crystals she studied. Her life reflects significant changes of the 20th century, including the progress of women's education and the globalization of science.

When I started my research, I wanted to read some scientific biographies. One of Hodgkin's friends suggested a new biography of Linus Pauling. Pauling was a close friend of Hodgkin, worked in the same field, and campaigned against nuclear weapons. I went to the main bookshop in my university town, only to find that there were no biographies of Pauling available. I now realize I was naive to think Pauling would be interesting to British readers, even though he was a highly influential chemist and a Nobel Prize winner in both chemistry and peace. Even scientists have questioned the value of scientific biographies. Peter Medawar, another Nobel laureate, once said that the lives of scientists are often dull to read. If scientists believe this, it is not surprising that publishers and booksellers do too. 

Treating scientists differently from others in biographies shows the 'two cultures' mentality, the idea that there is a big gap between the arts and sciences, which still exists in the literary world. Only a few great scientists make it into the biography sections of bookshops. It is not true that scientists lead less interesting lives than artists, writers, actors, or politicians. Some scientists are very careful about their public image. A leading geneticist once told me he was willing to be interviewed about his work but did not want to be quoted or photographed because he did not want to seem 'self-promoting'. This avoidance of personal stories gives a false impression of science and may discourage young people from pursuing it.

Fortunately, things are changing. Contemporary scientists now often appear in public in ways other than just scientific interviews. For example, Professor Richard Dawkins presents awards on a TV quiz show, and geneticist Steve Jones advertises cars on television. These activities may surprise some in laboratories, but they help make scientists more relatable than many academic papers do. The publishing world is also changing. Scientific biographies used to be very serious and dull, often ignoring the personal lives of scientists. This changed with Richard Feynman's book, Surely You're Joking, Mr Feynman?, a funny and touching memoir of a man who was also one of the greatest theoretical physicists of the century. Recently, even famous scientists like Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, Albert Einstein, and Marie Curie have been shown with their flaws. 

Dorothy Hodgkin was dedicated to her scientific work. Her major achievements included solving the structures of penicillin and vitamin B12, which earned her the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1964, and insulin, which her team solved in 1969. She pushed scientific techniques to new levels. However, she also had three children and a husband who was often away due to his work as a historian. Her personal life may not be directly related to her scientific work, but we can learn from how she balanced different parts of her life. There is much in her life that is interesting to everyone, but it would be unfair to say that this does not include her scientific work. 

Scientific inquiry was the passion of Hodgkin's life, as it must be for any successful scientist. Communicating this passion is the biggest challenge for a scientific biographer. Most readers do not have enough basic scientific knowledge to understand complex ideas without much explanation. Understanding scientific concepts is not harder than reading Shakespeare or learning a new language; it just requires effort. It is unfortunate that educated people, who would feel embarrassed if they did not recognize a famous literary or artistic figure, remain unaware of the rich legacy of scientists like Dorothy Hodgkin.'"
CAE_56,"**Text: 'Margaret and Her Water Finding Skills'**

Margaret Wilkins is known for having a special ability, often called a 'sixth sense'. She can use a forked hazel stick to find water underground. Farmers whose wells have dried up often seek her help. Along with her husband, Margaret runs a well-drilling business that uses modern tools like drilling rigs and air-compressed hammers. However, to find water, she relies only on her forked hazel stick. The couple has a success rate of over 90%.

This ability to find water, minerals, and lost items underground is known as dowsing. There are many theories about how dowsing works, ranging from scientific ideas like magnetism to spiritual beliefs. One of the most believable theories suggests that everything on Earth vibrates, and water vibrates more than other materials. It is thought that dowsers can sense these vibrations while standing on the ground. Some dowsers claim they can 'feel' water, while others say they can 'smell' it, as smell is a very strong sense.

In recent years, due to drought, Margaret has been very busy, with a waiting list of almost six weeks at one point. Most of her clients are farmers with dry wells. She explains, ""We usually see customers only once because wells last a long time."" Other clients include owners of remote cottages or barns that have become holiday homes, where running water pipes over long distances is too expensive. There are also golf course developers who need water for their clubhouses.

Margaret typically looks for water between 50 and 70 meters deep. She emphasizes that wells cannot be drilled where there is a risk of contamination from waste. The water she finds is usually in cracks in solid rock, and if they bring it up correctly, it should be clean. However, in Cornwall, there are many minerals, so they must be careful about iron in the water. 

Another important factor is electricity to run the pump, which can be costly if the well is far from power sources. Once she considers all these factors, Margaret begins her search for water. For large areas like golf courses, she starts with a map and a pendulum. ""I hold the pendulum still and move it gently over the map. It will swing when it is above an area with water.""

After identifying possible locations on the map, Margaret walks over the fields with her hazel stick, which is forked and equal in size on both sides. ""When I am above water, I feel a strange sensation; I sway slightly. When that feeling goes away, I use the stick to find the exact spot to drill."" She holds the two forks of the stick with both hands and pulls them slightly apart to create tension. ""When water is directly below, the straight part of the stick rises. It is crucial to drill exactly where the stick indicates. If we drill even a little off, we might miss the water completely.""

Margaret's husband also dowse the same area. Usually, but not always, they agree on the exact drilling spot. If they disagree, they will not drill until they reach an agreement. 

Margaret Wilkins is not alone in her practice; many anthropologists and writers have been intrigued by this mysterious ability. She describes it as an 'intuitive perception of the environment', which is the best way to explain how she finds water so accurately. If she did not have this 'sixth sense', it would be hard to understand how her family could continue to succeed in their well-drilling business year after year."
CAE_36,"**Simplified Text: 'We Changed Lives for a Day!'**

Have you ever thought about living someone else's life for a day? It might be fun to try something different! We arranged this for four people - here’s what happened.

**A. Amanda's Story**

I had never been to a place like this before. It was dark and noisy, with many people and a great atmosphere. It was very different from my hometown, and honestly, I wasn’t sure I could handle it! Being a mother is a busy job, but this was something else! I had just fifteen minutes to learn how to carry a tray of drinks with one hand. The other waitresses made it look easy, but just as I was getting the hang of it, the drinks slipped off the tray and spilled everywhere. I felt so embarrassed, but the other waitresses laughed. Everyone makes mistakes at first!

By opening time at 11:30 am, there was already a line outside, and I started to feel nervous. I worried about remembering all the orders, but luckily, everything was automated. After a couple of hours, my feet hurt, and I couldn’t get used to the loud music. Every time a customer spoke to me, I had to say 'Pardon?', which was embarrassing! By the end of my shift at 5 pm, I was completely exhausted and wanted to soak my feet in hot water. I couldn’t believe it when one of the waitresses said it had been a 'quiet' day! I never realized how tiring waitressing could be. I always thought it was an easy job, but you really need to be friendly and able to handle a lot of customers at once. I’m quite shy, and I don’t think I could manage on a busy Saturday night. I wasn’t impressed with the pay either. I must have been a bad waitress because even the rich customers didn’t tip me! I was very happy to return to my children. It felt easy compared to waitressing!

**B. Cindy's Story**

I was nervous about being a 'mum' for a day, but I was also excited. I had been told the girls were cheeky, but I thought I could handle it. As Amanda left for the restaurant, I had to get the two girls dressed and fed. After dropping off Sophie at school and Katie at nursery, I thought I would have three hours of peace. I was wrong! A note from Amanda reminded me that I still had to make the beds, clean the house, and do the laundry.

At 1 pm, I picked up Katie, rushed through the supermarket, and then took her home for lunch. But when I brought Sophie home from school, the real trouble began. They turned the couch into a trampoline and played a game that involved screaming loudly! I thought they would tire out soon, but I was wrong again. I thought I had a lot of energy, but they wore me out! After much effort, I got them to bed by about 8 pm, but then the fun began! How many glasses of water can a child drink? I realized they were just trying to come downstairs to watch TV, but it was exhausting to spend all evening negotiating with them. I never knew how tiring it could be to take care of two small children. You don’t get a moment to think about yourself, and the responsibility is overwhelming. Still, I really enjoyed the day.

**C. Rosemary's Story**

On the farm, I wake up at 5:30 am, so sleeping in until 7 was a treat! I took a long time deciding how to dress. I couldn’t show up in my farm clothes, could I? Looking at about 400 students at assembly, I hoped I blended in and that my fresh face didn’t make me stand out as a farmer. After that, I went to a math class. The children worked in small groups, using cards that were easy or hard - very different from when I was in school!

Then I helped with a nature project, identifying and feeding snails. By lunchtime, I was tired and looking forward to a break, but teachers only have about five minutes to eat. There’s so much to do before classes start again. I attended a staff meeting about reports and ended up helping with athletics trials. After lunch, there was a silent reading lesson (which was nice!) and then a French lesson in the video room. This was fun because all the children wanted to practice their French with me, which showed how rusty I was! Finally, we went to the gym for Physical Education. I was exhausted, but the children had endless energy. The hardest part was speaking in front of the class, even for just two minutes. Teachers may have more holidays, but I think I’ll stick to farming!

**D. Hilary's Story**

I arrived at White House Farm at 8:30 am, only to find out that Rosemary had been up for three hours! Rosemary’s farm has 100 Jersey cows, 15 calves, and about 800 sheep! She also makes ice cream, yogurt, and cream, which are sold in shops and restaurants. I spent most of the morning in the ice cream shop, filling milk containers, making ice cream, and putting on labels. It was hard not to taste everything!

At lunchtime, I checked the sheep. I drove to one of the fields and helped a sheep that had fallen over. If sheep are left for more than 12 hours after falling, they could die, so they need to be checked every day. What a nightmare it must be in winter! After feeding the calves, I started milking, which took two and a half hours. Rosemary does this twice a day, starting at 6 am, every day of the year! I found it quite lonely. I missed the children a lot - animals don’t talk back! The worst part of the job is that you can’t take time off. The cows need to be milked twice a day, so it’s hard to plan any time away. Rosemary will only get about three days off this year. Farming seems romantic, but the reality is very different. The income is unstable, and I wouldn’t want to depend on the weather."
CAE_6,"Text: 'A trumpet isn't just for Christmas... It is interesting how many musicians, even famous ones, come from families without music. Hakan Hardenberger, the only son of non-musical parents in a rural area of southern Sweden, has, at the age of 30, become a unique trumpet player in the world today. His recordings are constantly introducing new music, not only concertos by lesser-known composers from the baroque and classical periods but also new pieces. When you meet him, bright-eyed and attractive, he seems even younger than he is, as fresh and open in his manner as the sound of the trumpet. Recently, in one of London's top concert halls, he performed the Hummel Trumpet Concerto, a piece he often plays, while a television feature was made about his work and growth, filmed both in London and Sweden. Born near Malmo, his career began with a Christmas gift when he was just eight years old. His father, who did not play music but liked Louis Armstrong, decided to give his son a trumpet. Instead of a toy, he chose a real instrument after seeking advice. The gift was a success, and the boy never stopped playing. His mother contacted the second trumpet player in the Malmo Symphony Orchestra, who agreed to give her son lessons. Bo Nilsson was a rising musician who quickly recognized Hardenberger's natural talent. Hardenberger is grateful to have had such a dedicated teacher from the beginning, one who was so passionate about the trumpet that he sought out players worldwide and was always looking for new mouthpieces. However, Hardenberger distinguishes himself from his teacher. 'The trumpet is a basic instrument,' he explains, 'so you can't create a trumpet that is acoustically perfect. There will always be flaws. Also, no two mouthpieces are exactly alike. For me, it's about understanding these flaws and building a relationship with them.' From the start, Hardenberger seemed to have a talent for finding the right balance and making that connection. Without boasting, he notes that even as a child, his unique sound was already recognizable, 'the first thing I developed.' Unlike the great British trumpet player, John Wallace, who started in brass bands and then played in orchestras, Hardenberger has always seen himself as a solo artist. As a child, he looked up to the French trumpeter, Maurice Andre, another musician who avoided orchestras. He bought all of Andre's records and admired him. His parents supported his desire to practice and encouraged his ambition to pursue a career in trumpet playing. The question then became where to send him to study at 15. America, Bo Nilsson's first choice, was considered too far and dangerous, so he went to Paris at 16 to study with Pierre Thibaud. Thibaud confirmed Hardenberger's belief against joining an orchestra, saying that 'Playing in the orchestra is like digging in the garden.' He was realistic enough to know that he played better than others his age, but it was only after his first competition at 17 in Paris that he realized he had a special ability to connect with people. Thibaud suggested he enter the competition for experience. Hardenberger prepared only for the first round but advanced to the second. Fortunately, he already knew most pieces in that round too, but when he reached the final, he faced a concerto that had intimidated him. He did not win first prize that time, but he enjoyed the performance, realizing that even though he 'played poorly,' people were listening. Hardenberger's honest view of his work and career may seem arrogant, but that would be a misunderstanding. He thoughtfully avoids analyzing what this gift of communication might be, saying, 'You risk losing it by trying to explain. The power of music lies in its ability to always move people.'"

**A.** The story of Tristan Smith, a citizen in the made-up republic of Efica, is a remarkable tale about human power, history, and humor. The author skillfully creates a world with its own history, traditions, and customs. The book is also known for its humor and the author's unique perspective, combined with deep psychological insight, making it a challenging but rewarding read.

**B.** Harriet is a composed middle-class woman with an architect husband and her own business. Normally, she would not have met Sheila, a traditional working-class woman who cares for her aging father and has raised her grandson, Leo, since he was three. Their lives change dramatically when Leo violently attacks Harriet's son, Joe, in the street. After the court case, both boys refuse to discuss what happened. Leo, who had always been a good student and never fought before, cannot explain his actions, while Joe physically recovers but becomes withdrawn. Harriet is deeply affected by her son's situation, and caring for him takes over her life. Sheila feels so guilty that she asks to meet Harriet, leading to an unusual friendship. The author excels at showing how people respond to major changes in their lives and captures the mother's feeling that she can never do enough for her son.

**C.** This book, shortlisted for the Booker Prize, tells the story of one of the most isolated Scottish Orkney islands and its people over a long, quiet history. The narrative is set against important moments in Scottish history, vividly imagined through the daydreams of the young protagonist, Throfinn Ragnarson. He disappears suddenly in the story but returns after the Second World War, having learned to appreciate the simple lives of his ancestors.

Rebecca Cripps meets five women who talk about their different jobs: the good parts, the challenges, and what a typical workday looks like.

**A. THE BRAIN SURGEON**  
**Name:** Anne  
**Age:** 34  

**ANNE'S DAY**  
""I wake up at 6:30 am, go to the gym at 7:00 am, and arrive at work by 8:00 am. I start surgeries at 8:30 am. I perform surgeries all day on Mondays and Wednesdays, and sometimes on Friday afternoons. Most brain surgeries take about three hours, but some can last all day. There have been times when I’ve worked for ten hours straight without eating or taking a break. Deciding when to operate can be stressful. While I don’t feel stressed during surgery, I sometimes worry about my next day’s work. Brain surgery is often a last option for patients, but when it is successful, it feels amazing, which makes up for the times it doesn’t work. From 10:00 am to 1:00 pm, I run an out-patients' clinic where I explain the surgeries to patients. I enjoy this and find it easy to talk to them. If they get upset, I try to comfort them, but time pressure can make this hard. I usually leave work between 6:00 pm and 8:00 pm. Some nights and weekends, I am on call, and I always carry my pager. When I’m on holiday, I often worry about my patients for the first few days, and I sometimes dream about operating. I find it hard to relax.""

**B. THE SENIOR DESIGNER**  
**Name:** Marita  
**Age:** 31  

**MARITA'S DAY**  
""I wake up at 7:45 am, leave home by 8:20 am, and take the train to work, arriving at 9:15 am. On Mondays at 10:30 am, we have a meeting to discuss our projects and any issues. I work in a team with three senior designers, a partner who oversees everything, and a junior designer. My work is mostly about production, with only about ten to fifteen percent being actual design. I receive a brief from the client, and if they have clear ideas, I spend three to four weeks designing and developing the project. After that, I present my ideas to the client. Once they approve, we create estimates and budgets, and I start hiring photographers and illustrators. I also coordinate with printers to ensure everything is done on time. Managing multiple projects can be very stressful, and deadlines are always tight. I usually have lunch at 1:00 pm for an hour, often going to a pub, but sometimes I eat sandwiches and work through lunch. It feels great when a client appreciates my designs, but it’s disappointing when a project I worked hard on gets rejected. I usually get home by 7:30 pm, but it can be as late as 8:30 pm or later. I find it hard to relax when I get home, especially if I’ve had a busy day.""

**Age:** 42  

**LINDA'S DAY**  
""I usually wake up around 7:00 am, but on two or three mornings a week, I have to wake up between 4:30 am and 5:00 am for long-haul flights from Heathrow or Gatwick. At around 10:30 or 11:00 am, I might go for a bike ride or swim. Since chauffeuring is a sitting job, I need to be careful about my diet and exercise. I usually have a big breakfast and snack throughout the day. People often ask for my recommendations for restaurants or shops, so I need to know the area well. Many jobs are pre-booked, which allows me to plan my routes. Not all passengers are polite; some can be rude or unfriendly. However, most of the time, my clients are nice, and I have a good relationship with my regulars. Sometimes I hear conversations in the car and have to focus on driving. I work seven days a week, up to fifteen hours a day, so I must be careful not to get too tired. I try to go to bed by 11:00 pm.""

**D. THE LANDSCAPE GARDENER**  
**Name:** Tracy  
**Age:** 27  

**TRACY'S DAY**  
""I wake up around 7:00 am, leave home at 7:30 am, and start my first job. My assistant and I mainly maintain gardens we designed. We do some commercial work, but most of our jobs are in private gardens, spending about an hour and a half at each location. Around 11:00 am, we take a break and go to a local café for a big breakfast. Sometimes I wish time would go slower. In summer, I may work until 10:00 pm, and in winter until 4:30 pm. I run the business from home, so when I return, I check messages and return calls. If someone wants a new garden design, I usually set up a meeting in the evening around 7:00 or 8:00 pm. We focus on using old materials and unique plants to create gardens that look historic. Sometimes clients have very specific ideas, which can be challenging. However, it’s very rewarding to see a garden we designed bloom. I find it hard to relax in the evenings because I can always hear the business phone ringing. I sleep well because my job is physically demanding, and I’m always tired at the end of the day. I may not be very strong, but I am fit. It’s a tough job, but it allows me to be creative.""

**E. THE CIVIL ENGINEER**  
**Name:** Zena  
**Age:** 27  

**ZENA'S DAY**  
""I arrive at the construction site by 8:30 am. As the assistant resident engineer, I oversee the building of two bridges and a retaining wall that keeps vehicles from driving into a quarry. I check that the contractors are following the schedule and safety rules while minimizing environmental impact. I help coordinate the site professionals and solve any problems. The contractors start work at 6:00 am, so my first task is to find out what happened since I left the night before. The rest of my day depends on what I learn from the clerk of works. I usually have paperwork to review or design questions to answer. I take a half-hour lunch break between 2:00 pm and 2:30 pm, but I often eat on the go. The contractors have set meal times, so I use that time to check on the site. Since we monitor their work, it can create tension, so it’s important to maintain a good relationship. I see the duty resident engineer once a day, but if something urgent comes up, I act immediately. I usually leave the site around 6:00 pm and am on call all the time."""
CAE_40,"**Text: Careers: Six People Discuss Their Typical Working Day**

**A. Credit Card Executive**  
I wake up at 6 am to reach the office by 7:30 am. I manage customer development programs for our regular credit card users. My job includes launching and managing the Membership Rewards scheme in major European markets. I need to stay in touch with current card users, attract new ones, and build relationships with partner companies. I spend the first 45 minutes organizing my day and then respond to emails. I oversee advertising for the membership program across Europe, so I meet with our marketing team and advertising agencies to create strategies and plan future projects. I have meetings scheduled throughout the day, but I keep my door open for anyone who has questions. There are nine customer service units in Europe, and I travel to different markets once or twice a week to address any issues. When I’m in London, I usually leave work between 6:30 pm and 7:00 pm.

**B. Record Company Executive**  
I arrive at work by 10:00 am and go through the mail, which includes ten to twenty demo tapes daily, letters from producers, concert information, and invoices from session musicians and studios. The phone starts ringing around 10:30 am with calls from producers and publishers, and I have meetings throughout the day to discuss campaigns or projects for specific artists. I am aware that demo tapes represent people's hard work, so I try to provide constructive feedback. I can usually tell if the sound fits our record label. Once I sign a band, we begin working on their first album, choosing songs, a producer, and additional musicians. I also communicate my vision for the album to the marketing team. I manage budgets and expenses as well. I leave work by 7:00 pm at the earliest, and most evenings I attend gigs, sometimes seeing up to five new groups in one night. After a gig, I might visit an artist in the studio. Most of my social life revolves around my work, and I often don’t get home until 1:00 am, when I listen to a record to relax.

**C. Sales Director**  
I wake up at 8:00 am and drive to work, arriving by 9:30 am. I open the mail, check the schedule for client meetings, and wait to see who arrives. I enjoy showing people around the showrooms and love reaching agreements to sell furniture, knowing it will go to a good home. We sell antiques priced from £1,000 to £6,000, buying from London auctions, country house sales, private clients, and overseas. Many items need restoration, so I work closely with our full-time restorer and other specialists. I read the Antiques Trade Gazette while drinking coffee to stay updated on the business and often visit the Victoria and Albert Museum to compare furniture. I handle accounts once a month and do tax returns every three months. I leave work at 5:30 pm and it usually takes me about an hour to relax after work.

**D. Air Traffic Controller**  
I work on a set shift schedule. On early shifts, I leave home at 6:00 am. I start my shift at 7:00 am, taking over one of the four control positions in the tower. We have a rotating schedule, working about an hour and a half at one station, then taking a half-hour break before moving to another station. The air traffic controllers, a supervisor, and the watch manager work closely together to manage aircraft movements. In winter, we handle about 1,000 movements a day, and even more in summer. Night shifts are quieter, allowing me to read about new air traffic requirements between 12:00 am and 4:00 am. It’s important to stay alert in this job, so if I feel unwell, I don’t hesitate to take a sick day. The work can be stressful, and it takes time to unwind after a shift. I hope to become a watch manager and eventually the general manager of the airport.

**E. Shop Manager**  
If I have an early shift, I leave home by 8:00 am. The first thing I do is start the electronic point-of-sale system. I ensure someone is watching the till and coordinate lunch and break times for staff. In the morning, I help customers find and order books. I enjoy serving customers, although it can be frustrating when they come in with reviews and expect me to gather many books quickly. From 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm on weekdays, publishers’ representatives visit the shop, and I discuss new titles for the upcoming months. I need to estimate how many copies of a particular title we might sell. When we want to feature a new title, I make sure it arrives on time. The early shift ends at 5:45 pm. Two days a week, I work a late shift, during which I close the computer system, lock up, and go home.

**F. Financial Analyst**  
I listen to the news at 7:00 am, then get up and take a taxi to work, arriving by 8:45 am. I first contact our freelance reporters to find out what is happening in my region. I assess financial risks for multinational companies operating abroad, trying to warn clients about potential problems in those countries. I provide three services: an online executive preview, a security forecast, and a travel information security guide. From 9:15 am to 9:30 am, I meet with our editors to discuss the stories I will follow. My first executive preview must be online by 10:00 am, and my second deadline is 11:00 am, so I need to work quickly. I type the stories, send them to my editor for approval, and then make any necessary changes before they are published. I travel to Africa about three times a year to report on specific events or to stay updated on the situation. I usually leave work around 6:00 pm, and it can be hard to relax in the evenings; I often find myself awake until 1:00 am."

A. **What Makes a Good Leader?**  
A leader inspires others and brings about change. They guide people towards a common goal. Leadership is not about physical traits like height, as some early thinkers believed, nor is it just about being smart. According to Pat Dixon, author of *Making the Difference: Women and Men in the Workplace*, leadership is about ""making things happen through people who are as enthusiastic and interested as you are."" Enthusiasm is essential, and a good leader should express it clearly and confidently. Dixon emphasizes that a leader should say ""I believe"" instead of ""I think.""

B. John van Maurik, who directs a Leadership in Management course, states, ""Most people have more potential for leadership than they realize. Becoming a leader involves recognizing and developing your hidden talents."" In a way, we are all born leaders; we just need the right environment to grow. While it is easy to see leadership in famous figures like Emmeline Pankhurst or Mahatma Gandhi, it can be harder to see it in our own workplaces. However, leadership is now seen as essential for effective management.

C. Think about the best and worst boss you have had. They might have been equally good at setting goals and meeting deadlines. But how did they achieve these goals? The best leader motivated you and provided support. The worst leader made you feel unimportant and withheld information, blaming you when things went wrong. The first was a great leader; the second was a poor manager.

D. Leaders and managers are different. Managers prefer to work within set limits, while leaders create new possibilities. Micheal Shea, author of *Leadership Rules*, writes, ""A good manager can keep a struggling company running smoothly, but a good leader can change a discouraged organization, whether it’s a business, a sports team, or a country.""

E. Whether you are the boss or a middle manager, improving your leadership skills can be beneficial. Here are some lessons to learn:  
- Leadership is most effective when you choose to lead. Discover your passions and beliefs. When you feel inspired to lead, use that energy to take action.  
- Start seeing yourself as a leader. Your ability to lead is an important part of who you are.  
- Collaboration is good, but sometimes strong leadership is necessary. Try different leadership styles. If you usually negotiate, try taking charge. Notice how this change affects the results.  
- Set goals and strive to exceed them. Identify areas in your job where being a leader can improve your effectiveness and career opportunities.

F.  
- Leadership does not happen by itself. It develops through taking the lead, taking risks, and learning from mistakes. Learn to delegate, motivate, organize, and provide feedback.  
- Don’t assume your leadership style will be immediately accepted by your colleagues. It might even push them away. Keep improving your communication skills. You don’t need to be liked, but your ideas and achievements should be respected.  
- Be visible and approachable to those who matter. Remember, you don’t have to lead all the time. Understand when your input is crucial and how you can help others become leaders."

**Film critic Nick James reviews some recent releases.**

**A. Abyss**  
Before Titanic, director James Cameron created a tense Cold War thriller about oil workers and navy experts trying to rescue a nuclear submarine deep underwater. The friendly banter and brave attitude of foreman Bud and his team remind us of tough heroes in movies by Howard Hawks. The film's design and special effects are very impressive, but the dialogue and character development are weak. Despite the skill in making the film, the story feels like a simple B-movie.

**B. The Thin Red Line**  
This video version of the James Jones novel about the battle for Guadalcanal, directed by Andrew Marton, offers a different take compared to Terrence Malick's new film. While Malick's version is mystical and poetic, Marton's film is more traditional, focusing on a single soldier and his difficult relationship with his tough sergeant. Malick's film is richer and more complex, but Marton's version has its strong moments. The flashback where the soldier dreams of his wife is presented with a harshness that may be more effective than Malick's softer imagery.

**C. On Guard**  
This film, loosely based on Paul Feval's 1875 novel, is a fun swashbuckler that stands out among musketeer stories. Fabrice Luchini plays a clever villain who causes chaos behind the scenes. Vincent Perez is an energetic hero, though his role is short. Daniel Auteuil, while perhaps too serious for a light-hearted film, also has his moments as a swordsman. The filmmakers use familiar costume-drama clichés with enough wit and charm that it doesn't feel boring.

**D. Character**  
This film is a serious story set in early 1900s Rotterdam. The detailed production and costumes make it look like a museum piece. Jan Decleir plays the harsh bailiff Dreverhaven, who is cruel when evicting tenants. His troubled relationship with his son is central to the story, but the filmmakers focus too much on the period details and not enough on the dark themes of the story.

**E. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly**  
This newly remastered video release highlights director Leone's skill. The sound editing is particularly impressive, making every sound clear. The storytelling is harsh, and whenever there is a quiet moment, Morricone's powerful music brings excitement. Morally, there is little difference between the good (Clint Eastwood), the bad (Lee van Cleef), and the ugly (Ell Wallach), as they all act unscrupulously in the post-Civil War West.

**F. The Longest Day**  
The publicity for this three-hour war epic boasts ""Forty-eight International stars."" With four directors and 23,000 extras, it feels overdone. The early scenes, where battle-hardened veterans wait for news about the invasion, drag on for both the audience and the soldiers. While it is an impressive logistical achievement, it is best experienced on the big screen. Watching it on video does not do it justice."

**BOOK A** Steve Martin's *Compelling Evidence* is indeed compelling. The narrator, a lawyer trying to start a new practice after leaving a powerful law firm, is forced to defend his boss's wife when she is accused of murdering her husband. The trial scenes are exciting, with the outcome uncertain until the verdict, and there is an unexpected twist at the end. This is a strong debut in a crowded genre.

**BOOK B** *Curtains for the Cardinal* starts with a bang, throwing the charismatic Sigismondo, a troubleshooter for the Italian Renaissance aristocracy, into a mix of politics, church intrigue, and serious murder. We are confident he will uncover the guilty parties. The plot is complex, and the book is a bit long, but it is still very enjoyable.

**BOOK C** *File Under: Deceased* introduces a fresh new detective from first-time author Sarah Lacey. Leah Hunter is a tax inspector, well-suited for investigating when a strange man collapses at her feet. Despite facing criticism from various people—perhaps tax inspectors are used to this— and the disapproval of a handsome local detective sergeant, brave and adaptable Leah is a winner in every way.

**BOOK D** *Double Deuce* by Robert B. Parker features the literate private investigator Spenser, who helps his friend Hawk clear drug dealers from a poor neighborhood in Boston. The sharp dialogue comes quickly, but there are few deaths and more philosophy than usual. It is high-quality entertainment, as always from Parker.

**BOOK E** *False Prophet* by Faye Kellermann features her usual detectives, Pete Decker and Marge Dunn, investigating an attack and burglary at the home of a famous film star's daughter. The author's easy writing style and keen observation of unusual human behavior make this an entertaining mystery.

**BOOK F** Husband and wife team Diane Henry and Nicholas Horrock write *Blood Red, Snow White*, which features another lawyer and another female client, but the action takes place outside the courtroom. The defender becomes a victim as the plot unfolds. All the classic elements of romance, money, and violence are mixed well to create an engaging suspense novel.

**BOOK G** *Dead for a Ducat* by Simon Shaw presents actor Philip Fletcher as the intended victim. A funny group of characters comes together to film a story about Robin Hood, but Philip feels this is not how his career should be going. Simon Shaw always entertains, but in shifting his star actor from black comedy to farce, he delivers a performance that is not up to his usual high standard.

**BOOK H** *Fall Down Easy* is Lawrence Gough's best book in a while. Canadian police are searching for a clever bank robber who targets female bank tellers. The slow, expertly-paced build-up of tension and the portrayal of the intelligent, disturbed robber elevate this above the average detective novel."
CAE_57,"Text: ""I might be too old for this adventure, but here I go! At 34, Tim Pozzi has left a good job to go backpacking. He thinks about why he and others his age have decided to take this step. This summer, I quit my job and decided to rent out my flat to travel in South East Asia for a year. You might think I'm lucky, but I'm 34 years old and feeling nervous. It's not like I haven't traveled before. After university, I spent two years backpacking in North and South America, and when I returned, I promised myself I would do it again someday. But then life happened... I fell in love, started a career, bought a flat, and got used to earning a salary. Gradually, I realized I was sacrificing my own happiness for my salary. When I handed in my resignation, it felt like I was taking control of my life again. I have no ties now. Many of my friends are married with children, and while they wouldn’t trade places with me, they envy my freedom. I'm not in a relationship, and I don’t have strong career goals. I feel I should make the most of this freedom, if only for my friends' sake! 

Why am I so nervous? First, I need to make all the arrangements. How could I let someone else live in my home? How do I organize the rental? And I also need to decide where to go. I tend to procrastinate and am already behind my planned schedule. I thought, 'I might as well enjoy the summer in England,' and then, 'Why not wait for the start of the football season?' Letting go of emotional ties makes it harder. I keep delaying because I wonder if I can handle backpacking again. Will I be able to adjust to a simpler way of life? Will I feel out of place among younger backpackers? Maybe not. I've noticed that more Britons in their late twenties and thirties want to break free from their current lives and travel abroad. Jennifer Cox from Lonely Planet says that more people are realizing that adventure is available to them: 'People who always say ""I wish I had that opportunity"" are now understanding they can have it whenever they want. They just need to be brave, organized, and confident enough to do it.'

For Danny, a 30-year-old accountant, and his girlfriend Tammy, a 28-year-old teacher, this trip is a chance to enjoy life before settling down. They bought a round-the-world ticket for a year. 'I'm willing to give up job security for this trip,' says Danny. 'There's always a worry that I won't move up in my career and will return to the same position, but I think it's a risk worth taking. When I left the office, I threw my calculator into the river as a symbolic act of defiance!' For Matt, who just left the Army, his year of travel was a time of change. 'In the military, there’s a strict way of doing things. I needed to change this mindset to live well as a civilian.' 

While there are many reasons for traveling at my age, some common factors exist. 'Today, we have a more flexible workforce,' says Angela Baron from the Institute of Personnel Development. 'More people work on short-term contracts, so if your contract ends, you have nothing to lose.' Larger companies are even creating career-break policies. 'If you've invested time and money in training someone, it's good to know they will return instead of going to a competitor.' Dan Hiscocks, managing director of Travellerseye, a company that shares stories of 'ordinary' travelers, says that more thirty-somethings are reevaluating their lives. 'If you're not happy with your job—and many people aren't—it's no longer just about sticking it out. Now, people know that opportunities exist and that a job isn't permanent. Travel allows you to reflect and think about your life.'

Is giving in to wanderlust just another sign that my generation struggles with adulthood? Jennifer Cox disagrees. 'It's a sign of a better-educated, more stable society when we care less about paying bills and more about living a balanced life. We're taking the time to ask, ""Is this what I want?"" Ben, a 32-year-old picture researcher going to Central America for a year, believes he's not running away. 'It's more about running towards something. I'm trying to grab the things I want for myself.' But he does feel some anxiety. 'It's the thought of leaving behind my comfortable routine—going to the office every day, saying ""hi"" to everyone, and having my morning coffee.' I share Ben's concerns about leaving a structured life with few challenges, and I'm not sure I would be making this journey if I hadn't found my boss so unbearable. As Jennifer Cox points out, 'This is quite common. There’s often a trigger, like a breakup or losing a job, that pushes people to travel.' 

It may have taken a little push to get me moving, but I'm now looking forward to the next 12 months with growing excitement. No matter what happens, I will take pride in having embraced life. I believe I speak for all of us older backpackers."""
CAE_42,"**Text: 'Transforming the Home Office'**

Georgina McGuiness took a long break from journalism and felt disconnected from the changes in technology. In this text, she shares how she turned her home into an effective workplace.

The Christmas before last, I turned 37 and realized that if I wanted to restart my journalism career, I needed to act fast. I felt like my skills were outdated, stuck in the 1980s when typewriters were the norm. I worried that no one would trust me to use a computer in a newsroom. Many job ads required experience in desktop publishing, which I didn’t have. I thought I would have a better chance of hosting a seminar on nuclear physics than learning to design a page on a computer. I was known as the family technophobe; even calculators confused me, and I still didn’t know how to use the timer on the video.

I knew I had to change quickly. I thought leaving home before my children would be difficult, but then I entered a competition in a local newspaper. To my surprise, my family won a computer package. We received a laptop for my husband and a personal computer for the family. We jumped into this new world, and terms like cyberspace, Internet, and surfing became part of our everyday language. We started chatting online with strangers from around the world. The children stopped watching television, and I set up a small office in the kitchen with a phone, a fax machine, a CD-ROM, and a modem connecting me to the Internet. I had everything I needed to work from home while still taking the kids to school.

My children were already comfortable with computers from school, but I was nervous, thinking I would lose my work if I pressed the wrong button. I was wrong. Although I wasn’t very skilled, I learned the basics. It turned out to be logical and straightforward. With practice, I improved a little each day. I recently started freelancing for a magazine, writing about two articles a month, and I feel proud to have the best of both worlds.

How has the computer helped me? Since school, my desk has always been a chaotic mess, and I often lost important papers. The computer has made me more organized, especially with office tasks. Spreadsheets help me track income and expenses, and ready-made invoices and letterheads save me a lot of time. For a journalist, being online means I can research stories, ask for information in journalism forums, and discuss working from home with people worldwide.

However, there are downsides to working from home. You can feel isolated without physical contact with others. There are also distractions, like household chores, and when the children are home, we sometimes argue over who gets to use the computer. Still, many people are buying multi-media PCs, not just for education and entertainment, but also for the convenience of avoiding the daily commute to the city.

As we move into the next century, what defines home workers? A report called PC Usage in UK Homes gives a profile of the typical computer user: they are 38 years old and well-educated; 93% own a personal computer, 32% have a CD-ROM, 38% have a laser printer, and 50% have a modem. Considering this, I feel I am ahead of the game. Who knows, one day I might be emailing a column to a newspaper in Melbourne or even publishing my own magazine from home. It seems that the possibilities are endless."

CAE_54,"**Text: The Future of Newspapers**

The change from print newspapers to online news may take a long time. ""Transition"" is a nice word that suggests moving smoothly from one state to another. However, the shift of newspapers to the online world is uncertain and uncomfortable. Many people believe that this change will happen eventually because print newspaper sales are falling while visits to their websites are increasing. For example, the print sales of The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian have dropped by 8% to 10% each year, while their website traffic continues to grow.

However, the situation is not so simple. A recent survey by the World Association of Newspapers showed that global newspaper circulation actually increased by 1.1% last year, reaching 512 million copies a day. While sales in Western countries have decreased, Asia has compensated for this decline. News and current affairs magazines, which are often thought to be struggling, reported a 5.4% increase in sales.

The same trend can be seen in the book market. E-readers like Kindle are becoming very popular, with sales rising significantly this year. Yet, when booksellers looked at the sales of physical books over the last six months, they found only a small decrease of 0.4%. This suggests that people are buying both physical and digital books.

The idea that young people are no longer reading newspapers is exaggerated. According to the latest National Readership Survey, nearly 5 million people aged 15 to 35 still read the main national newspapers. Different countries in Europe show different trends. In Britain, there has been a 10.8% drop in newspaper sales, but in Germany, the decline is only 7%, and in France, it is just 3.1%.

These varying trends indicate that the situation is more complex than many believe. In the past, analysts thought that increasing online advertising would support the shift to digital newspapers. However, digital ad revenues are now falling, and many US newspapers have started charging for online access. The best way to attract paying readers seems to be offering both print and digital subscriptions together. Print newspapers still play an important role in selling online subscriptions, as their advertising rates are much higher than those for online ads.

Maintaining both a print edition and a website is challenging and costly for newspaper companies. However, print newspapers still have a strong presence, and being noticed online is much harder."
CAE_32,"**Photographing People**

People are the most interesting subjects to photograph. A picture with a person in it is usually more engaging than the same scene without anyone. However, photographing people can be challenging. Besides technical skills, photographers must pay attention to actions, gestures, and expressions. The presence of a camera can sometimes make people act differently.

**A. Grouping People**  
Avoid straight lines when taking group photos. Ask people to stand at different angles and distances, and if possible, have some sit or kneel in front. This way, you can see all their faces better.

**B. Posing for Pictures**  
People often feel stiff in front of a camera. Help them relax by suggesting comfortable positions, like folding their hands or putting them in their pockets.

**C. The Right Approach**  
Do not pretend you are not taking a picture when it is obvious you are. This can create tension. Most people will agree to have their picture taken, even if they hesitate at first. They may feel self-conscious, so you might need to guide them. A picture can be less interesting if the subject looks away from the camera.

**D. Eye Contact**  
A picture is more powerful if the subject looks at the viewer. Ask them to look into the lens, and they don’t have to smile. They might not be able to do this for long, so remind them just before you take the shot. You can also say something funny to get a genuine reaction.

**E. Candid Concentration**  
Instead of direct eye contact, you can have the subject focus on something in the picture. This can make it easier for them, and it gives the viewer a sense of observing the subject naturally. Candid shots are fascinating, and the subject's expression is crucial.

**F. Expressions and Gestures**  
Expressions and gestures reveal a lot about a person. For example, a laughing child can make viewers smile, while a sad face can evoke sympathy. Look for common expressions in your portraits, like shrugs, winks, or smiles. They communicate feelings instantly.

**G. Situation Interest**  
While close-up shots of a person can be powerful, the background can add more context. When including a background, avoid irrelevant details or blur them to keep the focus on the subject. Ensure the subject stands out against the background.

**H. Interaction**  
Good pictures often happen when people are interacting, like talking or laughing together. Couples, mothers with babies, and teams can create appealing images. Look for moments of connection, such as eye contact or gestures that show how one person is reacting to another.

**I. People and Places**  
Many pictures of people are taken during trips. To improve these photos, use a standard or wide-angle lens and step back to include the whole background, like a building or landscape. Position your subjects close to the camera while ensuring the background is visible. An elevated camera position can help achieve this balance.

**J. To Pose or Not to Pose?**  
Decide why you want to take the picture. If it’s to remember someone you met briefly, a clear posed picture against a nice background is good. However, family pictures can become boring if they are all formal poses. Candid shots of events are often more lively and can capture genuine moments, making them more memorable in the future."
CAE_65,"**Text: Under Sarah's Spell**

Sarah Janson is a trompe-l'oeil artist, which means her paintings create an illusion of reality. In this interview with Joanna Watt, we learn more about her unique approach to art.

Not many artists choose not to sign their work unless asked, but Sarah Janson is one of them. She believes that the artwork is more important than the artist. ""It's not the artist who is important, but the work,"" she says. Sarah is very modest and almost makes it seem like her paintings create themselves. This attitude makes for an interesting magazine interview. ""I just don't like to talk about myself,"" she admits, and she is visibly uncomfortable when asked about being photographed.

After some time, Sarah becomes more relaxed, and the interview turns into a fun and engaging conversation. She has been a trompe-l'oeil artist for sixteen years, following two years of intense drawing at art school, a degree in graphic illustration, and work at a publishing house. However, she found illustration unfulfilling and began working with a specialist decorator named Jim Smart. He asked her to create one trompe-l'oeil piece, and that sparked her passion. ""Suddenly my interest got focused,"" she explains. She started her own business, unsure of where it would lead but feeling it was the right path.

Sarah's keen observation skills and attention to detail, developed through her illustration work, are crucial for her trompe-l'oeil art. ""People often ask me where they can learn trompe-l'oeil, but no one can teach you. It's all about observation,"" she insists. She believes that learning never stops. ""The moment you think you've mastered something, you might as well give up."" She is also honest about her weaknesses, saying, ""I can't paint bread; it always looks like grey concrete,"" and admits she struggles with math. When faced with a large project for a chapel ceiling, she felt overwhelmed by the measurements. ""I thought to myself, 'You're not Michelangelo. Who do you think you are?'"" This self-doubt leads her to speak about her work in a detached way, saying things like, ""When I finished that ceiling, I thought, 'Well, I didn't do it; she did.'""

Despite her modesty, Sarah's trompe-l'oeil art is exceptional. She has many significant corporate and private commissions. Much of her work is inspired by architecture. For example, she created a trompe-l'oeil dining room based on a Venetian palace and a painting that makes a hallway look like it leads to two more rooms. However, she knows that once people understand the trick, they might lose interest. ""Trompe-l'oeil has to do two things. First, it must draw you in; it has to trick you. Second, it must hold your attention and engage your imagination. That is the most important part.""

Sarah believes that trompe-l'oeil art should also be personal to the client. ""I love interacting with clients; that's where the ideas come from,"" she says. ""Without a good relationship, creating a trompe-l'oeil scheme becomes difficult."" Some clients have clear ideas, while others do not, so she must be willing to listen and understand their vision. Many clients become friends, especially since she often works closely with them. Sarah appreciates her clients, saying, ""I am very grateful for the adventurous ones who let me work on their walls."" They seem happy with her work, which keeps her busy, even though she downplays her talent. ""I really don't like to talk about myself,"" she repeats. ""Like my work, I am very restrained. I don't want it to be loud. You get tired of things that are loud."" While this may be true, you could never really get tired of Sarah or her art. Her work deserves more recognition, and I am willing to risk her annoyance to promote it."
CAE_61,"**Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success**

Daniel Goleman explores the 'people skills' that are important for success in any profession.

A. The rules for work are changing. We are now judged by a new standard—not just by our intelligence or training, but also by how well we manage ourselves and interact with others. This new standard is increasingly used to decide who gets hired, who gets promoted, and who is likely to succeed or fail. These skills are important for our future job opportunities. They are different from what we learned in school, where doing well on tests was seen as the most important thing. The new standard assumes we all have enough intelligence and skills to do our jobs. Instead, it focuses on social skills and personal qualities, such as initiative, empathy, adaptability, and persuasiveness—what we now call emotional intelligence.

B. In a time when job security is low, personal qualities are becoming more important in the workplace. For many years, these qualities were referred to by different names, such as 'character' or 'soft skills.' Now, we have a clearer understanding of these abilities, which we call 'emotional intelligence.' This is defined as the ability to understand and manage our own feelings and those of others, and to use these feelings to guide our thoughts and actions. In the workplace, emotional intelligence includes self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills. Some people think it just means 'being nice,' but it can also mean being direct and honest when necessary. Emotional intelligence is not about expressing feelings freely; it is about managing feelings so they are expressed in a suitable and effective way, helping people work together towards common goals.

C. More businesses are recognizing that promoting emotional intelligence is a vital part of management. The more complex a job is, the more important emotional intelligence becomes. A lack of these skills can limit a person's ability to use their technical knowledge. While some people have succeeded despite lacking emotional intelligence, as work becomes more collaborative, companies that encourage teamwork have a competitive advantage. In today’s workplace, where teamwork and customer focus are essential, emotional intelligence is increasingly important for success in every job around the world.

D. Unlike IQ, which changes little over time, emotional intelligence can develop as we gain life experience. Studies show that most people become better at managing their emotions, motivating themselves, and improving their empathy and social skills as they grow older. This growth in emotional intelligence is often called maturity. We can learn emotional intelligence and add these skills to our toolkit for success, especially in a time when job stability is uncertain. While emotional intelligence is not a guaranteed solution for struggling organizations, ignoring the human aspect can prevent everything else from working effectively."
CAE_52,"Text: 'Should the media make money from content they do not own? Digital cameras and camera phones have made it easier to capture important news events, but social media has changed citizen photography significantly. With news often breaking on social networks, some journalists are now using these platforms for images as events happen quickly. Unfortunately, some reporters have shared user-generated content (UGC) without asking for permission. Although there is guidance that images posted on social media can be used without permission in special cases or when there is strong public interest, there is still debate about whether this is right. Research shows that about one in ten people would film or photograph a news event, indicating that UGC will play a big role in the future of the media. However, to maintain a good relationship with the public, the media must ensure that people are fairly rewarded for their work and that permission is always requested.'"

**Ancient Chinese Medicine in the West?**  
Acupuncture is a practice that is over two thousand years old. It comes from traditional Chinese medicine, which also includes herbal remedies, massage, diet, and exercise. Acupuncture is used to treat many health issues, but it is especially known for helping with pain. Some general practitioners (GPs), midwives, and physiotherapists use it regularly for pain relief.

**A. What is it about?**  
Traditional Chinese medicine views health as a balance of energy in the mind, body, and spirit. This energy, called Qi (pronounced ""chee""), flows through the body along pathways known as meridians. There are twelve main meridians, each connected to an internal organ, and many smaller meridians that carry Qi to every cell. When the flow of Qi is blocked or weak, it can lead to weakness or illness. During a visit to an acupuncturist, they will check for imbalances in your Qi by feeling your pulse, looking at your tongue, and assessing your overall health. They will ask about your medical history, current health, mental state, and your eating and sleeping habits. An acupuncturist uses fine needles that are inserted into the skin. They may also use heat from burning herbs or apply pressure to certain points to help the flow of Qi.

**B. Over three hundred points**  
The points used in acupuncture are connected to the meridians and may not be near the area of pain. Many people report feeling a mild ache or tingling when the needle is gently moved. This can be done by hand or with a machine that provides electrical stimulation. Acupuncturists believe this sensation indicates that the needle has reached the Qi in a meridian. There are over three hundred acupuncture points on the main meridians, with many more that are used less frequently.

**C. Science explains it**  
Even though many doctors do not accept the ideas of traditional Chinese medicine, they recognize that acupuncture can help relieve pain. They have found scientific reasons for its effectiveness. For example:  
- It is thought that stimulating certain nerves can block pain signals from reaching the brain.  
- Some scientists believe that acupuncture releases natural pain-relieving chemicals in the body called endorphins.

**D. What types of pain can be treated?**  
Many people with long-term pain try acupuncture as a last option. Commonly treated pains include back pain, sports injuries, arthritis, headaches, and pain after surgery. Acupuncturists also claim to treat menstrual pain, facial nerve pain, and pain in terminally ill patients.

**E. Modern use of an ancient treatment**  
Although acupuncture has been practiced in China for over 2,000 years, its use as an alternative to anesthesia during surgery began in the 1950s. This helped convince some doctors outside China that acupuncture has real benefits. In China today, acupuncture is used in many types of surgeries, from tonsil removals to heart surgery. Needles may be used alone, with electrical stimulation, or with medication. While some patients report little to no pain, experiences can vary. Many people might find the idea of being awake during surgery unappealing, but acupuncturists say that acupuncture anesthesia has fewer side effects than traditional anesthesia (like nausea) and allows for quicker recovery.

**F. Effectiveness**  
Like many alternative therapies, it is challenging to conduct clinical trials for acupuncture. However, studies show that 50 to 80 percent of people find it effective for chronic pain. Acupuncturists generally agree with this success rate. They acknowledge that it may not work for everyone and that individual responses can vary. Traditional acupuncturists suggest that for long-term pain, it usually takes six to seven visits to feel significant relief, but some improvement may be noticed after just two or three visits.

**G. A different approach to pain**  
Western and Chinese medicine have different views on pain. An acupuncturist looks at the patient as a whole, not just the specific symptoms. They spend time diagnosing the problem and looking for underlying issues in the Qi. They also consider external factors that may affect the pain, such as weather conditions. For example, they may ask if the pain worsens in cold, heat, damp, or windy conditions, and whether it feels sharp, dull, throbbing, constant, or burning. These factors are important in deciding how to use acupuncture for treatment. Most medical doctors do not consider these aspects.

**H. Traditional or not?**  
Some medical professionals have training in traditional acupuncture, while others, including many GPs who practice acupuncture, prefer scientific explanations. However, many traditional acupuncturists believe that only by using traditional Chinese medicine can deep changes occur that lead to longer-lasting relief, which is hard to measure in trials. It is important to choose a qualified acupuncturist, who should refer you to a medical doctor for further investigation if needed."
CAE_35,"Text: P.D. James, a well-known crime writer, has a gentle appearance that hides her deep and creative mind. Her full name is Phyllis Dorothy James, and she carries herself with quiet confidence. One can easily imagine her as a headmistress of a girls' school if she had not chosen to write detective stories filled with unexpected twists. However, it quickly becomes clear that her confident demeanor is a cover for her shyness. She admits that Adam Dalgliesh, the detective in her books, is based on herself, or how she might have been if she were a man. Dalgliesh likes to solve crimes alone, just like James prefers to write in solitude. ""I need time alone, especially when I write. I can write almost anywhere as long as I have complete privacy,"" she explains.

James is too humble to agree with the idea that she is the most famous crime writer in Britain, even though millions of people around the world enjoy her 12 major detective novels. She is a big fan of her close friend Ruth Rendell and particularly likes her psychological novels written under the name Barbara Vine. The books she enjoys most are often by women writers like Iris Murdoch, Anita Brookner, and Penelope Lively, but she also appreciates male authors like Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh, whom she believes were the best novelists of their time.

P.D. James found success later in life. Now in her seventies, she published her first crime novel, Cover Her Face, when she was 42. Born in Oxford and the oldest of three children, she grew up mostly in Cambridge, where her family moved when she was 11. ""I met my husband there; he was a student at the university, and I have always loved the place. That is why I chose it as the setting for An Unsuitable Job For A Woman.""

She shares that her life has been challenging and sometimes tragic. Her husband, Connor Bantry White, an Irish doctor, returned from World War II very ill. ""I had to work long hours to support him and our two young daughters, Clare and Jane. I had many ideas for stories, but I had no time to write. Thankfully, my husband's parents were wonderful and helped take care of my daughters, giving them security during those tough years.""

While working full-time in administration for the National Health Service, she used her excellent organizational skills. At one point, she managed five psychiatric outpatient clinics. She then spent 11 years at the Home Office, first in the Police Department, handling administration for forensic science research, and later in the Criminal Law section, focusing on juvenile crime. While working in forensic science, she became used to seeing dead bodies, but it was not death itself that inspired her. ""What interested me was the structure and process of writing a crime novel. I have always loved reading detective stories and knew I wanted to be a writer.""

""I didn't want to use the painful events of my life in my fiction. Writing detective stories was a great way to learn how to be a serious novelist, and it was different from my own experiences. As I continued writing, I realized that I could follow the traditional rules of a detective story and still create a meaningful novel about people. Writing detective stories,"" she says, ""is a way to bring order to chaos. Solving a crime affirms the value of life, even if that life is difficult. No one truly enjoys violence."""

**The Pen is Mightier than the Psychoanalyst**

The study of handwriting to understand a person's character is becoming more popular. In some countries, if you apply for a job, you will likely be asked to provide a sample of your handwriting. This handwriting sample can play a big role in deciding if you are suitable for the job. Handwriting analysis, also known as graphology, is considered a real science in many places. Researchers believe it can help identify certain health issues, like heart disease and cancer, and can show psychological states and emotional problems. 

More companies are using handwriting analysis for job guidance and as a supplement to interviews. Many large companies now hire graphologists to examine the handwriting of job candidates. However, many doctors and psychiatrists are skeptical about the usefulness of graphology. Patricia Marne, a professional graphologist for over 20 years, argues that it should be taken more seriously. She believes handwriting can reveal psychological traits and some medical conditions. 

Marne states, ""Handwriting is a strong indicator of social class and intelligence. It can also help determine if someone should focus on arts or sciences and whether they have a manipulative or honest character."" She claims that graphology can be especially helpful in identifying possible criminal behavior: ""Criminals often have disturbed handwriting, which is usually poorly shaped. Many criminals come from difficult backgrounds and have emotional issues, which can show in childish handwriting and repeated letters.""

Marne explains that she can tell if people are honest or manipulative. For example, young male offenders often have very high letters, suggesting they live in a fantasy world. Graphologists can also predict if someone is about to become violent, if they are under extreme stress, or if they have psychopathic traits. Handwriting can even indicate potential suicides. 

She adds that heart and lung problems can sometimes be seen in handwriting. ""You can't diagnose someone from just one sample unless the writing is clearly shaky. But if handwriting changes over time or becomes disjointed, it could mean something serious has happened."" A major emotional upset can also change a person's signature temporarily.

Marne believes handwriting can reveal other psychological traits. For instance, people whose letters connect in 'threads' may be clever but deceitful. Those who write mostly in capital letters might be hiding their true selves. Light pressure in writing shows sensitivity and low energy. Original handwriting, which differs from standard styles, indicates confidence and creativity. Disconnected writing often suggests loneliness. Very small signatures can show insecurity, while circles over the letter 'i' indicate a desire for attention. Crossing the 't' heavily can suggest intolerance and a condescending attitude.

Marne states that it takes six years of study and experience to analyze handwriting accurately, along with empathy and intuition. She believes more research is needed to establish graphology as a scientific field. She thinks this will happen soon, saying, ""It's actually more accurate than psychoanalysis because it reveals a person's entire history, including emotional crises, without asking them questions that they might answer incorrectly.""

Despite these interesting claims, there is little solid evidence to support them. Some psychiatrists criticize graphology, arguing that handwriting is influenced by education, artistic skills, and the type of writing taught, and that it has no deeper meaning."

Is your office working well? Fresh air and good chairs are important for a happy and healthy workplace, according to a new survey. We visited four different offices to see how healthy and happy they are as work environments. Our expert panel included a building health consultant, an ergonomist who studies working conditions, and an occupational psychologist. Here are their opinions.

**Office A: Advertising Agency**  
*Building Health Consultant:* This office is very simple; it has no central heating or mechanical ventilation, and the windows open directly onto the street. It is surprising that this space works, but the small, active team seems to have few complaints. They adapt to the seasons by opening doors and roof panels or using electric heaters, much like they do at home. This may be the key: a team of seven has created a happy, homely work environment without much outside control.  
*Ergonomist:* The furniture here is mismatched and creates poor working postures. The chairs are old, most are not adjustable, and many are broken. However, the staff have a varied work schedule that they control, including office work, client meetings, and presentations. This variety helps reduce fatigue, boredom, and muscle problems.  
*Occupational Psychologist:* Staff enjoy the variety of work and the flexible office space. They say their office is ""just the right size""—small enough to know what colleagues are doing, but large enough to focus on personal tasks. I found the office attractive and fun, showing both efficiency and creativity.

**Office B: News Service**  
*Building Health Consultant:* While this office may not be very exciting, it is comfortable and staff do not dislike it. The air quality and maintenance are good, helped by a No Smoking policy.  
*Ergonomist:* I was not surprised to find that the company had hired an ergonomist. The chairs are excellent, and the lighting and computer equipment are good. The space is adequate, but the layout could be better. However, the environment feels impersonal and dull, with grey, bare walls.  
*Occupational Psychologist:* The walls are mostly bare, except for year planners and a poster about maternity rights. Most staff have been there for at least five years, and relationships are satisfactory. The office could improve if desks were arranged to make sharing information easier. Success stories or project updates could be displayed on the walls.

**Office C: Bank**  
*Building Health Consultant:* This office gets mixed reactions from employees. It feels like being in a glass case, surrounded by many similar spaces. Despite a mix of smokers and non-smokers in a small area, the air does not seem stale. Even standing close to a smoker, I could not smell the cigarette.  
*Ergonomist:* The office is very standard and uninspiring. The desks are just adequate, and not all chairs meet the requirements for computer use, but this is a choice of the users. Computer screens are often on low desk units, which is not suitable for modern equipment.  
*Occupational Psychologist:* Staff support each other well and have good technology. Many communication awards are displayed. The wood-colored panels and brown carpet create a slightly gloomy atmosphere, but the office is busy.

**Office D: Newspaper**  
*Building Health Consultant:* There is not much good to say about this building. The air conditioning is poor, causing big temperature changes. The space is cluttered, and most people have too little desk space. The office is very dusty, with many places for dust to collect. The roof also collects dust, which falls on those below.  
*Ergonomist:* The furniture looks more suitable for a workshop than a modern office. Many chairs are not good for keyboard users, especially those shorter than 1.75 m. Most chairs are old, lack proper adjustments, and have armrests that make it hard to get close to the desk.  
*Occupational Psychologist:* The office has old brown chairs, dirty carpets, and dust everywhere. There is a lot of room for improvement—the place needs cleaning, individual achievements should be recognized more, and the air conditioning needs immediate improvement due to many smokers. When we visited, few conversations were happening; everyone seemed stressed and focused on deadlines. The company should encourage teamwork."
CAE_38,"**Chewing Gum Culture**

Chewing gum is popular, accessible to everyone, and Americans chew about 12 million sticks of it every day. This text explores how an ancient practice became a large industry. Chewing gum has fewer than ten calories per stick, but it is considered food and must meet the standards of the American Food and Drug Administration.

Today, most gum is made from synthetic materials, with added pine resins and softeners that help maintain flavor and improve texture. However, this was not always the case. The ancient Greeks chewed a resin from the bark of the mastic tree, which grows mainly in Greece and Turkey. Greek women especially liked mastic gum for cleaning their teeth and freshening their breath. American colonists learned from the Native Americans in New England and chewed the resin from spruce trees when the bark was cut. In the early 1800s, lumps of spruce for chewing were sold in the eastern United States, making it the first commercial chewing gum in the country.

Modern chewing gum began in the late 1860s with the discovery of chicle, a milky substance from the sapodilla tree found in Central America. Gum made from chicle was smoother, more enjoyable, and more elastic, leading to the growth of a whole industry. However, attempts to grow sapodilla commercially have not been successful. As the chewing gum market expanded, synthetic alternatives were developed.

Today, the few remaining chicle gatherers, known as chicleros, struggle to make a living. They trek for miles to collect sapodilla in very humid conditions. The environment is dangerous, with poisonous snakes and many insects. One of the most concerning pests is the chicle fly, which lays its eggs in the ears and nose of the gatherers. Despite these dangers, experienced chicleros climb trees quickly to cut the bark and collect the white sap in bags. They then carry the liquid to a camp, where it is boiled until it becomes sticky and is formed into bricks. Life at the camp is difficult, with a boring and often insufficient diet of maize and local alcohol made from sugar cane. 

Even though this work is hard, chicleros worry about their jobs. Not long ago, the United States imported 7,000 tonnes of chicle each year from Central America. Last year, only 200 tonnes were collected in the entire Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico. As chewing gum sales have increased, manufacturers have turned to synthetic materials to lower costs and meet demand. Meanwhile, gum producers are finding creative ways to market their products. 

Gum is said to help you relax, boost your energy, and reduce stress. During both world wars, soldiers were regularly given gum. One of the main benefits claimed by manufacturers is that chewing gum can help reduce tooth decay. Plaque acid, which forms when we eat, is harmful to teeth. Our saliva helps neutralize this acid and provides minerals like calcium, phosphate, and fluoride, acting as the body’s natural defense. Gum manufacturers claim that chewing for 20 minutes can increase saliva production. Research is ongoing to create new textures and flavors. Glycerine and other vegetable oils are now used to mix the gum base. Most new flavors are artificial, but some still require natural ingredients. Additionally, 137 square kilometers of land in America is dedicated to growing mint for the two most popular chewing gums in the world."

A. **INDIA: GHANERAO HOTEL, RAJASTHAN**  
Ghanerao Hotel is located at the edge of the Aravalli Hills in a small village known for its craftsmen. It combines the calmness of an English country house with Indian culture. The Ghanerao family has lived here for 400 years, and now Sajjan Singh and his wife welcome guests into their home. The facilities are basic, with hot water provided in buckets, but this simplicity adds to the hotel's charm.

B. **NEW ZEALAND: HERMITAGE HOTEL, MOUNT COOK**  
One of my favorite hotels is the Hermitage Hotel on New Zealand's South Island, which I discovered while climbing. After being flown close to the top of a glacier and climbing to the peak, we walked down. To my surprise, we found this hotel at the bottom, set in stunning countryside that is wild and high up. Arriving tired and finding luxury, with a pianist playing Cole Porter, was an amazing experience.

C. **MAURITIUS: PARADIS HOTEL**  
On the south-west of Mauritius, the Paradis Hotel is located on a quiet peninsula. The road to the hotel winds along the coast, passing empty beaches where only fishermen are present. The hotel is large and offers many free water sports, but you can easily find solitude along nine kilometers of private beach. Swim a little way out into the Indian Ocean, and the hotel will be hidden by palm trees. In the evening, when everyone has left, you can enjoy the peaceful beach as the sky darkens.

D. **ST LUCIA: LADERA HOTEL**  
The Ladera Hotel in St Lucia has a stunning location. It is quiet and away from busy areas, standing at 1,000 feet above sea level. Its open rooms offer views between the twin peaks of the Pitons to the Caribbean Sea, which is beautiful in the morning. The hotel has a colonial style, with mahogany and greenheart wood furniture, and four-poster beds with muslin netting.

E. **TURKEY: THE SPLENDID HOTEL, ISTANBUL**  
This hotel, located on Buyukada in the Princes Islands, is a great escape from the noise of Istanbul. The islands are just an hour away by boat and are very picturesque. There are no cars, only horse-drawn carriages and beautiful wooden buildings from the 1920s. The Splendid Hotel, made of wood and painted white with red domes, is modeled after a historic hotel on the French Riviera. Although it is a bit worn down now, it still has a lot of charm.

F. **FRANCE: CHATEAU D'ETOGES, EPERNAY**  
In the small village of Etoges, in the Champagne region, there is a lovely seventeenth-century chateau. Surrounded by a moat with two swans, this chateau was a family home until recently. It has 20 unique rooms, some with four-poster beds, and one even has a billiard table. They offer special weekend rates for two nights, including breakfast and dinner, plus complimentary champagne (their own brand, which you can take home).

G. **KENYA: THE FAIRVIEW HOTEL, NAIROBI**  
The Fairview Hotel is a rare find in Africa—a comfortable hotel that is not overly luxurious. It is a popular stop for travelers recovering from safaris and planning their next adventure. Guests often arrive, see the beautiful gardens and dining options, and decide to stay for a week. There are even apartments for those who want to stay longer. The hotel is set on Nairobi Hill, away from the busy city center, making it a great place to enjoy the stunning African sunset while sipping beer and looking forward to a hearty dinner.

H. **ITALY: HOTEL SPLENDIDO, PORTOFINO**  
The Duke of Windsor was the first to sign the guestbook at Hotel Splendido. Since then, many famous people have visited, including Lauren Bacall, Humphrey Bogart, Liz Taylor, and Richard Burton. Today, you might meet a billionaire or a rubber-tyre heiress. This former monastery turned villa and hotel is still splendid, offering simple yet delicious food in the restaurant, along with beautiful Persian rugs and homemade pasta."
CAE_47,"Text: 'Sue Brown is a hotel inspector. Christopher Middleton observed her during an inspection. Just one minute into the annual check, things are already going wrong for the Globe Hotel, although the staff do not realize it yet. The receptionist is busy giving room rates over the phone to a potential guest and does not notice Sue and Christopher. ""She hasn't even acknowledged us,"" Sue whispers. ""Very poor."" This is a common mistake during the arrival phase, one Sue has seen many times in her 11 years as an inspector. ""But this isn't just any three-star hotel,"" she argues. ""It has three red stars, and I expect better."" Having red stars means the Globe is among the top 130 hotels out of 4,000 listed in the guide published by her organization. However, even before the cold welcome, there is an uncomfortable atmosphere. Access from the car park is through an unmanned door with a buzzer, followed by a long, empty corridor to the hotel entrance. ""Again, not what I expected,"" Sue comments. Could things get worse? Yes, they could. ""We have no record of your booking,"" the receptionist says in a cheerful voice. It turns out that out of the hotel's 15 rooms, 12 are empty that night. One room is on the top floor, but it does not meet Sue's standards: it is stuffy, and there is a large hole in the wall behind the wardrobe. When she started her career, she earned a reputation for being tough. ""I was known as the Woman in Black,"" she remembers, ""which was funny because I never wore black. And I’ve never been too tough."" The next morning, after paying her bill, she reveals her identity to the hotel’s general manager, Robin Greaves. He looks terrified. Before she says anything else, he apologizes for a bad smell in the main lounge. ""We think there’s a blocked drain,"" he sighs. ""The whole floor might need to be replaced."" Sue kindly suggests that he should also tell his staff not to quickly show guests to that lounge. ""It might be better to guide them to the other lounge,"" she advises. Greaves nods sadly and takes notes. He has only been at the Globe for five months and seems to struggle to believe Sue when she says that her feedback is meant to help the hotel in the long run. However, not everything is negative. Emma, the assistant manager, and Trudy, the young waitress, receive praise for sharing information about the hotel’s 400-year history. Dinner is also good enough to keep the hotel’s two-rosette food rating, which encourages Greaves to ask, ""What do we need to do to get three rosettes?"" Sue’s suggestion is simple: ""Don’t serve a collapsing pudding."" Greaves’ brief excitement fades. It is Sue's difficult job to express the complaints that many customers do not have the courage to voice. ""Sometimes, it can be very sensitive. I remember a woman complained that I got her son fired. All I could say was the truth: he served me apple pie with his fingers."" She often receives letters with false claims, from accusations of being superior to demands for bribes. ""You get used to it, but it still hurts,"" she says. Sue must not only share her findings verbally with the hotel manager but also send a full written report. After all, they pay for her services (there is an annual fee for being included in the guide). However, being recognized with red stars makes it worthwhile. So it is good for Greaves to hear that Sue will not recommend taking away the Globe's red stars. That is the good news. The bad news is that another inspector will return in the next two months to ensure everything has been fixed. ""Good,"" Greaves smiles, though it seems unconvincing. ""We’ll look forward to that."""

Doug Scott, a mountaineer, shares his experiences of climbing the highest peaks on each continent, known as the Seven Summits. He began this journey later in life and will describe each mountain in the order he climbed them.

**A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)**  
While resting in a snow cave 91 meters below the summit, Doug's climbing partner, Dougal Haston, started talking about sleeping bags with their Equipment Officer, Dave Clark, even though only they were there. Doug found this odd and began talking to his own feet as he felt the cold creeping in. He remembered other climbers who had lost fingers and toes to frostbite. They were not just worried about survival but also about how well they would survive. Over the next two days, Doug reflected on their time on the summit ridge and felt grateful to be climbing with Dougal, who gave him confidence. He realized he needed to find a better rhythm to reach the summit, which he successfully did.

**B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)**  
This mountain is known to be very dangerous. In April 1976, Doug and Dougal arrived at the Kahiltna Glacier and spent four days carrying equipment and food to the base. After the first day of climbing, they understood how challenging their task was. They followed a route established in 1967 but decided to take a new route halfway up, aiming directly for the summit. They climbed with all their gear on their backs, which was a first for this area. After a tough climb, they finally reached the summit and celebrated their success.

**C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m)**  
In September 1976, Doug and his friend Paul Braithwaite flew to Nairobi to climb Mt. Kenya but ended up climbing Kilimanjaro instead. They got lost in the thick jungles on the lower slopes, which was serious because water was hard to find. On the second day, they found some painted arrows on trees and a trail of rubbish that led them to a rock pool. They were relieved to find rubbish on the mountain. They tried to climb a steep wall but decided to take a safer route instead.

**D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)**  
The usual route up Aconcagua is relatively easy. In January 1992, Doug and his wife, Sharu, arrived at Punta del Inca and met fellow climber Phil Erscheler, who invited them to join his group climbing via the Polish Glacier. After waiting for bad weather to pass, they set off. The glacier was icy and challenging, so they chose to take the standard route instead, joining many other climbers. They faced strong winds as they reached the summit and camped outside a refuge that night. At base camp, they met a group planning to climb the Seven Summits and encouraged Doug to pursue this goal.

**E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)**  
Doug learned that climbing Vinson Massif could be funded by guiding others. His team left Britain in late November 1992 and traveled to the South Pole. During this time, the sun stays above the horizon, creating a unique atmosphere. On December 7, they set out for the summit. Despite strong winds and freezing temperatures, they all reached the top within eight hours, although visibility was very low due to a storm.

**F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)**  
In early summer 1994, Doug's team gathered in St Petersburg. Upon arriving at Terskol, they had to pay a fee to their guide for bringing foreigners into the area, but this fee was later waived. After a few days of getting used to the altitude, they took a cable car to 3,900m and then walked to a refuge at 4,200m. Two days later, they faced strong winds as they climbed. They thought they had reached the summit but discovered there was still more to climb. They returned to the refuge and descended the next day.

**G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)**  
On their expedition to Carstensz, Doug and his team aimed to create a new route and spend time with the local Dani people. They were warned about possible dangers from bandits but decided to proceed. On May 12, they began climbing. The weather improved, and two team members moved ahead while Doug and another member climbed more slowly. They reached the summit by 11 am, and Doug received a standing ovation for completing his seventh summit. Mission accomplished!"

**Style Merchants**

Style affects many parts of our lives today, from clothing to home decoration and accessories. Jo Foley shares the fashion trends for this year.

**Ned Ingham: Dress Designer**  
Ned Ingham creates beautiful, romantic wedding dresses. He advises people to avoid traditional, stiff dresses and the overly frilly look, suggesting simpler styles instead. Ingham has been designing wedding dresses since he was a child. At 16, he went to fashion school to learn how to cut and make clothes. You don’t have to be a bride to wear an Ingham dress; he also designs elegant evening dresses in modern colors and fabrics. For those who prefer classic styles, he offers a timeless navy-blue summer suit, which has been a staple in women's wardrobes for most of the 20th century, but he gives it a fresh look.

**Sally Quail: Jeweller**  
Sally Quail previously worked for an art dealer but has no formal training in jewellery. She started designing her own engagement ring when she couldn’t find one she liked. This led her to become a designer in 1990. Now, many celebrities seek her unique pieces. Her style features large semi-precious stones set in gold, creating stunning necklaces, bracelets, and rings inspired by 18th-century designs. Recently, she has begun using diamonds. ""It reflects my age,"" says 36-year-old Quail. ""I reached the point in every woman’s life when she wants a diamond, and that’s when I started working with them.""

**Lily Grimson: Handbag Designer**  
Just four years after starting her career in the competitive fashion industry, Lily Grimson, who has only taken a basic art and design course, has had two of her designs chosen for a major exhibition. Her bags are always noticed, regardless of their shape or style. All of Grimson's handbags are handmade in the UK. They are not just bags; they are glamorous, made from high-quality calfskin or silk. A mix of style and care makes a Grimson bag special.

**Peter Little: Hairdresser**  
For over 20 years, Peter Little has styled the hair of many famous people. ""Most women want hair that looks natural and is easy to manage at home,"" he says. His unique approach ensures that his clients do not look like they just left a salon. However, this casual style comes at a high price—£250 for the first appointment, and there is a three-month waiting list. Using his fame, Peter has created his own line of hairdryers and styling tools, allowing those who cannot visit his salon to style their hair at home.

**Penny Pratt: Florist**  
Penny Pratt runs a small flower shop and also works as a flower consultant for a large supermarket chain and top restaurants. She has no formal training in floristry and left her teaching job 10 years ago to pursue a new path. Her modern and simple floral designs have won many awards, helping her establish her own London Flower School. She has also given successful lectures in Japan and the USA. She believes, ""Flower arrangements are simpler now. Keep them strong but simple, and avoid too many large leaves. For wedding bouquets, the key rule is that all flowers should be of the same type."""
FCE_19,"**Text: Five-Star Luxury and Modern Technology**

The new five-star Merrion Hotel in Dublin combines luxury with the latest technology. It was created after extensive research into what customers want and nearly two years of work converting four large 18th-century houses. This approach allowed for the installation of advanced technology that benefits both staff and guests.

General Manager Peter MacCann expects his staff to know guests by name, but he uses the hotel's computer system to keep track of guests' preferences. This system helps the hotel provide special treatment for returning clients. Although it cost £250,000 to install, MacCann believes it will be worth it over time due to its efficiency. For instance, if a guest requests specific music CDs during their first stay, those same CDs will be ready for them on their next visit, thanks to the guest-history feature.

Room temperature is another common concern for hotel guests. The Merrion has a high-tech system that allows guests to adjust the temperature within three degrees of the normal 18°C. Additionally, the front desk can change the temperature in each room between 14°C and 25°C.

Business travelers are a significant part of the hotel's clientele, making up to 65% of its business. To cater to their needs, the hotel has brought traditional business center services into individual rooms. Each room is equipped with three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that also works as a photocopier and printer, and video-conferencing capabilities.

Technology evolves quickly, so the hotel has prepared for future upgrades by laying extra cables. They rent televisions instead of buying them, allowing for easy replacement with newer models. DVD recorders can also be updated as needed. Despite all this technology, MacCann emphasizes that they want guests to feel comfortable, not overwhelmed. The 145 bedrooms are spacious, well-furnished, and inviting.

The hotel also features a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a lovely garden. As with all luxury hotels, the food must be exceptional. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, who has two Michelin stars, moved his restaurant to the Merrion. This change has allowed him to create a modern kitchen and improve parking facilities. For the hotel, having a renowned restaurant adds value without financial risk. With the help of technology and a skilled staff, the Merrion Hotel is poised for success."

Artist Susan Shepherd is well-known for her flower paintings, and the large garden around her house provides many of her subjects. It is filled with her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wildly and spread throughout the garden. The two long flower borders along the paved path that runs from east to west show a beautiful mix of colors, shapes, and structures. This is largely thanks to the previous owners, who were passionate gardeners and left behind plants that Susan loves. She also inherited the gardener, Danny. ""In fact, it was really his garden,"" she says. ""We got along very well. At first, he would say, 'Oh, it's not worth it' for some of the things I wanted to add, but when I told him I wanted to paint them, he understood my vision.""

Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than painting the entire garden. However, she sometimes paints a group of plants in their natural setting. More often, she picks the flowers and takes them to her studio. ""I don't set everything up at once,"" she explains. ""I take one flower out and paint it, which might take a few days, and then I bring in another one to add to the painting. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.""

Her busiest time is spring and early summer when the tulips bloom, followed by the poppies. ""They all come out together, and you're so busy,"" she says. But she also finds beauty in the gradual decay of the flowers. For example, with tulips, ""you bring them in and put them in water, then leave them for a day, and they each change into different shapes. They open up and look amazing. When you first put them in a vase, they seem dull, but they keep changing with twists and turns.""

Susan has always loved plants. ""I studied botany in school and used to collect wildflowers from the countryside,"" she says. ""I wasn't really interested in gardening back then; in fact, I didn't like garden flowers. I thought they looked like the fake ones sold in some flower shops. To me, the only real flowers were wild ones. I was fascinated by how they could grow in tough places, like cracks in rocks or on cliff tops.""

Today, her garden includes many plants from distant lands, but they seem just as comfortable in her garden as they do in their native places like China or the Himalayas. She has a relaxed attitude towards her garden, similar to a caring aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don't cause serious trouble. With two upcoming exhibitions to prepare for and plenty of subjects right outside her door, finding time to work in the garden has been challenging lately. She now hires an extra gardener, but despite the need to paint, she believes that to stay connected with her subjects, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""

Many trees in the Brackham area were damaged in the severe storms that March. The town lost two large lime trees from the old market square. The loss of these important trees changed the look of the town center completely, which upset many of the local residents. Normally, Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, the head of the local police, would have been among those upset. However, during the storm, when the wind knocked down the walnut tree in his garden, Pelham was too unwell to notice. He was a big and healthy man, but for the first time, he was seriously ill with bronchitis. When he first felt a headache and tightness in his chest, his wife, Molly, urged him to see a doctor. Believing the police needed him, he ignored her and tried to keep working. This made him forgetful and irritable. It was only when his colleague, Sergeant Lloyd, took him to the doctor that he finally agreed to go. By then, he was too weak to argue. Soon, she took him to the pharmacy for his antibiotics and then home to his wife, who sent him straight to bed.

On Thursday morning, when Molly told him that the walnut tree had fallen during the night, Pelham could hardly believe it. That evening, he weakly asked about damage to the house and was relieved to hear there was none, then he covered his head with the sheets. It was not until Saturday, when the antibiotics worked, his fever went down, and he got up, that he realized the loss of the walnut tree had changed the living room forever. The Pelhams' large house was in a big garden. It had not been cheap, but Pelham had no regrets about buying it. The green garden had given them a sense of privacy. Now, however, the storm had changed his view. Before, the living room had a beautiful walnut tree that let in interesting patterns of light and shadow, hiding the worn furniture they had brought from their old house. With the tree gone, the room felt harshly bright, showing the shabby furniture clearly. The view from the window was not pleasant either. The tall house next door, which had been hidden by the tree, was now visible, with its unattractive purple bricks and pipes. It had many upstairs windows that seemed to watch the Pelhams' every move.

""Doesn't it look awful?"" Pelham said weakly to his wife. But Molly, standing in the doorway, sounded more happy than upset. ""I've been saying that since we moved here. We need to buy a new sofa, no matter the cost."""
FCE_16,"**Text: Living in the Valley**

We had been living in our valley for sixteen months when we first realized the dangers that could come from the surrounding hills and threaten our survival. It was the year when the storms arrived early, even before November ended. Until then, we felt safe and protected in our valley below the hills. Soon, snow began to fall. Within a day, it was about 15 centimeters deep. It almost completely blocked our lane and made the path by the stream slippery and dangerous. But on the nearby hills, the snow was much deeper and lasted longer. Up there, the wind blew fiercely. In our valley, we only felt sudden gusts of wind; the trees swayed, but their branches stayed strong. Still, we knew we had reasons to worry. The snow and wind were annoying, but they did not really trouble us much. It was the river, the Ryburn, which usually flowed gently, that worried us the most. It reminded us of what could happen if things were different, if the flow of water from the hills had not been controlled by a series of dams many years ago.

Soon, the snow started to melt. Day after day, we watched dark clouds gather over the hills to the west. These grey clouds spread over the valleys, twisting and turning, warning us of what was coming. We had seen enough of the sky; now we began to watch the river, which was becoming fuller and wilder each day. The snow was washed away as more rain fell from the clouds, but high in the hills, the reservoir was filling up and getting close to a dangerous level. Then it happened – for the first time in years, the reservoir overflowed. It was like Niagara Falls as the water surged over the dam and poured into the stream below. The river seemed wild as the waters rushed down to its lower parts. Just a couple of meters from our cottage, the stream looked furious beneath the bridge. It was much deeper than we had ever seen it so close to our home, crashing against its banks. For three days, we prayed that it would stay below its wall. Luckily, our prayers were answered as the dam held and the waters began to go down.

In the past, before the dam was built, the river had flooded nearby villages in such a rage. Now, the dam controls the river's flow, and usually, everything is fine; the large amount of water from the hills, caused by snow and heavy rain, stays behind the dam with only occasional overflow. Because of this protection, we can enjoy, rather than fear, the huge clouds that hang over the valley, and we can appreciate the great power that the river has. Thanks to this safety, we feel that our home in the valley is still secure and safe."
FCE_21,"Text: 'Film critic Mark Adams reflects on his ten years of work for a newspaper called The Front Page. Writing articles about films for The Front Page was my first real job. Before that, I had done some reviewing—novels for other newspapers, films for a magazine, and various tasks for the radio. That is how I met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, who also worked in radio and television. He hired me, but Tom was not mainly a journalist, or he would have been more careful in choosing his team. Initially, he wanted a group of critics to cover art forms that didn’t need specialized knowledge: books, TV, theatre, film, and radio. We would have a weekly lunch to discuss the artistic material Tom wanted us to cover, and there would be guests to create a friendly atmosphere. At that time, it felt like a dream: a new newspaper, and I was part of the team. It seemed unlikely that a new paper could succeed in a crowded market. I even thought a millionaire was pretending to employ me to help me personally, reflecting my lack of self-confidence. The first time I saw someone reading the newspaper on the London Underground and turning to a page with my review, I felt embarrassed. 

Tom's idea for a team of critics never really happened. It was a good plan, but we didn’t meet as intended, so everything was done by phone. It turned out that the public preferred to connect a reviewer with a specific subject area, so I chose to focus on film. Without Tom's initial support, we might not have developed the current system, where I write a detailed weekly piece, usually about one film. This way of working suits me well. I wouldn’t have liked the typical film critic role, which involves reviewing every new film. That routine would quickly make me feel bored. I would soon be sitting in my seat on a Monday morning, sighing, 'What terrible film do I have to watch now?'—a sigh often heard in screening rooms worldwide. The freedom I have allows me to expand my arguments or, in a dull week, to create something interesting from little. 

But what is my role in the public eye? I believe people choose films based on the stars, the marketing, or the director. There is also loyalty to certain types of films or the opposite. It is rare for someone who dislikes westerns to buy a ticket for one after reading a review, or for a romantic film lover to avoid a love story because of a critic's opinion. So if a film review isn’t really a guide for consumers, what is it? I don’t feel I have to be 'right' about a movie. I also don’t think there should be a specific number of 'great' and 'bad' films each year. My job is to present an argument. I’m not a judge, and I wouldn’t want to be.'"
FCE_46,"Text: 'Why would a schoolgirl want to swim 1500m, cycle 40km, and then run 10km? Because ""it's fun."" A teenager who loves endurance sports is looking for a training partner for triathlons, preferably female. This is a chance to work with a potential Olympic champion. The partner should be very interested in distance running (regular 15km sessions), distance swimming (enjoying winter training in cold rivers is a plus), and distance cycling (a love for 100km rides is helpful). Being able to do all three sports without resting is essential. 

Triathlons are becoming one of the most popular Olympic sports. They attract large crowds who are fascinated (and sometimes horrified) by athletes who swim 1500m, cycle 40km, and then run 10km without stopping. While it may be exciting for spectators, what drives triathletes to push their bodies so hard? What makes a talented 17-year-old, with great academic results, give up so much for the challenges of this sport? 

Melanie Sears has not yet learned the usual phrases about personal satisfaction and mental challenges that most athletes use when asked similar questions. ""You swim 1500m, then run out of the water and jump on your bike, still wet. Of course, then you freeze. After the 40km cycle, you have to run 10km, which feels long when you're tired. But it's great fun, and it's all worth it in the end,"" she says. 

Melanie entered her first triathlon at 14. ""I won the junior section, but I was the only junior competing. It felt so easy that I was waving at my teammates as I went around."" Feeling confident, she entered the National Championships. Although she had the second fastest swim and the fastest run, she did not place well. ""I was following a man, and suddenly we reached the sea. We realized we had gone the wrong way. I ended up cycling 20 kilometers too far. I cried all the way through the run."" But she did not give up and is determined to keep going. ""Sometimes I wish I could stop, because then the pain would end, but I am afraid that if I stop just once, I would want to do it again."" 

Such determination earns admiration from Steve Trew, the sport's coaching director. ""I've just been testing her fitness,"" he says, ""and she worked so hard on the running machine that it finally threw her off and into a wall. She gave it her all, but while most people stop when they realize they can't go further, she just kept going."" 

Melanie was the top junior in this year's European Triathlon Championships, finishing 13th. ""I was almost as good as the top three in swimming and running, but much slower in cycling. That's why I'm working very hard on it."" She is trying to convince her supportive parents, who will pay the £1,300 cost of her trip to New Zealand for this year's World Championships, to buy a £2,000 bike (""It's a special deal, with £1,000 off"") so she can compete in national 25 km and 100 km races later this year. 

However, there is a cost to her dedication. Her intense training has made her somewhat of a recluse. ""I don't have a social life,"" she says. ""I'm not a party person anyway. After two hours of hard swimming on Friday nights, I just want to sleep. But I call and write to the other girls on the team."" What do they talk about? Boys? Clothes? ""No, we talk about our times."" 

Where will all this focus lead? Melanie has tried other events, like the triathlon ""sprint,"" where you only swim 750m, cycle 20km, and run 5km. She wants to enter even tougher events than the triathlon. ""The big problem is, I have no one my age to train with,"" she says. It's interesting, isn't it?"
FCE_70,"**Text: The Collectors**

Amanda Roy discusses the things she collects and why many people enjoy this hobby. Collecting has always fascinated me, and about one in three adults participates in it. It is a world filled with passion, envy, enthusiasm, and joy. However, if you decide to collect, remember this: only collect items you truly love. 

Since ancient times, people have felt the need to collect. Early humans collected pebbles and wore them as necklaces. Attracted by their shapes and colors, these pebbles were among the first objects gathered for intellectual and spiritual reasons. Over the years, not much has changed. Children still collect stones and seashells simply for their beauty.

I have been collecting for my entire life, from flowers like tulips to pottery and paintings. My first collection was stones I found in my parents' garden. When I was six, I was sent to a school in a remote, cold part of England. When my parents visited, they took me to a local museum filled with objects collected by people from the past. I was captivated by these items. 

Interestingly, I am not alone in my interest in collecting. One in three adults shares this passion. The reasons behind collecting have become a topic of great interest. Some believe it gives individuals a sense of control in their lives. For me, it is simply something I enjoy.

One famous collector was the Duc de Berry in France, who had a ""room of wonders"" filled with natural and artificial curiosities, like cups made from coconut shells and carved ivory beads. Another notable collector, Catherine the Great of Russia, owned over 4,000 paintings. However, you don’t need to be wealthy to start a collection. I have collected various items, from tulip bulbs to china cups, with great determination. 

I remember convincing another tulip collector to sell me a special bulb. I planted it and cared for it until, one year, it disappeared—stolen by another collector. I also collected 350 American rag dolls, searching all over the USA for different designs. Unfortunately, this collection was lost when my house caught fire. The next morning, I stood in my front hall, looking at the remains of my furniture and collection, unsure which loss saddened me more.

I have always been intrigued by how collections change hands. A silver spoon that once belonged to a king or a poet adds value to the items traded in markets. As small objects become popular among collectors, their prices rise. For example, toys from the 1950s are now considered valuable, as long as you kept the original boxes. (I, unfortunately, threw both the boxes and the toys away.)"

Four people talk about their jobs.

**Lisa - Exhibition Programmes Organiser, Science Museum**  
I am in charge of creating temporary exhibitions. This involves planning, designing, and promoting the exhibition. I need to research the topic beforehand and speak with key people to understand the main themes and goals of the exhibition. I also decide which objects and images should be displayed. It is important that the public understands the ideas behind the exhibition, so I plan interactive displays, workshops, and performances. I work with engineers and electricians to ensure the final display is safe for visitors. Before the exhibition opens, I help design and write brochures and leaflets to inform people about it.

**Janet - Teacher of London Taxi Drivers**  
When I arrive at 7:30 a.m., the first thing I do is check the accounts. Then, I see what new maps and documents need to be created to help students learn the routes for the London taxi-driver test. By midday, about 50 students are in class, figuring out how to make the journeys. They find the most direct routes, using the correct one-way streets and turns. I step in when there is a disagreement, like whether a right turn is allowed at a certain junction. As they prepare for the test, I give them a simple route, but I tell them they must take a different route because the road is closed. The next student must find another route, and I will again provide a reason why they cannot go that way. This is to encourage them to think critically.

**Sarah - Marine Conservationist**  
I live by the coast and work from home. My job involves answering phone inquiries, creating educational materials, and organizing training courses. Sometimes, I go to our main office, but I mostly work along the coast. I collaborate with schools and study centers, running courses for coastal managers and decision-makers about ocean conservation. I take them out to sea in a boat to help them understand the underwater life better. This experience often changes their perspectives, as it is very different from making decisions on a computer. I feel very fortunate because conservation is my passion, so I find great joy in my work. However, since I work for a charity, there is always a need for more funding, which means I am constantly looking for resources and cannot achieve everything I want.

**Chris - Map and Atlas Publisher**  
My job is quite diverse. I ensure that our publishing program meets market needs and that we keep around 300 copies of the books we publish in stock. We maintain very high standards for information and content. We receive many letters from readers about issues like the representation of international borders, which require careful responses. I discuss future projects and current sales with co-publishers. I work with a passionate team, which makes the job more enjoyable. However, like many jobs, there is too much administration to handle, which leaves less time for more interesting tasks like product development and design."

Every June, we went to Ireland. Since the four of us started going on holidays together, we spent the first two weeks of the month at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. It is a large house by the sea, not far from the village of Ardbeag. The English couple who own the house, the Malseeds, have made some additions to it, but they did so very carefully. Strafe found Glencorn for us. He saw an advertisement when the Malseeds were still advertising. ""How about this?"" he said one evening and read the details. The summer before, we had gone to a hotel recommended by friends, but it was not a good experience because the food was terrible. The four of us have been playing cards together for a long time: Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia, and me. They call me Milly, but my real name is Dorothy Milson. Dekko got his nickname at school; Dekko Deacon sounds nice, I guess. He and Strafe were schoolmates, which is why we call Strafe by his last name, like the teachers did. We are all about the same age and live close to the town where the Malseeds lived before moving from England to Ireland. We always think it’s a funny coincidence.

""How very nice,"" Mrs. Malseed said, smiling to welcome us again this year. She seems to know when guests are arriving because she is usually waiting in the large hall that always smells of flowers. ""Arthur, take the luggage up,"" she told the old porter. ""Rose, Tulip, Lily, and Geranium,"" she said, referring to the names of the rooms we had. Mrs. Malseed painted flowers on the doors instead of using numbers. In winter, when few people come to Glencorn Lodge, she takes care of little details like that; her husband handles repairs and redecorating. 

""Well, well, well,"" Mr. Malseed said as he entered the hall from the kitchen. ""A hundred thousand welcomes,"" he greeted us in the Irish way. He was smiling widely, and his dark brown eyes sparkled, making us feel like we were more than just another group of hotel guests. Everyone smiled, and I could sense that the others felt our holiday had truly begun. Nothing had changed at Glencorn; everything was fine. Kitty from the dining room came out to greet us. ""You look younger every year, all four of you,"" she said, making everyone in the hall laugh again. 

Arthur led the way to our rooms, carrying as much luggage as he could and returning for the rest. After dinner, we played cards for a while, but we didn’t play for too long because we were still tired from the journey. In the lounge, there was a man alone and a French couple. There were other people at dinner, of course, because Glencorn Lodge is always full in June. From where we sat by the window, we could see some guests walking on the lawns and others taking the path down to the beach. In the morning, we would do the same: walk along the sands to Ardbeag and have coffee at the hotel there, returning in time for lunch. In the afternoon, we would drive somewhere. I knew this because over the years, we had developed this routine. Since we first came here, we had all fallen in love with the beautiful landscape in every season."

A chalet girl's work is never finished, says Sarah Sutherland-Pilch. This is her second year as a chalet girl. Sarah, 24, is from West Sussex and works in Val d'Isere, France. She cooks and cleans for visitors who come to ski and stay in wooden houses called chalets. Sarah graduated last summer from Oxford Brookes University, where she studied French and History of Art. She views being a chalet girl as a fun way to spend a year or two before starting a more permanent job. ""It's a good way to meet people. I meet successful individuals every week,"" she explains.

Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to the chalet, which can accommodate up to 18 guests each week. She has her own breakfast before preparing breakfast for the guests. ""They get a full breakfast - porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants."" After breakfast, around 9:30 a.m., Sarah cleans up and either prepares afternoon tea for the guests or cleans the rooms, which she finds the least enjoyable part of her job. By 11 a.m., she is ready to ski. ""On a good day, we can ski until 4:30 p.m.,"" she says.

Sarah returns to the chalet to prepare dinner and takes a shower first, but she avoids sleeping. ""It's not good if you do,"" she warns. Dinner, which is a three-course meal, is served at 8 p.m., and coffee is usually ready by 10 p.m. After dinner, she cleans the kitchen. ""There's nothing worse than coming into a messy kitchen the next morning."" Sometimes she chats with the guests, but other times they prefer privacy. ""Good guests can make a week wonderful - breakfast this morning was a lot of fun - but some weeks don’t go as well for various reasons.""

Sarah meets her friends in the chalet where she lives, and they usually go out around 11 p.m. ""We often start at Bananas, then might go to G Jay's and finish at Dick's T-Bar,"" she says. However, she doesn’t stay out too late on Saturday nights because Sunday is her busiest day. ""It's a tough day,"" she admits, ""when you definitely don’t want to cook breakfast with a bad headache.""

On Sundays, work starts earlier than usual, as breakfast for guests leaving has to be ready by 7 a.m. Once the guests leave, Sarah cleans quickly. ""We clean everything - clear the breakfast, strip the beds, and prepare for the next guests."" If she hasn’t done the shopping on Saturday, she does it now. Around 3 p.m., after finishing the cleaning, Sarah prepares tea for the new guests, who usually arrive around 4:30 p.m. Sometimes they seem confused and have many questions. ""I think the mountain air affects them,"" she jokes.

Between tea and dinner, Sarah takes any guests who need boots or skis to the ski shop and then gets a ride back to the chalet. Soon, it’s time for dinner again, and sometimes she enjoys a drink afterward, but not always. ""Sometimes I'm so tired I just go to bed early,"" she says."
FCE_27,"Miss Rita Cohen was a small, pale girl who looked much younger than Seymour's daughter, Marie, but she said she was six years older. One day, she visited his factory. She wore overalls and large, unattractive shoes, and her curly hair framed her pretty face. She was so small and young that Seymour found it hard to believe she was studying at the University of Pennsylvania, researching the leather industry in New Jersey for her Master's degree. A few times a year, someone would contact Seymour to ask if they could visit his factory. Sometimes, he would help students by answering their questions over the phone or, if they seemed serious, by giving them a short tour. 

Seymour thought Rita was almost as small as the children from Marie's third-grade class, who had visited his factory years ago to see how gloves were made. He remembered how Marie loved to watch the workers shape and press each glove using steam-heated brass hands, which she called ""pancake hands"" because they looked flat and strange. 

Rita asked, ""How many pieces come in a shipment?"" Seymour replied, ""Between twenty and twenty-five thousand."" She took notes and asked, ""Do they come directly to your shipping department?"" He was pleased to see her interest in every detail. ""They go to the tannery first. The tannery is a contractor. We buy the material, and they prepare it for us. My grandfather and father worked in the tannery here in town. I did too, for six months when I started in the business. Have you ever been inside a tannery?"" 

""Not yet,"" she said. 

""Well, you should visit a tannery if you want to write about leather. I can help arrange that for you. They are basic places. The technology has improved, but it’s not that different from what it was hundreds of years ago. It’s tough work. Tanning is one of the oldest industries; they found six-thousand-year-old tanning relics in Turkey. The first clothing was just skins that were tanned by smoking them. It’s a fascinating subject once you get into it. My father is a leather expert; you should talk to him. If you start a conversation about gloves, he could talk for two days. Glovemakers really love their trade. 

""Have you ever seen anything being made, Miss Cohen?"" 

""I can't say I have.""

""I saw my mother bake a cake when I was a child."" 

He laughed; she made him laugh. She was innocent but eager to learn. His daughter was much taller than Rita, but otherwise, Rita reminded him of Marie. He remembered how Marie would come home from school, full of what she had learned, everything neatly written in her notebook and memorized overnight.

Chris Arnot asks four people with dream jobs if they are as great as they seem.

**A. Raquel Graham**  
Raquel Graham calls from a taxi on her way to the airport. She cannot meet tomorrow because her boss needs her in Los Angeles instead. As a personal assistant to a pop star, she often travels around the world at a moment's notice. Raquel loves her job and has a good relationship with her boss. However, there is one small issue—she dislikes flying. ""On a nine-hour flight to California, I usually take sleeping pills to help me relax,"" she admits. Her worst experience was flying on Concorde. ""It felt so closed in with those tiny windows."" When she is not traveling, she works in offices in Manchester and London. She handles some routine tasks like organizing schedules, attending meetings with lawyers and accountants, planning travel, and making more travel arrangements. She did not apply for this job; a chance meeting with a pop group manager led to her working behind the scenes, and she took a secretarial course in the evenings. Five years later, she was in the right place when her boss needed a personal assistant.

**B. David Brown**  
David Brown has worked as an accountant and a golf caddy, which is someone who carries a golfer's bags. Overall, he prefers caddying because golf is his passion. However, there are downsides. He earns a small flat fee plus a percentage of the winnings, with average earnings between £25,000 and £35,000, much of which goes to travel and hotels. He was 31 when he first caddied for golfer Greg Norman. ""You're not just carrying bags. You give advice, use your knowledge about the game, and try to understand the course,"" he explains. His accounting skills were recognized by European Tour Productions, which made him a statistical data administrator. He collects and analyzes statistics from the caddies, which are valuable for television commentators, golf magazines, and the players themselves.

**C. Martin Fern**  
Martin Fern is the editor of the 'Food and Drink' section of a daily newspaper, and one of his easier tasks is to taste food at fine restaurants. What does he think about restaurants with high prices? ""For those who can afford it, it's their choice,"" he says. ""I would rather spend £120 on a meal I will remember than buy a microwave."" His cooking talent led to a friend, who was an editor of a Saturday Review, offering him a food column. At that time, Martin was the creative director of an advertising agency, and it provided him with extra income. He was 42 when another newspaper offered him a full-time job. ""It meant a 50% cut in guaranteed income,"" he says, ""but it was a chance to turn my passion into a career."" He still cooks at home and tries to stay fit by cycling a couple of miles to the nearest tube station.

**D. Dick Prince**  
""I started writing children's stories about 20 years ago,"" says Dick Prince, one of Britain's most popular children's authors. ""Before that, I loved words and enjoyed using them, but I mainly wrote poetry. Then I had an idea for a story. I had been a farmer and knew about chickens being killed by a fox. So, I wrote a story called The Fox Busters, which became my first published children's book."" Where do his ideas come from? ""It's not easy; I have to work hard at them,"" he says. ""I usually do this in the mornings. I don't wake up at dawn, I'm afraid. After lunch, I spend a couple of hours typing what I wrote in the morning—all with one finger on an old typewriter instead of a laptop. I receive between 50 and 100 letters a week, and that is the part of being a writer that I enjoy the most. I try to answer them all, but now I have some secretarial help."""
FCE_66,"Text: In the lumberyard by the lake, trees were turned into boards for building. There was an old two-story brick building, and outside, there were large piles of soft sawdust. These golden piles of dust covered the area down to the blue lake. That afternoon, feeling bored, all the boys followed Michael up the ladder to the roof of the old building. They sat with their legs hanging over the edge, looking out at the lake. Suddenly, Michael said, ""I dare you to jump down,"" and without thinking, he jumped off the roof and landed in the sawdust, rolling around and laughing. ""I dare you all!"" he shouted. ""You're all cowards,"" he teased, trying to get them to jump too. 

Still laughing, he watched as they looked down from the roof, nervous and unsure. One by one, they jumped and got up smiling with relief. In the warm afternoon sun, they lay on the sawdust pile, telling jokes until one of the boys said, ""Let's go back up to the roof and jump down again."" They weren't very excited, but they climbed back up and started jumping off in a determined way until only Michael was left. The others were down below, smiling and calling, ""Come on, Mike. What's wrong with you?"" 

Michael wanted to join them, but he stayed on the edge of the roof, nervously licking his lips and grinning foolishly, wondering why the drop had not seemed so long the first time. For a while, they thought he was just joking, but then they saw him clenching his fists. He was trying to count to ten and then jump, but when that didn't work, he took a deep breath and closed his eyes. Soon, the boys began to laugh at him; they were tired of waiting, and it was almost dinnertime. ""Come on, you're a coward! Do you think we're going to sit here all night?"" they shouted. When he didn't move, they started to get up and walk away, still shouting. 

""Who started this? What's wrong with you all?"" he called out. But he stayed on the edge of the roof, staring unhappily at the ground. He was alone for nearly an hour while the sun, like a big orange ball, slowly set over the grey line of the lake. His clothes were wet from nervous sweat. Finally, he closed his eyes, jumped off the roof, and fell heavily into the sawdust, lying there for a long time. The yard was quiet; the workers had gone home. As he lay there, he wondered why he had been unable to jump earlier. Eventually, he got up slowly and walked home, feeling very ashamed and wanting to avoid everyone. 

He was so late for dinner that his stepmother said coldly, ""You're old enough to get home on time. If you won't come home, you might as well stay out tonight."" She was a strong woman with fair skin, a little grey in her hair, and a patient smile. She spoke with controlled seriousness, but Michael, with his dark, gloomy face, hardly heard her; he was still thinking about the row of smiling faces below on the sawdust pile and hearing their laughter."
FCE_44,"**Careers Advice**

Are you unhappy in your job and unsure how to change it? Kitty Doherty offers some helpful advice. Many people looking to change their job turn to a careers adviser. You will need to write a brief history of yourself and take several tests called 'psychometrics'. After this, you will receive a summary of the results, along with suggested careers and any retraining you might need.

I decided to try Career Analysts, one of the largest organizations that provide career advice. Taking the careers test felt like being back in my science exams. I was in a group of about ten people, answering questions under time pressure. I had to remind myself that it wasn't about passing or failing. It was hard to see how the psychometric tests would accurately reflect who I am. The tests included tasks like finding mistakes in lists of names and numbers and matching similar shapes.

After the tests, I had a long conversation with an adviser. Based on our discussion and the test results, he created a report with his observations and recommendations. I agreed with most of his conclusions, but I was a bit disappointed to learn that I had performed poorly in the scientific, technical, and practical tests. I’m sure many sick people are glad I never became a nurse! However, it was comforting to hear that I had made the right choices regarding journalism.

Changing your career doesn’t always mean a complete shift. Last March, after working as a marketing manager for a large insurance company for five years, 25-year-old Donna Laney lost her job. Her friends suggested she visit Career Analysts for help. ""Losing my job was a great chance for me to step back and review my career,"" says Donna. ""I wanted to reassess my skills and interests."" Some of the results surprised her. ""I didn’t realize I had a talent for design. But in the end, I had to weigh the cost of retraining in design against my financial responsibilities,"" she explains. Other suggestions included taking a year off to work in the Far East. ""I decided to use my existing skills and move into a field that suited me better than insurance. I am now a Public Relations officer. I believe I would have reached this point without Career Analysts, but they helped me understand what I truly wanted to do. I have recommended them to several friends, and they are all satisfied with the service.""

Some people feel they would not have reached their goals without help. A visit to Career Counselling Services helped 26-year-old Juliet Greene make significant life changes. ""After working at a major bank for six years, I found my job boring and wanted a new challenge. I had no idea what I wanted to do, so I went to Career Counselling Services with an open mind. I took the tests, which showed I was interested in sciences,"" she says. ""I had four sessions with an adviser. The third session was recorded, which I found very helpful, as it’s easy to forget what you say. After the fourth meeting, I carefully considered the test results and decided I wanted to study geology. I plan to start a degree in it later this year. I think the advice from Career Counselling Services was worth the cost. I feel much happier and more positive now.""

However, career advice does not work for everyone. Amanda Margetts, a 24-year-old sales representative, says, ""I reached a point in my career where I didn’t know what to do next. I thought a careers adviser might suggest something new. Although I received many ideas, I rejected them because they either required a significant pay cut or a lot of retraining. I didn’t learn anything new about myself,"" she says. ""You have to share a lot of personal information with the adviser, and I felt that if I had told a friend the same things, they would have given me similar advice."""
FCE_22,"**Text: Fun at the Dentist's**

If you visit W. Lloyd Jerome's dental office in the center of Glasgow, you will notice bright, modern paintings on the walls and a stylish blue couch where patients sit while he checks their teeth. Jerome says, ""Fifty percent of people only go to the dentist when they are in pain instead of for regular check-ups. This is often because they are scared."" To change this, he has tried to create a space where people feel comfortable. For example, he decided not to wear a white coat, as many people connect that with pain. He believes that dental treatment should happen in a relaxing, interesting, and enjoyable atmosphere.

This idea may surprise many, as most people think of dental visits as painful or very formal. Jerome explains, ""If people are relaxed, entertained, and treated well, they will forget their past negative experiences."" One of his new relaxation methods is using virtual-reality headsets. ""We were the first dental practice in Britain to use them, and they are very popular. The headsets are used during the initial check-up, where the patient sits comfortably on the blue couch and watches a film about underwater wildlife while I examine their teeth. Then the headset switches to a special camera that gives the patient a visual tour of their mouth."" Surprisingly, most patients enjoy this part of their visit.

Another important aspect is that the office smells more like a perfume shop than a dentist's office. Today, it has a pleasant orange scent. Jerome explains, ""When people walk in, I want them to realize with all their senses that this is not a typical dentist's visit. Smell is very important. The usual dental smell can make people anxious if they are afraid of dentists."" I found the gentle scent in the office very nice.

Although Jerome is known as Glasgow's most stylish dentist, he emphasizes that he takes his work seriously. While relaxation techniques are important, the quality of treatment is the most crucial factor. For instance, Jerome uses a special tool that sprays warm water on the teeth to clean them instead of scraping. It feels a bit unusual at first, but as long as people are relaxed, it is not painful.

Five years ago, Jerome traveled to the United States to study dental techniques. ""One thing I learned there is that when you make it easier for the patient, it also makes it easier for you,"" he explains. He believes his patient-focused approach is the beginning of a gradual change towards less formality in British dentistry.

At that moment, a patient arrives. Jerome quickly goes over, offers him a cup of tea (herbal or regular), asks what video he would like to watch, and gently leads him to the chair. The patient seems to enjoy this five-star treatment, and it is easy to see why. The office feels more like an elegant beauty salon than a typical dental practice."

Chocolate, which comes from South America, is now a huge global business worth millions. In the UK, people spend over £230 million on chocolate during Easter, which is about eight percent of all chocolate sales for the year. Only at Christmas do people buy more chocolate. 

Although chocolate production on a large scale started in the last century, the cacao plant was first grown by the Aztec, Toltec, and Mayan civilizations in Central America over three thousand years ago. The cacao tree is a tropical plant found in Africa, South and Central America, the West Indies, and Southeast Asia. Its fruit is the size of a melon and contains 20 to 40 seeds. When dried, these seeds become cacao beans, which are used to make chocolate. In English-speaking countries, they are often called cocoa beans, a term that originated from a spelling mistake in the 17th century.

The Aztecs used cocoa beans as money and made a drink called xocoatl, which means ""bitter water"" in their language, Nahuatl. This drink was flavored with spices and used in ceremonies and to welcome guests. The Spanish found it tastier when mixed with cinnamon and sugar, but this recipe did not reach the rest of Europe for another hundred years.

In the late 17th century, chocolate houses opened in major European cities where people gathered to drink chocolate. Until the last century, the drink was made from solid chocolate blocks that had to be melted in hot water. In 1826, CJ van Houten from the Netherlands invented chocolate powder by removing most of the cocoa butter from crushed beans. The chocolate bar as we know it started in 1847 when a company in Bristol, Fry and Sons, mixed cocoa butter with chocolate liquor and sugar to create a solid bar. A Swiss company later added milk solids to make milk chocolate.

At the beginning of the 20th century, French companies dominated the British chocolate market. In 1879, the English company Cadbury named their factory Bournville, hoping to attract some French charm. Then, in 1905, Cadbury introduced the Dairy Milk bar, originally called Dairymaid. Smart advertising linked it to the healthy image of milk from the English countryside, making it a strong competitor to rich French brands. 

Currently, chocolate consumption in Britain is stable at about four bars per week. This has led manufacturers to find new ways to attract customers. One new idea is the ""extended line,"" where chocolate bars are turned into ice cream, soft drinks, or desserts to appeal to chocolate lovers who want something different.

However, cacao farmers are still struggling due to a drop in cocoa bean prices in the late 1980s. Many small-scale farmers went out of business. So, as you enjoy your next chocolate bar, remember the challenges faced by these farmers."
FCE_18,"**THE SHELL ARTIST**

At 83 years old, Peter Cooke has become a master of his craft. He still has many interests, such as paper-making and feather-work, but for now, he focuses on creating delicate and unique objects from shells. ""Let me know if I am boring you,"" he says as he shows me his work in his apartment. There is a fine line between being boring and being passionate, but Cooke is definitely the latter, thanks to his charm and the beauty of his creations.

He points to some shell-covered ornaments above his fireplace. ""I won’t mind if people don’t buy them because I have grown so fond of them. I never intended to sell my work. About five years ago, some friends suggested I have an exhibition so more people could see my art. They spoke to a gallery owner."" This led to an exhibition in London, where 70% of the pieces sold. His second exhibition opened at the gallery yesterday. Given the high prices of his work—around £2,000 for the ornaments—Cooke seems willing to sacrifice some space above his fireplace.

There are 86 pieces in the exhibition, with prices starting at £225 for a shell-flower in a crystal vase. Cooke insists he has no control over the prices and is open about them. He believes no one else in the world creates work like his, and as the gallery owner told him, ""One day you will stop, and everyone will want your pieces because there won’t be any more.""

""I wish I had started this earlier,"" Cooke says, ""because I could have created even more wonderful things. Although I still have ideas and do my best now, I am more limited physically than when I began."" Nevertheless, his work is far from the typical shell items found in seaside shops. ""I have a miniature mind,"" he explains, which has led to boxes covered in thousands of tiny shells, small pictures made from shells, and baskets of incredibly realistic flowers.

Cooke has developed his own method and uses materials as he finds them. He repurposes cardboard from laundered shirts for his flower bases, uses a special glue bought in bulk from a sail-maker (""If it runs out, I don’t know what I will do!""), and washes the shells with dish soap. ""I have an idea of what I want to create, and it just happens,"" he says about his working process. However, the attention to detail, color variations, and symmetry he achieves seem far from random.

Cooke's search for beautiful, especially tiny, shells has taken him beyond his local beaches in Norfolk to places like France, Thailand, Mexico, South Africa, and the Philippines. He insists that he only collects dead shells and defends himself against those who accuse him of damaging the world’s beaches. ""When I collect shells, I hear people stepping on them much faster than I can gather them. The ones that remain are broken by the sea. I would never collect shells with living creatures inside or dive for them, but once the animals have left, why shouldn’t I collect them?"" His argument is convincing, especially considering the beauty of his work often exceeds that of the shells themselves."
FCE_62,"**The Schoolgirl Model**

When 15-year-old Kira Langer is not traveling to exciting places and appearing on magazine covers, she is likely studying for her school exams. Jane Laidlaw learns more about her.

""I'm afraid Kira will be a little late,"" the receptionist at the agency told me. ""Oh, that's fine,"" I replied. I had been trying to convince myself that the negative things I had read about models were not true, but words like difficult, vain, and unintelligent kept coming to mind. And now she was going to be late. How late? An hour? Three hours? Maybe she wouldn't come at all. What if she thought going to the hairdresser was more fun than talking to me? If she was late, she might be rushing and in a bad mood, refusing to answer my questions. 

However, when the winner of the Looks magazine supermodel competition walked in, she was smiling, relaxed, and apologetic, accompanied by her mother. Kira was not wearing expensive designer clothes but a simple black dress and trainers. There was no sign of a selfish attitude; she was just a very friendly, tall, and pretty girl. Kira explained that all models under 16 must bring an adult with them to work, and her mother, who looked proud of her daughter, was just a normal mum.

Kira seems a bit confused by her sudden fame, which is understandable since it was unexpected. It was her older sister who suggested she enter the modeling competition. ""She saw the competition and said I should join,"" Kira remembers. ""I said no, but she sent some photos anyway."" When she received the call saying she was a finalist, she was at school. Being selected for the final gave Kira the confidence to continue, and she performed perfectly. She won easily, and the Select model agency in London quickly offered her work.

Kira now finds it challenging to manage her two separate lives. Her friends and teachers have gotten used to having a star among them. ""They're really proud of me,"" she says. However, some unkind people at her school make rude comments about her success. ""They say I have too high an opinion of myself."" This must be difficult for Kira to handle, as she is not self-important at all. She explains, ""They think that because I've suddenly become a model, I can't stay the same. But the only thing that has changed is that I've become more confident—not in a bad way, but I can stand up for myself more.""

As a busy model, her social life is affected. The Select agency can call at any time to tell her she is needed for a job the next day. ""If my friends are going out, I can't say I'll join them because I don't know what I'm doing the next day. I can't really make plans, and if I do, they sometimes get canceled, but my friends are understanding. They don't say, 'Oh, you're always going off modeling now, you never have time for us.'""

Kira has the looks, talent, and support to have a great career ahead of her. Not many people can say that before they even take their school-leaving exams. As I finish the interview with this girl who seems to have it all, I ask what she would like to do as a career if she didn't have the beauty that is likely to take her to the top. She pauses and replies, ""I'd like to do what you're doing."""
FCE_49,"**Text: Father and Son Start Gold Rush**

Terence and Chris Madden have traveled from the cold north of Canada to the warm lands of Africa in search of valuable metals. This father and son team—one an explorer and the other a mineral expert—believe their mine on a Welsh mountain could hold up to 10,000 ounces of gold. After ten years of digging in the Welsh hills, they are sure they are very close to a gold vein worth five million dollars. ""As we dig, we are finding high levels of gold; now we just need to dig a few more meters to where it is concentrated,"" said Terence, 68, from Liverpool.

The pair have dedicated their lives to finding gold. Their search began when Terence read about gold worth millions buried in the 'Dolgellau gold belt,' an area near the town of Dolgellau in Wales. While reading old mining journals and newspapers at the Welsh National Library in Aberystwyth, they chose the most promising land to explore. Since they first cleared the area and found pieces of gold in the rocks, they have spent the last ten years getting permission from landowners, taking soil samples, and removing old cars and trash. They have dug out 150 tonnes of greenstone rock to create a tunnel and a 10-meter shaft.

Now, they are running low on money. After spending their savings on this dream, they need to convince an investor to put £50,000 into the project to dig a few more meters to reach the gold. Chris Madden says, ""Right now, this seems unlikely, although we have several people we can contact.""

As news of their dig spread through the valleys last week, the allure of gold began to attract the attention of local residents as well as other gold diggers. Dolgellau depends on tourism, and locals are cautiously optimistic. ""If they are right, it would bring more visitors here,"" said Peter Woolven, manager of the Royal Ship Hotel, ""but if they find gold, I hope millions of people don’t come and disturb the hillside.""

The Welsh gold industry has greatly declined since its peak in the late 1880s when thousands worked in many mines across the countryside. One of the last remaining mines, Clogau-St David's, which made wedding rings for the Queen and the Princess of Wales, closed a month ago. However, individual gold diggers are returning. George Hall, another prospector, plans to dig a tunnel deep into the hill on the other side of the ridge from the Maddens. ""Searching for gold is very emotional,"" said Hall, 70. ""It's adventurous and exciting, the thrill of uncovering hidden treasure. Maybe I will be lucky this time."""
FCE_31,"**Text: IN HOT WATER**

Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends a lot of time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She teaches and researches marine geochemistry, which means she studies the chemical processes in the sea. Rachel is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she is not teaching, she gets into a small steel vehicle designed for underwater exploration and dives three kilometers down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes. 

Inside the vehicle, space is very limited, and she can touch the two pilots. They are used to these conditions, where they cannot stand up or move, and they must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last for 16 hours: three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours to collect rock and water samples, and three hours to return to the surface. If there is a problem and they need to get to the top quickly, they can hit a panic button. This releases a small escape vessel that rises quickly to the surface. ""No one has tested it yet, but I don't think it would be a pleasant journey,"" she says.

Rachel remembers her first time in the vehicle. It was on the deck of a ship, and she got in with an instructor who explained the emergency procedures, including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack. They were testing how she would react in such a small space. Now, Rachel has made six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian crew. They traveled five days west of the Canary Islands to a site with many underwater volcanoes, where black smoke is released. The Russian team was dropping off scientific equipment to study the effects of a project that would create a hole 150 meters through a volcano.

When Rachel is not at sea, she works in her office at the Oceanography Centre in Southampton. ""Two-thirds of my salary comes from teaching, which I love, but I do it so I can continue my research on the 'black smokers,'"" she explains. This term refers to underwater volcanoes that release water that looks like black smoke at a rate of one meter per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees Celsius.

Rachel recalls a frightening experience during her first dive with an American team. They were towing equipment when suddenly there was an explosion. ""There was a huge bang as the shock waves hit our vehicle, and I thought, 'I'm going to die.' We looked at each other in silence, waiting. When nothing happened, we couldn't believe it. The relief was incredible—we were still alive!""

""Diving to the deepest part of the ocean is such an adventure. Every time I look out of the porthole and see those chimneys, I feel a sense of wonder. Here I am at the bottom of the sea, and no one else on this planet has ever seen them before. I studied the black smokers for three years for my PhD, and when I finally saw them for real, it was an amazing feeling."""
FCE_58,"Text: 'I was dirty, smelly, hungry, and a bit sunburned. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. My body was exhausted, and my mind was tired of dealing with foreign schedules, currencies, and languages. ""Never again,"" I said as I stepped onto home ground. I repeated this the following year and the next. All I needed to do was buy one train ticket, and since I was under twenty-five, I could travel anywhere in Europe for a whole month. Ordinary beds feel different once you learn to sleep in a train corridor, rocked into a deep sleep. Carrying all your belongings in a rucksack leads to a simple way of traveling and encourages wastefulness, like burning socks that have become too dirty and getting rid of books after reading them. However, this carefree attitude is part of the Inter-Rail spirit, where common sense can be set aside along with the paperback book and the socks. All it takes to feel this freedom is one of those tickets in your hand. Any system that allows young people to travel through multiple countries in a day is special. On my first trip, my friends and I didn’t realize the full potential of this train ticket, thinking it was just a cheap way to reach our campsite in southern France. But the idea of continuous travel was too tempting, as there was always one more country to visit, always a little further to go. And what did the extra miles cost us? Nothing. We were not completely uninterested in culture, but this was our first holiday without parents, like most other Inter-Railers, and in planning our own schedule, we focused only on the most accessible sights. This was our chance to escape guided tours and do something different. I took pride in the fact that, in many places, all I wanted to see was the view from the station. We were just there to get by and enjoy ourselves. In this, we were like most other Inter-Railers with whom we shared train corridors, food, water, money, and music. The excitement of travel comes from the sudden reality of a place that was just a name before. It feels like the city you arrive in never existed until the train pulls into the station and you see it with your own tired eyes for the first time. Only by seeing Europe, watching the changing landscapes, and noticing the differences in attitudes and lifestyles can you truly understand the continent. Everyone knows what is there, but it means nothing until you experience it yourself. This is why other people's holiday photos can be so dull. While the train trip may not let you discover new things in the world, it is a valuable personal experience. Europe is vast, and Inter-Rail offers the best chance to appreciate this, though it didn’t happen for us right away.'"
FCE_37,"Text: 'There is nothing more disappointing than arriving at an airport in another country and finding out that your luggage has been left behind. At best, you will have to wear the same clothes for hours or days until the airline returns your luggage. At worst, you might be in a different climate, far from home, and stuck in unsuitable clothes. Although airlines do not often share how many bags they lose, it is a common issue that regular travelers will eventually face. Even the best airlines make mistakes sometimes, and it is impossible for any airline to guarantee that your checked luggage will travel on the same flight, especially when your journey involves one or more flight changes.

The system works like this: Airlines require passengers to check in early, which is meant to give enough time for luggage to be processed and loaded onto the plane. Minimum connecting times (MCTs) are the shortest time needed to transfer between two flights, and these times are also extended to allow for luggage transfers. Normally, this system works well. However, extra security checks and air traffic issues can lead to flight delays, which can disrupt the baggage system. Human error or accidents, such as a destination label being torn off, can also cause problems. These issues can be worse at large transfer airports, known as 'hubs', because they handle many bags. 

For example, last year, London’s Heathrow airport served over 41 million passengers, with nine million changing planes. British Airways alone managed two million transfer passengers at Heathrow, most of whom transferred between Terminal 1 (for domestic and European flights) and Terminal 4 (for long-distance flights). Even efficient airports like Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Singapore, and Zurich can have bad days. The risk of losing luggage during plane changes is higher at certain airports. The United States also faces issues; Miami airport is known for losing luggage when transatlantic passengers connect to flights in Latin America.

To reduce the chance of losing your luggage, choose direct flights whenever possible and check in well before the official time. If you must change planes, try to fly with the same airline for all your flights. Allow extra time for connections by taking an earlier flight to the transfer airport, and make sure to label your luggage inside and out with your home and holiday addresses, including your flight numbers. If your luggage still goes missing, contact the airline staff in the baggage area and fill out a property irregularity report (PIR) before leaving the airport.'"
FCE_2,"**The Kingfisher**

Wildlife photographer Charlie James is an expert on the kingfisher, a beautiful blue-green bird that lives near streams and rivers and feeds on fish. Old trees hang over the stream, providing shade to the shallow water. The main colors in this scene are soft greens, browns, and various shades of yellow from the sunlight, creating a peaceful atmosphere, just like the gentle sounds of water in the breeze. The kingfisher moves quickly and gracefully, like a flash of light, so striking that you can almost feel its presence. It disappears in an instant, but the image stays in your mind, its impact greater than its small size.

Charlie James fell in love with kingfishers when he was young. His deep feelings for this little bird are shown by his uncertainty about what exactly attracts him to it. The kingfisher is part of many legends. In Greek mythology, it is a moon goddess that turned into a bird. Another story says that the kingfisher flew so high that its upper body became the blue of the sky, while its lower body was burned by the sun. There is some truth to this tale. Despite the many shades of blue in their feathers, kingfishers do not have blue pigment. Instead, the structure of their feathers scatters light and reflects blue. This is why a kingfisher can look bright blue or rich emerald green depending on the angle of the light.

It is no surprise that many wildlife photographers are passionate about kingfishers. The combination of their colors and the fact that, although they are shy, they can be observed easily from a distance makes them fascinating. Charlie James's first hideout was an old blanket he put over his head while waiting near a kingfisher's favorite spot. The bird returned within minutes and sat just a meter away. However, it took him another four years to take his first good picture. During this time, the European kingfisher became a major part of his life. He spent as much time as possible by a stream rich with kingfishers. Unfortunately, school limited his time with the birds, and he missed classes, calling himself an ""academic failure."" But his interest in this widespread kingfisher, the only one of its family that breeds in Europe, was noticed. At 16, he was hired as an advisor for a nature magazine. He then worked as an assistant to the editor and gradually became a freelance wildlife film cameraman.

Now, he dreams of making the ultimate kingfisher film: ""No speech, just beautiful images that say it all,"" he says. ""I’m drawn to the simple approach. I like to photograph parts of kingfisher wings..."" His voice trails off as he thinks of the colors of the bird he has spent more than half his life observing, which still captivate him. His photographs express some of his feelings, but Charlie knows that there is much more to his connection with the kingfisher than his work can ever show."
FCE_68,"**Text: Conducting an Orchestra**

Giving directions to an orchestra is not easy. Anne Inglis talks to five new conductors about their experiences.

**A. ANNE MANSON**  
Anne Manson, 30, asked to attend conductor Claudio Abbado's practice sessions in Vienna. She ended up filling in for an absent assistant and was later asked to help with another opera the next season. ""I had to lead the first orchestral rehearsal for Abbado. I wasn't nervous. I have always felt confident standing in front of an orchestra."" Manson, who is from America, works with a well-known opera company in London that focuses on modern works. She is also gaining recognition in other European countries, thanks to support from the British Arts Council. Since that first experience, she has assisted Abbado on several more projects.

**B. ANDREW CONSTANTINE**  
Andrew Constantine, 31, believes the hardest part of being a conductor is finding the right opportunities. He won a major competition in 1991 after unsuccessful attempts in two others. Looking back, he feels lucky about the timing: ""If it had happened earlier, I would have been forgotten."" The competition gave him many performance opportunities and a chance to work as an assistant to a famous conductor. However, Constantine struggles with being known only for the competition: ""If in three years my name is still linked to the competition, I will be worried. But orchestras like the English Chamber Orchestra, who hired me after the competition, are inviting me back. If that doesn't happen, my career could suffer.""

**C. WASFI KANI**  
Wasfi Kani, who founded Pimlico Opera, enjoys the long practice periods that come with opera productions. ""The music deserves four weeks of focus,"" says Kani, who began conducting seriously in her late twenties. After university, she worked in London's commercial center until Pimlico Opera became fully professional two years ago. Taking lessons with Sian Edwards was a turning point for her. ""I saw her conduct and realized she was my size. I had always learned from much larger conductors, which makes a big difference."" Kani appreciates the complexity of opera: ""There are many arguments, and you have to consider the personalities of the singers.""

**D. ROGER VIGNOLES**  
Roger Vignoles, 48, says, ""Conducting surprised me, but it fascinates me."" This career choice is not so strange; he started as a resident musician with an opera house and worked with talented conductors. Last year, he was asked to direct Handel's Agrippina from the piano at a festival, something he had never done before. ""It was easier than I expected. I knew the music well and what I wanted it to sound like. I did my best to achieve the performance I wanted. Fortunately, people respect my skills as a musician. I benefit from all my experiences, both in musical style and performance. Now, I will accept any opportunity to discover what I enjoy.""

**E. WAYNE MARSHALL**  
In 1986, conductor Simon Rattle noticed a young assistant conductor during one of his productions and told his agent about Wayne Marshall. Now 32, Marshall soon found himself conducting a musical in London on short notice, which was a challenging start. He even had to manage some relaxed professional musicians reading newspapers during the show: ""I was firm with them. I always gave a clear beat and aimed for the best result. Many orchestral musicians I’ve seen don’t seem to need guidance from a conductor. But I’m never afraid to express what I want. If people see you’re worried, it gets worse. I have never studied conducting formally, and no book teaches you how to conduct, but people have been kind to me. I am determined and know what I like."""
FCE_23,"**Variations on a Theme**

If you are thinking about taking children to a theme park, there are many options in Britain. We asked five families to review some of the best parks.

**Fun Island - The Burns Family**  
Last year, we visited a large theme park in the US and thought Fun Island might be boring in comparison. However, we were pleasantly surprised. The park is designed for younger children, so our three-year-old felt included. The kids loved the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. There is a special dodgems ride for very young kids, which was a big hit. For older children, there are more thrilling rides, like Splash Out, where you jump into a pool! After five hours, Steve and I were ready to leave, but the children wanted to stay because they were having so much fun. Our only complaint is that the park could use more atmosphere, and the scenery was not very impressive. However, the staff were very helpful, and we found the park to be clean, well-organized, and focused on safety.

**Wonderland - The McMillan Family**  
None of us had been to a theme park before, so we didn’t know what to expect. We thought Oscar might be too young, but he loved it. He enjoyed the Mountain Train and especially liked Little Land, which has small models of famous buildings that he could see easily! The older children liked the ferris wheel and enjoyed driving toy cars on a real road layout. We spent six hours there and appreciated the places to relax. The landscaping was beautiful, and the staff were friendly and helpful. There was something for everyone, including adults.

**Adventure World - The Jeffree Family**  
After seven hours, we felt there was still more to explore. The children loved the Big Top Circus, which had an amazing trapeze act that kept us excited. We tried the Terror Line, and although the girls were scared and kept their eyes closed, they said they enjoyed it. Their favorite ride was Running River, where you think you will get wet, but you don’t. Toy Land is also a lot of fun for younger children. The kids looked at the new ride, Fear Factor, but we were relieved when they realized they were too small to go on it! The park is so well designed that even waiting in line for rides is not too boring. It was very clean, and the staff were excellent. On one ride, I couldn’t sit with both girls, so a staff member kindly went with one of them.

**The Great Park - The Langridge Family**  
We arrived at one o'clock and were disappointed that the park closed at 5 p.m. This is a great theme park for younger children because the rides are not too scary. I am not very brave, but I still had fun. We all loved Exotic Travels, a boat ride that starts slowly and then becomes very exciting. We waited for half an hour for Lightning River, and it was over too quickly! I wouldn’t go on the Big Leap, but it looked fun if you are brave enough. If the children had been a bit older, they might have found it a little boring, but they were the right age and enjoyed it.

**Fantasy World - The Break-all Family**  
According to the park's advertising, there is 'No Limit to the Fun', and we definitely felt that was true. Europe's tallest roller-coaster, the Rocket, stands out in the park, and Ben thought it was the scariest ride, while Jennie said the Hanger, where you hang upside-down 30 meters above the ground, was even scarier! There are about a dozen main rides, which the older children went on several times. Sarah was too small for some rides but enjoyed the Long Slide. We found the staff's attitudes varied. Some were great with younger children, but the welcome was not always friendly. You need a full day to enjoy Fantasy World. We wouldn’t have dared tell the kids we were going home early."
FCE_60,"**Text: Running a Business in the Countryside**

Five women share their experiences of starting a business in the countryside.

A. ""My customers are friends,"" says Christine Hogan, who runs a computer-aided design business that earns over £200,000 a year and has four full-time employees. ""My husband and I moved from London to the countryside when our children were young, and I wanted a job I could do from home. I had worked with computers before marriage, so my husband suggested I start a computer-aided design business. It required a lot of money, and the beginning was tough. I was careful and always informed the bank manager if I might overspend. Working from home saves money, and I can work in the evenings if I choose. My business has stayed small, and we rarely deliver work; customers from the area usually come to pick it up.""

B. ""I enjoy being independent,"" says Maggy Sasanow, who designs greeting cards from home. ""I studied art at university and wanted to work in a museum. But when I got married, we moved to the countryside, where such jobs were not available. So, I decided to start my own business and now create a range of 50 greeting cards that I sell to museums. I work in a large room upstairs. The downside of working from home is that there are always chores to do, like mowing the lawn. My business relies entirely on word of mouth; I don’t advertise. People send work from London because I am cheaper than other artists. Working alone means I miss sharing ideas with others, but overall, the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.""

C. ""It has been challenging at times,"" says Delia Turner, who runs a curtain-making business that has experienced ups and downs. ""I started my business eight years ago when this type of work was growing. In two years, my earnings increased from £24,000 to £80,000. I used to manage six full-time curtain-makers, but I had to let them go due to the economic decline, which was hard because finding other jobs in this area is not easy. Now, I am back to making curtains at home with my husband’s help and using women who work from their homes. I must be ready to lower my prices when needed and explore new opportunities.""

D. Tessa Strickland manages her children's book publishing business from her farmhouse. ""I moved to the countryside three years ago for two reasons: it was cheaper than London, and I love the countryside. I enjoy being able to work when I want. Eighty percent of my income comes from deals with Australia, the Far East, and North America, so I have to take calls at unusual hours. The downside is that I need discipline to close the office door. I publish children's books from different cultures, working with authors and artists. I had all my professional experience in London, so I felt very isolated at first.""

E. Meg Rivers runs a cakes-by-post business and a shop that earns £250,000 a year and employs six people, some part-time. ""I started ten years ago at home. I am very interested in health, so I began making fruit cakes with high-quality flour and eggs. Soon, I received requests from friends and family, and I started sending cakes all over the country. Seven years ago, I rented a small building where everything is made; we have a baker, an assistant, and a professional cake decorator. I don’t bake anymore, as I manage the business side. My biggest challenge has been the financial aspect, which has been tough because we didn’t have a lot of money to start with."""
FCE_1,"**Text: Meet the Amazing Watkins Family**

The Watkins family is special because they are all involved in music. The sons are composers and award-winning musicians, while their dad makes musical instruments. Matthew Rye reports.

It is not uncommon to find families of musicians, but it is rare to find one that includes both music creators and an instrument maker. When John and Hetty Watkins, who are schoolteachers in South Wales, needed a cello for their ten-year-old son, Paul, they were surprised by the high prices. John says, ""We looked at different shops, and it was clear it would be very expensive. So, I thought about making one myself. I found out that the Welsh School of Instrument Making was nearby, and I attended evening classes once a week for about three years.""

Paul, now 28, adds, ""After trying to make violins and violas a few times, he made his first cello. It turned out really well. He made me another one later, which I used until a few months ago."" John has since retired from teaching to become a full-time craftsman, making up to twelve violins a year. Selling one to the famous American musician Jaime Laredo was a great achievement for him.

Both Paul and his younger brother, Huw, were encouraged to play music from a young age. Paul remembers, ""I started with the piano as soon as I could reach the keys. But soon, I was drawn to the cello. My parents wanted me to play the violin because Dad played the viola and needed another violin for his music group. I tried it for about six weeks but didn’t enjoy it. I was inspired by the cellist in Dad's group, who I thought was really cool when I was six or seven. He offered to give me lessons, and that’s how it all began. Later, they wanted Huw to play the violin too, but he wasn’t interested.""

Huw, now 22, says, ""My parents were supportive but not pushy. I think I would have struggled if they had forced me. Instead of feeling jealous of Paul's success, I found it motivating."" Huw is now starting to make a name for himself as a pianist and composer.

John's cello has helped Paul achieve great things. With it, Paul won the string final of the BBC Young Musician of the Year competition. At just 20 years old, he became the principal cellist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra, a role he held while still using his father's instrument until last year. Now, he has a Francesco Rugeri cello on loan from the Royal Academy of Music. Paul says, ""Dad hasn’t said anything about me moving on, but he recently played both cellos and admitted that my new one is quite nice! The only thing Dad's cello might gain over time is the ability to project sound in large concert halls. It will get richer with age, just like my Rugeri, which is already 304 years old.""

Soon, Paul will perform on television as the soloist in Elgar's Cello Concerto, which is part of a new series called Masterworks. He says, ""The history of the performance doesn’t change how I play it. I will always do it my way."" However, Paul won’t be able to watch himself on TV because he is performing at the Cheltenham Festival that same night. Huw also has a performance, as his String Quartet will premiere in London at the Wigmore Hall that evening. John and Hetty will need to be organized and energetic to keep up with all their sons' musical events in the coming weeks."
FCE_53,"**Looking after the Countryside: The National Trust**

The National Trust is an organization that aims to protect the British countryside. Gill Page visits the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and speaks with Gareth Roberts, a warden who works for the Trust to care for its beautiful areas.

According to Gareth, a National Trust Warden needs common sense and good people skills because they interact with farmers, visitors, conservationists, and construction companies regularly. Gareth grew up on the Lleyn Peninsula and worked on his parents' farm until he got married. About 80 people applied for the position of National Trust Warden for the Lleyn Peninsula. In the end, Gareth's local knowledge and farming experience helped him get the job, even though he did not have formal training. 

He says, ""It helps that I still farm with my parents, so I can relate to farmers and understand their issues. They can't fool me!"" His farming background also prepares him for the physical demands of the job, such as building fences, planting trees, and constructing walls. Since joining the Trust, Gareth has learned more about nature conservation. He remembers, ""When I was young, I used to pick flowers, collect butterfly larvae, and find old birds' nests. Recently, I wondered where I could find those flowers and nests now. It has become clear to me that farming has changed the countryside. It's not the farmers' fault; they were just following government advice.""

Gareth notes that when he started, farmers and conservationists were often in conflict, each wanting things done their way. Now, they are communicating and understanding each other's perspectives. ""We're at a turning point, and it only takes a small step to bring them together,"" he says. 

Conservation is a key part of Gareth's work, along with allowing public access to the Trust's land, planting trees, and working with tenant farmers. ""My job is to ensure tasks are completed efficiently and with minimal fuss. What I enjoy most is seeing projects finished, although I spend about half my time on reports and paperwork.""

Gareth is passionate about his job and enjoys every moment, especially interacting with the public. However, he admits, ""I dislike the attitude of some visitors. They come in, demand everything, and leave as if they have a right to it. Being polite to those people can be frustrating!"" But as Gareth says, it all comes down to common sense. 

If you have plenty of common sense and enjoy outdoor work, you might consider applying to be a warden like Gareth. Just don't expect a position to open up on the Lleyn Peninsula for a long time!"
FCE_55,"**The Netball Captain**

In our series about women in sports, Suzie Ellis met England's netball captain, Kendra Slowinski. Kendra is the captain of the England netball team. When I met her, she had a busy day, typical for the weeks before the World Championships next month. She taught at a local school and then had a training session in a supermarket car park. 

""Don't you get strange looks?"" I asked her. ""I'm too focused on my movements and my feet to notice anything else,"" she replied. ""I might see cars slow down out of the corner of my eye, but that's it."" 

""My whole life now is about being my best for the Championships,"" Kendra said. ""I follow a strict schedule to be as fit as possible."" This will be her fourth World Championships, and it is expected to be the biggest yet, with 27 countries participating. ""We will have home support, which is very special,"" she said. ""It's important to improve the reputation of netball in this country. Playing at home means there will be more pressure than usual. The crowd will have expectations and will support us more. People expect us to start the tournament with a strong game."" 

Their first match is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. ""As far as I know, we have always beaten them, but they will be exciting to play against. They have a lot of talent."" The England team is currently ranked fourth in the world. However, Kendra notes that the World Championships will be challenging. ""You have to push yourself to play every day; there is no break between games like in a series. You can still win a series if you lose the first game, but the Championships are different because you only have one chance, and you must be ready to take it."" 

In the fifteen years she has played at a high level, the sport has become harder and faster. Players are more aggressive on the court. ""You don’t train hard not to win,"" Kendra said. ""But once the final whistle blows, you become a different person. We are all friendlier after the game."" 

Netball is also using a more scientific approach to fitness testing. ""It is essential that we all think and train like world-class players,"" Kendra explained. ""As captain, I believe it is important to have a strong mental attitude and lead by example. I see my role as supporting and encouraging the team."" 

""From the start of my netball career, everything has been carefully planned,"" she said. ""I decided some time ago that this competition would be my last as a player."" She will likely coach young players in the future, but for now, she is focused on her final big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she may very well have a tear in her eye."
FCE_50,"**SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS**

How can parents support a child with exceptional musical talent? It can be challenging to know how to nurture their gift. Some parents may not recognize their child's needs until frustration leads to difficult behavior. While most schools can help children who excel in academic subjects, musically gifted children often need special attention that regular schools may not provide, especially if music is seen as less important.

Children who are musically talented, and those whose abilities are encouraged by their parents or teachers, may benefit from attending a specialist music school. In Britain, there are five such schools, which have been established relatively recently. These schools aim to create a supportive environment for gifted children aged seven to eighteen, allowing them to develop their skills under the guidance of professional musicians.

At specialist music schools, students spend about one third to one half of their day on music-related activities. This includes individual lessons (up to three hours a week for their main instruments), playing in orchestras and chamber groups, voice training, conducting, and music theory. They also practice in well-equipped private rooms, sometimes with a teacher. The rest of their day is filled with a limited academic program that focuses on essential subjects like English, math, basic sciences, and languages, although students can study more subjects if they wish.

All five British specialist music schools are independent, with smaller class sizes and a high teacher-to-student ratio. Most students live at the school, which means they spend their formative years with peers who share similar goals and interests.

However, there are some disadvantages. One major issue is the cost; fees for boarding students range from £12,000 to £17,000 a year. Each school tries to help parents of exceptionally gifted children with scholarships and financial aid. Additionally, not all parents want to send their children to boarding school, especially at a young age. Many directors of these schools have concerns about admitting children as young as seven into such a demanding environment. They emphasize that their goal is to develop well-rounded individuals.

It is important to note that separating musically gifted children from their peers at an early age can create stress. Some early signs of musical talent may fade during the teenage years, and the pressure to succeed can lead to feelings of failure. However, all specialist schools monitor their students closely and provide support when needed.

While many former students feel they gained a lot from the high-quality music education, some worry about the limited academic program, which often takes a back seat to music. Many musically talented young people are also very intelligent and can handle academic challenges, so they may feel frustrated if their academic needs are not met.

For these reasons, it might be better to wait until a child is older and can make their own choices before considering a specialist music education. Children who are also academically gifted may thrive in a regular school with a strong music program or by combining a normal school schedule with music training at junior departments of music colleges. These colleges offer Saturday morning lessons with excellent teachers, as well as orchestral and chamber music experiences. However, this option may not be feasible for families living far from London or other major cities."
FCE_25,"**Text: An Eye for Detail**

Artist Susan Shepherd is well-known for her flower paintings, and the large garden around her house provides many of her subjects. It is filled with her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wildly and spread all over the garden. The two long flower borders along the paved path that runs from east to west show a beautiful mix of colors, shapes, and structures. This is largely thanks to the previous owners, who were passionate gardeners and left behind plants that Susan loves. She also inherited the gardener, Danny. ""In fact, it was really his garden,"" she says. ""We got along very well. At first, he would say, 'Oh, it's not worth it' about some of the things I wanted to add, but when I told him I wanted to paint them, he understood my vision.""

Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than painting the entire garden. However, she sometimes paints a group of plants in their natural setting. More often, she picks the flowers and takes them to her studio. ""I don't set everything up at once,"" she explains. ""I take one flower out and paint it, which might take a few days, and then I bring in another one to add to the painting. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.""

Her busiest time of year is spring and early summer when the tulips bloom, followed by the poppies. ""They all come out together, and you're so busy,"" she says. But she also finds beauty in the gradual decay of the flowers. For example, with tulips, ""you bring them in and put them in water, then leave them for a day, and they each change into different shapes. They open up and look amazing. When you first put them in a vase, they seem dull, but they change all the time with twists and turns.""

Susan has always been interested in plants. ""I studied botany in school and used to collect wildflowers from the countryside,"" she says. ""I wasn't really into gardening back then; in fact, I didn't like garden flowers. I thought they looked like the fake ones sold in some flower shops—only wildflowers seemed real to me. I was fascinated by how they could grow in difficult places, like cracks in rocks or on cliff tops.""

Today, her garden includes many plants from distant lands, but they seem just as comfortable in her garden as they did in China or the Himalayas. She has a relaxed attitude towards her garden, similar to a loving aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don't cause serious trouble. With two upcoming exhibitions to prepare for and plenty of subjects right outside her door, finding time to work in the garden has been challenging lately. She now hires an extra gardener, but despite the need to paint, she knows that to stay connected with her subjects, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""
FCE_34,"**Text: Keeping Holiday-Makers Happy**

A chalet girl's work is never done, says Sarah Sutherland-Pilch. This is her second year as a chalet girl. Sarah, 24, is from West Sussex and works in Val d'Isère, France. She cooks and cleans for visitors who come to ski and stay in wooden houses called chalets. Sarah graduated last summer from Oxford Brookes University, where she studied French and History of Art. She views being a chalet girl as a fun way to spend a year or two before starting a more permanent job. ""It's a good way to meet people. I meet successful guests every week,"" she explains.

Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to work. She has her own breakfast before preparing breakfast for the guests. ""They get a full breakfast - porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants."" After breakfast, around 9:30 a.m., Sarah cleans up and either makes afternoon tea for the guests or cleans the rooms, which she says is the least enjoyable part of her job. By 11 a.m., she is ready to ski. ""On a good day, we can ski until 4:30 p.m.,"" she says.

After skiing, Sarah returns to the chalet to prepare dinner. She takes a shower first but does not sleep, as she believes it would make her feel worse. Dinner, which is a three-course meal, is served at 8 p.m., and coffee is usually ready by 10 p.m. After dinner, she cleans the kitchen. ""There's nothing worse than coming into a messy kitchen the next morning,"" she says. Sometimes she chats with the guests, but other times they prefer to be alone. ""Good guests can make a week wonderful. Breakfast this morning was great fun, but some weeks are not as good for various reasons.""

Sarah meets her friends in the chalet where she lives, and they usually go out around 11 p.m. ""We often start at Bananas, then go to G Jay's, and maybe end the night at Dick's T-Bar,"" she shares. However, she does not stay out too late on Saturday nights because Sundays are her busiest days. ""It's a tough day,"" she says, ""when you really don’t want to cook breakfast feeling tired.""

On Sundays, work starts earlier, as breakfast for guests must be ready by 7 a.m. Once the guests leave, Sarah cleans quickly. ""We clean everything - clear the breakfast, strip the beds, and get ready for the next guests."" If she hasn’t done the shopping on Saturday, she does it now. By around 3 p.m., after finishing the cleaning, Sarah prepares tea for the new guests. ""They arrive around 4:30 p.m. Sometimes they seem confused and have many questions. I think the mountain air affects them,"" she jokes.

Between tea and dinner, Sarah helps any guests who need ski boots or equipment and then gets a ride back to the chalet. Soon, it’s time for dinner again, and she might chat with friends, but sometimes she is too tired and goes to bed early."

Mandie Currie, a zookeeper, spent a day at the magazine Marie Claire. ""Choosing my outfit for Marie Claire was difficult because I usually wear a uniform at work. First, I went to a photo studio, then to press previews, all before lunch. The zoo is a calm place, and here I was rushing around when I could be quietly spending time with an animal. Some members of the fashion team seemed stressed, but my job is not very pressurized. At a fashion shoot in the afternoon, I found it funny to think that I would usually be cleaning cages or handling rats. I am interested in how magazines work, but I really enjoy my job at the zoo, so I will stay there.""

Alice Cutler, a fashion assistant at Marie Claire, spent a day at London Zoo. ""I arrived at the zoo in my leather boots and dark blue trousers. The zoo gave me a green polo shirt to wear, which was good because I got very dirty. While I stroked one of the elephants, I thought Mandie would probably be packing clothes in a cupboard. By five o'clock, I was dirty but had a wonderful day. When I retire from fashion, I could see myself working with elephants, maybe in Africa.""

Karen Hodson, a nurse at Hammersmith Hospital, worked with the television gardening program Ground Force. ""I was very excited to meet the team, and Alan Titchmarsh, the presenter, was very nice. I enjoyed being outside because I sometimes don’t see daylight due to my shifts. Even though it was hard work, it was fun. I thought I was strong, but I felt weak compared to the rest of the team. My idea of gardening did not include hard physical work or careful planning. I am more enthusiastic than effective at gardening, so I don’t plan to quit my nursing job.""

Charlie Dimmock, a landscape gardener on Ground Force, worked a shift at Hammersmith Hospital. ""I made beds and handed out medicine. I thought I would feel faint doing some tasks, but I surprised myself by managing well. The friendship among the nurses was great, and it felt very different from my usual male environment. I feel my job is less important compared to nursing. My day at the hospital was not pleasant, but it gave me a great sense of satisfaction.""

Lucy Harvey, a personal trainer, spent a day with Ryanair as cabin crew. ""I changed into the uniform, and as soon as I put it on, I felt different—people looked up to me. Before the flight, our supervisor talked about safety and what to do if someone had a heart attack, which I knew from my fitness training. When the passengers boarded the flight to Paris, I handed out magazines. Everyone stared at me, and I felt very self-conscious. On the return flight, we had 80 schoolchildren who wouldn’t sit still. I wished I was back in the gym with one sensible adult to manage them.""

Sonia McDermott, an air hostess with Ryanair, spent a day as a personal trainer in a gym. ""I was nervous about this swap because I don’t exercise. I was surprised by how much attention you give to one person. In my job, I meet 130 passengers four times a day. At lunch, I was surprised to see that some trainers didn’t eat very healthily, but they all drank a lot of water. I wouldn’t change my job for this, but it has inspired me to join a gym and try to be healthier."""

**A. Andrea Thompson - Newsreader**  
I fell in love with the south of France a long time ago and try to visit as often as I can. There is a local train from Cannes that goes along the coast and crosses into Italy. It takes you past some of the most beautiful sea views. No matter the weather or the time of year, it is always magical. Out of the other window, you can see some of the best gardens and homes in France. It feels like you are peeking into the lives of the rich and famous. The passengers are always lively, with a mix of tourists and locals, all enjoying the stunning journey.

**Raj Patel - Explorer**  
I have had many great train journeys, but my favorite is the Nile Valley Express, which travels through the northern Sudan desert. When I was young in South Africa, I missed a family train trip from Cape Town to the Kruger National Park because I was considered too young and troublesome. I was sent to stay with an aunt instead. When I moved to England as a teenager, I still hadn’t traveled by train. London Waterloo was the first real train station I ever saw, and its large glass dome amazed me.

**Betty Cooper - Novelist**  
I am grateful to one train in particular: the Blue Train, which took my husband and me on our honeymoon across France to catch a boat to Egypt. On the train, my husband gave me a pink dress, which I thought was wonderful. Someone said that pink is good for the brain, and I have worn it ever since. What I remember most about the journey is how lovely it was to travel through France and then by boat up the Nile. It was the perfect way to relax after all the wedding planning.

**Martin Brown - Journalist**  
We were working on a series of articles about a round-the-world trip and needed to cross a desert in Africa. There was no road, so we had to take the Desert Express. The schedule was unpredictable; we were just given a day. We heard that the driver would often wait for days to leave if he knew people were still coming. When the train finally arrived, there was a rush of people climbing into and onto the carriages—some even traveled on the roof for free. During the night, the train passed through some of the most beautiful landscapes I have ever seen. It felt like a dream, like traveling across the moon.

**Arisu Mezuki - Actress**  
Most people form their favorite memories of trains when they are young, but that’s not true for me. I grew up in Singapore and Cyprus, where I saw very few trains. It wasn’t until I was a teenager that trains became important in my life. I made a film that featured a railway in Yorkshire. Most of the filming took place on an old, unused part of the line that volunteers had carefully maintained. That’s where my love for steam trains began. When we weren’t filming, we took every chance to ride the train, and when I returned last year, it felt like time had stopped. Everything was still there, even the gas lights on the station platform!"
FCE_8,"Text: 'Are you trying to get published? If you want to know where to send your story, our expert Margaret Stubbs has some helpful advice. Many readers of this magazine ask, ""I have written a story/book. Can you tell me who to send it to?"" One of the first things they need to understand is that they should research their markets and learn about publishers while also improving their writing skills. Turning your writing into something that can be sold requires a good understanding of the publishing world. No matter what type of writing you do, you need to know the markets you are targeting. There are several ways to do this, but the best way is to read as much as you can about relevant topics. Use your local library and visit local bookstores and newsagents. Reading widely will help you understand what kinds of writing publishers are currently accepting. This knowledge needs to be updated regularly because new publications are always appearing—editors change jobs, and magazines change focus. Publishers are always looking for new talent, so as writers, we must give them what they want. 

At first, you might not be sure what you want to write. For example, if you think you would like to write short love stories, the first step is to find out which magazines publish love stories, as this is a limited market today. Get as many recent copies as you can and learn about the types of stories they are buying, paying attention to who their readers are. These readers will have different expectations, and the editor wants to meet their needs. Writers often send me their stories saying, ""This has been rejected three times—am I wasting my time? Do I have a chance?"" As a former teacher, I would never discourage anyone, but it is likely that the work is not yet ready for publication. I try to give honest feedback while remaining positive. The issue is that many new writers are too eager to submit their work, often before they are ready. If you have only written one story or article, it is very unlikely to be published. This almost never happens. When you read about someone’s success, you often find that they have been in the publishing or journalism field for years before achieving that success. 

When you finally send out your work for the first time, start writing more while you wait for a response. Write ten more stories, or even twenty. Each one will be better than the last, and you will start to see yourself as a writer, which will improve both your fluency and confidence. Don’t discard any of your work—focus on improving it instead. I also recommend not sharing your work with others, especially in the early stages. Remember, every successful writer has faced many rejections before succeeding. Do everything you can to advance your writing career. Look for a creative writing course nearby. If you can’t find one, consider joining a local writers' group to gain ideas and confidence from other aspiring writers. Think of yourself as a writer and practice writing every day if possible.'"

On the last day of a difficult year, I was leaning against a pillar in the Baltimore train station, waiting for the 10:10 train to Philadelphia. There were more people waiting than I had expected. The usual clean and bright feeling of the station was gone. Elderly couples with matching luggage filled the benches, and groups of college students had left their bags all over the floor. A grey-haired man was walking around, talking to different strangers one by one. He looked well-off: tanned skin, nice sweater, and a soft beige coat. He approached a woman sitting alone and asked her a question. Then he came over to a girl near me. She had long blond hair, and I thought I wouldn’t mind talking to her. The man asked, ""Are you traveling to Philadelphia?"" 

""Well, northbound, yes,"" she replied. ""But to Philadelphia?"" 

""No, New York, but I'll be..."" 

""Thanks, anyway,"" he said, moving to the next bench. Now he had my full attention. ""Ma'am,"" I heard him ask an old lady, ""are you traveling to Philadelphia?"" When she said, ""Wilmington,"" he just walked on to a couple with matching luggage. I straightened up from my pillar and moved closer, pretending to look at the platform as if I was focused on the train. I was going to Philadelphia. He could have asked me. I understood why he didn’t; he probably thought I looked unreliable. He glanced at me quickly and then went to the other end of the waiting area. He looked stressed now. 

""Please!"" he said to a woman reading a book. ""Tell me you're going to Philadelphia!"" She lowered her book. She looked about thirty or thirty-five—older than me. A schoolteacher type. ""Philadelphia?"" she said. ""Yes, I am."" 

""Then could I ask you a favor?"" I stood a few feet away, pretending to check my left wrist (even though I didn’t own a watch). I could tell she was becoming cautious. The man must have noticed too, because he said, ""Nothing too difficult, I promise!"" They were announcing my train now. People started moving toward Gate E, older couples pulling their wheeled bags behind them like pets on leashes. 

Next, I heard the man talking. ""My daughter is flying out this afternoon for a study year abroad, leaving from Philadelphia. I put her on a train this morning, stopped for groceries afterward, and came home to find my wife upset. She hardly said 'hello' to me. My daughter forgot her passport. She called from the station in Philadelphia; she didn’t know what to do."" The woman nodded sympathetically. I would have stayed quiet and waited to see where he was going with this. 

""So I told her to stay put. Stay right there in the station, I said, and I would get someone to bring her passport."" I thought this was a strange story. Why didn’t he go himself if it was such an emergency? 

""Why don’t you go yourself?"" the woman asked. 

""I can’t leave my wife alone for that long. She’s in a wheelchair."" I thought this was a weak excuse. It seemed like too much bad luck for one family. I looked at them. The man was holding a packet, not a plain envelope, but a padded one the size of a paperback book. Aha! Padded! So you couldn’t feel what was inside! From where I stood, it looked stapled shut too. Watch yourself, lady, I thought silently."

The restaurant owner John Moore talks about his relationship with his son Gary, who is a famous TV chef. He believes everyone has a chance in life. His son Gary had a chance to cook, and John had a chance to run a restaurant. When he learned about the opportunity, he quickly went to see the place. It was in very bad condition, but it was perfect for his plans. Starting this business reminded him of his childhood. He remembers how his mother worked in a factory, and he felt sad being left alone. Because of this, he wanted to make time for family. His wife took care of the children and managed the accounts while he ran the restaurant. They lived above the restaurant and always made sure to have meals together. This has helped their children, Gary and Joe, become very confident. From a young age, they would talk to regular customers, which gave them a good start in life.

Gary was a lively child. When he was about seven, he jumped into a corner bath like it was a swimming pool and knocked himself out. As he grew older, he had to earn pocket money. He started with small jobs, and by age ten, he was working in the kitchen every weekend, so he always had money at school. He was disciplined and would wake up even before his father. In a family business, everyone helps out, and it was nice to see Gary doing his part. Although he wasn't very good at school, he excelled in the kitchen. By age 15, he was as skilled as the adult chefs and sometimes was even in charge. He could prepare over a hundred meals, and John knew Gary would pursue a career in catering because of his talent.

When Gary needed work experience for school, John sent him to a friend who owned a restaurant. Recently, Gary started playing the drums and formed his own band. John wonders what will happen to Gary's cooking if his music career takes off. He advised Gary to focus on one thing at a time, saying, ""If you chase two hares, you catch neither."" He also told Gary that if he wanted to achieve something, he needed to do it by age 30, or it might be too late.

At 17, Gary went to catering college. On his first day, he and the other new students, who were usually beginners, were given a morning's work. But within an hour, Gary had chopped all his vegetables and sliced all his meats. He was helping others by the end of the day. No one can believe how successful Gary's TV cooking show has become, and John is very proud of him. He has always told Gary that if you want something, you must work hard for it because no one gives you anything. Gary has recognized the opportunity he was given and has taken full advantage of it. John knows that as children grow up, they may only remember a small part of what parents say, but he is happy that Gary seems to have listened at times."

Finding a good flat in Dublin at an affordable price was very difficult. The best way to find one was through personal connections: if you knew someone who knew someone leaving a place, that often helped. But if, like Jo, you had just arrived in Dublin, you had no personal contacts to inform you about available rooms. So, Jo had to stay in a hostel and search for a flat. For her, Dublin felt like a big unknown. She felt nervous when she took the train to work there. She didn’t question why she was going; everyone at school expected her to leave. Who would stay in a small town? That’s all she had heard for years. Her friends wanted to escape, experience life, and have a real existence. Some of her classmates had moved to towns like Ennis or Limerick, where family members helped them settle in. But Jo was going to Dublin alone.

Jo's mother thought it would be good for her to stay permanently in the hostel run by nuns, believing she would be safe there. Her father hoped the hostel would be warm, as they were often cold. Jo's sisters, who worked as waitresses in a hotel, thought she was crazy for staying a whole week in a hostel. However, Jo was unaware that they were still thinking about her as she responded to an advertisement for a flat in Ringsend. The ad said, ""Own room, own television, share kitchen, bathroom."" It was very close to her workplace and seemed too good to be true. She hoped it would be nice, that they would like her, and that it wouldn’t be too expensive!

There wasn’t a line for this flat because it was more about finding a ""Third Girl Wanted"" than just a flat to rent. The mention of ""own television"" made Jo wonder if it was too fancy for her, but the house looked ordinary—just a red-brick terraced house with a basement. The flat was upstairs, and a cheerful girl with a college scarf, who looked like a rejected applicant, was coming down the stairs. ""Desperate place,"" she told Jo. ""They're both awful. Common as dirt.""

""Oh,"" Jo replied and continued up the stairs. ""Hello,"" said the girl with ""Nessa"" on her T-shirt. ""Did you see that snobby girl leaving? I can't stand her kind."" 

""What did she do?"" Jo asked. 

""Do? She didn’t have to do anything. She just looked around, made a face, giggled, and said, 'Is this all there is? Oh dear, oh dear,' in a posh accent. We wouldn’t want her here, would we, Pauline?"" 

Pauline, wearing a very colorful shirt, was a punk, which surprised Jo. She had seen punks on O'Connell Street but had never talked to one before. 

""I'm Jo, I work in the post office and I called about the flat,"" she said. Nessa mentioned they were about to have tea. She brought out three mugs; one had ""Nessa,"" one had ""Pauline,"" and the last one had ""Other"" written on it. ""We’ll put your name on a mug if you come to stay,"" she said kindly."
FCE_43,"**Text: Behind the Dolphin's Smile**

People love dolphins. We enjoy watching them in seaside marinas, movies, and TV shows. However, according to the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society, dolphins are in serious trouble. Mark Simmonds reports on the decline of these animals.

Dolphins are special to us. They are among the most intelligent animals, sensitive to human feelings, and they inspire us with dreams of freedom in the ocean. Our affection for dolphins has been supported by television. First, there was Flipper, and now there is Darwin from Seaquest. But these happy images hide the harsh reality of dolphins living in polluted and overfished seas.

The population of North Sea harbour porpoises, a type of dolphin, has decreased by up to 89,000. You might think that such beloved animals would be protected by law and cared for in marine reserves. Unfortunately, this is not true, and the lack of protection could lead to a major wildlife disaster.

There are forty different types of dolphins worldwide. In northern Europe, the most common are the striped dolphin, the common dolphin, the bottlenose dolphin, and the smaller harbour porpoise. The striped and common dolphins usually live far out in the open sea and are often seen in small groups. We know very little about them. Bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises were once frequently seen near European coasts. Bottlenose dolphins are very social and used to be found along the Channel coast and in rivers in Britain, including the Thames. Now, they can only be found in a few places, like the Moray Firth in Scotland and Cardigan Bay in Wales. The few that remain show signs of stress, such as skin injuries.

The complex behavior of dolphins makes it hard to understand why their numbers are decreasing. Overfishing is greatly reducing fish populations and threatening local fishing industries, which also endangers porpoises and dolphins. Porpoises need to find food quickly, and if fish are removed from one area, they may not survive long enough to find food elsewhere. They can also get caught in fishermen's nets, which they cannot see. Many modern fishing methods use large nets that are either left floating or pulled quickly through the water. In recent years, hundreds of dead dolphins have washed up on the beaches of France and Cornwall. Marks and cuts on their bodies show that they often die after being caught in these nets.

Pollution in the sea can also harm dolphins. For example, pesticides can build up in their bodies because they are fat-soluble. Female dolphins produce milk that contains these toxins, which can poison their young. There is already one recorded case of a young dolphin dying from its mother’s contaminated milk.

Another serious threat to dolphins comes from human activity. Dolphins live in groups and rely on sound to understand their environment. Noise pollution from ships and oil drilling travels much better in water than in air, which may disturb dolphins in ways we do not fully understand."
FCE_51,"**Getting Fit**

Exercise is important for your mind, body, and spirit. It helps you stay balanced, especially when life feels chaotic. You might be tired of hearing about fitness, but there are many good reasons to exercise, and very few reasons not to. 

Exercise improves your muscle tone and can quickly change your body shape. It increases muscle strength and helps you maintain good posture, which is how you hold your body when sitting or standing. It also helps prevent muscle imbalances that can lead to injuries. Additionally, exercise can improve specific areas like your thighs, stomach, and upper arms. It benefits your heart, lungs, and blood circulation.

You may have heard these benefits before, but here’s something new: exercise can help reduce feelings of depression and tiredness, and it can improve your sleep. It also helps manage stress and can relieve some medical conditions. 

If you’re not convinced yet, just think about it: exercise is good for you. There are many types of exercise you can try, such as aerobics, jogging, or using weights. However, be careful not to overdo it, as training too hard can lead to injuries. Start slowly, and if you’re unsure, talk to your doctor about what’s best for you.

Good posture is essential for improving your body shape. If you have poor posture, it can make you look and feel less energetic and can lead to minor health issues. To improve your posture, imagine that a helium balloon is pulling the top of your head upward. This can help you lift your chest for better breathing and make your body look slimmer.

Stretching is also important. It increases flexibility and helps you move easily, which can prevent injuries. If you stretch four or five times a week, you will become more flexible and fit. Your exercise routine should include a warm-up, stretching, an energetic workout, and a cool-down period."
FCE_11,"**IN THEIR NATURAL HABITAT**

What keeps filmmakers Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman away from their comfortable homes for months? They are searching for the perfect shot. Among all the animals in the jungles and plains of East Africa, two of the hardest to find are Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman. Currently, they are in the Ngorongoro Crater, which has experienced six months of almost continuous rain, leading to several unexpected problems. Newman explained that they had to buy an expensive piece of equipment so that if one of their vehicles gets stuck in the mud, Amanda can pull him back to safety. Their partnership has produced some of television's best wildlife films, including a well-received film about leopards. While this film about one of Africa's shyest cats was being shown, they were already back in the field, this time tracking the equally shy jackal. 

This is common in television partnerships. Traveling filmmakers have been exploring the world to film exotic wildlife since television began. I spoke to Newman about their partnership while he was having a rare reunion with other people at a safari lodge. ""We do have occasional arguments, but we tend to resolve them quickly,"" he says about working with Amanda. Neither of them sees themselves as the leader, and one reason they get along well is that they both view the animals similarly. ""When we are on the move, we have to set up our tents each night. But this time we are working from a more fixed camp, so we prepare tea the night before and keep it warm in a vacuum flask."" Their daily meals consist of pre-packed food that is heated and served by whoever is available. ""It's not unusual for us to be out for up to eight weeks at a time, so cooking can sometimes be stressful,"" says Newman. 

It can be a tough life, but the advantage of being in such remote areas is that they can get close to the animals and become part of their lives. Newman recalls filming a family of lions, where one lioness would often wander off. When she returned, she would greet all the other lions in the pride, and eventually, she included their vehicle in her greetings. 

Newman first worked with Barrett in 1988 on a film called ""The Great Rift,"" and two years later, they began filming Arctic foxes together. Since then, they have learned to spend four months on location to gather enough material for each half-hour film. Before they can start filming, they must submit a script for approval. ""Amanda and I developed a strong working relationship from the beginning,"" says Newman, ""because it was clear we shared the same ideas and vision. We aim to create a film that captures the atmosphere, brings to life the true spirit of the place and its animals, and touches people's hearts. I believe that evoking an emotional response is much more powerful than just appealing to logic."""
FCE_14,"**The Netball Captain**

In our series about women in sports, Suzie Ellis met England's netball captain, Kendra Slawinski. Kendra is the captain of the England netball team. When I met her, she had just finished a typical day of teaching at a local school, followed by a training session in a supermarket car park. I was surprised by her training location. I asked her, ""Don't you get strange looks?"" She replied, ""I'm so focused on my movements and my feet that I don't notice much else. I might see cars slow down out of the corner of my eye, but that's it.""

Kendra said, ""My whole life now is about being at my best for the Championships."" She follows a strict schedule to achieve maximum fitness. This is her fourth World Championships, and it will be the biggest yet, with 27 nations participating. ""We'll have home support, which is very special,"" she said. ""It's important to improve the reputation of netball in this country. Playing at home means there will be more pressure than usual. The crowd will have expectations and will support us more. People expect us to start the tournament with a strong game.""

Their first match is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. ""As far as I know, we have always beaten them, but they will be exciting to play against. They have a lot of talent."" The England team is currently ranked fourth in the world. However, Kendra notes that the World Championships will be challenging. ""You have to push yourself to play every day; there’s no break between games like in a series. You can still win a series if you lose the first game, but the Championships are different because you only get one chance, and you must be ready to take it.""

In the fifteen years since she started playing at a high level, the sport has become harder and faster. Players are more aggressive on the court. ""You don’t train hard just to lose,"" Kendra says. ""But once the final whistle blows, you become a different person. We are all friendlier after the game.""

Netball is also using a more scientific approach to fitness testing. ""It’s essential that we all think and train like world-class players,"" Kendra explains. As captain, she believes it’s important to have a strong mental attitude and to lead by example. ""I see my role as supporting and encouraging the rest of the team.""

Kendra says, ""From the very beginning, my netball career has been carefully planned."" She decided some time ago that this competition would be her last as a player. She will likely coach young players in the future, but for now, she is focused on her final big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she will probably have tears in her eyes, knowing her loyal supporters are with her every step of the way."

Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends a lot of time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She teaches and researches marine geochemistry, which means she studies the chemical processes in the sea. Rachel is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she is not teaching, she gets into a small steel vehicle designed for underwater exploration and dives three kilometers down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes. 

""Inside,"" she says, ""the space is so small that I can reach out and touch the two pilots. They are used to these conditions, which means we can't stand up or move around, and we must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last for 16 hours: three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours collecting samples of rock and water, and then three hours to return to the surface.""

""If something goes wrong and you need to get to the top quickly, you can press a panic button. The outside drops away, and a small escape vessel is released, which quickly rises to the surface. No one has tested it yet, but I don't think it would be a pleasant journey.""

""I didn't know how I would react the first time I climbed into the vehicle. It was on the deck of a ship, and I got in with an instructor. He explained the emergency procedures, including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack! They were testing how I would react in such a small space."" 

Now Rachel has made six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian crew. ""We went to a site that was a five-day sail west of the Canary Islands in the Atlantic. Here, on the ocean floor, there is a large area of underwater volcanoes, with their chimneys releasing black smoke. It is where the Atlantic Ocean comes alive. The Russian team was dropping off scientific equipment to study the effects of a multi-national program that would create a hole 150 meters through a volcano.""

When she is not at sea, Rachel is in her office at the Oceanography Centre in Southampton. ""Two-thirds of my salary comes from teaching, which I love, but I do it so I can continue my research on the 'black smokers.' This is another name for underwater volcanoes, where water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke. This flows out at a rate of one meter per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees.""

""The only time I was scared was when I first went down with the Americans. We were towing equipment on a 50-meter rope when suddenly there was an explosion. There was a huge bang as the shock waves hit our vehicle, and I thought, 'I'm going to die.' We looked at each other in silence, waiting. When nothing happened, we couldn't believe it. The relief was incredible—we were still alive!""

""Diving to the deepest part of the ocean is such an adventure. Every time I look out of the porthole and see those chimneys, I feel a sense of wonder. Here I am at the bottom of the sea, and no one else on this planet has ever seen them before. I studied the black smokers for three years for my Ph.D. When I got down there and saw them for real, it was an amazing feeling."""
FCE_56,"**Interview Tips**

First impressions are very important. Studies show that people form opinions about us within the first few minutes of meeting. They notice how we dress, our eye contact, our body language, and how fast or slow we speak, as well as our voice tone and the words we use.

Mary Pearce studied to be a teacher. She worked hard to earn her degree and felt confident when she graduated. She applied for a job at a nearby primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher. On the day of the interview, she noticed a small hole in her jacket. She thought about changing but decided it would make her late, and she believed being on time was very important. Unfortunately, Mary did not get the job. A friend who worked at the school told her that the Head Teacher said, ""If someone doesn't take the time to present her best image at an interview, what kind of teacher will she be?""

Simon Grant, a hotel manager, says, ""Interviewees who look like they care about themselves are more likely to care about their jobs. People often think that what’s inside matters most, but in an interview, you should try to present yourself in the best way possible."" However, many people overlook the importance of having a professional appearance.

For example, Janet Goodwood worked for ten years as an administrative assistant in a large accounting firm. When the office manager retired, she applied for the position but did not even get an interview. She thought it was a mistake and asked the Director of Personnel what happened. He told her she did not fit the image of an office manager and suggested she improve her wardrobe before applying again. Janet was shocked because she believed she did a great job and that her appearance should not matter.

Movement and gestures also affect an interviewer's first impression. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian found that only 7% of our message about feelings comes from the words we use, 38% from our voice, and a surprising 55% from our facial expressions. When our facial expressions and words send different messages, the listener will pay more attention to the non-verbal message. Therefore, it is important that your words match your body language. Mixed messages can confuse the interviewer.

It is also important not to seem too desperate for the job or overly eager to please. Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, applied for a promotion and had a great interview, leading to an immediate job offer. She was very happy but reacted with too much enthusiasm. Once her boss sensed her excitement, he offered her a lower salary than she expected. She believes she could have negotiated a better salary if she had controlled her excitement.

Finally, what we say and how we say it can greatly affect the success of an interview. David Artesio, a manager of an employment agency, suggests learning about the company before the interview. For example, the annual report can provide information about the company’s activities. Mentioning an area that interests you during the interview can create a positive impression and show your interest in the company. Business consultant Marian Woodall advises having a few questions ready and avoiding long, confusing sentences. She says, ""Poor communicators talk in paragraphs. Successful communicators use short sentences and highlight key points."""

**The Farmer**  
Matt Froggatt used to work as an insurance agent in London, but now he runs a sheep farm. ""After 14 years in the business, I found that working in the City was no longer exciting; it became a grind - no one was having fun anymore. I had planned to stay for another five or ten years, but then I was made redundant unexpectedly. I didn’t receive a great pay-off, but it was enough to start the farm. My big break came when I met the head chef of a local hotel with one of the top 20 restaurants in the country. By supplying them, my reputation grew, and now I also sell meat through mail order. I’m happy to be out of the office, but it’s surprising how little has changed for me: I still work 80 to 90 hours a week and sell a product.""

**The Painter**  
Ron Able was a manager in advertising, but now he makes a living as an artist. ""I started painting as a hobby, but I found it much more exciting than my job. It made sense to take redundancy and become an artist. The career counselor I spoke to was very helpful. I think I was the first person to tell him, 'I don’t want to go back to my old job.' He was surprised because most people in their mid-forties need to find work quickly for financial reasons. My wife and I married young, and our children no longer need our support. It was a leap into the unknown. We moved to the north of England, where we didn’t know anyone. It meant leaving our friends, but we’ve been lucky; our friendships have survived the distance, and many of them visit us now.""

**The Hat Maker**  
After working for five years as a company lawyer, Katherine Goodison started her own business in her London flat, making hats for private clients. ""My job as a lawyer was enjoyable and well-paid, but the hours were terrible. I realized I didn’t want to become a senior partner, working even more hours, so I left. Many people said I would get bored, but that has never happened. The key is to have deadlines. Since it’s a fashion business, there are always collections and new designs to work on, so I have to keep a strict schedule. I feel happier now and much less stressed. However, I miss the social interaction with colleagues. What I love about this job is that I am completely responsible for the product. If I do a poor job, I am the one who takes the blame. Of course, you care when working for a company, but when your name is on the promotional material, you care even more.""

**The Masseur**  
Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16 years before becoming a masseur at the Life Centre in London. ""I had been in financial markets since I was 22, setting up deals. I enjoyed the excitement, but I never found the work fulfilling. I almost lost my job in 1989, but I left voluntarily and traveled for a year. During that year, I tried to figure out what I wanted to do. I was interested in health, so I visited some of the best gyms in the world and spoke to the owners about how they started. I knew I needed qualifications to change careers, so I took various massage courses. Then I was offered part-time work at the Life Centre. I have no regrets. I used to feel out of control, but now I have peace of mind and control over my future. That is the best part."""
FCE_6,"**Text: 'Dedicated to Their Sports'**

Four young athletes share their experiences.

**A. Darius (Runner)**  
I have always been active in sports. I tried many sports, but I was best at football and athletics. When I was 14, I tried out for a professional football club, but I chose to focus on athletics instead. My biggest achievement was competing for my country in the youth team and winning a medal. Unfortunately, it did not get much media attention, which was disappointing. I hoped to get some sponsorship because training can be expensive. I train at home all winter and then go to Florida for three weeks before the season starts. It’s enjoyable because there are excellent athletics facilities and a lively nightlife. However, I need to be very disciplined. If friends invite me out the night before training, I have to decline. I wish I didn’t have to, but dedication is important in this sport. My main goal is to qualify for the next Olympics—that would be amazing.

**B. Gabriel (Surfer)**  
The surfing community is small, so I often see the same people at competitions. Professional surfers take their sport seriously, and the best waves are usually at dawn, so I have to avoid late-night parties. I don’t mind this too much, but I do enjoy sleeping in, which I often have to give up. However, it is worth it because without this dedication, I might not have won the National Championships last year. After a win, I always celebrate with a big night out, and if I win money, I treat myself to a nice getaway. The sacrifices are worthwhile because winning that championship allowed me to host a surfing series on TV. I guess I’m a bit of a celebrity now.

**C. Dieter (Yacht Racer)**  
When five guys are on a boat together, we have a lot of fun. We are traditional and always celebrate our wins in style. Some say we act a bit childishly when we celebrate, but we don’t seek media attention. Sometimes, reporters seem more interested in our celebrations than in our race results. I spend eight months a year away, so it’s nice to return home and hang out with friends from different backgrounds. You can’t live and breathe the sport all the time—it’s not healthy. I am known in the sailing world, but I can count on one hand how many times I’ve been recognized in public. I wouldn’t want to be a celebrity. I do receive many nice letters from fans asking for signed pictures, and I make sure to reply to each one, even if it takes time.

**D. Tomas (Tennis Player)**  
It feels great to walk onto the court and feel the support of the crowd. At my last tournament, things got a bit hectic with fans crowding around. Still, I enjoy being recognized by fans when I’m out shopping. However, it has its downsides. My last girlfriend didn’t like it when I received too much attention from female fans. Tennis players travel a lot, and that’s part of why we broke up. It was tough, but sacrifices are necessary in any sport; you have to be serious and professional. It doesn’t bother me too much, though. I’m focused on my game now and will catch up on other aspects of life after I retire, which happens relatively early in this sport."

Shopping in supermarkets with children can be very challenging for parents. One mother explains, ""They want everything they see. If it’s not the newest sugary cereal, it’s a Disney video or a comic book. Usually, they want all three. I can’t afford all this, and if I give in to their requests, I feel guilty about buying unhealthy food. I hate saying no all the time, and I get anxious before we even leave the house. I try to avoid taking them shopping, but then I worry that I’m not letting them learn how to make their own choices. It feels impossible.""

Research shows that children ask for something to buy every two minutes when they are in a supermarket. Over £150 million is spent each year on advertising aimed directly at children, mostly on television. This amount is expected to grow, and supermarkets are where this advertising is most effective. Children often do not understand why their parents say they cannot buy certain things, and arguments about the dangers of sugar are not convincing when compared to attractive advertisements.

Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, ""Most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, but these ideas are not always correct. It is important for parents and children to talk about food, because if children only hear about products from TV ads, they get a very one-sided view. Parents feel frustrated because they are competing with the advertising industry and often have to disappoint their children.""

The Independent Television Commission, which controls TV advertising, does not allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy products. However, Dibb points out, ""The main goal of advertising is to persuade people to buy something. So even if they can’t say, 'Tell your mom to buy this,' that is still the effect.""

Shopping with children can be stressful for parents because they have to decide which requests to agree to and which to refuse. One mother says she is patient when discussing food with her children, but she still feels uneasy about how she handles their shopping requests: ""My son pays attention to ads but is critical of them. We talk a lot about different products and look at labels together. I’ve talked about it so much that he thinks all ads are bad. Now, we have very little conflict in the supermarket because the children don’t ask for things I don’t want to buy.""

Parents also admit they can be inconsistent in how they respond to their children’s requests. Mike, a father of a seven-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter, says, ""We refuse to buy him sweets because we say they are bad for him, while we fill our trolley with cream and chocolate for ourselves. It’s nice to buy good things, and it’s normal for children to want to share that. But I still get annoyed by their requests. It depends on my mood. If I’m feeling good, I’m more likely to say yes. It’s hard to be consistent.""

Supermarkets could help reduce conflicts between parents and children by removing sweets from checkout areas or providing supervised play areas. Although parents might spend less if their children are not with them, the idea of shopping without their children’s demands could attract more customers, making up for any loss in sales."
FCE_20,"**Text: Five-Star Luxury and Modern Technology**

The new five-star Merrion Hotel in Dublin combines luxury with the latest technology. It was created after extensive research into what customers want and nearly two years of work converting four large 18th-century houses. This approach allowed for the installation of advanced technology that benefits both staff and guests.

General Manager Peter MacCann expects his staff to know guests by name, but he uses the hotel's computer system to keep track of guests' preferences. This system helps the hotel provide special treatment for returning clients. Although it cost £250,000 to install, MacCann believes it will be worth it over time due to its efficiency. For instance, if a guest requests specific music CDs during their first stay, those same CDs will be ready for them on their next visit, thanks to the guest-history feature.

Room temperature is another common concern for hotel guests. The Merrion has a high-tech system that allows guests to adjust the temperature within three degrees of the normal 18°C. Additionally, the front desk can change the temperature in each room between 14°C and 25°C.

Business travelers are a significant part of the hotel's clientele, making up to 65% of its business. To cater to their needs, the hotel has brought traditional business center services into individual rooms. Each room is equipped with three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that also works as a photocopier and printer, and video-conferencing capabilities.

Technology evolves quickly, so the hotel has prepared for future upgrades by laying extra cables. They rent televisions instead of buying them, allowing for easy replacement with newer models. DVD recorders can also be updated as needed. Despite all this technology, MacCann emphasizes that they want guests to feel comfortable, not overwhelmed. The 145 bedrooms are spacious, well-furnished, and inviting.

The hotel also features a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a lovely garden. As with all luxury hotels, the food must be exceptional. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, who has two Michelin stars, moved his restaurant to the Merrion. This move has allowed him to create a modern kitchen and improve parking facilities. For the hotel, having a renowned restaurant on-site is a great advantage without financial risks. With the help of technology and a skilled staff, the Merrion Hotel is poised for success."

Emma Marsden asked six women who live life fully to share how they find their energy.

A. **Jeanette Kupfermann, Journalist and Author:** ""I think excitement gives me energy. I need to be challenged and learn new things. Right now, I'm learning flamenco dancing, which is very energizing. If I'm bored, I feel drained. Being effective, even in small ways, boosts my energy.""

B. **Linda Kelsey, Magazine Editor:** ""I have a lot of work, but I enjoy it. Work is not a chore for me. When I get enough sleep, I feel great. I know exercise gives me energy, but sometimes it's hard to find the motivation. I do yoga once a week and try to work out at home. After exercising, I feel much better. I often feel low in the afternoon, so I think it's good to have a snack then.""

C. **Annie Nightingale, Disc Jockey:** ""I don't eat perfectly for energy; I think my natural enthusiasm helps. I dislike negative people. I believe we should enjoy life and set goals. I love my job, and the last two years have been exciting. Being around lively young people energizes me. I enjoy taking photos and writing lyrics for fun, which helps me relax while traveling.""

D. **Floella Benjamin, Author and Children's TV Presenter:** ""My energy comes from doing things I love. I believe in my work and being positive. Working with kids is great because they are full of energy. Smiling at others can create a positive feeling. I try to eat healthily and avoid smoking and drinking, but I don't have a strict exercise routine. I get my energy from playing with kids.""

E. **Deborah Moggach, Author and Playwright:** ""I love creating gardens from wasteland. I once turned a concrete area into a garden, which was more energizing than any workout. Knowing that someone wants to read my writing also motivates me. I enjoy exploring nature, even if it means sneaking onto private land.""

F. **Katherine Monblot, Therapist:** ""It's important to have an interest in what you do. I like taking risks and get bored easily, which keeps me motivated. Doing things I don't enjoy drains my energy. I used to be part of many committees, but I found them exhausting. You should focus your energy on what matters most to you."""
FCE_45,"**ICE SKATING**

Ice skating has been around for thousands of years. Archaeologists have found skates made from animal bones, which were used until iron was introduced in Scandinavia around 200 AD. Among the upper classes in Scandinavia, skating was considered an important skill. In the early 1900s, skating was seen as stylish and reserved, but at the 1924 Winter Olympics, 11-year-old Sonja Henie brought a more athletic style that made skating very popular. Today, skating combines art and athletics, making it both graceful and physically challenging.

For beginners, balance and control are very important, and speed comes with practice. The way you position your body is crucial for balance. Keeping your legs slightly bent and your knees relaxed helps you maintain your center of weight, leaning slightly forward. Relaxation is essential in skating, more than in many other sports. 

To start, your heels should almost touch, and your feet should point outward. As you push forward with your back foot, make a small movement with the other foot. If you can keep this up, you can gradually increase the length of your movements as you gain experience. Learning how to fall is one of the first skills a skater should master. Even professional skaters fall sometimes. To fall safely, stay relaxed to reduce the impact when you hit the ice. To get up, use your hands to kneel, then stand up.

Once you feel confident moving on the ice, you can practice different styles, such as figure skating, freestyle, distance skating, speed skating, and pair skating. The best way to start is by learning figure skating and then basic freestyle. Most ice rinks offer guidance, so you can quickly learn the basic moves, and soon you will be able to do turns, jumps, and spins in freestyle.

If you watch skilled skaters, you will notice how relaxed they are and how smoothly they move. To achieve this, it is important to follow a regular exercise program. Skating with a stiff body can be dangerous, so warm-up exercises should focus on your legs, back, shoulders, and especially your ankles and knees. After skating, do the same exercises to prevent stiffness.

Skating helps improve balance, coordination, relaxation, and movement. It also boosts heart and lung health and strengthens the body. When combined with swimming or jogging, it creates an excellent program for overall health and fitness."

If there's one thing that can make you cry with joy, it's seeing a talented child receive a medal. Julia Gregson spoke to three young stars and their mothers about the joys and challenges of their lives.

A. **Annika Reeder, 15**  
Annika won a gold medal in gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games. She wants to be a physiotherapist and compete in the next Olympics. ""Right now, the training is very hard. I don’t have time to watch TV, go out with friends, or do much besides gymnastics and school. I take it one day at a time. When I feel really tired, my coach sometimes gives me a day off, but usually, I keep going. You can’t take too many days off, or you get stiff.""

B. **Annika's Mother**  
""From a young age, Annika showed great talent. I’ve seen some parents push their children, but that doesn’t work. To perform at Annika's level takes a lot of time and energy, and she has to want it herself. People often say we, as parents, have sacrificed a lot, but they don’t see what the sport has given us. We love it and what it has done for Annika. Before gymnastics, she was a shy girl who hid behind me, but now she has met people from all over the world and gained confidence through her success.""

C. **Sarah Stokes, 12**  
Sarah started show-jumping at age ten and has won the British National Championship. ""It’s great that my parents love show-jumping because they train me and take me everywhere in the horse box. The shows can last from one to five days. I never get tired of it—I love the excitement and fun of show-jumping. Even if my parents weren’t involved, I would still do it because I’m determined. I’m happy when they are proud of my wins, but I’m not doing it for them. This year, I want to qualify for the British young riders (under-18) team. My big dream is to win a gold medal at the Olympics.""

D. **Sarah's Mother**  
""From the moment Sarah sat on a horse at age one, I knew she had found her passion. When she was five, she would wake up early to exercise her pony. To qualify for major shows, we travel all over England. To save money, we sleep in the living quarters of our horse box. Sarah is very organized. She is completely happy on a horse and knows what she’s doing. Watching your child succeed at something they love is an amazing feeling.""

E. **Jane McShane, 10**  
Jane is the Under-14 Chess Champion in Britain. ""Tournaments are really friendly. I know everyone, and it’s fun. When I play, I don’t focus as much as I should. I just look around and don’t think too much. I’m not worried about being arrogant; I don’t talk about my success at school because I don’t like feeling embarrassed.""

F. **Jane's Mother**  
""Jane played her first game when she was five. My father said, 'Let’s see if she likes it.' He had tried to teach me when I was young, but I found it boring. Jane loved it from the start. By the end of that day, she had memorized all the moves, and by age six, she was beating adults. Of course, I’m happy when she wins, but if she wanted to stop playing tomorrow, I wouldn’t stop her. I also don’t want to discourage her because she is exceptional. If she has this talent, I want her to reach her full potential."""
FCE_29,"Text: 

It's true - we are all getting taller. Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy after school. The teacher asked, ""What do you want to be? The flagpole on a ship?"" The teacher had a point because Chris, at fourteen, was already almost two metres tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is Britain's tallest man. Every decade, the average height of people in Europe increases by about one centimetre. More and more tall people are being born. Interestingly, this does not mean we are creating a new super race. Instead, we are returning to how we were as cavemen. We are losing the effects of generations of poor diet, which is having a big impact. ""We are only now beginning to reach our true potential,"" says palaeontologist Professor Chris Stringer. ""We are becoming like Cro-Magnons again - the people who lived on this planet 40,000 years ago.""

For most of human history, our ancestors got their food from many sources: women gathered herbs, fruits, and berries, while men hunted animals (a lifestyle still seen in some remaining tribes of hunter-gatherers). One study found that they ate from 85 different wild plants. Then, about 9,000 years ago, agriculture began, which had serious consequences. Most of the planet's green areas have been taken over by farmers, leading to just three carbohydrate-rich plants - wheat, rice, and maize - providing more than half of the calories consumed by humans today. This poor diet has harmed human health and development. Over the centuries, we have eaten soups, porridges, and breads that have left us underfed and underdeveloped. In one study in Ohio, scientists found that when they started growing corn, healthy hunter-gatherers became sickly, underweight farmers. Tooth decay and diseases increased. Some anthropologists argue that corn was not a blessing but a public health disaster.

Despite this, agriculture spread because a piece of farmed land could support ten times more people than those living as hunter-gatherers. The fact that many people relying on this system are poorly nourished has only recently been addressed, even in wealthier nations. Only in Europe, the US, and Japan are diets starting to reflect the variety of our ancestors' diets again. As a result, the average man in the US is now 179 cm tall, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. This is a positive trend, but it comes with its own challenges. Heights may have increased, but the world has not fully adapted. The standard bed length has remained at 190 cm since 1860. Even worse, legroom in planes and trains seems to have decreased, while clothing manufacturers are constantly updating their products. The question is: where will it all end? We cannot keep growing forever. There must be a limit. But what is it? According to Robert Fogel from the University, it could be as high as 193 cm, and we might reach it sometime this century. However, scientists add an important note. While individuals may be growing taller due to better nutrition, as a species, we are actually getting smaller. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, humans were slightly rounder and taller as an adaptation to the cold. (Larger, round bodies are better at keeping heat.) Since the climate warmed, we seem to have become slightly thinner and shorter, even when well-fed. As the planet continues to warm, we may shrink even more. In other words, the growth of humans could be affected by global warming."
FCE_57,"**Text: Studio Audiences**

What is it like to be in the audience when a television show is being made? Cosmo Landesman explored this question. Like technical problems, studio audiences are a common part of television, but many of us find them mysterious. When we see people getting excited on game shows, we often wonder: who are these people?

Studio audiences are often seen as the least important type of audience. Some people in television even look down on them, comparing them to cattle. I used to think that studio audiences were made up of silly people wanting a moment of fame. However, there is no typical studio audience. They come from different backgrounds, jobs, and income levels. Television shows try to attract various types of people for different programs.

Many of us who watch television at home don’t understand why anyone would want to be in a studio audience. Why would someone apply for tickets, travel far, and sit through hours of boredom just to watch what they can see at home? One idea is that people hope to be seen on television. I didn’t believe this until I spoke to Angela, who said, “I came for a chance to be on TV.” Another idea is that people are curious about what happens behind the scenes. But the most common reason I heard was simply, “A friend gave me a ticket.”

Few of us have been in a studio audience, yet we think we know what it’s like. You sit close to strangers while someone holds up signs that say APPLAUD or LAUGH, and you respond accordingly. This may be true for some shows, but not all. As one studio manager said, “We believe a good show doesn’t need these signs.”

Is there a real difference between being in a studio and watching at home? For Claire, being in a studio is “more exciting,” while Charlotte enjoyed feeling involved with live television. “Last year, I saw my favorite comedian. When you watch him at home, you miss a lot.” What I missed was seeing the live actors; I could only see the back of someone’s head. The opening scenes were filmed far from my seat, so I ended up watching the show on a studio monitor.

Going to a studio may not be the best way to watch television, but that’s not what matters. For most of the audience, it was simply fun and a free night of entertainment."

**Favorite Places**

**Bruce**  
I don’t like wild landscapes that are untouched by people. I find the human element important. This is also true when I travel abroad. I am attracted to charming villages with old temples, not empty deserts. When I was eight, I went to school in England, and on Saturdays, I would ride my bike to the village of Lastingham in its beautiful valley. Cycling was a way to escape from school. I loved exploring the bare hilltops, the sheltered valleys, and old villages. Coming from Scotland, I found the landscape both familiar and different, and I still visit there today. I used to write about my adventures in my private diary. In a way, that was my first attempt at travel writing, which later became my career.

**Sophia**  
There is a small railway that runs from Hythe to Dungeness, operated by volunteers. I always travel first class because it doesn’t cost much more than the regular ticket. The scenery is not amazing. The train goes across Romney Marsh with its sheep and next to a canal. But there is one part of the journey I always look forward to - when our small train goes through back gardens. For a few moments, we passengers see people in their homes, making tea, washing dishes, or setting up a deckchair. I see myself in their eyes, a woman in a tiny train carriage, looking into other people’s lives. It’s the everyday nature of the landscape that attracts me. Just fields, sheep, and a distant grey sea. This makes me look more closely, searching for something that opens my eyes.

**Matthew**  
The Hartland Peninsula is a beautiful and remote coast. The beaches are hard to reach and filled with rocks, so there are not many people here. A few brave surfers come, but most visitors prefer to enjoy the beauty of the sea. The coast faces the Atlantic and is known for shipwrecks. There are walking paths along the coast that you can combine with trips into lovely damp valleys filled with oak trees, ferns, and wildflowers. We stay in simple self-catering accommodation with a family who owns property in the village of Southole.

**Annette**  
My favorite place in England is the Trough of Bowland, a wide-open moorland that is perfect for hiking. There are not many people living there and not many visitors either. It’s a quiet and remote area, and I like the feeling of space. I found this place by chance when I was a student, and since then, I have visited every year, either alone, with my boyfriend, or now with my son. It has changed little since my first visit. Having a child makes these visits more special. It makes me sad that he is growing up in a city.

**James**  
I bought Glenthorne, my favorite house in Britain. It was about finding peace and reconnecting with my English roots. I grew up in what is now Sri Lanka, but at twelve, I went to school in Devon, in the west of England. I used to ride my bike around the moors and village streets. There was a story about a place we would never cycle past: if you went down the driveway, you would never return. That place was Glenthorne. It is the place of my dreams. It is a magical, secluded, romantic house. You can only hear the sea, the wind, and the birds."
FCE_42,"**HAPPY HUNTING GROUND**

We are 'animal people' who love being around all kinds of creatures. One afternoon, my daughter called me at work to tell me she had found a beautiful pine snake. ""Can we keep him?"" she asked excitedly. I agreed, but only for one night. We had prepared a special tank for such visitors, allowing us to admire them and look them up in our natural history book.

I got home late and quickly put a pot on to boil when I heard my sons screaming, ""Oh, Mother! Help! Do something!"" I rushed to their bedroom. The chaos involved Domino the cat and Bianca, the white mouse I had received as a Mother's Day gift. Domino was running around with the mouse in his mouth, trying to escape while avoiding the flailing arms of the children.

In the midst of the confusion, I tripped and fell. As I considered how to stop Domino, I noticed the snake had escaped. It was slithering off the table and onto the floor. I crouched down as the snake moved closer, while the kids and the cat were jumping around in a wild, noisy mess. The dog was barking loudly, and the pot in the kitchen boiled over.

I quickly turned off the gas and returned to the chaos with renewed energy. I managed to grab Domino by the tail and rescued the small, wet, and surprisingly unharmed mouse from his jaws. Interestingly, that same mouse was caught by Domino three more times in its life but eventually died of old age.

Feeling encouraged by my success with the cat, I examined the snake for any weak spots, but it had none. I ended up sitting on the floor like a snake-charmer, rocking back and forth, but without a flute. Gradually, the snake relaxed and rested its head on its body, though its eyes still looked suspicious. 

I slowly slid my hands under the snake and lifted it to a kneeling position, then stood up and walked to the end of the garden. I pointed the snake towards a tree, hoping it would find a good place to live. When I finally let go of its head, expecting it to bite me, it instead slid over my shoulders like a colorful shawl, seeming to settle in for the winter.

As dusk fell, my four children, the snake, and I stood together. DJ, my oldest, broke the silence with a scientific observation: ""You know what it is, Mum? You're nice and warm, and the shed isn't."" I had the children gather at the snake's tail and gently encourage it to move on. Slowly, it did, climbing up the wall and disappearing over the roof. As the last bit of its tail vanished, three-year-old Clay sighed and said what we were all thinking: ""Boy, that was one big snake!"""

However, receiving a letter brings a unique joy that no other form of communication can match. There is excitement when a letter arrives, pleasure in seeing who it is from, and enjoyment in reading its contents. Letter writing has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. It probably started with the little notes I wrote to my mother. She always made sure I wrote my own thank-you letters for Christmas and birthday gifts. It didn’t matter how short or messy they were, as long as they were letters. When I left home at 18 to train as a doctor in London, I wrote to my parents once a week, and they wrote back. Occasionally, my father would write, and his long, funny letters were always a joy to receive. Most letters from home shared everyday events about my parents and their friends. We also made phone calls, but it is the letters I remember most. I also received letters from my boyfriends. In my youth, I often attracted people who had to work or study away, and we kept in touch through letters. Instead of harming our relationships, letter writing seemed to strengthen them. I found it easier to express myself in writing than in conversation. I love the letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. Notes are nice, but having a year’s worth of news is even better! It’s even more exciting when it comes in an airmail envelope with beautiful stamps. I receive letters from Mangala in Sri Lanka, from someone I trained with over 20 years ago, and I have penfriends in Australia and Vancouver. There’s also a lady who writes to me from France. If we hadn’t started talking in a restaurant on the way home from a holiday, if my husband hadn’t taken her photo, and if I hadn’t asked for her address, I would never have been able to write to her. More importantly, if she hadn’t replied, we would have missed out on a wonderful friendship. Now, we have regular correspondence. I can improve my French (she speaks no English); we have stayed at her home twice, and she has stayed with us. My biggest letter-writing success came this summer when my family and I visited my American penfriend in Texas. We had been writing to each other for 29 years but had never met. Everyone was surprised that a friendship could last so long. The local press even thought it was newsworthy enough to report on the front page. I am happy that my children are continuing this tradition. Like my mother, I make sure they write their own thank-you letters. My daughter writes me little letters, just as I did to my mother. She and my son have penfriends in Texas, organized by my penfriend. I strongly encourage readers not to let letter writing become a 'lost art'.'"

**Careless Tourists Damage Ancient Rock Art**

Many ancient pictures carved into the rocks at one of France's most important tourist sites are being slowly destroyed. Scientists worry that the 36,000 drawings on rocks in Mont Bego in the French Alps are being damaged so quickly that they may not last for future generations. The mountain is thought to have been a place for prayer and worship, and it has drawings that are about 4,000 years old. These include images of cows, fields, and various gods and goddesses. However, as more people visit the site, the pictures are being harmed by careless graffiti.

Jean Clottes, the chairman of the International Committee on Rock Art, says, ""People think that because the pictures have been there for so long, they will always be there. But if the damage continues at this rate, there will be nothing left in 50 years."" He has seen tourists stepping on the drawings, which wears away the rock and damages the artwork. Some visitors even take pieces of the rock home as souvenirs. ""When people can't take a good photograph, they rub the drawings to make them clearer,"" he explains. ""The drawings are already polished by the weather, and if the sun is shining and visitors can't see them well, they rub and scrape them to make them look fresher.""

Other researchers have noticed that some people come with long sticks to scratch their own drawings or names into the rocks. Experts disagree on the best way to protect the drawings. Henry de Lumley, director of the Museum of Natural History in Paris, believes the only way to save the site is to make the whole mountain a ""no-go"" area, allowing the public to visit only on guided tours. He warns that if this is not done, the site will be completely destroyed, and important research will be lost.

Clottes disagrees with de Lumley's strict plan. He says, ""While it is the most effective, it will also cause protests from local residents."" He adds that the site was declared a historic monument by the Ministry of Culture, and we must do everything possible to protect it.

David Lavergne, the regional architect, also wants to keep the site open. He says, ""De Lumley's idea isn't ideal. Our department believes the best solution is to let people visit, but the area is so large that it is hard to stop visitors from causing damage. I would prefer that everyone could see it, but the main problem is money. We do not have enough funds to hire enough guards. We may need to consider charging a fee, as there seems to be no chance of government funding.""

In Nice, Annie Echassoux, who has also researched the site, is worried that as the mountain becomes easier to reach—tourists can now avoid the long walk by hiring vehicles—the damage will increase quickly. She believes the only solution is to block off the area and provide guides. ""You can't say the plan can't go ahead because there is no money,"" she says. ""That is not good enough. Money must be provided because the Ministry of Culture has classified this area as a historic site. If we don't take action, we will be responsible for losing the drawings for future generations."""
FCE_32,"**Text: Young Shoppers**

Shopping in supermarkets with children can be very challenging for parents. One mother explains, ""They want everything they see. If it’s not the latest sugary cereal, it’s a Disney video or a comic. Usually, they want all three. I can’t afford all this, and if I give in to their requests, I feel guilty for buying unhealthy food. I hate saying no all the time, and I get anxious before we even leave home. I try to avoid taking them shopping, but then I worry that I’m not letting them learn to make their own choices. It feels impossible.""

Research shows that children ask for something to buy every two minutes when they are in a supermarket. Over £150 million is spent each year on advertising aimed directly at children, mostly on television. This amount is expected to grow, and supermarkets are where this advertising is most effective. Children often do not understand why their parents say no to certain things, and arguments about the dangers of sugar are not convincing when compared to attractive ads.

Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, ""Most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, but these ideas are not always correct. It’s good for parents and children to talk about food, because if children only hear about products from TV ads, they get a very one-sided view. Parents feel frustrated because they are competing with the advertising industry and often have to disappoint their children.""

The Independent Television Commission, which controls TV advertising, does not allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy products. However, Dibb notes, ""The main goal of advertising is to persuade people to buy something. So even if they can’t say, 'Tell your mom to buy this,' that is still the effect.""

Shopping with children can be stressful for parents because they have to decide which requests to accept and which to refuse. One mother says she is patient when discussing food with her children, but she feels unhappy about how she handles their shopping requests: ""My son notices ads but is critical of them. We talk a lot about different products and look at labels together. I’ve talked about it so much that he thinks all ads are bad. Now, we have very little conflict in the supermarket because the children don’t ask for things I don’t want to buy.""

Parents also admit they are sometimes inconsistent in how they respond to their children’s requests. Mike, a father of a seven-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter, says, ""We refuse to buy sweets for him because they are unhealthy, but we buy double cream and chocolate for ourselves. It’s nice to buy treats, and it’s normal for children to want to share that. But I still get annoyed by their requests. It depends on my mood. If I’m feeling good, I’m more likely to say yes. It’s hard to be consistent.""

Supermarkets could help reduce conflicts between parents and children by removing sweets from checkout areas or providing supervised play areas. Although parents might spend less if their children are not with them, the idea of shopping without their children’s demands could attract more customers, making up for any loss in sales."
FCE_65,"**Text: Climbing Walls**

In the past, climbers went to the mountains to climb. Now, people can enjoy climbing in many places, both indoors and outdoors. The audience watches closely as the French climber Francois Lombard hangs upside down by just two fingers on a climbing wall. He is competing in the World Cup Climbing Championships at Birmingham's National Indoor Arena. This arena is better known for the TV show Gladiators, but both events have one thing in common: The Wall. The ability to hold these events is thanks to new and quickly advancing technology.

Before the mid-1960s, climbers practiced on natural cliffs where there were good climbing spots. In winter, they had to deal with cold weather, go for walks, or climb on snow and ice in Scotland. As the sport grew, it became important for climbers to stay fit. Since they could not use cliffs for much of the year, they started to train on brick edges or stone buildings. This helped them keep their fingers strong and avoid boredom from not climbing.

Soon, many sports centers began to build climbing walls specifically for training, using bricks with special edges. One of the first climbing walls was created by Don Robinson, a physical education teacher, in a corridor at Leeds University in the mid-1960s. He came up with the idea of placing natural rock in concrete blocks to create climbing walls. Throughout the 1970s, many similar walls were built in sports halls, but they had some design issues. These walls could only be vertical, while real cliffs have features like overhangs and slanted rocks. Once built, the walls could not be changed, and climbers would eventually get bored with the same routes.

In 1985, a Frenchman named Francois Savigny invented a material that could be shaped like the holds found on cliffs. These holds could be attached to any wall and removed when climbers wanted a change. French manufacturers also started to create panels on steel frames. Concrete was too heavy for making overhanging walls without major construction, but steel frames could be built anywhere as free-standing structures. This system of interchangeable holds provided climbers with endless new challenges."
FCE_61,"Text: 'So you want to be an actor? If you tell someone that you want to pursue a career in acting, they will likely mention that it is a risky choice. Acting is indeed a risky profession because there are many more actors than there are roles available. When you decide to become an actor, some people you thought were your close friends may think you are making a mistake, while others may support you. Everyone will have different advice to give you. Ultimately, this is a personal decision, and you are responsible for your own path and for achieving your goals. There are no easy shortcuts to success—there are no exams to pass, and no guarantee that after your training, you will find work in the field. Success often depends on a mix of luck and talent. However, there is always a need for new faces and talent, and acting can bring excitement, glamour, and sometimes financial rewards.

Many people ask what talent really is. I believe talent is a combination of natural ability and imagination, with imagination being the hardest quality to measure. It also involves a person's courage and their belief in what they are doing. Where does the desire to act come from? It can be hard to explain why you want to act. In theatre, the important moment is the connection between the actor and the audience. This connection is what motivates all actors. If you ask successful actors how they achieved their success, they might just shrug. They may understand some things about their skills and techniques, but they do not take anything for granted. They know they are only as good as their last job, and their fame can be temporary. 

Disappointment is a major challenge for actors. Last month, you might have been unemployed, working in retail or as a waitress. Then, you might get a chance to audition for a role, but even if you really want the job, it may not be offered to you. Because of this, actors often avoid discussing their chances of success. They find ways to cope with the stress of competing for roles and the fear of rejection. No one enjoys being rejected. Remember, the possibility of rejection exists from the moment you start auditioning professionally. You are saying that you are available, willing, and hopefully talented enough for the job. In many ways, your success depends on your commitment; if you don’t care enough, others may not care about you either.'"

It's true - we are all getting taller. Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy after school. The teacher asked, ""What do you want to be? The flagpole on a ship?"" The teacher had a point because Chris, at fourteen, was already almost two metres tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is Britain's tallest man. Every decade, the average height of people in Europe increases by about one centimetre. More and more tall people are being born. Interestingly, this does not mean we are creating a new super race. Instead, we are returning to how we were as cavemen. We are losing the effects of generations of poor diet, which is having a big impact. ""We are only now beginning to reach our true potential,"" says palaeontologist Professor Chris Stringer. ""We are becoming like Cro-Magnons again - the people who lived on this planet 40,000 years ago.""

For most of human history, our ancestors got their food from many sources: women gathered herbs, fruits, and berries, while men hunted animals (a lifestyle still seen in some remaining tribes of hunter-gatherers). One study found that they ate from 85 different wild plants. Then, about 9,000 years ago, agriculture began, which had serious consequences. Most of the planet's green areas have been taken over by farmers, leading to just three carbohydrate-rich plants - wheat, rice, and maize - providing more than half of the calories consumed by humans today. This poor diet has harmed human health and development. Over the centuries, we have eaten soups, porridges, and breads that have left us underfed and underdeveloped. In one study in Ohio, scientists found that when they started to grow corn, healthy hunter-gatherers became sickly, underweight farmers. Tooth decay and diseases increased. Some anthropologists argue that corn was not a blessing but a public health disaster.

Despite this, agriculture spread because a piece of farmed land could support ten times more people than those living as hunter-gatherers. The fact that many people relying on this system are poorly nourished has only recently been addressed, even in wealthier nations. Only in Europe, the US, and Japan are diets starting to reflect the variety of our ancestors' diets again. As a result, the average man in the US is now 179 cm tall, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. This is a positive trend, but it comes with its own challenges. Heights may have increased, but the world has not fully adapted. The standard bed length has remained at 190 cm since 1860. Even worse, legroom in planes and trains seems to have decreased, while clothing manufacturers are constantly updating their products. The question is: where will it all end? We cannot keep growing forever. There must be a limit. But what is it? According to Robert Fogel from the University, it could be as much as 193 cm, and we might reach it this century. However, scientists add an important note. While individuals may be growing taller due to better nutrition, as a species, we are actually getting smaller. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, humans were slightly rounder and taller as an adaptation to the cold. Since the climate warmed, we seem to have become slightly thinner and shorter, even when well-fed. As the planet continues to warm, we may shrink even more. In other words, the growth of humans could be affected by global warming."

**The Farmer**  
Matt Froggatt used to work as an insurance agent in London, but now he runs a sheep farm. ""After 14 years in the business, I found that working in the City was no longer exciting; it became a grind. I had not planned to leave for another five or ten years, but I was made redundant unexpectedly. I didn’t receive a great pay-off, but it was enough to start the farm. My big break came when I met the head chef of a local hotel with one of the best restaurants in the country. By supplying them, my reputation grew, and now I also sell meat through mail order. I’m happy to be out of the office, but it’s surprising how little has changed for me: I still work 80 to 90 hours a week and sell a product.""

**The Painter**  
Ron Able was a manager in advertising, but now he makes a living as an artist. ""I started painting as a hobby, but I found it much more exciting than my job. It made sense to take redundancy and become an artist. The career counselor I spoke to was very supportive. I think I was the first person to tell him, 'I don’t want to go back to my old job.' He was surprised because most people in their mid-forties need to find work quickly for financial reasons. My wife and I married young, and our children no longer need our support. It was a leap into the unknown. We moved to the north of England, where we didn’t know anyone. We left our friends behind, but we’ve been lucky; many of them visit us now.""

**The Hat Maker**  
Katherine Goodison worked as a company lawyer for five years before starting her own hat-making business in her London flat. ""My job as a lawyer was enjoyable and well-paid, but the hours were terrible. I realized I didn’t want to become a senior partner, working even longer hours, so I left. Many people said I would get bored, but that has never happened. The key is to have deadlines. Since it’s a fashion business, there are always collections and new designs to work on, so I have to keep a strict schedule. I feel happier now and less stressed. However, I miss the social interaction with colleagues. What I love about this job is that I am fully responsible for the product. If I do a poor job, I am the one to blame. Of course, I cared when I worked for a company, but when my name is on the promotional material, I care even more.""

**The Masseur**  
Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16 years before becoming a masseur at the Life Centre in London. ""I had been in financial markets since I was 22, making deals. I enjoyed the excitement, but I never found the work fulfilling. I almost lost my job in 1989, but I chose to resign and travel for a year. During that year, I tried to figure out what I wanted to do. I was interested in health, so I visited some of the best gyms and spoke to the owners about how they started. I knew I needed qualifications to change careers, so I took various massage courses. Then I was offered part-time work at the Life Centre. I have no regrets. I used to feel out of control, but now I have peace of mind and control over my future. That is the best part."""
FCE_5,"**Text: A Winning Game**

Two brothers have discovered that their childhood game is great for business. Dave and Norm Lagasse, two bearded brothers in their forties, are sitting in their simple home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA, and enjoying their childhood memories. In front of them is a wooden board with round plastic pieces. They are playing the old game of pichenotte, which they believe is unique. Their grandfather, Lucien Rajotte, a grocer from Quebec, Canada, brought the game to the USA and taught it to his family. Soon, every weekend and holiday, the family played the game and, as Dave says, ""had the best time ever."" Eventually, the family moved to New Mexico, but they continued to play with Grandpa's pichenotte board, which he had made from old wooden crates. Visitors were often intrigued because the game was unknown in the southern USA.

Three years ago, Dave noticed how worn out the pichenotte board had become and decided to make a new one. It turned out beautifully. A relative saw it and wanted one, and then a friend wanted another. Curious about the interest, the brothers took one of Dave's new boards to a sports bar in Santa Fe. ""People started to watch,"" says Dave, ""and said, 'No way I'm playing that silly game.' But then they'd sit down, and soon you couldn't get them up from the table!"" When people asked about the game's origins, Dave researched it. He found that the roots of the game likely come from India, where a similar game called 'carroms' exists. This was adapted into a game called 'squails' played in British pubs, and British immigrants brought it to Canada. Pichenotte is the French-Canadian version that developed in Quebec.

Pichenotte can be played by two to four people and is a game of skill. Each player has 12 pieces or 'pucks' that are 'flicked' across a wheel-like board using one hand. Flicking a puck into a small hole is worth 20 points, while three rings around the hole are worth 15, 10, and 5 points, respectively. There are also eight small posts that act as obstacles. The game usually lasts about two minutes.

Seeing how popular the game was at the Santa Fe bar, the Lagasses made more boards and took them to markets and craft fairs. Crowds gathered, money was exchanged, and the game's popularity grew. Championships began, and a trophy called the 'Lord Pichenotte Cup' was created. As word spread, the boards sold quickly, and the brothers decided to start a pichenotte business full-time. They set up a workshop in their garage and began making boards. To date, they have produced over 450 boards, made of birchwood and mahogany, each weighing 12 kg and 1 cm thick. Norm explains, ""They're very durable, as they have to withstand a lot of use."" They are available for $595 each on the brothers' website.

Currently, there are no professional pichenotte players or TV coverage to create pichenotte stars. However, the day may come when the brothers' garage will be home to a luxury car instead of tools and wood. Until then, they are happy to spend their free time playing the game they hope will bring them success."
FCE_41,"**WELCOME TO THE MODEL VILLAGE**

When you first enter the Model Village, it is hard to believe that just a few years ago, this area was a piece of waste ground, flat and covered in brambles. For many years, it was seen as useless land. However, the careful planning and hard work of one man, with the support of his wife, transformed this land into the beautiful place you see today. 

During the construction of the village, many thousands of tons of soil and clay were moved to change the flat area into the sculpted landscape you see now. Although bulldozers and digging machines helped, a lot of hard manual work was also involved. Once the land was shaped, about 1,000 tonnes of topsoil were brought in to create the lawns, flower beds, and rockeries. 

In building the Model Village, hundreds of trees and shrubs were planted. These plants had to be carefully chosen for the area. Only those that could survive the salty air near the sea were used, and they also needed to withstand strong winter winds. Most plants came from local garden centers, but some were imported from as far away as Canada and New Zealand. 

The entire village was designed by Colin Sims, who made over 100 models by hand over nine years after the village opened in 1972. The models are made from various materials—stone, concrete, specially treated wood, and plastics—to endure all types of weather. At first, Colin needed help from experts to learn how different materials would last through changing weather, but he quickly became an expert himself. 

You will notice that a consistent scale has been followed, and great attention has been given to even the smallest details of the models. This was achieved through patience and the development of unique building techniques. The Model Village has become a popular attraction, known for its high quality and maintenance. The methods used to create these realistic models have been adopted in other model villages across England and have even been included in some college courses on modeling. 

All the buildings you will see in the village represent traditional British architectural styles and are not based on any specific place or structure. One of the most impressive buildings is the Manor House, a typical 13th-century stone structure with a brick tower and stone walls, inspired by manor houses found in the West Country. As you walk around the village, you will also see the Castle, St Mary's Church, a zoo, and a mini golf course, which is the newest addition to the village. 

We ask you to stay on the paths during your visit and not to touch any of the models; a small mistake can lead to hours of repair work for us. Photography is allowed only from the pathways. Dogs are welcome on a short lead. 

To enhance your experience at the Model Village, you will find buttons in front of some working models. Pressing these buttons will make the models operate. At the end of your visit, we welcome any comments you may have. We are always planning new models, and your ideas can help us create a more varied and interesting display. We would also like to know if there are any models that you think do not meet the high standards of the rest of the village. We are constantly replacing and updating the models, and we need your feedback on which ones need attention. 

We hope you enjoy your visit and look forward to seeing you again. Don't forget to tell your friends about it!"
FCE_69,"Text: 'Every week, British tabloid newspapers publish pictures that invade people's privacy and violate the editors' code of practice. While pop stars sometimes pose for paparazzi, this is not common. More often, serious harm is done to public figures when their private moments are shown on the front page. However, very few people contact the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), which was created to address these issues. Rarely are these pictures in the public interest. Do private photos of pop stars help solve crimes? How did a picture of a famous actress on a hotel balcony protect public health and safety? The actress has complained about long-lens photos before, and since she was in a hotel—a place where, according to the code of practice, 'there is a reasonable expectation of privacy'—she had a valid reason to complain, but she did not take action. It is a scandal that the PCC did not start an investigation. It should also look into the shocking story recently published about a pop star's love life. Like the actress, the pop star has not made a formal complaint. Shouldn't the PCC take the lead on this and other disgraceful attacks? 

This seems like a good idea. It could lead to many decisions against newspapers, which would be reported by their competitors and shown on TV and radio. The public would not support such actions, and editors would have to stop publishing this kind of material. Photographers would also be affected, as they would no longer be able to afford to hide behind trees waiting to take pictures of unsuspecting celebrities. If the PCC decided to act as a 'police officer', which it technically could, there would be several challenges. How would it decide whether to start an inquiry? Should it contact the victim and encourage them to complain? And if the person still refused to act, should it proceed anyway? Additionally, celebrities and royals might expect that any story about them would be investigated, and then be upset if it wasn't. 

Moreover, the role itself is too large. How could the PCC realistically monitor all of the British press: national, regional, and magazines? There is also the issue of embarrassment to consider. No matter how much someone's privacy has been violated, would they really want the added embarrassment of an investigation? I believe most people just want to move on with their lives. Of course, some may have other reasons for staying quiet. A worse story might exist that they have kept from the press, and they know that this could also become public if they complain. In other words, even the PCC might become a problem. 

One British comedian faced issues with the press when he and his wife were secretly photographed on their honeymoon in the Caribbean. He did not complain then, nor did he when he and his family were photographed again during a holiday. His reason was fear that the newspaper, News of the World, would publish the pictures again with a new story about his 'anger', claiming they thought it was just a joke, and that, as a film star who makes comedies, he would have a sense of humor. This fear is understandable. People believe they will become targets again if they challenge the tabloids. It is difficult to find an easy solution to this serious problem.'"

FCE_17,"**Text: 'What is the Secret of Confident People?'**

Confident people may seem like they were born that way, but most will say it is a skill they learned because they needed to. Nina Hathway asks five people how they became confident.

**A. Jenny**  
When I left school, I was very shy and thought I would always be that way. At about twenty-five, I was asked to help at my daughter's school. I was sure I wouldn't manage, but I surprised myself by doing well. Someone there suggested I take a university course. On the day of my first lecture, I felt very nervous. However, my confidence grew over time, and I became more outgoing. Looking back, working at the school was a turning point in my life that helped everything else fall into place.

**B. Michaela**  
My journey began four years ago when my father became ill, and I had to take over the family business. I was scared and became a bit too aggressive and impatient, thinking that was what confident people were like. Gradually, I learned that to be confident, you must believe in yourself. If work becomes too demanding, I don’t feel guilty about saving some tasks for the next day. When faced with something difficult, I remind myself that I have nothing to lose. Fear can make you feel less confident, so I often have quiet talks with myself to set aside those fears.

**C. Lisa**  
People think I am very confident, but the calmer I appear, the more scared I actually am. I had to learn to look confident because it is essential in TV. Interviewing people has shown me that most of us feel tense in important situations, and we feel calmer when we talk to someone friendly. The best advice I received was from my mother when I was worried about my clothes as a teenager. She said, 'Who is looking at you? Everyone is too busy worrying about how they look.' I remember this often. I also believe you gain confidence by facing your fears. When I took my driving test, I was very nervous, but I passed. After that, I felt sure I would never be that scared again, and I haven't been.

**D. Barbara**  
My confidence comes naturally from enjoying my work, but I have built it up over the years. If you keep working and learn from your mistakes, you will feel more confident next time. I work hard and am popular in the restaurant, but I know that one out of ten people may not like me. I don’t let that bother me. You must like yourself for who you are, not try to be what others expect. My company offers many training courses, and attending those has improved my self-esteem. The company also encourages us to set realistic goals. It helps a lot to see that you are achieving something, rather than trying to do everything at once and ending up with nothing.

**E. Kim**  
After college, I worked for years as a secretary and would sit in meetings, often disagreeing but too scared to speak up. Eventually, I found the confidence to share my thoughts. When I first worked in politics, I had never spoken in public and would shake with nerves. I told myself, 'Don’t be silly. People do this every day, so you can too.' I also found it helpful to write down a few points to refer to, like having a comfort blanket! I believe everyone feels a bit nervous when speaking in public. The real secret to confidence is telling yourself repeatedly, 'Nothing is impossible.'"

Paul Forster attends a kite-flying festival and spends a nervous night in the forest. Adnan Ali smiled widely when I gave him his torn kite. ""You should keep it,"" he said, ""it's traditional - if the line breaks, finders keepers... and I have many more."" He pointed to a pile of beautifully decorated kites at his feet. All were exactly 120 cm wide and long, made of tissue paper and split bamboo. We sat down in the shade of the whispering conifer trees behind the Beach of the Seven Lagoons in Kelantan, looking out at Malaysia's largest kite festival. 

In the center of the beach, there were 10 platforms where helpers held up the kites, and a line of tense competitors waited for the countdown. When the whistle blew, the crowd cheered, and the kites soared into the sky like rockets. More than 500 men and boys had signed up for the competition, which lasts for five days each year. Each participant entered four different designs, judged on decoration, stability in the air, and flying efficiency. 

""Flying kites isn't too hard,"" Adnan said, ""but making them requires real skill. Come visit me at home, and I'll show you how."" This was one of five invitations I received that day, and I decided to accept. At his house, I drank cold milky tea and ate fish crackers in a large, polished room. As night fell, he invited me to return the next day to start rebuilding his kite, but I couldn't. Instead, I explored the southern part of the state, driving towards Kuala Lumpur, through granite mountains covered in lush rainforest. 

I took a wrong turn, and the smooth road ended at a river. A small boat was waiting to take people across. Nearby, a sign caught my attention. It pointed up a footpath into the forest and read: ""Jelawang Jungle 3 km."" Before starting, it would have been helpful to know that most of this distance was steep and slippery. When I reached the track, I found a man named Baba waiting with a flask of tea. He managed a tented kitchen and several bamboo huts. I decided to stay there, trying not to think about the insects crawling under my thin foam mattress. 

The night was completely dark, filled with various sounds. A nearby waterfall roared, and many creatures moved and squeaked. In the morning, I enjoyed a stunning view over five ranges of green mountains. In the afternoon, it rained. First, the wind blew, then lightning struck the treetops. Moments later, I was soaked. Sliding downhill, I wondered how the giant butterflies avoided the heavy raindrops. I also worried about my car being washed away (it sometimes happens) and the risk of drowning if I opened my mouth. Luckily, my car was still there, covered in mud, at the bottom of the track. 

No one stays a stranger for long here. Back in Kota Bahru, the capital of Kelantan, everyone asked me questions: ""Where are you from?"" ""How old are you?"" But their curiosity was friendly. While Kelantan is famous for its kites, I remember it more for the kindness of its people."

I don’t often spend money on myself, so when I do, I feel guilty and usually tell my husband I spent less than I really did. The real price always seems shocking.

C. Juliet, 28, personnel manager: I only shop for essentials. I dislike shopping and only go when I have to. When I do, I know exactly what I want and won’t settle for anything else. I find shopping tiring and would rather be doing something else.

D. Anita, 35, TV producer: I like to look around sometimes, but I usually know what I want and where to find it. I don’t waste time and try to get in and out quickly. However, I do have some items in my wardrobe that I regret buying, so maybe I’m a careful shopper who sometimes makes mistakes!

E. Lizzie, 41, secretary: I really dislike shopping. I find it hard to find clothes I like or anyone to help me. The shops are too noisy and messy, which makes it a nightmare for me. Luckily, I don’t have to shop for clothes often because I usually get them as gifts. For food shopping, I go to the local supermarket once a week and do it quickly.

F. Lisa, 22, actress: I’m probably a happy shopper. Sometimes I go out with my friends to look around the shops, and we often end up buying things. I don’t usually have a specific item in mind, but if something catches my eye, I’ll buy it.

G. Suki, 26, art gallery assistant: I’m a careful shopper. I enjoy shopping, but I don’t buy much. I usually know what I want and don’t go overboard. Sometimes I shop to feel better, but then I often feel worse because I’ve spent too much.

H. Ann-Marie, 29, nursery worker: I love shopping, but only on certain days and never on Saturdays because it’s too busy. I consider myself a careful shopper. I always have a good idea of what I want and don’t rush into buying things. I check other shops to find better deals, which takes me a long time!

I. Linda, 32, restaurant manager: I’m an unwilling shopper. Since I work in the city center, shopping has lost its appeal for me. When I have to shop, I go reluctantly and don’t bother trying things on because it’s too much trouble. The clothes I buy don’t always fit, but I don’t mind too much. I’d rather make a few mistakes than put in a lot of effort!'"

**Easter Quiz for Children**  
During the Easter holidays, young visitors can join a quiz about surprises. Free quiz sheets can be picked up at the desk by the Orange Street entrance. Children will be guided to 14 surprising paintings and asked various questions about them. The quiz sheets will be available during normal gallery hours from March 25 to April 9.

**New Artwork**  
The Gallery now features a beautiful still life by the Dutch painter Jan van Os from the 18th century. This large painting (89.1 cm x 71 cm) shows flowers and fruit in bright colors on wood. It is one of the first paintings of this kind in the Gallery. The painting is signed and dated 1777 and 1778. It is common for such paintings to have two dates because the artist waited for specific flowers to bloom in different seasons. This artwork was generously donated to the Gallery by Miss Violet Churchman in memory of her sister, Ida Nancy. It is now displayed in Room 25.

**Special Exhibition**  
The exhibition ""Painting in Spain during the Late 18th Century"" opened in the Sunley Room on March 15. The Gallery has recently acquired works by three Spanish painters from this period: Paret, Melendez, and Francisco Bayeu, who are the main focus of the exhibition. They are joined by Francisco's brother Ramon, Antonio Gonzalez, and two Italian artists who worked in Spain during this time: Corrado Giaquinto and Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. The exhibition will run until May 31.

**Lecture Series**  
The series of lectures related to the special exhibition continues every Wednesday. On April 5, Lizzie Barker will discuss Melendez's work, while on April 12, Sarah Symmons will talk about Luis Paret. On April 19 and 26, Juliet Wilson will speak about Francisco Bayeu. On Tuesdays in April, Erika Langmuir will explain how artists often tell stories through their paintings.

**Gallery Restaurant Improvements**  
The Gallery is pleased to announce that the restaurant has improved and expanded its services. With new kitchens, the restaurant now offers a wide variety of hot and cold dishes at reasonable prices.

**Visitor Information**  
Free guided tours of the Gallery are available every day at 11:00 am and 3:00 pm (except Sundays). These tours introduce some of the Gallery's greatest paintings and showcase its collection of important European art from the 13th to the early 20th centuries."

For a group of children aged ten to fifteen, Saturdays are spent learning how to cook. Their weekly lessons in small classes are so popular that there is a waiting list of 30 children who want to join. Parents pay £280 for the course, where their children can have fun and learn to make good food. 

Bill, who is ten years old, says, ""I love my mum's cooking, and now I can do it better than her. The teachers make us laugh, especially when we sit down to share the food we've made."" 

Flora, who is twelve, has some trouble with onions. She says, ""I love cooking. I made a meal for ten friends, and they really enjoyed it. My mum suggested I find a hobby instead of doing nothing on weekends. I was happy at home, so I wasn't very interested at first. But I'm really glad I decided to come."" 

Their teacher, Philippe, says, ""It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, even if the kitchen isn't always tidy when they cook! As adults, we keep learning more about food. If parents get their children interested in cooking when they are young, they will have the skills to cook for themselves when they leave home."""

PET_21,"**MONEY**

What is money? The pound, the dollar, and the franc are similar to a gram or a kilometre. The key difference is that you can trade money for goods or services. For example, a five-pound note can buy a book, a large bag of sweets, or a few cinema tickets. However, the note itself is just a piece of paper that costs very little to produce. 

Thousands of years ago, people did not have money as we understand it today. There were no banks or shops. Back then, Mr. Green, a farmer, traded the corn he grew for Mr. Hive's honey. This was a direct exchange between two people, each having something the other wanted. Over time, most societies created their own forms of 'currency' to facilitate trade. Eventually, different currencies began to connect, which is why today everyone uses a national currency."

We are looking for people who can write good stories. The judges, including novelist Mary Littlejohn, television reporter Michael Brown, and Keep Writing's editor Susan Hitchins, want interesting and original stories. Last year, detective fiction was very popular, but the winner wrote a love story. You can write about anything, but here are some tips to help you: 

1. Write about what you know. This is important advice for every writer. Last year, most stories were about love, family, and friendship problems. However, you should make ordinary situations interesting so that people want to read them. Write about everyday things in a new and surprising way.

2. Get your facts right. It is important to describe places or explain things accurately. Do not write about something unless you are sure it is correct.

3. Hold the reader's attention. Start with an interesting beginning and end with a surprise. A weak ending can ruin a story. Develop your story carefully and think of something unusual for the ending.

4. Think about the characters. Make the people in your story feel real by using descriptive words.

Your story must be your own work, between 2,000 and 2,500 words, typed, double-spaced, on one side of each page. We cannot accept stories by fax or email, even if you are close to the deadline. You must include the application form with your story. Unfortunately, we cannot return your story or discuss our decisions. You should not have had any fiction published in any magazine or book in this country, as per a recent rule change. The story must not have been published in any form, such as on radio or TV, anywhere in the world. Your fee of £5 will go to the Writers' Association.

Hypatia's father was the director of Alexandria University, and he ensured that his daughter received the best education possible. This was rare, as most women at that time had limited opportunities to study. After studying in Athens and Rome, Hypatia returned to Alexandria and began teaching mathematics. She quickly became well-known for her understanding of new ideas. Although we do not have copies of her books, we know she wrote several important mathematical works. Hypatia was also interested in technology and invented various scientific tools to assist with her work. During this time, many rulers feared science, and those involved in it were often in danger.

Grass is one of the most successful plants in the world. There are over 9,000 types of grasses, and they can be found in every part of the earth. They are the only flowering plants that can survive in the cold environments of the Arctic and Antarctic. Grasslands are home to many animals, from small insects and birds to large animals like cows and lions. All these animals rely on grass in some way. 

Grass grows back quickly after being cut or damaged. Unlike other plants, new leaves grow from below the soil, not from the top. This is why many animals can live together in one area. Once they have eaten all the grass, new grass starts to grow again, providing a fresh meal."

Since she was a child, she has drawn clothes and created designs. She never told her parents, who run a supermarket, that she wanted to make fashion her career. She thought they wanted her to choose a more traditional job, so she studied management at university. After finishing her degree, she moved to London and worked at an advertising agency. She had to go to industry events but couldn't afford the designer clothes she admired. So, she started making skirts and tops for herself. When her friends saw her creations, they asked her to make clothes for them too. She then found a small shop in London that agreed to sell her designs on a sale-or-return basis. The clothes were very popular, and nothing was returned. This success encouraged her to leave her advertising job, take out a £20,000 loan, and start her own womenswear brand. Kal's parents were supportive of her career change, which made her very happy. Now, her clothes are sold in over 70 stores, and her business earns more than £500,000.

PET_31,"**Text: Climbing to the Top of Britain**

Every year, thousands of people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland. Because it is located in the north, the weather can be very cold. Climber Keith Hewitt shares his experience of climbing Ben Nevis for the first time.

""It was February, my first big winter climb. We chose a route up the north face of the mountain to Tower Ridge. This climb is six hundred metres high, probably the longest in Britain. We planned to camp for three days in the 'Carries', which are large bowls cut into the mountain halfway up. We carried tents, sleeping bags, and metal spikes for our boots. You would struggle on Ben Nevis without them because the snow can be so hard that it feels like walking on ice. Even though some members of our group were very experienced, we packed a lot of safety equipment, including lights to attract attention, hard hats, and extra clothing. 

Although the weather forecast was perfect with no strong winds, we still felt nervous when we started. Climbing Ben Nevis in winter is always a challenge. The path quickly became steep, and my legs felt heavy. As the weakest member of the group, I needed to rest more often. The others sometimes took breaks to let me catch up, but as soon as I reached them, they would start again. I promised myself that I would train properly before my next climb.

After climbing 200 metres, we reached the start of Tower Ridge, the path that would take us to the top of Ben Nevis. It is only a metre and a half wide, and the mountain drops hundreds of metres on each side. We knew we had to stay calm and focus on every step as we moved slowly along it. After seven hours of climbing, we finally reached the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and the island of Skye, which is 48 kilometres away. However, we were not so lucky because a mist had come down.

Getting back down to camp can be just as challenging as going up. You need to be able to read a map well; a wrong turn could lead to dangerous slopes in winter. I was glad we decided to take turns with that responsibility. It was only when I was safe in the tent that I could say I really enjoyed the experience. But at least I made it to the top."""
PET_58,"**Text: Anna's New School**

This week has been very exciting because we have just moved into our new school building! It is a wonderful place. The builders used wood for the entire structure, similar to our old school, but this one is also designed to be environmentally friendly. The construction took several months, and we watched it all happen. It was thrilling to see the builders clear the land, even though it meant some beautiful open space was lost. The noise from the construction machines was very loud, and the builders often had to stop working because of heavy rain. At times, we thought the building would never be finished.

Now, we have five classrooms, which are much larger than those in our old school next door, which was very old. We also share one room with people from the town for meetings. There is a nursery, a lovely dining room, and large changing rooms that we are excited to use once our new sports field is ready.

When you enter the school, one of the first things you notice is that there are no heaters! Instead, the warmth comes from everyone inside—the children, the teachers, and the computers we use. The building is designed so well that it keeps all the heat inside, as well as the sound. If we sing in our classrooms, it feels like we are in a concert hall!

Another interesting feature is that the school roof has a tree on top! The builders placed it there after finishing the roof because it is a tradition in Austria, where the roof was made. The electricity for the lights and computers comes from a wind turbine on a hill behind the school. We visited it with our teacher yesterday, and it spins very fast. It is so large that it can be seen from miles away! We took some pictures that we plan to put on our website.

Even though we are already using the school building, some parts are still being completed. For example, we are currently preparing a play for our parents, but we have to go back to our old school hall to perform it. The new hall will be ready by next year. We are very happy with our new school, and our teachers say we will learn much faster now that we are here!"

The accommodation was not great, but we had everything we needed (beds, blankets, food), and we were happy to be out of the city and in the fresh air. On Saturday morning, we met the other ten members of our group. Cameron came with two friends, Kevin and Simon, while sisters Carole and Lynn came with Amanda. We all came from different places and none of us knew the area. We knew we would spend the weekend outdoors, but none of us was sure how. Half of us spent the morning caving while the others went rock climbing, and then we switched at lunchtime. Matt and I went to the caves first.

On Saturday afternoon, I left my handbag on the bus. Inside it were my cheque book, address book, and my purse, which had about £50 in cash and some credit cards. When I realized what I had done, it was too late. I didn't know what to do; I am 72 years old, far from home, and quite worried. I stood by the side of the road and cried. A young man asked me what was wrong, and I explained my situation. He gave me some money for my bus fare home. When I told the bus driver what had happened, he said I could keep the fare. I got home safely, and soon after, the telephone rang. It was the manager of CityBus, the company that owned the bus where I left my handbag. He said they had found my handbag and offered to drive over to return it. I got my handbag back, and amazingly, everything inside was untouched. I want to express my gratitude to everyone who helped me that day and how much I appreciate their kindness and honesty.

Sharks are some of the most frightening animals in our oceans. They are well adapted for hunting underwater because they can see very well and can feel movement through special lines on the sides of their bodies. This makes sharks very dangerous for smaller sea animals that they eat. 

Although sharks are similar to other fish in some ways, their bodies are different. For example, most sharks must swim all the time to breathe and stay alive, so they hardly sleep at all. Also, if sharks are turned upside down, they can stop moving completely. This is a useful technique for researchers who need to handle sharks. It helps them learn more about these interesting creatures.'"

On my first day of ballet class, I felt nervous because I didn’t know anyone. Everyone came over to ask me questions, all in Russian. I tried to respond in Russian, and they switched to English, so we could communicate. Now, six months later, everyone is very friendly, my Russian has improved a lot, and I understand my teachers well.

For the first two weeks after I arrived, my mum stayed with me, and when she left, I felt a bit sad. I even called home late one night to talk to her because I felt lonely. Compared to my ballet school in England, the classes in Russia are much harder, and I eat a lot to keep my energy up. This gives me confidence to meet the school’s high standards.

In the evenings, I watch my favorite films on my computer, but sometimes I fall asleep before the movie ends. Now that I have settled in, I feel at home here. I enjoy walking around the city and visiting different shops, even in December when it was extremely cold. I decided to buy a fur hat because it was minus 10°C, but the locals said it was mild for that time of year! At least my room is warm and cozy.

Right now, we are preparing for a new production, and there is also a competition for young dancers that I plan to enter. I feel very lucky to be here.'"
PET_55,"**THE ICEHOTEL**

For many years, the Arctic was a popular summer destination to experience the land of the midnight sun. However, in winter, the few residents enjoyed the snow and ice alone. By the late 1980s, people began to see the dark and cold winter as a positive feature. In the winter of 1990, French artist Jannot Derit was invited to open an exhibition in a specially built igloo (a structure made of snow) in the small town of Jukkasjarvi, located on the frozen Torne River. This building, called Arctic Hall, attracted many curious visitors.

One night, a group of foreign guests decided to sleep in Arctic Hall. The next morning, they were very happy with their experience, and the idea of an ice hotel was created. Today, it is famous worldwide. When winter starts, a team of snow builders, architects, and artists from around the globe come to Jukkasjarvi to construct the hotel for that year. As each section is finished, it opens to visitors and overnight guests, while other parts are still being built. The first section is completed in December, and each week after that, a new section opens until January 7th, when the hotel is fully finished.

Since the ICEHOTEL is built outdoors using natural winter materials, the completion date depends on the weather, so plans can sometimes change. In spring, as temperatures rise, the hotel melts. Inside the hotel, the temperature is never colder than -5°C to -8°C, no matter how cold it is outside. Guests receive winter clothing, such as warm overalls, hats, and gloves, as part of their stay. It is also wise for guests to bring sweaters, scarves, and plenty of woollen socks, and to choose shoes that are slightly larger than usual to fit thick socks.

If you plan to visit the hotel, you can buy warm sweaters, woollen socks, and more on the ICEHOTEL website. You can order these items and any necessary equipment when you book your stay, and they will be delivered to your room upon check-in. The hotel is located in the village of Jukkasjarvi, 200 km above the Arctic Circle, but only 15 km from Kiruna airport and 17 km from Kiruna train station. Bus transport can be arranged from the airport or train station to the ICEHOTEL."

A report by Dave Worthington

Homestyle, a new furniture shop, had to close shortly after it opened at midnight last Thursday. Up to 6,000 people rushed to the shop. There were many special offers, including a leather sofa for £45 (only until 3 am) and a bed for £30 (only between 3 am and 8 am). The shop's regular hours will be 9 am to 9 pm every day, but Homestyle had announced it would stay open for the first 24 hours. However, it had to close within half an hour of opening.

A police officer who was called to the shop said: ""The police knew a large crowd was expected, but people were not patient. The shop quickly became full, and the managers wisely decided to close the doors. The people outside got angry because they thought everything would be sold before they could enter, and they refused to wait quietly until there was space for them inside. Another problem was that there was a long line of cars trying to get to the parking lot. I couldn't believe that many people decided to leave their cars in the middle of the road and walk the last few meters to the shop. This blocked the road completely.""

One customer, Jenny Smith, who got into the shop, said: ""I waited in line for three hours, and I didn't have time to buy what I wanted. But the staff were very calm and explained what was happening. They had no choice, as it wasn't safe. So I'll come back when they reopen, but I'm not willing to wait in line again."""

PET_34,"**Text: Free-diving in the Caribbean**

Tanya Streeter holds four world records in free-diving, a sport where competitors dive to great depths on just one breath of air. In 2003, she made history by becoming the first person to dive 120 meters into the ocean and return to the surface without assistance. Although she had dived deeper a year earlier using a balloon to help her swim back up, this time she held her breath for over three and a half minutes, making her the only woman to break a world record previously held by a man. A team of fourteen safety divers monitored her dive at different depths. 

Some people argue that free-diving is too dangerous, especially after reports of serious accidents involving other divers. However, Tanya believes that safety is the most important factor, followed by proper training. Most free-divers focus on one or two types of events, but Tanya maintains a consistent training schedule. Two-thirds of her training is done at the gym, while the rest is split between the pool and the ocean. She uses an exercise bike to improve her heart fitness but avoids running to protect her knees. Instead, she prefers fast walking to build her fitness.

When preparing for practice dives, Tanya usually travels away from home. She aims to complete fourteen dives over four weeks, taking a rest day between each dive to avoid fatigue, which could affect her performance. When she is not training for an event, she often makes public appearances to promote sports products and supports environmental organizations through research projects and films.

Growing up on the Caribbean island of Grand Cayman, Tanya spent her childhood swimming and exploring rock pools to observe sea life. She feels that her life now is like living her childhood dreams. Because she is well-known in some countries, she believes people listen to her when she discusses environmental issues. Looking to the future, Tanya, now in her thirties, plans to continue breaking her own world records. Since she started free-diving at the age of twenty-five, she emphasizes that she does not plan to retire from the sport for many years."
PET_12,"**CARTOON FILMS**

Cartoon films have very few limits. If you can draw something, you can make it move on the screen. New ideas and advanced computer programs are making cartoons exciting again for people of all ages. By the end of the 1970s, the film industry believed that cartoons were only for children. However, soon after, a few directors had original ideas. They showed that it was possible to create films that both adults and children could enjoy together. Not every cartoon film was successful, though. For instance, The Black Cauldron failed because it was too scary for children and too silly for adults. Directors learned from this mistake, and film companies started to make a lot of money again."

I had only acted in school plays, but I loved the book since I was eleven. My grandmother used to say I was just like Polly Finnegan, and I always imagined playing her. I took a year off to travel before university. While I was in Chile, my mother emailed me about plans to turn the book into a TV drama. I knew I had to audition for the role. She was surprised at first but sent my photo to the director and convinced him to meet me. I flew back and got the role. The outdoor filming started a week into the term, so I got permission from the university to be away for three weeks. Once I returned, I woke up at 6:00 am to write the essays I had missed. I didn’t tell my university friends, but they found out and thought it was great. It was an amazing experience, and I feel so lucky. After university, I definitely want to pursue acting as a career. I’m not from an acting family, although my grandfather was an opera singer. I have tried for other TV roles but haven’t received any offers yet. I’m not sure how I managed everything because I also had a busy social life. When filming ended, I didn’t know what to do next. I have since appeared in two college plays.

**Day 8:** You will arrive in Oporto with plenty of time for independent sightseeing and last-minute shopping before your flight back to London Heathrow."
PET_30,"**HONEY**

Honey is a sweet liquid made by bees. It is made up of water and sugars. Bees can travel up to seventy-five thousand kilometers and visit over two million flowers to make just half a kilo of honey. The color and taste of honey depend on the type of flower the bees visit. There are more than three hundred different types of honey. Generally, lighter-colored honey has a milder taste than darker honey. 

In ancient times, honey was the main sweetener because sugar was very rare. The ancient Egyptians valued honey highly and even used it as a form of payment. Today, honey is produced and consumed all over the world. Research indicates that honey can help reduce tiredness and improve athletic performance. Additionally, honey is not only a food; it can also be used for sore throats and is found in many skin and hair-care products."
PET_7,"**Text: Norwich**

Norwich is the capital of East Anglia, a region in Britain, and has been a place to live for over two thousand years. It started as a small village by the River Wensum. By the time of the Norman invasion in 1066, it had grown into one of the largest towns in England. Norwich has two cathedrals and a mosque, making it an important center for different religions. The first cathedral was built in 1095 and recently celebrated its 900th anniversary. In 1994, Norwich celebrated the 800th anniversary of receiving a Royal Charter, which allowed it to be called a city and to govern itself.

Today, Norwich is smaller than cities like London or Manchester, with a population of about 150,000. However, in the 16th century, it was the second city of England. It continued to grow for the next 300 years, becoming wealthy and famous for having as many churches as there are weeks in a year and as many pubs as there are days in a year. Nowadays, there are fewer churches and pubs, but in 1964, the University of East Anglia was established in Norwich. With a growing student population and its success as a modern commercial center (it is the largest center for insurance services outside London), Norwich now offers a variety of entertainment options, including theatres, cinemas, nightclubs, busy cafes, excellent restaurants, and several arts and leisure centers. The city also has a football team known as 'The Canaries', whose colors are green and yellow, though the reason for the name is unclear.

One of the city's recent developments is a modern shopping center called 'The Castle Mall'. For over two years, the people of Norwich lived with a large hole in the middle of their city while builders worked on the main car park. They moved nearly a million tons of earth to create a city center park on the roof of the Mall, complete with beautiful water features and many trees. The local people are happy that the old open market remains in the heart of the city, next to the new development. Both areas continue to thrive, showing that Norwich has successfully combined the best of the old and the new."
PET_43,"**The Albuquerque Balloon Festival**

Every autumn, the sky above Albuquerque, a city in the southwestern United States, fills with bright colors. This is the Albuquerque Balloon Festival, a nine-day event that happens every year. The first festival took place in 1972 to celebrate the 50th birthday of a local radio station. It started with about twelve hot-air balloons that launched from a parking lot in the center of Albuquerque. Since then, the festival has grown a lot. This year, at least a thousand balloons from over a third of the countries in the world are expected to attend at its current location outside the city.

**What to See**

The pilots communicate with each other using radios, and they all light up the burners of their balloons at the same time. This event is called a ""balloon glow,"" and it is a great chance to take amazing photographs. To see these ""glows,"" you should arrive just after nightfall or before 5:30 AM, as the balloons rise into the dark sky. During the day, you can walk among the balloons and talk to the pilots as they prepare for take-off. The balloons come in various sizes and colors, some shaped like animals or cartoon characters, and even popular products like soft drinks and fast food. Children will enjoy it.

In the afternoon, you can also take a balloon flight over the desert with one of the many companies that offer rides. Another option is to ride the cable car from the desert floor to the top of the nearby mountains, which is the longest ride of its kind, and enjoy a stunning view of the festival.

There are many other attractions for visitors of all ages, including balloon races and fireworks on the opening night and the last three nights of the festival.

**The Albuquerque Box**

This is a local wind pattern that creates ideal conditions for balloonists. The Sandia Mountains protect the balloons from strong winds and create gentler wind currents at different heights. This allows skilled pilots to control the direction of their balloons by rising or descending.

**Practical Advice**

Buy your tickets in advance online to avoid long waits at the festival site. Wear several layers of thin clothing, as it can be cool at night and in the early morning, but during the day, sunglasses and sunscreen are important. Bring a flashlight for nighttime events and, of course, your camera. If you use film instead of digital photography, make sure to bring high-speed film for evening and nighttime photos."

""The best age to start learning the violin is between three and six,"" says Margaret Porter, a violinist and music teacher. ""It's when you are discovering the world."" Margaret, who lives in London, usually teaches children who are three or four years old, but she has made exceptions for eager five-year-olds. When she began teaching the violin in 1972, her first class was made up of her children's five-year-old friends. 

Margaret's students have group lessons. Each group has about twelve students, and each lesson lasts one hour, taking place every two weeks. Additionally, each student has one individual lesson with her each week. Parents must also attend the classes because it is important for them to be involved in the lessons. 

From the very first lessons, students learn to play by ear. They do not try to read music until they have been playing for several years, and for a long time, there is a noticeable difference between their playing and their ability to read music. Margaret explains that her teaching method is not meant to create great violinists, and she often suggests that students who excel should leave and study the violin using more traditional methods."

From the first song, which is a dance tune, it is clear that the band is shifting away from slow songs. The second song is also a dance track and is even louder and heavier. Most of the later songs are in the band's usual slow style. These two dance tracks will likely surprise many fans. Either of them could easily become a hit single because they are excellent. 

Singer Rob Letchford has a chance to showcase his talent, hitting each note perfectly. Fans should be thankful he recorded these songs before experiencing throat issues, which led to the band having to cancel their next tour. (Anyone who has bought tickets need not worry, as all the concerts will be rescheduled once Rob has recovered.)

On this CD, Moonshine demonstrates their ability to create great music in various styles, from the slow songs we know to the upbeat tracks that will keep you dancing. However, I felt that they placed their best songs at the beginning, and the last few tracks were not quite as strong. Despite this, ""Here Again"" is sure to be a big hit and bring more success to the band."

In the past, people did not focus on shoes being comfortable or stylish. Early shoes were likely made from animal skins, which people tied around their ankles to keep warm. Today, we still use leather, but other materials like silk, plastic, and cotton are also common, depending on current trends. It was only about one hundred and fifty years ago that people started wearing different shoes for each foot. Before that, shoes were straight and could be worn on either foot. All shoes used to be handmade, but now, while some shoemakers still use traditional methods, most shoes are made by machines in large factories. The invention of sewing machines allowed the shoe industry to produce many more affordable shoes for a larger number of customers."

PET_40,"**THE HISTORY OF THE IDITAROD - THE LAST GREAT RACE ON EARTH**

In the 1880s, gold was found in Alaska, the northernmost state in the USA. Many people moved there hoping to become rich. New towns were quickly built, including one called Iditarod, which means 'far, distant place'. In 1909, Iditarod grew so fast that it briefly became the largest city in Alaska. 

During the summer, supplies could be brought to these towns by boat. However, in winter, the rivers and ocean froze, making it impossible to reach them. To solve this problem, a winter trail was created in 1910 for dog teams pulling sleds. They delivered mail, food, and clothes to the gold miners. This trail became known as the Iditarod Trail. It took a team of dogs about three weeks to travel across Alaska, stopping at 'roadhouses' where drivers could find a warm bed and food for themselves and their dogs. The trail was used every winter until the 1920s when airplanes replaced boats and dog teams as the main transport.

However, the dogs had one last moment of fame in 1925 when a disease called diphtheria struck the city of Nome. The disease could be treated, but the nearest medicine was in Anchorage, on the other side of Alaska. Airplanes were still new, and no one was sure if they could fly in such cold weather. The only skilled pilot, Carl Eielson, was away at that time. So, it was decided to transport the medicine using dog teams instead. 

The journey was over 1,000 kilometers, mostly along the Iditarod Trail. It took twenty teams just six days to complete the trip. Leonhard Seppala, a Norwegian who had come to Alaska for gold, traveled the first 400 kilometers. He relied on his dog Togo to guide him through the blinding snow, and Togo proved to be a great help. The last part of the journey was completed by Gunnar Kaasen, who had driven dog teams in Alaska for 21 years. His lead dog was Saito. At one point, Balto, another dog, refused to go further, saving the team from falling into icy water. The diphtheria outbreak was stopped, and Balto became a hero.

Today, a dog sled race is held every year from Anchorage to Nome, following the route of that famous journey in 1925. It is called the Iditarod and is known as 'The Last Great Race on Earth'."

""At first, no one thought it was a problem that I was a girl. But then the team we beat complained."" This story was published in a local newspaper, and Jose Craveirinha, who supported other African athletes, learned about Maria. He went to meet her and saw her kicking a ball outside the football club. He quickly realized that she was very fast. 

""He talked to me about athletics. I didn’t understand what he meant. The only sport I knew was football. Then he bought me running shoes and took me to train. It was very hard work, and my legs really hurt."" Jose spoke to her parents and convinced them that she could be successful, which would help their family. They agreed to let him take her away to train. 

In 1991, she finally accepted an invitation to train in the United States. She had said no before because she knew she would miss her family. Her background was different from the girls she met in the US. She explained, ""They were good athletes, but while I worried about my parents having enough to eat, they worried about dresses and make-up.

In the past, animals were trained to perform for visitors, but this practice has stopped. Now, zoos aim to show animals in their natural behaviors. Most cities have a zoo or wildlife park today. However, opinions about zoos vary. Supporters believe zoos help us learn about nature and allow us to see wild animals up close, which would be hard to do otherwise. On the other hand, some people oppose zoos because they think it is wrong to confine animals in cages. They argue that poorly managed zoos can have dirty conditions and provide unsuitable food for the animals.'"
PET_59,"**JAZZ**  
By Katie Atkins, aged 14  

I play the trumpet in my school jazz band. Last month, we held a jazz competition with bands from local high schools, and our band won! Each band had their own costumes, from black school uniforms like my band wore to brightly-colored T-shirts. We didn’t look much like professional adult bands, but we were all used to performing in competitions, so the quality of our playing was impressive, especially considering how young we are. Players from each band even created new tunes right on stage. It was exciting to watch, but even better when my band performed!  

We have a great jazz band at my school, but not everyone who wants to join gets accepted—only about half of the applicants. However, anyone who is eager to play can attend jazz practice before school, and we often spend time together after school, listening to jazz and learning about it. There are also trips to jazz summer camps across the country. I’ve been to a couple and learned a lot.  

Adults are often surprised that young people are interested in jazz. My music teacher believes it’s because pop music isn’t challenging enough for serious musicians like me. I find jazz exciting because it feels both new and old at the same time—you can create your own music while also feeling connected to its history, as you perform on stage like great jazz artists before you. My school is very fortunate to have excellent teachers and supportive parents. Without them, we wouldn’t make progress in our music!"

In Marrakesh, Morocco, it can rain anytime from November to March. However, rain is not very common. When it does rain, the city's water pipes often cannot handle the sudden floods, causing the streets to become like rivers. Many winters have been dry recently, so when rain finally comes, the local people appreciate it. 

The parks and gardens in Marrakesh do not rely on rain; instead, they are fed by a system of underground channels built in the 11th century. These channels bring water from the mountains all year round. Places that are mostly dry but receive water this way are called oases. 

Further south of Marrakesh is Skoura, where every piece of land is divided into small squares by water channels to grow food. The snow-covered Atlas Mountains in winter create a beautiful backdrop."

Gareth Ellis, 13, is the youngest son of Alan, an engineer, and Kath, a nursery teacher. His older brothers work in banking and computers, but Gareth has always dreamed of being a clown. Three years ago, Alan, Kath, and Gareth joined a circus. ""People laugh when we tell them,"" says Kath. ""But it's true. Gareth has wanted to be a clown since we took him to the circus when he was three."" 

When Alan lost his job, he and Kath decided to look for full-time jobs in the circus. They both found jobs with a well-known circus, and Gareth started training to become a clown. He calls himself Bippo. They travel with the circus in the summer and return home in the winter. Gareth's brothers are old enough to take care of the house while they are away. 

""I can't say it was easy,"" says Kath. ""There was a lot to think about and organize. We only had a car and a very small caravan to sleep in, and we were leaving our nice house behind. The only thing Gareth missed was his long, hot baths."" 

""People ask about my education,"" says Gareth, ""but from the start, wherever we go, someone has always come to teach me. I use the same books as everyone back at school, and I have a computer. I've never fallen behind my classmates."" 

And what about the future? ""It was a tough decision,"" says Kath, ""but there was no other way to teach Gareth about being a clown. I'm happy to say it's working, and we're enjoying it."" And Gareth? ""I'm going to be the main clown in a circus one day,"" he says, ""maybe Bippo's circus."""
PET_52,"**Eight-eighteen News**

Eight-eighteen News is a news agency for young people aged 8 to 18. We collect news and write reports, stories, and articles. We send these to national and local newspapers, magazines, television, radio, and websites for publication. You can read or listen to the news stories and articles by our members on the Eight-eighteen website.

We have three centers across the country where young people can meet others and participate in projects. We plan to open more centers nationwide. Since our agency started in 1994, originally called 'Young News', over 2,500 young people have been members. Sophie was one of them. She says: ""I first heard of Eight-eighteen when they interviewed me for an article about young people's views on hip hop music. I was amazed by the opportunities available to young journalists. Age didn't matter; we were trusted to work on stories independently. I began attending the Eight-eighteen center in my city, received training, and was a member until I turned 18. Eight-eighteen helped me achieve more than I thought I could. With the skills I learned, I got a job at 19 and am now the youngest employee on a major news website, checking articles before they are published.""

**Get Involved at Every Level**

When you join Eight-eighteen, you will receive training and participate in monthly meetings to decide who will write each news story. Eight-eighteen encourages members to share skills. 'Peer trainers' are experienced members aged 12 and older who train new members and teach them basic journalism skills. As they gain more experience, some members present sessions to young people and adults outside of Eight-eighteen, often in youth clubs and summer camps. These young trainers are always supported by older staff who accompany them on these trips.

Eight-eighteen News holds training sessions for new members three times a year. Our next training for new members will be in February. If you or someone you know is interested in joining, call Director Den Ley at 01622 657874 for more information. The Eight-eighteen program is suitable for children with reading and writing skills at all levels. Membership is free, and there is no test to join."
PET_28,"**Antarctica Sightseeing Flights Website**

Welcome to our website! Here is what you need to know before booking a flight. During the short summer in Antarctica, we offer sightseeing flights from Sydney, Australia, on a Boeing 747. The exact flight dates for next year are not confirmed yet, but if you book now, your deposit can be transferred if we need to change the date.

**Questions**

Here are answers to common questions about our flights.

**How long is the flight?**  
The average flight lasts 12 hours. About four hours into the flight, we usually see the first sea ice and icebergs. We spend four hours flying over Antarctica and the rest of the time returning home. During the flight, experts who have worked in Antarctica give talks about the environment and history, and they answer questions. There is a camera next to the pilot that shows a view from the cockpit on the video system, from take-off to landing.

**Will I get a seat next to a window?**  
All passengers receive two boarding passes. At the halfway point of the flight, you will be asked to move to the seat indicated on your second boarding pass. Business and first-class passengers will have a window seat for half of the flight and a seat next to a window for the other half. Economy passengers will have either a window seat or a seat next to a window for half of the flight and an aisle seat for the other half. While we are over Antarctica, we encourage passengers to move around the plane to enjoy the views. The pilot flies in long 'figure 8s' over interesting sights so that everyone can see them well from both sides of the plane.

**What happens if the weather is bad?**  
We have 17 different approved flight plans. On the morning of the flight, our captain checks the satellite images of the clouds and chooses the direction that offers the best views.

**Will I see penguins and other wildlife?**  
Most Antarctic wildlife lives at sea level, which is over 3,000 meters below the plane, so we cannot see them clearly. We do not land in Antarctica for environmental reasons. To see Antarctic wildlife, you would need to join a boat tour.

**Can I take photographs?**  
Yes! All cameras are welcome. We even offer some fun photo opportunities on board where you can try on Antarctic cold weather clothes."
PET_35,"**Text: Little Chefs**

A group of children aged ten to fifteen spends their Saturdays learning how to cook. Their small classes are very popular, and there is a waiting list of 30 children who want to join. Parents pay £280 for the course, where their children can have fun and learn to make good food. 

Bill, who is ten years old, says, ""I love my mum's cooking, and now I can do it better than her. The teachers make us laugh, especially when we sit down to share the food we've made."" 

Flora, who is twelve, has some trouble with onions. She says, ""I love cooking. I made a meal for ten friends, and they really enjoyed it. My mum suggested I find a hobby instead of doing nothing on weekends. I was happy at home, so I wasn't very interested at first. But I'm really glad I decided to come."" 

Their teacher, Philippe, says, ""It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, even if the kitchen isn't always tidy when they cook! As adults, we keep learning more about food. If parents get their children interested in cooking when they are young, they will have the skills to cook for themselves when they leave home."""
PET_5,"**Winter Driving**

Winter can be dangerous because it is hard to predict what will happen, and accidents can happen easily. Fog may appear suddenly over a hill. Ice can be hidden under melting snow, ready to cause you to lose control. A car coming towards you might slide unexpectedly across the road.

**Rule Number One** for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly. Sudden movements can make it hard to control your car. When you turn the wheel, brake, or speed up, do it gently and slowly. Imagine you have a full cup of hot coffee on the seat next to you. Drive carefully so you don’t spill it.

**Rule Number Two** is to be aware of what could happen. The more ice there is, the further ahead you should look. Test how long it takes to stop by braking gently. Remember, you might be driving faster than you think. Generally, allow double your normal stopping distance on wet roads, three times this distance on snow, and even more on ice. Try to keep control of your car at all times to avoid problems."
PET_41,"**Craigie Aitchison**

The painter Craigie Aitchison was born in Scotland. He moved to London to study law but ended up going to art school instead. He found the traditional drawing classes challenging, but he continued to paint. In his late twenties, the Italian government gave him money to study art, and he became interested in early Italian artists, which is reflected in some of his work. He loved the greens and browns of the Italian countryside and the bright light there, and he wanted to capture this light in his paintings. This inspired him to layer colors from light to dark, but he admits he is never sure of the outcome. He says, ""It's a secret - because I don't know myself. I don't start by painting yellow, knowing I'm going to put anything on top.""

Like many talented artists, Aitchison makes it seem easy. ""Anyone can do the colors - you can buy them. I just pay attention to what colors are next to each other."" Unlike some artists, he does not make drawings before starting a painting because he feels that doing so might make him lose interest in the painting. Instead, Aitchison often changes his paintings many times before they are finished. This is why he prefers to work with models who do not ask to see their portraits while he is painting. ""If I feel they're worried and want to look at the painting, I can't do it.""

Since moving to London years ago, he has not felt connected to the Scottish art scene. He says he is not interested in following any tradition; he just paints in his own way. However, his work still inspires young British painters."
PET_38,"**Text: 'Rock Band'**

Two years ago, our 14-year-old son, Ben, asked us for a set of drums for his birthday. At first, we were against the idea because of the noise. Ben argued, ""It's better than watching television or playing computer games in my free time, and it'll keep me out of trouble."" In the end, we agreed. ""All right,"" we said, ""but you must think about the rest of the family and the neighbors when you play.""

That was just the beginning. Since drums are not easy to move, the other members of Ben's band started coming to our house with their guitars and other equipment. So, for several hours a week, our house shakes with the noise of their instruments and singing. At least Ben's hobby has been good for our health: whenever the band practices, my husband and I go for a long walk. 

I must admit that, although their music may sound a little strange, they are a friendly and polite group of young men. I cannot judge their musical skill; after all, I didn't expect my parents' generation to like the same music I did when I was a teenager. They do play regularly in local clubs for young people. 

Our main worry is that they won't spend enough time on their schoolwork because of their music, but this hasn't happened yet. I always remind Ben how important his studies are. One thing is certain: Ben was right; it has kept him out of trouble, and he is never bored."
PET_17,"**Text: Atlantic College**

Last week, I visited Atlantic College, a great private college in Wales. It offers young people important experiences outside the classroom, along with the chance to study for their exams. The students, aged 16 to 18 and from all over the world, study in the morning. In the afternoon, they participate in useful activities, such as helping on a farm, caring for people with learning difficulties, or checking rivers for pollution. 

One of the best things about Atlantic College is that its students come from various social backgrounds and countries. Since few can pay the fees of £20,000 for two years, there are grants available. A quarter of the students are British, and many can only attend because they receive government support. 

""I really admire the college for promoting international understanding among young people,"" said Barbara Molenkamp, a student from the Netherlands. ""You learn to live with and respect others, even those you may not like. During the summer holidays, my mother noticed I argued much less with my sister.""

In summary, Atlantic College provides its students with an excellent education through effective methods."
PET_47,"**Text: Being an Older Student**

At 32, I have just completed my first year at university. I attend lectures regularly and have learned to read books quickly and write long essays. I decided to go to university after being away from school for fourteen years. As a secretary, I earned a decent salary, but I felt bored because my job did not challenge me. I became increasingly unhappy with the idea of being stuck in that job. I envied the students at the local university; they seemed happy, carefree, and full of hope, and I wanted to be part of that experience.

Now that I am a student, I find it difficult to connect with younger classmates. They often mistake me for a lecturer and ask me questions I cannot answer. I also feel distant from the lecturers because, even though we are the same age, I know much less than they do. However, I am grateful for this chance to study because I understand that having a qualification is important for getting a good job.

Unlike most eighteen-year-olds, I prefer spending my weekends studying rather than going out to parties. I also enjoy the typical student benefits, like long holidays and discounts for theatre and cinema. I often worry about what I will do after university, but I hope that continuing my education at this stage in my life is a smart decision."

Henry Ford was born on a farm in Michigan in 1863, but he did not enjoy farming. At the age of fifteen, he started working as a mechanic, and in 1893, he created his first car. After driving it 1,500 kilometers, he sold it and made two larger cars. In 1903, he founded the Ford Motor Company. By using strong yet light steel, he produced affordable cars for regular people. In 1908, he introduced the first Ford Model 'T', which cost $825. Soon, he was selling 100 cars every day. By 1927, the Ford Motor Company was valued at $700 million. Early Ford cars were simple and inexpensive, but this simplicity sometimes meant fewer options. Henry Ford famously said about the Model T, ""You can have any color you like, as long as it's black."""

Canada Geese are large birds with blue and white feathers. When autumn comes, they must fly south to find warmer weather. The winters in Canada are very cold, and the birds cannot survive if they stay there. Last spring, Bill Lishman discovered sixteen young Canada Geese on his farm. They had lost their parents. Bill thought, ""These young birds will not know how to migrate in the autumn."" 

Bill owned a small plane and decided to teach the geese to follow him. Throughout the summer, he took short flights in his plane, and the young geese followed him. When autumn arrived and the weather turned cold, Bill flew to Virginia in the United States, which is 600 miles south of his home in Canada. The geese followed him all the way.

After reaching Virginia, Bill left the geese there and returned home. This spring, he waited for the birds to come back, but they did not arrive. So, Bill flew back to Virginia to find them. He searched for two weeks but could not locate them. When he returned home, he was surprised to find the geese waiting for him. They had managed to find their way home without his help!"

She sold the jam for £1 a jar to her friends and quickly doubled her aunt's £500.

At first, Esther's parents did not want her to spend her time making jam; they believed she should study instead. They hoped she would become a teacher or a doctor one day. However, Esther ignored their advice and continued making jam. After a few months, she began selling it at the local market. She also started making orange juice, which she sold to a school where one of her friends worked.

After two years, her business had grown significantly, and her parents were very proud of her. She made various types of food, which she sold to shops and supermarkets. She was so busy that she needed to hire some people to help her."

Corryvale Farm is located in the west of England. Stephen and Jenny Blackler raise cows and chickens and sell milk and eggs. However, most of their income comes from Jenny's sheep. She has 50 sheep, and each sheep produces enough wool for six sweaters. Every six months, Stephen shears the wool from the sheep to keep them comfortable.

Five years ago, Jenny made some sweaters from the wool and tried to sell them at local markets. Unfortunately, it was summer, and the hot weather meant people were not interested in buying sweaters. Instead, she decided to make socks. Everyone loved the socks because they were affordable, durable, and easy to clean. This is how Jenny's business began.

At first, she made the socks at home, but soon she had thousands of customers. To keep up with demand, she started sending the wool to a factory, where machines now produce all the socks. There are six colors, five sizes for all ages, and different types of socks for walkers, athletes, and skiers. Jenny is especially busy during Christmas because Corryvale socks are a popular gift.

Most house burglaries occur between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m., according to the police. Inspector Ian Saunders informed our newspaper that the number of house burglaries has increased by over 30% compared to last year. He also mentioned that 67% of burglaries happen when people leave their homes and forget to lock a door or a window. He noted that burglaries at night are rare because families are usually at home during that time. However, winter afternoons are the best time for burglars since it gets dark, making it harder for them to be seen. Many houses are often empty during this time because people are still at work. Inspector Saunders suggested that it is wise to leave lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when going on holiday, as this can help deter burglars. He also encouraged neighbors to keep an eye on each other's homes when someone is away and to call the police if they notice anything suspicious. ""We will also provide advice on how to make your house safer,"" Inspector Saunders said. ""This kind of help is free."""

KET_44,"Text: 'The History of Farming

Before farming began, people searched forests for plants and fruits to eat. This meant they had to move constantly to find food. However, around 12,000 years ago, in the Middle East, people started to grow their own food. These individuals were the first farmers. Farming allowed people to settle in one place, leading to the growth of larger villages. Some villagers could then focus on other jobs, like making clothes, because farmers provided food for everyone. Unfortunately, farming was challenging during bad weather, which sometimes left people without enough food. Today, farmers can produce more food, which can travel thousands of kilometers to reach our homes.'"

Many Indians prefer watching films to any other leisure activity, with ten million people visiting cinemas daily. Bollywood films often tell romantic love stories, and singing and dancing are key elements in every film. These films are also popular outside India. Last year, Bollywood earned over $500 million by selling its films to other countries. 

Indian actors produce more films each year than American actors in Hollywood, but they earn less money. This is why most Bollywood films have a production cost of about $2 million, while Hollywood films usually cost at least $5 million. Most Bollywood actors are young and work hard, but their careers are often short. Amitabh Bachchan, considered by some to be India's greatest actor, is an exception.

Schnauzers originate from Germany, where they assist farmers with sheep and are also used by the police due to their intelligence. Schnauzers make great family pets; they are friendly and good with young children."
KET_23,"**The Ruwenzori Mountains**

Mary Daniels is a student from England. This year, she had a fascinating summer holiday. She traveled with fifteen other people to the Ruwenzori Mountains in Africa. Their purpose was to help build a road through a forest connecting two large towns. 

""It was very challenging because there was no drinking water and no shops to buy food,"" Mary explained. ""It was also very cold and rainy in the mountains. It is one of the wettest places on Earth."" 

Mary spent six weeks in the mountains. Although it was hard work, she believes it was the best experience of her life. She hopes to return next year to continue her efforts there."

Thank you for your letter. Today was my first day at my new school. A girl named Nicole helped me and showed me where the classrooms are. She is very nice, and I plan to visit her this weekend. My favorite lesson today was Maths, and I felt happy because I knew more than the other girls. I also played hockey for the first time, and I really enjoyed it. Most of the teachers seem friendly, but I am a bit scared of the head teacher. No one likes him because he shouts a lot. I have to go now because I need to do my homework.

Horse racing has been an important sport for thousands of years. It began in Central Asia around 4,500 years ago and was popular in ancient Greece and Rome. Modern horse racing started in the 12th century when Arab horses were brought to Europe. Initially, races were long and involved only two horses, but by the early 18th century, this changed. Races became shorter and included several horses competing against each other. Today, horse racing is one of the most-watched sports in the USA, second only to baseball, and it is also very popular in many other countries.'"

You may have seen these beautiful birds with their bright colors and long tails in forests or zoos. Parrots are found in countries such as Brazil, Australia, and India. They usually live in large groups and enjoy eating fruit, which can sometimes cause problems for farmers. There are many different types of parrots, but they all have strong beaks and feet that help them climb and hold food. The largest parrots can live for up to 80 years. They are very loud, but they are intelligent and can easily learn to talk. Some zoos have parrot shows where you can watch the birds perform tricks they have learned."

A young Englishman named Howard Bonnier opened a restaurant called The Palace there around three and a half months ago. Not many people in Britain know Mr. Bonnier's name yet, but he is already quite well-known in France. This is because he has written for French magazines about many of the best restaurants in that country. He is only 29 years old. When Howard was a teenager, he often visited restaurants with his parents. He enjoyed this so much that he chose not to spend his money on clothes and CDs; instead, he traveled to France to eat at good restaurants. He also collected many French and English cookbooks - he says he has over two hundred and fifty! So why did he decide to open a restaurant? Simply because he loves cooking. Has it been easy? He says it is expensive to start your own restaurant and much harder to cook for fifty people than for your family, but he is confident he made the right choice.'"

Many young people called the radio station to ask for his songs to be played again. 

John, who goes by the name Jon Otis when he sings in Japan, plans to continue working in the park in England. He is unsure how much money he will make from his music. ""I must keep my job in the park,"" he says. ""I still have to pay my bills!"" The other gardeners do not know that he is famous in Japan and have never heard him sing.

Many people in Britain have taken up a new hobby: line dancing. In nearly every town, you can find clubs and classes for this fun activity. 

""Line dancing is easy to learn. If you can walk, you can do it!"" says Fiona Lever, a teacher. ""You don’t need a partner because you dance in groups. It’s a great way to meet new friends.

KET_4,"**THE HISTORY OF THE LONDON POLICE**

Today, there are police officers everywhere, but in 1700, London had no police force. A few elderly men tried to protect the streets at night, but they were not paid much. About 300 years ago, London was growing. The city was very dirty, and many people were poor. There were many thieves who stole money in the streets, so people preferred to stay at home.

In 1750, Henry Fielding began to pay a group of men to catch thieves. They were similar to police officers and were called the 'Bow Street Runners' because they worked near Bow Street. Fifty years later, there were 120 Bow Street Runners, but London had grown larger and needed more police. So, in 1829, the first Metropolitan Police Force was established with 3,000 officers. Most of the men patrolled on foot, but some rode horses. Until 1920, all police officers in London were men. Today, London police officers are well paid, and those who still ride horses earn even more than the others."

For three weeks in August and September, the city is filled with actors and artists from around the world. They come to Edinburgh for the largest arts festival in Britain. During this time, the streets are alive with music and dance from morning until night. You can even see artists painting in the streets. One of the highlights of the Festival is the 'Fringe', where students perform comedy shows in small venues and cafes. Many tourists visit the Festival to watch new films and plays and listen to music from famous musicians. This year, there are over five hundred performances featuring actors from more than forty countries. Tickets for these shows are quite affordable, and it is often easier to see your favorite star in Edinburgh than in London. So, plan to visit Edinburgh next summer, but remember that finding a room can be challenging, so consider booking your hotel now!'"
KET_43,"**ICE-FISHING**

If you drive north from Toronto for three hours, you will reach Lake Nipissing. In winter, the lake freezes, and many Canadian fishermen go there every weekend. They build small wooden houses on the ice and paint them in bright colors. Inside these houses, they try to catch fish that swim beneath the ice. Bob Marvisch has been coming here for twenty-five years during this season. 

""You need clothes that are light but warm: two pairs of socks and gloves, several thin sweaters, and a snow suit on top,"" he says. ""Catching fish is easy. First, you break the ice and make a small round hole in it. Then, you take a fishing line and put some bread on it. You put the line through the hole and into the water. You pull the line up when the fish eat the bread. The fish are between ten and twenty centimeters long. Some people like to eat them, but when I catch three or four fish, I prefer to have some chocolate or another snack! Today, I have caught twenty-five! It's a great sport, and you can meet nice people here!"""

Bicycles are an affordable and environmentally friendly way to travel. The first bicycle was created about 150 years ago. Initially, bicycles were costly, and only wealthy individuals could afford them. These early models looked very different from modern bicycles. Over time, as bicycles became less expensive, more people started to buy them. Many began using bicycles for commuting and leisure activities. 

Today, cars are more commonly used than bicycles because they are faster and keep you dry in the rain. However, some people still choose to ride bicycles to work. They argue that there are too many cars in city centers, making it hard to find parking."

Last summer, I went to Thailand for a beach holiday with my family. One day, we visited a park near our hotel. It had beautiful flower gardens, but we were mainly interested in the elephant show. We went directly to a large area with seats on three sides. Three elephants entered with their keepers and stood in front of a big piece of white card. Each elephant was given a paintbrush and began to paint on its own card. Occasionally, the keepers would give a new brush filled with paint to each elephant and take the old one away. Slowly, following their keepers' instructions, the elephants created pictures on the cards. I couldn't believe my eyes! One picture showed a river, another a tree, and the third a bunch of flowers. When the keepers displayed the paintings, everyone wanted to buy one. We also gave the elephants the bananas we had brought for our lunch. Twenty years ago, elephants worked in the forest. Now, they no longer work there, but the smartest of these animals live in special centers where visitors can watch them.'"

There are many types of cats, and they vary in size, appearance, and behavior. Tigers are the largest cats, measuring up to 3.7 meters from head to tail. While most cats avoid water, tigers often enjoy lying in pools when it is hot. Lions are unique because they live in large family groups. These lions often work together to hunt for food. They typically inhabit flat, open areas where they can see far and track other animals easily. All cats have excellent eyesight, which helps them catch smaller animals for food. They also need to be fast and strong."

The Marangu route, which is five kilometers long, is considered the easiest. It usually takes about five days to complete and is very popular with tourists. However, only half of the climbers who attempt to reach the summit succeed. This is often due to sudden changes in the weather.
