CPE_15,"**Simplified Text: 'Garbage in, garbage out'**

Charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems like a good idea for the environment and the economy. However, it may not be. Many aspects of modern life are similar in developed countries, including how rubbish is collected. Regularly, rubbish bags or bins are taken away by special trucks to local dumps. Economists find this strange because, in many places, this service is free. Households pay for it through local taxes, but a family that produces a lot of rubbish pays the same as an elderly couple that produces very little. However, rubbish disposal is not free. The more rubbish people throw away, the more collectors and trucks are needed, and the more local authorities must pay for landfills. This creates a basic economic problem: if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. 

A common solution is to make households pay for the disposal of their waste. This would encourage them to throw away less and recycle more, assuming local governments provide places to collect recyclable materials. However, economists Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman found that this logical solution can lead to complicated and sometimes disappointing results. Their research looked at several American towns that have started charging households for rubbish. The most common method is to sell stickers or tags that must be attached to rubbish bags or cans. Only bags with these labels are collected each week.

In a paper published last year, Fullerton and Kinnaman studied a scheme introduced in July 1992 in Charlottesville, Virginia, a town of about 40,000 people. Residents were charged 80 cents for each tagged bag of rubbish. This seems like a good use of market forces. However, the authors concluded that the benefits of the scheme did not cover the costs of printing materials, paying sellers, and the wages of those running the scheme. While the number of bags collected fell sharply by 37%, this was mainly due to a behavior called the 'Seattle stomp,' where people crammed more rubbish into each container, sometimes jumping on it to fit more in. This method is less effective than using machines at landfills. The weight of rubbish collected, which is a better measure of disposal costs than volume, only fell by 14% in Charlottesville. In 25 other Virginian cities without a pricing scheme, the weight also fell by 3.5%.

Worse still, some people chose to dump their rubbish illegally instead of paying for collection. Although hard to measure, the authors estimate that illegal dumping may account for 30-40% of the reduction in collected rubbish. A positive outcome was a 15% increase in the weight of recycled materials, suggesting that people preferred to recycle (which is free) rather than pay for rubbish removal. However, this increase may not be directly related to the fee, as many residents were already part of Charlottesville's voluntary recycling program.

In a more recent study, Fullerton and Kinnaman looked at rubbish economics in more detail. They found that pricing does reduce the weight of rubbish, but not significantly. On average, a 10% increase in sticker prices only reduces rubbish quantity by 0.3%. This figure is lower than in other studies, but is it surprising? To significantly reduce rubbish, people would need to buy less of almost everything. A small tax on garbage is unlikely to make a big difference. If this is true, it is important to consider whether other factors, like income and education, are just as important as price. For example, in wealthier towns, people tend to throw away more rubbish and have less time for recycling.

Should we conclude that charging households for rubbish is a bad idea? Not necessarily; free disposal is likely too cheap. However, the effects of seemingly simple policies can be complex. Detailed economic models are often needed to understand them, and sometimes the results are not pleasant."

Theodore Zeldin explores how our work life might change. Do you feel respected and valued in your job? Success in a career is no longer enough. Many professions feel they are not appreciated or understood, and even famous individuals often feel unhappy despite their success. Loving your job used to be enough to be envied, but now you must consider how your job affects you as a person, your mind, character, and relationships. This question is very important. No matter how skilled you are, if your work makes you boring or unable to connect with others, then no amount of status or money can make up for that.

I am trying to find ways for work to focus on personal fulfillment instead of just serving industrial needs. Work should not only create wealth but also provide a meaningful way of living, helping us discover new talents and connect with more people. However, this change will not eliminate unemployment. As more people get educated, they want jobs that are interesting and meaningful.

Even traditional professions like medicine and accounting are losing their appeal. Doctors often feel more stressed than their patients, and accountants worry about their profession's ethics. Many architects cannot use their creativity, and administrators are stuck in bureaucracy. Middle managers, who once felt proud of their status, are now losing their confidence. Meanwhile, companies and public institutions are shrinking. Efforts to improve decision-making and rewards have not succeeded in gaining employee commitment. In Britain, only 8% of employees feel their values match those of their organizations.

I am studying various jobs to see how they shape or harm people. I have looked at what humans can achieve in different cultures and how courage can be developed. I am now focusing on finding more satisfying ways to earn a living. While many experts work to improve companies, we also need to reflect on ourselves as human beings and consider who we want to spend our lives with. How many of us feel truly alive at work? How many are like part-time slaves, feeling trapped by our jobs and qualifications, working not to become better people but because we see no other choice?

Take hotel workers as an example; 10% of the workforce is in the hospitality industry. There is a lot of untapped potential. Many smart and energetic people endure low pay and long hours because the idea of a hotel has not changed much since the Ritz, which represents an old-fashioned view of luxury. A hotel is not just a place to sleep; it is like a small United Nations where people from around the world meet, often without speaking to each other. Many hotel staff are foreigners eager to learn new languages and cultures, but they often have only superficial interactions with guests.

Hotels could be cultural centers, connecting guests with the city and each other. Hotel owners could use the knowledge of their many student employees instead of assigning them only simple tasks. If they listened to their staff's true ambitions, they would see many other services hotels could offer. However, they are often limited by accountants who say companies should focus on one main activity to maximize profits. It is time to rethink what this means from a human perspective, not just a financial one.

For me, work is about relationships. Many people now want more than just obedience at work; they want to express their independence and personality. They should have the chance to design their own jobs and choose their colleagues and customers, within practical limits. This requires the ability to communicate across different professional languages and connect with people who may seem very different at first.

Everyone understands the importance of communication, but true conversation is different. Traditional conversation is not the same as the new kind of conversation that people feel is missing today. This new conversation is more personal and creates a bond of respect between people, allowing for deeper understanding. It is more than just relaxation; it is a powerful way to establish equality. Every meaningful conversation changes the world, even if just a little."
CPE_24,"**Text: 'BROADCASTING: The Social Shaping of a Technology'**

The term 'broadcasting' originally referred to the act of spreading seeds widely by hand. This idea is not just about farming; it also represents a hopeful view of modern progress. It suggests planned growth that can lead to a fruitful outcome if conditions are favorable. The metaphor implies that there are central resources available for spreading and reproducing this growth.

We need to explore why a new technology that sends words and images electronically was organized in a way that fits this farming metaphor. Although television is linked to two-way communication methods like the telegraph and telephone, it was designed from the beginning as a centralized 'mass' medium. This means that it was set up to send signals from a central source to private homes, which matched the social and economic structures of modern societies.

There were attempts to create different forms of television, but these remained just experiments. Two lesser-known alternatives are worth mentioning because they show what television could have been in a different social setting. In the early 1930s, radio enthusiasts in Britain experimented with two-way television as a possible substitute for regular telephones. Popular science magazines like Radio News published articles on how to build television transmitters and receivers, and many amateur experimenters were active across the country. However, in 1938, the British Radio Manufacturers Association established standards for television equipment and channel regulations that pushed these grassroots innovators out. This marked the end of a potential counter-cultural development of television as a widely accessible and egalitarian form of communication.

Broadcasting was closely linked to strong economic interests and the fundamental structures of modern societies. Despite the efforts of TV amateurs, television was mainly a medium for public viewing in the USA during the early 1930s and was often seen as a competitor to the film industry. In fact, throughout the 1930s, most people experienced television in public places, especially in Britain and Germany.

The idea of grassroots or amateur two-way television was unlikely to succeed, while systems based on collective public viewing were operating in several countries during the 1930s. These systems could have posed a threat to the domestic nature of television, but this threat did not materialize. Manufacturers recognized the potential for mass sales of home television sets once prices dropped. Given the division between public and private life in modern society, centralized broadcasting to a wide domestic audience was the most suitable way to organize the medium.

As working-class people improved their living standards and joined consumer society from the 1920s onward, the dream of the home as a center for entertainment and cultural experiences became a reality for many in Western countries. This trend is now happening globally. There is a clear link between social modernization and the structures of broadcasting. While social and economic changes led to more centralization of power and capital, the breakdown of traditional communities created new lifestyles. People became more mobile, both socially and geographically, which often left them feeling isolated compared to those in more stable early communities.

Centralized broadcasting was a response to the need for governments to efficiently reach all citizens with important information. It also served as a tool for creating a unifying 'imagined community' within the nation-state. The widespread nature of these processes made broadcasting the dominant form for both radio and television.

However, it is important to recognize the positive view of broadcasting as a social form that can support democracy. During the period between the World Wars, many countries saw broadcasting as a way to ensure equal access to the resources needed for informed participation in political, social, and cultural life.

Television is evolving, and there is a risk that the term broadcasting may become outdated or insufficient. If this happens, the metaphor will only refer to a specific organization of audio-visual technology during a certain centralized phase of social modernization."

Sometimes, it feels like no matter how many things you own, you never feel secure. It is normal to want a comfortable home that meets your needs, but there comes a point when the desire to acquire more possessions becomes excessive. Modern advertising is designed to exploit our insecurities. A common message we receive is that if you don’t have certain items, you are somehow less valuable. To see how much advertising affects you, try not to look at any billboards the next time you walk down the street. These expensive messages constantly influence us in persuasive ways, often without us realizing it. We are surrounded by them—on television, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, t-shirts, and the internet—all urging us to buy more.

**Caves**

Research institutions and universities worldwide have spent years studying caves, focusing mainly on their origins, water systems, and ecosystems. Caves are a small but intriguing part of the natural world, sparking our curiosity and desire for knowledge. Because they are natural features, they have been studied for a long time, especially in areas where caves impact our lives. However, exploring many caves requires physical skill, which means that cave research often involves both professional scientists and amateur enthusiasts who visit caves for recreation.

**Weather Watch**

Many observant people, using only their senses, laid the groundwork for meteorology, which has evolved since the 17th century into a complex science. Today, satellites and electronic devices provide us with quick weather information, and computers can solve complicated calculations much faster than humans. Meteorological terms can be difficult for non-experts to understand. However, human experience remains essential in turning data into weather forecasts. Personal observations can still offer valuable insights that help professionals understand the mysteries of the atmosphere."
CPE_16,"**MUSIC AND THEATRE**

Until recently, I believed that opera is mainly theatre. However, after working at a national opera house, I realized that opera is primarily about music, with theatre being secondary. This is how it should be. I come from the theatre world, where the words and the actors are most important. In theatre, once the performance starts, there is no one directing the action, and the performers and audience usually share a common language.

At any musical performance, whether in a concert hall or an opera house, there are many people, like me, who do not have a deep understanding of music. Some may feel embarrassed about their lack of knowledge, while most are amazed by the performers' skills. A talented singer or a skilled string section is easy to admire. Even a decent musician shows the results of years of hard work. Watching top-class music is similar to watching an athletics event; we know athletes are doing something similar to what we do when running for a bus, but we also see how much better they are.

Theatre audiences, on the other hand, have different expectations. They often do not understand the skills of actors and may not be impressed by performances that seem similar to what they could do themselves. They usually do not express awe when an actor delivers a long and difficult speech, even though actors often get asked, ""How do you remember all those lines?"" This does not mean that theatre audiences are less demanding than concert audiences; in fact, many are the same people. It suggests that audiences and performers interact on more equal terms in theatre, regardless of how challenging the material is.

The question is whether music can learn from theatre about this relationship. I believe it can, as I have seen how a different approach can enhance the experience for concert-goers. Live music is inherently theatrical, filled with passion, humor, sadness, and intimacy. It connects with the audience's imagination, both individually and collectively. However, the traditional ways of presenting music, such as strict dress codes and excessive respect for conductors and soloists, create a clear divide between performers and listeners, which can feel uncomfortable.

On the other hand, contemporary music audiences sometimes interrupt performances by applauding between movements or after impressive pieces. While this is often a spontaneous show of appreciation, it can disrupt the overall flow of the performance. Is there a solution? Yes, a lot is being done to attract new audiences to concert halls and opera houses and to break down the barriers that make people feel that ""serious"" music is not for them.

I remember a remarkable event, the community opera ""In Search of Angels,"" which took place in various locations within a cathedral and the surrounding town. It was a high-quality musical experience where the skills and generosity of the professional musicians were central, and it changed many audience members' lives, as they were not just there to watch and listen but also to participate.

What I wish for in music is a bit more of the risk and creativity that the best theatre can show. This can come from using unusual or challenging locations that disrupt normal expectations, creating surprising effects for both performers and audiences. While some comforts may be lost, and the acoustics might not be perfect, theatre audiences have learned to be adventurous in following artists into unexpected spaces.

I understand that most plays are performed in a conventional manner, similar to concerts. However, I believe that the conventions of attending music performances can and should change. My only authority comes from being a passionate fan: I love theatre and spend as much time and money as I can enjoying music. I want both to thrive and for more people to experience the joy I find in being part of the audience."

**Sand**  
While I appreciate how sand can be turned into useful things like glass and concrete, I do not like it in its natural form. To me, it is mainly an annoying barrier between a parking lot and the sea. It blows into your face, gets into your food, and can hide important items like car keys and coins. When you are wet, it sticks to you like glue and is hard to remove, even with a strong hose. However, the moment you step onto a beach towel, get into a car, or walk on a clean carpet, it falls off you easily. For days after, you find small amounts of sand on the floor every time you take off your shoes, and even more when you remove your socks. Sand seems to stay with you longer than many illnesses. So, I would prefer to avoid sand.

**Lock and Key**  
The search for a safe home, privacy, and security has existed since humans first built permanent homes. The simple wooden beam behind a door has changed to electronic locks that use plastic cards with many combinations. However, the desire to keep out intruders remains. The idea of a lock and key is partly psychological. Recently, some companies have tried computerized locking systems, where smart cards control electronic locks. But people do not like these systems. You might accept them at work, but at home, everyone wants the comfort of using a physical key. Therefore, when a locksmith company created a new electronic system, they made sure to include a real metal key.

**Modern Art**  
I felt nervous about visiting the new Tate Modern gallery because, like many people, I find modern art confusing. I know I like some of it, especially furry objects, neon light sculptures, and large photographs. Maybe if I understood it better, I would have more opinions. However, art is not meant to be understood in a strict way. The goal is to let it connect with you. This is a great idea, but it has not worked for me in the past. This new gallery has tried to give visitors real insight into the reasons behind the artworks. The first thing I noticed was the labels, which provided context and explained what the art was about. Instead of staring blankly at the pieces as I used to, these helpful pieces of information allowed me to understand better."
CPE_46,"**Every Picture Tells a Story**

**Adapting Novels for Film**

Turning novels into films often means cutting down the story. This can be frustrating for writers, but it can also be enlightening. While working on a script, I realized that I could remove a lot of dialogue and descriptions from a scene in the novel and still convey the same message. This does not mean that the original dialogue and descriptions were unnecessary. It relates to how each medium engages the audience and the type of repetition they use. 

In a novel, repetition can include reminding readers of character traits or using phrases like ""he said."" A character's trait might only need to be described once, but reminding readers helps them understand better. Usually, we can tell who is speaking in a dialogue scene from the context, but speech tags make it easier to read. 

Stage plays, which are mostly dialogue, mimic real speech with varying levels of style. In some modern plays, the dialogue can seem overly repetitive, serving only to connect the speakers without clearly communicating anything.

**Watching Movies**

When watching movies, people can feel completely immersed in the film's world. This experience allows viewers to escape from reality for the duration of the film. However, once the lights come on, the illusion ends, and viewers return to the real world. People often do not feel accountable for the time spent watching a film, and this sense of unreality can lead to a lack of serious consideration of movies, which some older generations viewed as mere entertainment rather than art.

**The Film Studios**

The Leiper Film Company studios were a confusing mix of buildings. While there were a few recognizable places, like the Script Department, most of the studio consisted of many small, similarly furnished rooms. These rooms were used for both official and unofficial meetings and could only be identified by a strange system of letters and numbers. Finding a specific room without help was quite a challenge. 

The studio lacked a clear main entrance, having three equal entrances that offered no real guidance. For outsiders, this was very confusing, but the studio did not encourage visitors. It was assumed that employees could navigate the space easily. Thanks to their teamwork, stories of romance and adventure would reach audiences everywhere, allowing characters like Jane and George, or Sally and Dick, to escape their everyday lives for a few hours.

**Film-Makers**

Many people seem to want to make movies. Bookstores are filled with guides on scriptwriting and film production, and universities offer related courses. There are even competitions that reward aspiring filmmakers with equipment. Robert Rodriguez, who made the film *El Mariachi* for just $7,000, became a well-known independent director. He reflected on his success, noting that he felt pressure to create his breakthrough film before he turned 26, just like famous directors Orson Welles and Steven Spielberg did.

In the past, filmmakers were expected to take their time to develop their skills. They often worked behind the scenes as editors, writers, or cinematographers, learning the craft by directing low-budget films. For example, John Huston was 35 when he made his first film, *The Maltese Falcon*, and Fred Zinnemann, who directed *High Noon*, found his success in his forties. Today, without the support of studios or television, aspiring filmmakers often have to go their own way."
CPE_3,"In the past, the council houses were spread across the western side of the city, with many rows of small, shabby homes made of orange brick or pale white stucco. In summer, the chemicals from the May and Baker factory, located two miles away, created a strong smell of sulphur that lingered around the doors and gardens. A common sight in that part of Norwich early in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he walked along someone’s front path. I have forgotten much of my early life, but I remember sitting near an upstairs window, looking at the houses as they faded into the distance. 

There are other memories too—faces I cannot name, my mother ironing towels in a house that I don’t think was ours, and snow falling on the turrets of a grand mansion at Earlham. It is not surprising that my mother appears in these early memories. I remember her as a small, precise, and often angry woman, and I never fully understood the reason for her anger, so I could not do anything to make it better. Even as a child, when I went with her to the small shops in Bunnett Square or on longer trips into the city, I sensed something unusual about her personality. She was the most solitary person I have ever known, feeling alone even in a crowded room. 

Her solitude was combined with a strict sense of propriety that was unusual for the West Earlham estate. This sometimes resulted in intense spring-cleaning sessions or strict instructions to ""behave properly."" I found this moral code hard to understand, and even now, I am not sure I fully grasp it. It meant not wandering into neighbors' gardens or damaging their rose bushes while walking down the street; it meant sitting quietly for long periods in a dining room, hands folded, listening to radio programs my mother enjoyed; it meant many rules and restrictions. 

Over time, other figures appeared in these serious early memories. Despite her solitude, my mother had friends. There was Mrs. Buddery, who was obsessed with the Royal Family; Mrs. Winall, who rarely spoke except to agree with others; and Mrs. Laband, who was more lively and not always approved of by the others. Looking back, I realize that this trio was not good company; they often talked about their bad legs, the cold weather, and ungrateful children, a category I often felt I belonged to. 

Reflecting on this, it felt like a heavy weight made up of the West Earlham houses, my mother, her friends, and the pressure to ""behave properly"" rested on my shoulders, and I felt it was my duty to grow up and free myself from it. However, this was not easy. Growing up in West Earlham followed a strict routine. Until you turned five, you stayed at home and got in your parents' way (I remember long, aimless days playing on a rug while my mother sat coldly in an armchair). Then, the September after your fifth birthday, you were sent to Avenue Road infants school, half a mile away. The lucky few had mothers with old bikes and child seats. I think my mother let me go with other children in the street for this journey. 

If I remember anything from those early years, it is the summer holidays, when I caught glimpses of the world outside West Earlham: a vague old man next door to Mrs. Buddery who told stories about his time in the Merchant Navy; a charity fair held at a house far away where a kind woman offered lemonade and tried to interest me in something called the League of Pity, a kind of junior charity. My mother dismissed it, saying the organizers were ""only after your money."" My mother often spoke about mercenary motives, and she held politicians in deep contempt. If she thought of the House of Commons, it was as a place where wealthy people opened letters filled with money sent by a gullible public. 

I may exaggerate and overlook her good qualities while focusing on her flaws. However, there was little kindness in my mother; it seemed to have been taken from her. To be fair, she was aware of her role in my education. Occasionally on Sundays, she would take me, dressed in my ""good clothes,"" on the 85 bus to the Norwich Castle Museum. Hand-in-hand, we would walk through rooms filled with paintings by the Norwich School of Artists. My mother was not completely against this activity and eventually developed some opinions about the art. I remember her stopping in front of a painting of a Roman soldier in full armor and saying, ""Well, I wouldn't want to meet him on a dark night!"" This was one of the few times I remember my mother trying to make a joke."
CPE_10,"**Text: Philadelphia Avenue**

I walked down the odd-numbered side of Philadelphia Avenue. The evening was getting darker, and the air was humid with a light drizzle that made my walk feel secretive. I knew this side of the street well; I remembered our neighbors, the Matzes and the Pritchards, Han Kieffer's grocery store, and the houses of my first playmates, all girls. Although I didn’t know everyone by name, each house was as familiar to me as the small troughs in the sidewalk that carried rainwater from the roofs to the street, which I often skated or scooted over. 

As the street sloped down, I noticed a slight decline in the social status of the houses: the porches were lower, and the front yards were smaller. Over the years, things changed: wooden porch railings were replaced with wrought iron in a style that reminded me of the South or Spain. In Shillington, houses I remembered as homes had turned into stores, and strangely, some stores, like Pep Conrad's and Han Kieffer's, had become homes again. I wondered how the residents used those open spaces and how they lived with the lingering smells of the goods that used to be sold there.

**Bachelor Fads Furniture Designer Rick Gilbert**

Rick Gilbert's apartment used to be a curtain warehouse. It has the typical features of a loft, like exposed brick and large doors that once allowed curtains to be lifted from trains on the nearby railway. However, Gilbert did not want a completely open space for both practical and aesthetic reasons. ""In my last place, my living and working areas were mixed. It was hard to relax or start working when everything was in view,"" he explained. 

To create a more defined space, he used a large piece of corrugated plastic near the entrance. ""It hides the office, creates a hallway, and leads to the kitchen in the middle of the apartment. I wanted the kitchen to be a neutral space where I could cook for friends or make coffee for clients."" To balance the modern look of his plastic screen and stainless steel kitchen, Gilbert chose light wood for the floors. His apartment is filled with futuristic chairs and sofas, but it also has sentimental furniture given to him by his parents or found at markets.

**Bruce Chatwin**

Bruce Chatwin's life was a mix of adventure and mystery, making it a topic of much discussion. He was a talented and unique writer. His first book, *In Patagonia*, published in 1977, changed travel writing. It reads like a thrilling story, with the charm of romantic fiction and deep insights. However, even in this book, Chatwin mixed facts with fiction; he often changed details to make his stories more interesting or to highlight the deeper meanings of travel, suggesting that exploring new places could reveal hidden histories.

**Swimming**

During a warm summer rain, I rushed across my lawn and jumped into the pool. As I swam, I kept my eyes just above the water. Each raindrop created a small splash that turned into bubbles. The best moments were when the rain got heavier, drowning out the birdsong, and steam rose from the water as if the pool was reaching up to the sky. 

In the summer of 1996, while enjoying this rain, I began to think about swimming across Britain. I wanted to follow the rain as it traveled to the sea, escaping the frustration of my usual swimming routine, where I felt trapped like a tiger in a cage. Many of us live in a world where everything is labeled and explained, which makes reality feel more like a visual experience. This is why walking, cycling, and swimming can feel rebellious. They help us reconnect with the wild and ancient parts of our world, allowing us to explore beyond the usual paths and discover the mysteries that still exist."
CPE_67,"**Text: 'CRYING** 

Charles Darwin believed that crying in humans did not have a clear purpose in evolution. However, he was likely mistaken. Recently, scientists have emphasized the social importance of crying. Psychiatrist John Bowlby pointed out that crying helps create a bond between a mother and her child. Many people think that tears, especially in children, mainly show feelings of helplessness. 

Understanding why adults cry is more complicated. It appears that the sound of crying is less important than the visual message it sends. Crying may have been beneficial for early human groups by helping to build trust and social connections. 

There are also other reasons for crying. We might cry to show sympathy for those facing great injustice. Additionally, we can cry unexpectedly, often feeling embarrassed, when we hear touching music or inspiring speeches. We are more likely to cry while watching a sad movie if we are with others rather than when we are alone. The social role of crying seems clear, but research is ongoing.'"
CPE_27,"**Text: The Heat is On**

We have all heard about global warming, but how much warmer will the Earth become, and how will it affect our lives? Most people understand the basics of global warming, but few know its consequences. A warmer climate is likely to change the weather everywhere. Since the atmosphere is connected to every part of our planet, any climate changes will significantly impact plants, animals, water, and soil. Humans have learned to use these natural resources to our advantage, allowing us to grow food, build cities, and support billions of people. Therefore, any changes to these resources must be taken seriously.

The challenge we face is understanding how the world will change and what is causing these changes. Over the last century, human activities have significantly increased the levels of certain gases in the atmosphere, which are closely linked to global temperatures. These rising gas levels are likely already affecting the global climate, but our limited knowledge of the Earth's heat balance makes it hard to predict the current and future situations. 

We know that greenhouse gas levels have varied in close relation to global temperatures over the past 40,000 years, suggesting a strong connection between the two. Evidence indicates that the Earth's surface has warmed by about 6°C over the last 100 years. Most scientists believe this warming is not entirely natural and is partly due to human pollution. 

A lot of research has been done to predict the effects of higher global temperatures. Most of this research uses computer models called general circulation models (GCMs). These models use the laws of physics and chemistry to analyze how temperature, pressure, solar radiation, and other climate factors interact to predict past, present, and future climate conditions. However, these models simplify reality and have many limitations. Their results are only estimates, and they can be slow and costly to run. 

Despite these challenges, most people agree on one important point: the rate of climate change will be faster than anything we have experienced before. The predictions from GCMs help us understand the conditions of the world we will live in over the next few generations. Currently, they suggest that the average global surface temperature could rise by 1°C to 3.5°C by 2100, sea levels could increase by 15 to 95 cm, and changes in rainfall patterns are expected. Scientists also predict that extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, floods, and droughts, will become more common in some areas. 

These forecasts highlight the potential impact of climate change on the environment and humanity. Changes in climate could affect where ecosystems, like forests and grasslands, are located, the types of species they contain, and their ability to provide essential resources for society. This includes food production, water supply, and human settlements. Some effects may be irreversible and could be harmful in many regions, but not all impacts will be negative. In fact, some climate change effects may be beneficial. 

For example, in Australia, research has shown that wheat yields have increased by about 0.5 tonnes per hectare since 1952, partly due to climate trends. Warmer temperatures have led to fewer frosts, which has reduced damage to crops. However, many predicted effects of future warming are concerning. Even small climate changes can affect water availability, especially in dry regions or areas already facing shortages. 

The Mediterranean Basin is one example where decreasing rainfall has been observed, particularly in western-central areas. In southern Portugal, rainfall is now more concentrated in autumn and winter, with less in spring. Another worrying effect is the change in glacial processes, which will impact ice and, in turn, affect vegetation, wildlife habitats, and human structures. There is a strong possibility that Arctic ice will melt completely, making marine transport and oil exploration easier but increasing the risk of icebergs.

Perhaps the most dramatic effect of global warming will be rising sea levels. This will happen because warmer water expands and ice melts. With about half of the world's population living in coastal areas, rising sea levels could have severe consequences. Increased flooding and inundation are likely, affecting cities like London, New York, and Tokyo. Many people could lose their homes and livelihoods, leading to millions of environmental refugees. 

The most severe consequences may be faced by small, low-lying island nations, which could disappear entirely if worst-case scenarios occur. This would be devastating not only for the people and cultures of these islands but also for the countries that would need to take in those displaced."

The 2018 deadline is set because the next time Mars and Earth align for a launch will be in 2031. It is a challenging task, but there is a race to develop new technologies. If these technologies are ready in time, the spacecraft might succeed. Even if it never leaves Earth, the efforts to reach these goals will still be valuable for future missions.'"
CPE_44,"**AESTHETICS**

The existence of artworks, which are the basis for aesthetic theory, can actually hinder our understanding of them. This is because artworks are physical objects, like buildings, books, paintings, or statues, that exist separately from human experience. However, the true essence of an artwork lies in how it interacts with our experiences. This separation can make it difficult to grasp their meaning.

Moreover, the high regard for certain artworks, due to their long history of admiration, creates established ideas that can block new perspectives. Once an artwork is considered a classic, it often becomes disconnected from the human experiences that led to its creation and the effects it has on our lives. When artworks are viewed apart from their origins and their impact on our experiences, it becomes challenging to understand their broader significance, which is what aesthetic theory aims to explore. Art is then seen as something separate, removed from the everyday human efforts and achievements.

A key task for anyone writing about the philosophy of fine arts is to reconnect the refined experiences that artworks provide with the everyday events and struggles that everyone recognizes as part of life. Just as mountains are not isolated but are part of the earth's processes, artworks should not be seen as separate from human experience. Those studying the earth, like geographers and geologists, work to show this connection, and similarly, art theorists must do the same.

If we accept this idea, we may reach a surprising conclusion: to truly understand artworks, we may need to temporarily set them aside and focus on the ordinary experiences that we usually do not think of as aesthetic. We must take a detour to reach a deeper understanding of art. While it is possible to enjoy flowers for their beauty and scent without knowing about plants, understanding how they grow requires knowledge of the interactions between soil, air, water, and sunlight.

To grasp the aesthetic in its most profound forms, we must start with raw experiences—those moments and scenes that capture our attention and bring us joy. However, many people are so influenced by the idea that art is something special and separate that they might be surprised to learn that they enjoy their everyday activities partly because of their aesthetic qualities. 

The arts that resonate most with people today often do not fit traditional definitions of art. For example, movies, jazz, comic strips, and even sensational news stories are forms of art that many people appreciate. When art is confined to museums and galleries, the natural desire for enjoyable experiences finds expression in everyday life. 

Many who criticize the museum view of art still hold onto the misconception that art should be separate from ordinary experiences. The most appreciation for distinguished artworks occurs when they are closely linked to the products of everyday life."
CPE_22,"**Text: Observing Lions**

In popular culture, lions hunting for food are often seen as a remarkable display of teamwork. As the sun sets, a group of stealthy lions emerges from the shadows and surrounds their unsuspecting prey. They appear to be ideal social animals, setting aside minor disagreements to work together for a common goal: their next meal. However, after many years of studying these animals in the wild, we have come to a different understanding. When we began our research in 1978, we wanted to find out why lions hunt together, raise cubs, and scare off rivals with their roars. If we measure the success of an animal's behavior by how many offspring survive, then cooperation may not always be beneficial. If one animal is too generous, its partners may take advantage of it. So, why do lions seem to ignore the rules of self-interest? We thought we would solve this question in two to three years. But lions are very good at being inactive. We would add them to the list of unreactive noble gases like krypton, argon, and neon. Therefore, we needed various research methods to find clues about their behavior. Since wild lions can live up to 18 years, we are only now beginning to understand the answers to our questions.

**Pop Music Review**

The release of Bedrock's third album was a significant moment for a talented but previously unstable band. ""New Life"" started a movement that changed rock music in this country for the rest of the decade. Gone were the serious themes, dull clothing, and loud guitars of the past; instead, a lighter mix of melodic local styles emerged. Social commentary and strong emotions blended with sounds from fairground organs and brass bands. Humor and irony were prominent, and the singers proudly expressed their backgrounds. The album showed Bedrock as skilled collectors and observers, as well as versatile songwriters. They playfully explored traditional English themes like sunbathing and Sunday afternoons. However, the album's true strength lay in its deep, gentle sadness found in songs like ""So Low,"" a beautiful tune related to weather, and ""To the Brink,"" a serious ballad. The beauty of ""New Life"" is its consistently high quality—16 tracks with no filler, an unmatched achievement in the era of lengthy CDs.

**Extract from an Autobiography**

As a child, I was always intrigued by stories of 'The Sibyl,' those wise women who had great influence in ancient times. At first, I only knew of one from a story my mother told me. An old woman from Cumae offered Tarquin, the King of Rome, nine books for 300 gold pieces. When he refused, she burned three of them and offered him six for the same price. When he refused again, she burned three more. He finally bought the last three for the full price. I realized even then that there was a deep truth in this story—a lesson in sales and life. I was often a lonely only child. I would ask to play with other kids and be turned down. My mother advised me to do something so interesting that the other children would want to join me. It worked, and it’s a lesson I’ve never forgotten. When I had the chance to write a travel book, I needed to find a topic that mattered to me. I’m not a keen traveler; at the first chance, I sent my editor a long list of places I didn’t want to visit. Ultimately, I’m only interested in ruins because I prefer to travel through time in my mind.

**What Happens to Your Manuscript?**

When you submit your manuscript, it will likely join a pile waiting for someone to review it—the so-called slush pile. This person is usually either a junior member of the editorial team (often under 18) or an experienced freelancer who works a few mornings a week. Neither has much power, but they are generally supportive and looking for something original. The junior member hopes to make a name for themselves and find an author, while the experienced freelancer wants to justify their job. If they find your novel promising, they will pass it to a senior editor, and it will eventually be discussed in a meeting. The editor who supports your novel must justify its acceptance based on its quality and potential sales, as well as whether you seem like a promising long-term author. They will also consider how marketable you are, which is important when a new novel needs all the support it can get. For this reason, publishers often prefer to meet potential authors before making an offer."
CPE_39,"**Text: Advertising on Trial**

If you work in an advertising agency, the early 1990s may have been very challenging for you. The recession was worse than expected, affecting industrialized countries for thirty years. In Britain, in 1991, the economy shrank, interest rates were very high, consumer spending dropped on almost everything except basic needs, over half a million people lost their jobs, and around 75,000 homes were taken back by banks. Every business was impacted, with some industries, like vehicles and construction, seeing a 30% decline. Many people and companies around the world suffered.

While advertising professionals were not the only ones losing jobs, those who remained often felt a lot of pressure. They were seen as responsible for helping companies make money, which meant they were closely watched by their colleagues and bosses. They also faced the challenge of doing their increasingly difficult jobs with smaller budgets. They were told that doing less could be more effective. At the same time, the importance of marketing was growing. Companies began to realize they needed to create products and services that customers actually wanted, rather than just what was easy for them to provide. This idea has been around for a long time, but it was only in the last ten to fifteen years that many companies started to take it seriously.

As a result, marketing activities began to receive more attention from management, and some brands started to be genuinely marketed. This increased the status of marketing professionals, but it also added to their workload. Marketing was often seen as a solution to all problems, even though about half of marketing budgets were spent on advertising. While the 1980s were a great time for advertising, the early 1990s brought the worst downturn in a generation. This was partly due to the economic situation, but there were also deeper changes that would not simply go away when the economy improved.

During the recession, potential clients reviewed and often cut their advertising budgets. They also looked more closely at the effectiveness of advertising. Many companies concluded that the benefits of advertising were uncertain. With a strong desire to account for every dollar spent, it was unclear to many clients what they were actually getting for their money and what return they were seeing on their investment. Advertising, which has always faced skepticism, was under more scrutiny than ever.

Client companies expressed a desire for better strategies, targeting, creativity, media placement, and thinking. They wanted the best people from advertising agencies to work on their projects and to be motivated to produce excellent work. While this situation does not necessarily evoke sympathy for the advertising industry, it means that many advertising professionals still face the same challenges as their clients: how to achieve more with less.

In addition to these challenges, several other factors made effective advertising difficult. Some of these were direct results of the recession, such as debates over production costs and a reluctance to take risks, which are often essential for good advertising. Other changes would have occurred regardless of the economy, including significant demographic shifts in the West, the growing power of retailers, changing consumer needs, the rise of sponsorship, and stricter legal regulations on advertising. Additionally, some companies faced the new challenge of advertising internationally.

Together with the economic situation, these factors forced advertising professionals to reconsider the saying by Lord Leverhulme: ""Only half my advertising works. The trouble is I don't know which half."" Now, more than ever, there is pressure to increase the effectiveness of advertising. It is not surprising that help for those wanting to improve is not easily available. Companies and advertising agencies have been too busy dealing with these challenges to discuss them, and those who have managed to succeed often want to keep their strategies private. As a result, while conferences and seminars may offer some useful insights, the available books on advertising often do not provide practical guidance. Many of these books treat the advertising process with too much respect, suggesting that the work produced by advertising agencies is always of the highest quality and value, which is not true and does not help the employees responsible for the results."
CPE_18,"**The Allure of the Kitchen**

When I was in university, I decided I wanted to become a chef. This was an unusual choice among my peers. Cooking was not a popular career option. On the surface, it seems like an unattractive job. Chefs often have tough lives: the work is long, stressful, repetitive, and poorly paid. However, these factors did not discourage me. I was unhappy at university. The work was difficult, and the social scene felt closed and self-important. Becoming a chef seemed like the perfect escape from the intellectual and social pretensions of college life. It offered a seriousness and integrity that I felt was missing in my studies.

My desire to cook was not just a reaction to my student life; it also reflected a deeper appreciation for food. My first taste of this passion came when I had a meal at a famous restaurant in London. It was a revelation. I still remember my starter clearly. After that meal, I felt like bowing down in gratitude to the chef who created it. I felt light and happy for days. This experience sparked a strong desire in me to learn the secrets of this wonderful art. I turned my student life into a preparation for my future in cooking. My history degree became a distraction from my true goal. I learned about cooking in a chaotic and incomplete way by reading cookbooks, exploring markets, and preparing elaborate meals.

**Extract from a Novel**

The school's swimming instructor was a former drill sergeant, small and muscular, with tattooed arms. When I asked him to teach me how to dive, he told me to sit on the edge of the pool, raise my hands above my head, and roll forward, pushing off with my feet. I practiced this move until the hour was over. On my next visit, he had me stand up and dive off the edge. The instructor was strict, and every time I surfaced, he looked at me with disapproval: ""Don't look down, look up!"" ""Keep your legs straight."" ""Point your toes!"" The following week, I climbed up to the high diving board. It was fixed and slightly bent at the front. It seemed very high as I stood there, trying to gather my courage. Gradually, the noise faded away, and I felt as if I were in a bubble of silence. I waved my arms as I had been taught, tried to look up instead of down, and jumped into the air. For a brief moment, I felt like I was flying. When I hit the water, I fell awkwardly, and my legs flailed. The instructor looked at me with disdain and shook his head. But even he could not take away my joy. I thought, ""This is what they mean by 'free as a bird.'""

**The Traveller**

For those of us who value a comfortable bed, running water, and the chance to live at least until tomorrow, the idea of a traveller seems both strange and fascinating. These are people who have given in to the tempting call of the unknown. They choose to risk their lives by climbing dangerous mountains, sailing alone on small boats through huge waves, and eating insects if there is nothing else to eat. They can live for months in uncertainty. It is easy to see such people as oddities, and indeed they are, often considered eccentric: hermits, extreme divers, or writers. While their existence is undeniable, the unusual world they inhabit is far from our everyday lives, and we can dismiss it as irrelevant. We can shrug and return to our lives with microwaves and answering machines, relieved that our own risks are predictable, like crossing a busy street.

**SAILING**

Jonathan Raban is afraid of the sea, which is probably why he spends so much time on it. He does not claim to be a top sailor, but he is clearly skilled. His main reason for sailing is that, as a writer, he enjoys writing about his sailing experiences. Sailing provides him with exciting stories to tell. Raban's small boat has a device that shows sailors their exact location anywhere on Earth. While he appreciates this tool, he also believes that the invention of the compass was a mistake. He thinks it has created a gap between people and the sea. Since the compass was invented about a thousand years ago, sailors have focused on it instead of observing the waves and feeling the ocean. The sea, once full of life, has become just a space to navigate. Because of this, the person steering the boat can often be replaced by an autopilot. This might be why Raban has time to carefully observe the waves."
CPE_62,"**Holiday Reading**

Summer brings us two great joys: escaping home and reading books. These joys are closely connected. Books can help us feel more at home in the world. We can relate our own experiences to those in great books from the past or from faraway places because there are fewer types of people than there are individuals. In the writings of others, we find our own thoughts, embarrassments, and dramas. Authors can express feelings we thought we were alone in experiencing, using words we might struggle to find. What is shy and confused within us is clearly and powerfully expressed in their work, especially if it was written by someone from a different time or place. We feel thankful to these authors for reminding us of who we are. Through reading and travel, we break free from the dullness of routine. Our eyes are most open during the first few days in a new place, or perhaps while reading a great book, which reveals things we had previously overlooked. Our minds become like radar, picking up on details we hadn’t noticed before, such as the colors of the sky, the changing expressions on a face, the insincerity of a friend, or a sadness we didn’t know we felt.

**Author's Note**

These reflections on travel were published as articles in the Observer newspaper over seven years. I have made some small edits to fit the articles to the page, but otherwise, I have added very little. I corrected a few obvious mistakes, but only if they were minor details I should have gotten right initially. With hindsight, I could have made more improvements, but that would have taken too long. For example, in the second article about China, I thought the Hong Kong dollar would remain strong, but a year later it fell. If I rewrote it to predict this, it would no longer be a report from that time. Like any traveler in Southeast Asia or elsewhere, I was there in that moment, unaware of what would happen next, and focused on understanding what had already occurred. This is the true story of mass air travel: the world opening up to people who have no special qualifications to explore it except the price of a ticket. However, I have never believed that all my fellow travelers were completely unaware. Even a postcard can have a purpose.

**Ecotourism**

If there were awards for tourism phrases that have been misused, ""ecotourism"" would win first prize. The term first appeared in the early 1980s, reflecting a growing awareness of environmental issues and a realization by tour operators that many travelers wanted to ensure their presence abroad would not harm the environment. It quickly became a popular marketing term for holidays. Today, the ecotourism label includes everything from two-week tours with remote tribes to one-hour boat trips through Australian gorges. Any tour that involves cultural experiences, beautiful natural spots, wildlife, or a bit of adventure is likely to be labeled as ecotourism. While the original intentions behind the movement were good, the lack of regulations and a clear definition left many travelers confused in an ecotourism maze.

**Transylvanian Journey**

I lost my notebook from my journey in Transylvania for 50 years, but I found it again a few years ago by chance. It has helped me remember that time and write about it, but it was not as reliable as I hoped. In Transylvania, I had a much easier time than I expected, moving from one welcoming country house to another, often staying for weeks. When I settled down during those long stays, my writing stopped too; I thought there was nothing to record. I was often slow to start writing again when I moved on, and even then, quick notes sometimes replaced longer narratives. Worried that some details might be out of order when I began writing this book, I surrounded these sections with many warnings. However, I realized that these pages were not meant to be a guidebook, so I decided it didn’t matter much, allowing the story to unfold without unnecessary complications."
CPE_49,"**Text: Fashion**

Fashion is often thought of as a recent development, mainly influenced by capitalism in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. However, many fashion historians argue that the concept of style and design has a much longer history. They often trace its beginnings to the growth of trade in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. As societies have become more complex, populations have grown, and new technologies for making various types of clothing and accessories have emerged, the meanings associated with dress have also become more complex. Therefore, it is challenging to determine what any piece of clothing or accessory truly signifies today. For instance, a man's suit, which is often seen as a symbol of uniformity, can have very different meanings depending on the context and the person interpreting it.

**Writer**

Reports about publishers competing for popular manuscripts can create a misleading image of life for most novelists. In my experience, which is not exactly filled with best-sellers, there are two main ways to make a living. The smartest writers work in the evenings and have other full-time jobs that will still be there if their book is not quickly published or made into a film. Others, like me, take on various writing-related jobs, such as teaching, leading workshops, and writing articles. I have heard of a writing job at a chocolate factory, but I have never found anything like that. Somehow, by balancing part-time jobs and using credit cards, and often thanks to the kindness of those mentioned in the Acknowledgements section of books, I manage to write my novel.

**Sudden Fame**

The small venues where we performed across the country were starting to sell out, and we needed extra security to manage the growing number of excited fans. We had to use secret entrances to avoid being overwhelmed by admirers at the village halls and ballrooms where we played. On the few nights we were not performing, it was hard to leave the house without being followed by enthusiastic fans. In just a few days, we became celebrities. Our actions were closely watched by our fans, and our management took care of all our needs. Although my natural shyness never completely disappeared, it was replaced by a strange, naive confidence that only people who are usually shy and suddenly find themselves in the spotlight can understand. In short, I felt completely out of my depth emotionally."
CPE_31,"**Text: Music - The Future Ahead**

Technological advances are changing our lives at work, home, and during our free time. Susan Hallam talks about how these changes affect music in Britain. In the late 20th century, there was a quick rise in ways to listen to music, such as through radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, videos, and new multimedia technologies. However, this has led to fewer live music performances and fewer full-time jobs for professional musicians. 

It is clear that access to music will keep growing, as it meets many human needs. On a national level, no important state event is without music. For individuals, music offers many activities, both formal and informal. A society without music is hard to imagine. The question is not whether there will be music in the 21st century, but what kind of music it will be and if people will still want to learn to play instruments. I believe that people will continue to want to learn instruments. The music industry is a major source of income in Britain, and musical skills will remain important for various jobs, especially in media-related fields.

Moreover, there is increasing evidence that playing an instrument can help develop skills early on. Research in the USA suggests that listening to or making music positively affects spatial reasoning, which is one way to measure intelligence. While these findings need more confirmation, studies from Europe show that group music lessons can improve social relationships in schools and help young children focus, especially those with behavioral issues. 

Current research is also looking into how playing an instrument might help develop transferable skills. For example, regular practice can lead to good study habits and concentration, while performing in concerts can teach punctuality and organization. Because of these reasons, there will likely be a continued demand for instrumental teaching in the near future.

What about the long-term future? Will there be a change in focus, and if so, what will it be? I believe two main possibilities are likely. First, the types of music people listen to will become more varied, with new genres that mix different styles. Second, technology will play a bigger role in composing and performing music. This will make it easier to create music without needing advanced technical skills, but it may also reduce the need for live performances and musicians focused only on that.

At the same time, more people of all ages will want to participate in making music. These activities will likely be community-based and reflect the musical traditions of those communities. If this vision for the future is to happen, what should the music profession do to prepare? 

The focus of instrumental teaching will need to change. We must find ways for more people to learn to play different instruments throughout their lives. This will require changes in the instrumental curriculum and how we assess progress, making them relevant to a wider population. Ultimately, we will need to include a broader range of musical skills.

Training for musicians will be crucial for this process. They must be able to motivate, inspire, and teach learners of all ages, work with large and diverse groups, and develop communication, social, entrepreneurial, and management skills for community work. This represents a significant change from traditional methods and will require a response to demands for public accountability. 

Positively, this change will allow those involved in music education to showcase the high quality of music teaching available. Finally, we must work to raise the profile of music itself. Music is essential in our lives, but it is often taken for granted. Everyone in the music profession needs to collaborate actively to ensure this changes."
CPE_58,"**The Actor's Craft**

Actors sometimes face criticism and scorn. Much of this negativity comes from the actors themselves when they are asked to discuss their work in interviews. They should respond like the dancer Pavlova, who said, ""If I could tell you what I mean when I dance, I wouldn't need to dance."" Instead, actors often fall into tired clichés or gossip. Paul Scofield once wrote to a friend, saying that an actor's work is only alive when performed. Discussing it makes it feel empty and theoretical. Each time an actor performs, they start anew, learning from the characters and the writer. After a play ends, they feel empty until the next performance, and this emptiness shows in discussions about acting.

**A Review of Hamlet**

Adrian Lester's portrayal of Hamlet is a delicate balance between youth and maturity, showcasing thrilling simplicity and confidence. His control over the text and his physical presence elevate him from a promising actor to a leading performer. Lester plays a young man filled with suppressed anger, using sharp wit and humor that make him both intimidating and endearing. His performance is skillful, evident in how his body language conveys a character waiting to be brought to life. Handy's portrayal of Horatio similarly suggests a character moved by an inner force.

**What is Acting?**

What does it mean to act? Is acting merely copying behavior, or does it bring something deeper to life? This question lies at the heart of theatre.

**One Director's Approach to Rehearsal**

This director's rehearsal begins with a process called ""dropping in."" The stage manager displays the script on a screen. While one person speaks, the actors listen quietly, absorbing the impact of the words. When it’s their turn, they look at the screen, understand the first phrase, reflect on its meaning, and wait for the impulse to speak. For example, if the line is, ""Queuing all night, the rain, do you remember?"" they breathe and let the thought come to them. They might visualize a queue at a bus stop or a concert. After imagining the scene, they find the motivation to say the line, which the director calls ""the pathway to the line."" Impulses can come from outside or within. Actors should connect with their fellow performers and their characters without overthinking. They should approach the moment with an open mind, trusting that something will emerge.

**The Perfect Theatre**

The ideal theatre should make you feel that your presence matters. Attending a live performance is a special event, and the staff should recognize this. It feels isolating if the people working at the theatre treat it like just a job. The theatre must create a connection between the performers and the audience. No audience member should feel they are getting a biased view of the actor. It’s crucial that they can see, hear, and feel connected to what happens on stage. The design of the auditorium is important; it should suit the human voice and body. If the space is too large, it can diminish the human experience at the heart of drama. Many theatres built in the late nineteenth century succeeded in creating an auditorium that embraces the stage. I appreciate theatres that carry a sense of history, like worn stone steps in a church, which reflect layers of human experience. 

When it comes to plays, you cannot please everyone. You cannot predict what an audience will want to see. When you go to the theatre, you seek something unexpected; otherwise, you might as well stay home."
CPE_37,"**Text:**

**Paul Simon**  
Rock and roll in the 1950s was mainly a music movement for young people, but it had a significant effect on the middle class and older adults. It also opened doors for the next generation of rock stars, who listened in awe, knowing that this unique and exciting music would be connected to their futures. For Paul Simon and other young people in the US, the best way to hear this new music was through Alan Freed's radio show, Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party. Freed's show was essential listening for many young rock stars. Like John Lennon, who was 3,000 miles away in Liverpool, listening to Radio Luxembourg—the only European station playing rock and roll—Paul Simon was captivated by the sounds from Freed's show. He was getting ready for the next big step for a teenager obsessed with rock and roll: moving from listening to creating his own music.

**Snow**  
No path was visible, but I thought I would be okay if I walked carefully. The wind blew hard from above, pushing me over as I slipped on the icy ground. Suddenly, the snow that looked innocent gave way beneath me. I fell into a hole about four feet deep. The snow had formed a roof over the gap between two rocks, which melted away, leaving only a thin layer that I fell through. I pulled myself out, shaken and scared, wondering what I would have done if the hole had been thirty feet deep. I leaned against a pine tree sticking out of the snow to think about my situation. In an hour, I had only gone about half a mile. It was clear that I would have to give up my plan.

**Qualitative Research**  
There are many books that try to help researchers understand qualitative research. While a lot has been said about collecting data, these books often do not explain how to analyze that data. There is still much mystery about how researchers analyze their findings. Therefore, we invited various social scientists who have worked on qualitative projects to share the methods they used. The goal was to provide insight into the process of qualitative data analysis, rather than to create a guidebook for new researchers. This task involves making unclear processes clearer. While this may seem easy, we have found it quite challenging. We have allowed our contributors to present their work in different styles, including personal stories and more formal approaches."
CPE_2,"**Text: Screen Learning**

Recently, I saw my six-year-old son eating noodles in a funny way. He was pulling them up with his teeth and pretending to be a dinosaur. ""I'm a little dinosaur,"" he said. He was acting out a scene from a TV show, so I asked him what he remembered about dinosaurs. He didn’t remember much. 

There is a trend to use the internet and computers for learning, but is learning from a screen effective? One writer shared his experience with an interactive program he tried with his son. The father read the words while the son played with the pictures. The father thought that if his son had spent ten minutes reading a book, he might have learned something. 

Research shows that learning happens best in environments where there is conversation with teachers or parents. Learning needs guidance. Using new technology to teach our children is fine, but traditional education still plays an important role.

**Hollywood**

By 1918, most of the world’s film-making had moved to Hollywood. The local people were not happy, seeing their neighborhood in Los Angeles changed by these newcomers. However, they eventually accepted this change because of the American value of success, measured by box-office earnings. 

Hollywood can recognize a good film, one that can create stars and make money. In less than a century, Hollywood has transformed from a small village to a town as famous as New York, Rome, or Paris. Physically, it has changed a lot; a hundred years ago, you would walk through orange groves to get to the village store. Yet, in some ways, it still feels like a small village, focused on films: how much money they make, who is dating whom, and who is working on which project. 

Many successful people in Hollywood try to escape the area, wanting to work there but live elsewhere. Still, it remains the place where almost everyone in show business wants to be.

**Photography**

Photography was created by artists in the nineteenth century as a way to capture their surroundings. They wanted a lasting record of what they saw, and photography provided that. The combination of light, lenses, and chemical-coated surfaces produced images that were more detailed and realistic than what painters could create in a long time. 

This new art form surprised other artists. At first, they were pleased, but then they claimed that photography could not be considered art because it relied too much on mechanical processes. They believed that photography was too connected to reality to be an expression of creativity. 

Despite the criticism, photographers recognized that they had discovered a new way to express themselves. They used photography like other artists use brushes and pencils—to interpret the world and present their vision of nature and people.

**Book Illustration**

During the time of black-and-white book illustrations, it was clear that every children's book needed illustrations. This also applied to many novels for older readers, which saw a decline as fewer copies were printed. 

Children's publishing remained active, but it was often low-budget, leading to many average works. However, the best artists always submitted their best work. Therefore, the collection of black-and-white illustrations is a mix of both valuable and less impressive pieces, making it a great place for research and discovery. 

The true treasures from this period will likely be displayed again, either through reprints of classic titles or new publications about the artists. There are signs that interest in this art form is growing, and we may soon see a publisher create a series of classic children's book illustrations from this time, either as reprints or new editions using the original artwork."
CPE_68,"**Text: Blogging: Sharing Our Lives Online**

Not long ago, a website warned about the dangers of public check-ins, which are online announcements of where you are. The website's message was clear: while you might think you are simply saying, ""Hey, I'm here,"" you are also letting many people know your location—some of whom you might not want to meet. This reflects a growing understanding that there can be negative consequences to the constant sharing that the internet encourages. 

The internet offers many chances to share every part of our lives with a global audience, which can seem exciting: wealth, fame, and more! However, as we dive into the online world, sharing personal stories and photos, we may find ourselves overwhelmed and lost in the chaos. This might sound discouraging, but there is hope. The future has been mapped out for us by early internet pioneers who explored these challenges long ago.

In the early days of the web, these pioneers faced many difficulties. They lost jobs, made and lost friends, and dealt with the temptations of fame—all before social media existed. These early bloggers experienced what many of us are now going through. It is important to learn from their experiences. 

In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting on the web, which was mostly used by graduate students and scientists. The web was created at CERN, a physics lab in Switzerland, to help researchers share their work. Hall saw a different opportunity: to share his life. He created a personal website filled with stories, photos, and art. In January 1996, he began a daily blog, attracting many readers who were fascinated by his boldness in using this new medium. Hall's approach was open; anyone who crossed his path could be featured on his site, and no topic was off-limits. While some might see this as attention-seeking, there was also a unique beauty to his work.

However, one day, visitors to Hall's site found it replaced by a video titled ""Dark Night."" In this video, he shared that he had fallen deeply in love, but when he wrote about it online, he was told, ""either the blog goes, or I do."" Hall felt that sharing his life online made people distrust him. The blog was removed, but the issue remains. Sharing online can be wonderful, but if you think that sharing your life will make people want to be around you, you might be disappointed.

In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a young woman in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, an anonymous coworker shared her blog's address with the company's vice presidents, including some she had criticized, which led to her losing her job. Researchers studying online behavior have a term for this: the ""online distribution effect,"" which describes how people often feel they can say things online that they would never say in person. However, our online lives are connected to our real lives, and ignoring this can lead to serious mistakes.

Armstrong's story had a happy ending. Although she was upset and stopped blogging for a while, she eventually got married and started a new blog focused on her family. Today, she is a well-known ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her household. Once seen as an example of the risks of online sharing, she has now mastered the art of sharing her life wisely. Armstrong's experience teaches us an important lesson: while the internet allows us to say anything, that doesn't mean we should."
CPE_23,"**Text: Enough Sleep?**

Tiredness is often seen as a common issue in modern life. As wealthier and busier countries have developed, sleeplessness and anxiety have also increased. Research in the USA shows that 40 million Americans suffer from chronic sleep problems. Some popular novels in Britain have even featured characters who cannot sleep or have settings in sleep research labs. This growing interest in sleep includes its patterns, its importance, and the problems people face with it. A leading sleep researcher states, ""People need more sleep."" Many people reduce their sleep when they are busy, often waking up early to avoid traffic.

Recently, a sleep researcher conducted an experiment. He allowed participants to sleep for up to 14 hours a night for a month. After three weeks, they settled into an average of eight hours and fifteen minutes of sleep, showing a significant need for sleep that they had been missing.

In Europe, a university sleep research lab in the English Midlands has studied various topics, including how fatigue affects sailors, the impact of airport noise on sleep, and the risks of driving when tired. They recruit participants through student newspapers, offering them £5 an hour and asking them to change their sleep patterns as instructed. Dr. Louise Reyner reassures participants who worry about having electrodes placed on their heads, explaining that the lab focuses on physical aspects of sleep.

In a dark room, there is a motorway simulator with a car facing a large screen. Participants are told to arrive at 2 PM, during the body's natural afternoon slump, after a short night’s sleep or no sleep at all. They drive while answering questions as the projector shows a long road ahead. The young men insist they will not fall asleep. Dr. Reyner has recorded one participant trying to stay awake. At first, he sits up straight, but soon he starts to blink more often and his head begins to droop. Eventually, he experiences brief moments of blackout, waking up each time, but by the second or third time, the car veers off the road. Dr. Reyner suggests that two cups of coffee can help someone stay alert for at least half an hour. She also recommends various products like energy drinks and caffeinated gum, especially for shift workers.

What else do we know about human sleep? Like other mammals, humans sleep in a daily cycle. While asleep, they go through four stages, from light sleep to deep sleep. Dreams usually happen during light sleep, and the brain temporarily paralyzes the body to prevent injuries. Beyond this, many theories exist about the purpose of sleep. Some suggest it helps repair body tissue or restore muscles, but it is unclear if this happens more effectively during sleep or while relaxed and awake. Scientists agree that women tend to sleep about half an hour longer than men, and older people generally need less sleep, though the reasons are unknown.

Some researchers describe sleep in grand terms, saying, ""Sleep is a way to travel through time without harm."" Sleep patterns may have been different in the past. A history professor studied British sleep habits from 1500 to 1850 and found that people went to bed early, woke up after midnight for a while, and then went back to sleep. This time was used for reflection, remembering dreams, or even stealing. The poorest people benefited most from this quiet time, escaping their daily struggles. However, by the 17th century, as artificial light became more common, wealthier people began to adopt the more efficient sleep patterns we have today. The industrial revolution later extended working hours for most people, except in rural areas.

In many non-Western cultures, the old sleep patterns still exist. According to an anthropologist, some societies do not have strict bedtimes. People may sleep for a few hours, wake up, and then sleep again. The idea of a full night’s sleep is not universal. In certain tribal communities, sounds from humans and animals, along with the need to tend to fires and watch for predators, make continuous sleep difficult. It appears that people everywhere are in great need of more sleep."
CPE_60,"Text: 'We are talking about very expensive cowboy boots. I stood in my 800-dollar designer cowboy boots on the rocks in the Arizona desert. Money was not a problem. I wore a complete cowboy outfit, and if you have the outfit, you might be a cowboy. But I was not. It wasn't working for me. I squinted into the morning sun, looking at the Arizona mountains, and I had to admit, I did not feel at home. I flew in from Denver just after dawn, thinking I might look like a cowboy arriving from the sky. That feeling disappeared when I saw a real cowboy at the Phoenix airport. He was wearing a dirty shirt, needed a shave, and was carrying a worn bag when he noticed my new cowboy boots. He raised an eyebrow and left without saying anything. 

There should be a set of clothes that an ex-racing driver can wear without feeling out of place. Something that makes him feel comfortable wherever he goes. I loved being a racing driver and driving racing cars. I am addicted to it, and it is all I know. But I don’t do it anymore. I couldn’t even if I wanted to. I wondered, looking at the rough mountains in the distance, what I should do now. A racing driver should have one or two backup plans for when he stops racing. I thought I had some, but when I tried to reach for them, they vanished. 

How about being a commentator at the racetrack? 'We have fifteen former Indy and Formula One drivers ready to be commentators. We’ll call you.' Or maybe starting a business selling classic cars? That plan lasted all winter with phone calls, lunches, lawyers, and meetings with bankers. But it was a bad year for selling old Ferraris, and I decided to step back before I lost everything. 

Being an 'ex' anything is tough. Who wants to hear about how I almost became World Champion? No one wants to hear a story that ends with 'almost.' Even if I had been the champion, you would probably only want to listen for a few minutes before getting bored. Last year’s champion is just that—last year. Not that I want sympathy, which is good because I don’t get any. Why should I? I had a good career, made money, and saved enough. But I miss the thrill of getting into that powerful racing car with seven hundred horsepower. I miss the excitement of going from zero to one hundred fifty miles an hour in 4.9 seconds. I even miss the danger of almost crashing every race. I miss the bright, interesting people and the reporters who acted like my words mattered. 

Being somewhat famous has its perks. Businessmen and politicians liked to tell their friends they knew me. Little boys would sneak under fences to get my autograph. And now that I don’t drive anymore... Just last week, my phone rang twice. I have free time in the morning and afternoon. Tomorrow looks free too, so much empty time. I looked up at the clear blue sky. No buzzards flying above. Maybe Arizona doesn’t have buzzards. But a couple of small brown birds in a cactus nearby were warning me to leave their nest alone. I never thought the desert had songbirds. It made me realize that a fake cowboy in designer boots has a lot to learn.'"
CPE_1,"**Text: Vancouver**

In the last ten years, many people from around the world have moved to Vancouver, in western Canada. In the evenings, residents walk through the city streets, and if you join them, you will likely hear different languages being spoken. People come to Vancouver for its mild weather, beautiful location between the ocean and mountains, clean and safe environment, and good educational and job opportunities. Although some locals may complain about the speed of new building developments, it is clear that the new residents and growing tourism have contributed to a vibrant city life. Vancouver was once called 'Terminal City' because it served as a gateway to other places. Although this name is less common now, Vancouver is still a major gateway.

**Putting Pen to Paper**

Journalists like me often struggle with writing letters. Some say this is because we dislike writing for free, but I think it is more about how we aim for the best effect in our work, which makes writing a letter feel different. A true artist, who may rewrite their work many times, does not face this issue. I believe that understanding the impact of their words is a key sign of a real artist. When Shakespeare wrote his famous lines, he likely did not think about how the use of long words made them powerful and showed his talent.

**Supermarket Opening**

In Britain, the opening of a new supermarket used to be a big event. You could expect a celebrity, like a soap star or a member of the royal family, to come and cut the ribbon. Now, new supermarkets seem to open every day, and celebrities are no longer needed. Why pay a famous person when anyone can open it for free? Last week, waiting customers did not care who opened the new Superbuy store, as long as they were at the front of the line. According to someone who knew an employee, the first five men to enter would receive a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women would get a bunch of flowers. This news quickly spread through the crowd, making those at the front feel proud and causing envy among those who arrived later."
CPE_53,"**Text: Citizen Kane**

When the film *Citizen Kane* was released in 1941, it created a lot of excitement, but it was not a commercial success. The release was delayed because the distributors were worried about what William Randolph Hearst, the person the film was thought to be about, might do to them. Although it received very positive reviews, it was television that helped bring it back into the public's attention. This film has inspired many people to become filmmakers, which is impressive since it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles believed that its success came from his lack of knowledge about what he could or could not do; he simply went for it. He also had a talented team, including cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and special-effects expert Linwood Dunn. When Welles and Mankiewicz decided to create a character based on a newspaper magnate who was similar to Hearst but not exactly him, Welles realized he had found the perfect role for himself as both director and actor, and he took full advantage of the opportunity.

**Dermot and Carmel**

That morning, Dermot thought Carmel seemed a bit strange. He had mentioned twice that he might be late and that he might stop by the golf club on his way home to talk to someone. Each time, she nodded as if she hadn’t really heard him. “Will you be okay? What are you going to do today?” he asked. She smiled and replied, “It’s funny you ask. I was just thinking I have nothing planned, so I might walk downtown and look at the shops. I feel like it would be a bit sinful to waste the day like that.” Dermot smiled back, saying, “You deserve to enjoy yourself. And if I’m late, I won’t need anything to eat, so don’t worry about it.” “That’s fine,” she said.

**Title Race**

“Tea boy? Do you mind? I’m a mobile lukewarm beverage resource facilitator.” Human nature can be quite funny. A recent study showed that job titles often cause jealousy and problems at work. A survey by a well-known recruitment firm found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees believe that job titles create divisions among coworkers. Surprisingly, the survey also revealed that 70% of office workers would give up a pay raise for a more “motivational” or “professional” job title. If our desire for status is so strong that it overcomes basic greed, we are in trouble. In the early twenty-first century, no one wants to be called subordinate. The job titles being discussed focus on skills (like specialist or coordinator) but are really just fancy words."
CPE_55,"**The Vienna Assignment**

I was in Vienna to take photographs. This was usually the reason I traveled. Photography was not just my job; it was a big part of my life. The way light fell on different surfaces always inspired me. I believed that a single photograph could capture the essence of a moment, a place, or a person. I always hoped to take the perfect picture, as long as I had film in my camera. My rule was simple: finish one roll, load another, and keep looking with open eyes. This had been my approach for a long time.

Once, I got lucky when a photo of a smoke plume from a burning oil well became popular worldwide. It was a brief moment of fame, but they say you create your own luck, both good and bad. After that, I decided to work freelance, which seemed smart at the time, but life took some unexpected turns. The mid-nineties were not as successful as I had hoped, especially after my photo made the cover of Time magazine. That’s why I found myself in Vienna instead of somewhere more exciting. Still, I was taking photographs and getting paid for it, which I thought was good.

The assignment came about by chance. I had taken photos for a coffee-table book called *Four Cities in Four Seasons*, which featured London, Paris, Rome, and Vienna. I received a nice payment for capturing my city in different seasons. I had my own style, showing daffodils in Hyde Park and the heat haze in Piccadilly. I accepted that much of my work would be overlooked since it was just a picture book, not meant to challenge anyone’s views.

After a cold snap over Christmas, I submitted my winter photos of London and learned that the Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, had left his job in Vienna for reasons unknown to me. Instead of hiring someone new, they offered me his position. The Austrian publishers liked my work, and I was available, unlike the French and Italian photographers. I was eager to go because things at home were not good. A week in snowy Vienna was a welcome change.

They put me up at the Europa hotel in the old city. My last visit to Vienna had been a busy weekend with my wife, where we rushed through palaces and museums. It had been hot and chaotic, and I hadn’t taken many photos. This time, alone in the cold of January, I felt it would be different. As soon as I arrived and saw the pink-grey dome over the snow-covered roofs, I knew I would enjoy my time here and take great pictures.

On my first day, I didn’t rush to take photos. I rode the trams around the Ringstrasse, getting on and off to experience the city’s atmosphere. The weather was cold and still, like the grand buildings from the old empire. I hadn’t seen Schussner’s photos from spring, summer, or autumn, and I didn’t want to. This was going to be my Vienna, and I was ready to discover it.

A photograph captures a moment, but you must wait for the right moment. So, I took my time, observing until I could see clearly. The next morning, I was out at dawn. The overnight snow made Stephansplatz beautifully white and almost empty. I struggled to find a way to capture the cathedral in one shot. Its tall spire reached into the grey sky, while at ground level, it was massive and imposing. I realized I might have to focus on just part of it. In that weather and at that time, it could still be magical.

Photography has always held a sense of magic. Nineteenth-century pioneers felt this before they fully understood the chemistry behind it. You can watch a blank sheet of paper turn into a photograph in a dark room. Even when you know how it works, the mystery remains. Perhaps that’s why what happened at Stephansplatz that morning didn’t surprise me in a strange way."
CPE_50,"**Text: Kinetic Art**

Exciting news: London's Hayward Gallery has changed into a place of wonder. This transformation is not due to a big-budget show, but rather a unique exploration of a lesser-known part of the last 60 years. A new exhibition looks at the history of kinetic art, which is art that involves movement, throughout the twentieth century. It shows that creating art that moves on its own or explores the idea of movement has been a consistent, though often overlooked, theme in some of the most interesting creative work of this century. The exhibition features a wonderful collection of paintings, drawings, documents, and films about kinetic art, curated by Guy Brett, who has studied this subject for many years. The artworks are mostly presented without much text, allowing visitors to enjoy discovering connections and insights on their own.

**David Hockney**

David Hockney's art attracts many people who might not usually be interested in art. This could be because his work is figurative and easy to understand, or because it offers an escape from everyday life. Some people might even be drawn to Hockney's charming personality and his clever comments that make him popular in the media. However, this raises the question: does this popularity mean his art lacks serious purpose? Some critics believe Hockney is an overrated artist. In response, one could argue that his popularity might be seen as a problem today, rather than a lack of depth in his work. Hockney himself is realistic about his abilities and believes it is not important to dismiss his art just because it does not fit a traditional idea of greatness. He does not claim to be a great artist and understands that only future generations can truly judge his importance.

**Window-shopping - an Art Exhibition**

In recent years, I have attended many contemporary art exhibitions, some brilliant and others mediocre. What often frustrates me are shows that seem to push a specific agenda, suggesting a common viewpoint among certain artists. Sometimes this approach works, revealing new trends in seemingly unrelated works. More often, however, it highlights a questionable angle or a forced idea. This led me, as a curator, to create a show that opposes this trend. Along with seven artists, I took over a space in an empty warehouse. 'Window-shopping' was meant to be a collection of individual artworks that connected only by being labeled as art. For example, Sam Cole's knitted cats playfully chased each other on a toy train track, while Matthew Crawley filmed a video camera, opening it up and poking around until it broke, creating flickering images on a monitor. These works did not fit into a specific theme and would not usually be shown together, but they complemented each other in their contrast. While I did not make grand statements about contemporary art, I believe that art is fundamentally an individual activity where artists set their own rules.

**Art History**

People who enjoy paintings sometimes hesitate to analyze them, fearing it will ruin their enjoyment. Some believe that art historians, who focus on theory rather than practice, overlook the joy of viewing art and the special act of creating it. This idea is similar to thinking that knowing a recipe and cooking method takes away from the taste of a dish. Understanding the importance of enjoyment does not mean we cannot also have a deep knowledge of what we are experiencing. In fact, knowing more about an artwork might enhance our pleasure. Additionally, pleasure is complex. How we sense and recognize pleasure is influenced by our history and society. Our preferences for certain characteristics in art are shaped not just by our genes or personalities, but also by the values of the society we live in. Therefore, while we should not underestimate the importance of instinctive responses to art, the belief that intellectual understanding diminishes enjoyment is an outdated idea that once promoted art as a substitute for thought."
CPE_25,"**Text: Metals**  
Stone Age people may have been interested in metals because they wanted to decorate themselves. While sitting by a river, waiting for fish, one of our early ancestors might have found a shiny yellow stone and picked it up. It felt different from regular stones and was very attractive. This could be how gold became important to early humans. Because gold is easy to shape, it quickly became a popular material. Copper might have also been discovered by chance, and once people realized how useful copper tools were, they actively searched for copper ores and ways to extract the metal. This led to the development of metalworking, which improved the lives of our ancestors.

**St Ives**  
We were quiet as we carried our bags down the narrow, cobbled street that led to the town center, bending against the strong wind and trying to avoid the cold waves crashing over the walkway. The streets were empty, and every cottage by the water had its shutters closed tightly against the storm. We had seen the weather get worse as we arrived in St Ives on a small train. As the dark clouds gathered, visiting Cornwall in the off-season without a car didn’t seem like a good idea anymore. I had convinced my friend to come with me by promising beautiful walks along the Cornish coast and cozy evenings by the fire.

**Computer Modelling**  
Studying the past is challenging because it is gone. The people who lived in times of peace and hardship are no longer here. The reasons they settled in certain places or formed families and communities have been forgotten. Archaeology gives us some clues, but we cannot test our ideas with experiments on past cultures. We cannot rewind time to see what happened. However, computer modeling allows us to recreate ancient landscapes and environments and fill them with virtual communities—digital people with some needs and abilities like real humans. We can set rules for them and create social groups. Then, we can change the weather or increase the population and observe how these virtual cultures and their artificial people respond."

**Vervet Monkeys**  
Cheney and Seyfarth studied vervet monkeys and observed a dominant male in a group. One day, he saw a strange male nearby in another grove of trees. The stranger wanted to join the group, which could lead to the dominant male losing his position. To keep the stranger away, the dominant male cleverly made an alarm call that vervet monkeys use when they see a leopard. This scared the stranger back into the trees. He repeated this every time the stranger approached. However, the dominant male made a mistake when he called out the alarm while walking across the open ground himself.

**What Cats Catch**  
In a survey in the English village of Felmersham, people recorded what their cats caught over a year. Seventy cats caught over 1,000 prey items. A professor in America estimated that all cats in Britain might kill 100 million birds and small mammals each year. However, this number is misleading because most cats live in towns and catch fewer animals than those in the survey. The important question is whether these numbers are sustainable. The answer seems to be yes. In winter, many people feed birds, and gardens provide nesting sites, keeping the bird population above natural levels. The survey showed that while cats are significant predators, they are not destroying Britain's bird population.

**Buffalo's Day**  
Buffaloes are very important to the marshmen, and they are treated with care. Each morning, the buffaloes, who often sleep near their owners, slowly leave their resting place to go to the distant reed beds. They take their time, groaning about their tiredness, until the leader finally steps forward and enters the water. Once in the water, they seem to forget their purpose and wallow there, making low sounds of complaint. Their movements away from the house are slow and almost unnoticed, but eventually, they swim, appearing to struggle to keep their noses above the water. They spend the day among the reeds, grazing on green shoots.

**Picasso, Pablo**  
In early spring 1940, Picasso painted several still lifes of fish while staying in the fishing port of Royan. One painting shows a fishmonger’s slab with a crab and some soles. The fish look alive despite their situation. The painting is complex, with overlapping transparent shapes and delicate colors, creating a calm underwater scene. However, there is tension as the fish seem to be preparing for a fight with the crab. The sharp shapes in the painting suggest a sense of danger and hidden violence, giving it a deeper meaning."
CPE_12,"**Text: Photography**

Over the last 150 years, photography has been used to capture many aspects of human life. In this relatively short time, photography has improved its ability to record moments in time and space, allowing us to see both large and small details. It has given us images from faraway places, distant parts of the solar system, and the complex social issues of modern life. Photography has become one of the most important ways to express what it means to be human.

However, the idea of recording events visually has a much longer history. The earliest known images date back to the Upper Paleolithic period, around 35,000 years ago. We cannot be sure why early cave paintings were created. They might have recorded actual hunting events, served as magic to help with hunting, acted as religious symbols, or simply been made to brighten daily life. Nevertheless, visual images are deeply connected to human culture.

Throughout history, people have questioned how accurate visual images are and what role they play in society. The saying ""seeing is believing"" has always given special importance to visual images. When photography was invented in the mid-1800s, it seemed to promise a truthful visual record. The camera was seen as a tool that worked like the human eye, capturing fixed images that closely resembled what we see. The chemical process used in photography allowed for the capture of what we consider natural images.

At the same time, photography was viewed as a sophisticated cultural achievement, producing images that artists had long tried to create through skill and practice. Ironically, because photography seemed so realistic, it was thought that everyone could easily understand photographs. In 1933, photographer August Sander suggested that even the most isolated person could understand a photograph of the sky, whether it showed the sun, moon, or stars.

However, as global communication increased in the late 20th century, we must consider how well photographs can cross cultural differences. Is photography limited by cultural norms like any other form of communication, such as language? Has our familiarity with photographs led us to overlook the complex ways they convey vivid impressions of reality? Photography is often seen as providing convincing evidence, making it seem like a clear reflection of our environment. For example, it is common for someone to show a photograph and say, ""This is my grandson.""

Since its invention in 1839, photography and the attitudes towards it have changed significantly. This change may be partly due to photography moving into what we might call ""mythic time."" Its original role as a record-keeper has evolved, and photographs, once closely tied to the photographer and subject, have become historical documents. These images often reveal as much about the people and society that created them as they do about their subjects.

I aim to show that the camera is not just a silent recorder of events. Photography does not merely reflect culture; it can inspire social and political change. For instance, it is hard to imagine the cultural shifts of the Italian Renaissance without recognizing how the development of perspective changed visual representation. Similarly, photography has played a significant role in shaping the media culture of our time, while also bringing the harsh realities of the world into our everyday lives."
CPE_26,"**How to Write Poetry**

Teaching people how to write poetry can be tricky. It requires creativity, but one mistake can lead to confusion. I won’t pretend to know everything, so I will say this: for beginners, nothing replaces reading a lot, writing often, and letting your imagination flow freely, as long as it doesn’t lead to chaos. Some people need a stable life to write poetry, while others can express their feelings through writing during tough times. Some writers follow a schedule, while others wait for inspiration. All approaches are valid, as long as they don’t follow strict rules. The key is to find your unique voice, nurture it, and let it grow. Eventually, it will be strong enough to stand on its own.

**The Short Story**

In a short story, it’s important not to overcrowd it with too many characters or long descriptions. Flashbacks should be brief and only used when necessary to clarify something. One effective way to include a flashback is through a character’s memory, which can help move the story forward at a critical moment, but it should never slow down the action. Dialogue is often more effective than many new writers realize. Two characters talking can show different perspectives much faster than explaining everything from one viewpoint. This keeps the reader engaged and avoids unnecessary words. Overwriting can ruin a short story, but being brief doesn’t mean it should feel like a summary. Conflict and action should be just as strong in a short story as in a novel, but the skill lies in making every word count in a limited space.

**Screenplays**

Writing a screenplay for a film is similar to playing chess. Most chess players make mistakes as they go along. We may not know everything, but we know enough to play. We can sometimes see a few moves ahead, and that feels rewarding. As we learn more about chess, we realize it’s more about long-term strategy than short-term moves. We start to see the game as a whole, not just individual moves. Patterns emerge, known as gambits, and they have names like openings, middle games, and end games. The more we play chess, the more we understand its complexities, just like in screenplay writing.

**Looking at Writing**

Humans naturally want to communicate, as seen in the chatter of young children. However, no child instinctively knows how to bake, brew, or write. Charles Darwin noted that language is a natural human instinct, but writing is not. Language exists in all societies, both past and present. While languages change, they do not necessarily improve; modern English is not better than Old English. All healthy children learn to speak without formal lessons. When children are together without a common language, they create their own. In contrast, writing systems have been created only a few times in history, starting in complex societies and evolving over time. Until recently, many children did not learn to read or write, and even today, some struggle. A group of children is unlikely to invent an alphabet, just as they wouldn’t invent a car engine. Children are naturally good at sound, but learning to read and write is a skill that takes time and effort. We need to understand how writing works and how to help children learn it effectively."
CPE_8,"Text: ""I have never started a novel with more uncertainty. If I call it a novel, it is only because I do not know what else to call it. I have little story to tell, and I do not end with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave my reader hanging. This book is about my memories of a man I met only occasionally, and I do not know much about what happened to him in between our meetings. I could invent details to make my story more complete, but I do not want to do that. I only want to write down what I know. To avoid embarrassing living people, I have given the characters in this story names I made up, and I have taken care to ensure that no one can recognize them. The man I am writing about is not famous. He may never be. When his life ends, he might leave no more trace of his existence than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the water's surface. If my book is read at all, it will be read for its own interest. However, the way of life he has chosen and the unique strength and kindness of his character may influence others, so that long after his death, people may realize that a remarkable person lived in this time. Then it will be clear who I am writing about, and those who want to know a bit about his early life may find something useful in this book. I believe my book, despite its limitations, will be a helpful source of information for my friend's biographers. I do not claim that the conversations I recorded are exact. I never took notes of what was said, but I remember well what concerns me. Although I have put these conversations in my own words, I believe they accurately represent what was said. I mentioned earlier that I have invented nothing, but I have taken the liberty that historians take to create speeches for the characters that I did not hear. I did this to make the scenes more lively and believable, as they would be less effective if simply told. I want to be read, and I think I am justified in making my book engaging. The thoughtful reader will see where I have used this technique and is free to reject it. Another reason I feel anxious about this work is that the people I write about come from a different culture. It is hard to truly know people, and I believe one can only really know their own countrymen. People are shaped not only by themselves but also by their birthplace, the places they grew up, the games they played, the food they ate, the schools they attended, the sports they followed, and the poets they read. These experiences shape who they are, and you cannot learn them just by hearing about them; you must live them. You can only understand if you are one of them. Because you cannot know people from a different nation except through observation, it is hard to give them credibility in a book. I have never tried to write about anyone but my own countrymen, and if I have done so in short stories, it is because you can treat characters more briefly in those. You give the reader general ideas and let them fill in the details. In this book, I do not claim that my characters see themselves as they truly are; they are seen, like my main character, through my own perspective."""

At any time in history, the world of literature can seem confusing to those experiencing it. It is only later, when people look back, that the patterns and important figures become clear. Right now, there is a particularly complex mix of poetic styles, types of poetry, and differing opinions on how poetry should be presented, criticized, and taught. 

In general, the current discussion in contemporary poetry focuses on the distrust and disapproval between serious 'literary' poets, who write poems meant to be read on the page, and 'popular' poets, who prefer to perform their work for an audience. However, this division is not strict. The number of public poetry readings has been growing over the last twenty years in various forms. Small literary groups in towns hold readings in community centers or members' homes; schools and colleges invite poets to read and speak to students; arts festivals often feature poetry readings by well-known authors.

The effects of these events, where poets often have to perform publicly, are many and their benefits are unclear. For 'pop' poets, whose work is created specifically for live audiences, the situation is straightforward. They benefit from performing. Their poems are usually simple in both form and content, making them easy to understand in one hearing. However, the weaknesses in their thought and technique often become obvious when read on the page.

On the other hand, poets who are dedicated to their craft and aim to continue the best traditions of poetry—compressing deep feelings, thoughts, and creativity into a small space with varied rhythms—may not be appreciated by audiences who are hearing their work for the first time. The risk is not that they will try to imitate entertainers, but that they might only read their most accessible poems, which are often their least significant.

Attending poetry readings cannot replace reading poetry on the page, although it can be enjoyable and educational. Hearing good poets read their work, even if they are not great speakers, helps the audience understand where to place emphasis. It is best if the audience has the text in front of them or knows the poems beforehand.

The main reason for popular poetry recitals, sometimes mixed with music (like jazz), is to help audiences connect poetry with enjoyment, making it feel accessible rather than an art form only for a select few."
CPE_30,"**Oral History**  
Historians increasingly use oral evidence, but this approach has challenges. It is overly simplistic to think that a person's testimony is a clear reflection of their past experiences. In an interview, both the interviewer and the interviewee influence each other. The historian chooses the informant and decides what to focus on. Even if the historian only listens, their presence can change how the informant remembers and discusses their past. The final account is shaped by the historian's social position and their understanding of history, which may be communicated to the informant. Thus, historians must acknowledge their role in creating new evidence. The challenges continue even after the historian leaves. The informant's memories may be influenced by other sources, like the media, or colored by nostalgia or feelings of loss from their childhood. Listeners may find the informant's emotions convincing, but these feelings might stem from later experiences rather than the time being discussed.

**Animal Science**  
Animal science has two main approaches: physiological and whole animal. Physiologists focus on how the body functions, studying how nerves, muscles, and senses work together to create complex behaviors. Those who take the whole animal approach study the behavior of animals in their natural state and the factors that influence it. Within this approach, there are psychologists and ethologists. Psychologists often work in labs, studying learning in a few species, like rats and pigeons. Ethologists study natural, unlearned behaviors in animals, often in the wild. While this distinction still exists, there is now a blending of the two fields. Physiologists often claim their methods are more fundamental. However, understanding how nerve cells work does not eliminate the need to study behavior at a broader level. Behavior has its own structure and units that must be used for its study. Describing a bird's nest-building behavior by only looking at nerve cells would be like trying to read a book with a powerful microscope.

**The Social Sciences**  
Students studying social sciences for the first time face a dual challenge. They must learn both the content of their new subject and the methods used to study it. This means they need to understand not only the knowledge and research findings in textbooks but also the methods used to gather and organize that knowledge. These two aspects are closely connected. While we all have experience with social life, social sciences go beyond common sense. Each discipline focuses on a specific aspect of social life, uses particular research methods, and has its own concepts. These basic ideas form the ""logical basis of the subject,"" allowing social scientists to move beyond everyday understanding and differentiate one discipline from another.

**Classical Architecture**  
In the classical world of Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building structures. According to the Roman architect Vitruvius, architecture involves Order, Arrangement, Proportion, Symmetry, Propriety, and Distribution. He provides Greek equivalents for several of these terms, likely based on earlier Greek sources that are now lost. While utility and function are not part of his initial definition, Vitruvius later discusses the best forms and arrangements for different types of buildings. At the start, the focus is on aesthetics, viewing architecture as an art. The origins of classical architecture are complex, with a long history of simple constructions in Greece and Italy that did not meet Vitruvius' artistic standards. Although these early structures were not artistic, they contributed essential elements of form that influenced later architectural ideas. Despite its elaborate appearance, the classical temple is fundamentally a simple, single-roomed structure."
CPE_7,"The two sisters kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for a while. She would drive around the gardens and the railway, jumping over a small bridge with all four wheels in the air, which was her only mistake. After that, they would pass the gasworks, where there was a strong smell of sulphur. Chen, however, found it funny that his wife was driving without him knowing. ""So you can really drive, Lily? Well done!"" he said. Mui thought men were strange. Her brother-in-law should have been upset, but instead, he was excited and made plans with Lily for a trip. They decided to go on a Monday at the start of next month, the quietest day of the week, leaving early and returning by noon so they wouldn’t lose any customers. In the meantime, Lily would practice driving. Despite her doubts, Mui bought a road map and got a ten percent discount, which impressed Chen, but Lily felt a bit insulted by Mui's lack of trust in her navigation skills.

Within an hour of leaving home, they were looking at the English Channel. Lily drove very well. Even Mui, sitting in the back and ready to give directions, had to admit this. On the road, Lily overtook a couple of slow cars with great skill, making Mui hold back her own concerns. Chen even applauded her. After passing the gasworks in the seaside town, they drove smoothly along the empty promenade. Lily parked in a small street off the seafront, where there were many empty spaces. She was unsure about the road signs and preferred to pay for parking rather than risk getting towed or fined. Would this show Mui that she was being careful? On the way down, Lily noticed her sister's worried face in the driving mirror. Maybe it was better not to add to Mui's worries.

Lily locked all the van doors and checked each one carefully. ""Don't worry,"" Chen joked. ""No one will want that old thing."" The sisters were annoyed. Lily accused her husband of being ungrateful, and Mui scolded him for being too easily fooled by appearances. Surprised, Chen took Man Kee ahead to look at the grey sea. He lifted his son onto the railing and held him close. Man Kee was a warm, soft bundle who reached out to touch his father's sleeve. In that moment, Chen decided to raise his son his way. He wanted Man Kee to learn about numbers, which Chen struggled with, and to grow up owning many restaurants, gaining experience along the way. The dark sea made Chen feel thoughtful as he planned Man Kee's future. 

There was smoke on the horizon, and then, sparkling in the morning sun, he saw a ship. He found a telescope nearby and put a coin in it to look at the ship. At first, he couldn’t find it, but then he spotted it: a large, rusty tramp steamer. He lifted Man Kee to the eyepiece. ""Do you see the ship, Son?"" he asked gently. ""It’s a special little ship for people like us. It may be small and old, but that’s just what strangers see. We know better, don’t we, Son? It will take us back home when we are done here. It will take you to your homeland, which you have never seen."" Chen kissed the top of Man Kee's head. Behind them were Lily and Mui. Lily put her arm around Chen's shoulders. ""The little old ship,"" Chen said. ""Let your mother see, Son."" Man Kee didn’t want to let go of the telescope, and when he finally did, the view was just a blurry circle of light. By the time Chen found another coin, the ship was gone, and Lily was left watching seagulls searching for food in the water."
CPE_43,"**THE WELL**

I had read that if you go deep enough into a hole, you can see the stars on a clear day. I convinced you to help me with my idea; you watched, surprised, as I pulled up the well bucket, steadied it on the wall, and then climbed in. I asked you to lower me down. I didn’t think about how heavy the bucket was or that you might not be strong enough to hold it. You held the handle, trying to help as I pushed the bucket off the edge. As soon as it was free, I fell. You screamed and tried to stop it, but then you let go. I fell into the well and hit my head. At that moment, I didn’t realize I had achieved part of my plan. I saw strange lights, like the stars I usually saw in cartoons when a character got hurt. At first, I was confused, then scared, then relieved, and finally angry at you for letting me fall and worried about what Mother would say. You called down to check if I was okay. I opened my mouth to shout, but then I heard panic in your voice, and I couldn’t speak. I lay still, peeking at you through my eyelashes. You ran off to get help. I waited a moment, then climbed back up and pulled myself over the edge, landing on the courtyard stones. I heard worried voices coming from the castle. I ran away to hide in the shadows by the moat bridge. Mother and Father came with you and old Arthur; Mother was screaming. Father shouted for Arthur to help with the winch. You looked pale and shocked. I was hidden in the shadows, feeling a rush of excitement. Then I noticed the drops of water I had left from the well to where I stood. I looked in horror at the dark spots on the dry stones. A small pool of water formed at my feet. I looked back at the courtyard, where Father was shining a flashlight into the well. The drops sparkled in the sunlight. I couldn’t believe no one had seen them. Mother was now screaming loudly, a sound I had never heard before. It shook me. What should I do? I had gotten back at you, but now things were more serious than I expected. What started as a fun prank quickly turned into something that would lead to serious trouble for someone, probably me. I regretted not thinking this through. In just a few minutes, my clever plan had turned into a disaster. Suddenly, I had an idea. I gathered my courage and left my hiding place, staggering out and blinking. I called out softly, then yelled louder when no one heard me. I stumbled a bit further and then fell dramatically on the stones. Sitting up, comforted by my crying mother, I sighed and said I had found a secret tunnel from the bottom of the well to the moat, and I crawled through it until I got out. I thought I was almost getting away with it until Father squatted in front of me. He made me repeat my story. I hesitated. His eyes narrowed. I thought I was filling in a gap, but I was only making things worse. I said the secret passage had collapsed after me; there was no point in sending someone to look for it. The well was dangerous. I looked into my father's eyes, and it felt like looking into a dark tunnel with no light. It seemed like he was seeing me for the first time, and I was seeing how adults view the world and the lies children tell. My words got stuck in my throat. ""Don't be ridiculous, boy,"" he said, sounding more disappointed than I could imagine. He stood up and walked away. Arthur looked down at me, his face showing regret and concern. He seemed to want to shake his head, not because I had a scary adventure and my father didn’t believe me, but because he could see through my sad lie and worried about my character and future. His pity felt like a harsh lesson, even more than my father's words, and it affected me deeply."
CPE_51,"**REMOVAL DAY**

Now that her children are grown, Susan, who is a widow, must leave her family home. The van had the words 'Removers of Distinction' on it, and indeed, everything that made the house special was being taken away. Fred, the removal man, with his large fingers, carefully packed all the fragile items, while his helpers were not as gentle. The house was beautiful, a four-story building overlooking a small harbor. The memories of her children growing up there lingered in the air, like dust. When they first bought the house, her son Robert, who was five at the time, had asked, ""Mum, how do you get a house home?"" It was easy to miss the little boy he used to be; now he was here, helping, especially making sure Susan didn’t forget about the piano. Francesca, their daughter, was also helping, insisting that only she could take care of the valuable Steinway piano.

Fred noticed Susan was not crying. ""That's something,"" he said. ""Do people cry?"" Susan asked, curious. ""You'd be surprised,"" Fred replied. ""They seem happy while packing, but then they cry in an empty room. They are fine once they reach the new place; it’s just hard to see everything taken apart."" Susan could understand that feeling. If she had been alone, she would have warned the movers about the piano before agreeing to the move. Robert insisted it was the movers' responsibility to notice any issues. The piano stood alone in the upstairs sitting room, the best room in the house. They would move it last.

Sitting on the bottom stair, with all the chairs gone, Susan remembered the day they moved in. Today felt like that day played in reverse—the piano had been the first thing brought in, but it got stuck on the stairs. The removal team struggled for nearly two hours, trying to get it up the stairs while little Robert watched in awe, and Francesca cried, ""We can't live in a house without a piano!"" They had to find a way to get it inside, and her late husband, Peter, had solved the problem. The piano was left in the garden while the other furniture was moved in. The next day, a builder was hired to remove the first-floor window. A crane was borrowed from a local farmer, and the piano was carefully lifted through the window while the children cheered with joy. However, it took months to afford to have the piano tuned professionally.

""That's that,"" Peter had said. ""That's there for ever."" But forever is a long time. The children were too busy to visit on weekends, and Susan found it harder to move around the house. She thought about the stairs and remembered the banister rails were still not perfectly fixed. She should have warned the movers about the piano, but now it was too late. Any moment now, they would discover it. Feeling dazed and panicked, she looked around. ""Are you all right?"" Fred asked. ""Just the piano left, and then we’ll be done."" She stepped away from the stairs, her heart racing. Robert and Francesca appeared in the hallway to watch. ""No tears then?"" Fred asked casually. Truthfully, she was close to crying. It was strange how moving things made them feel so important. Chairs, cups, and countless items that seemed unimportant while they were in place now felt full of emotion, begging to be cared for. She felt she might cry at any moment.

Just then, the piano appeared, being carefully brought down the stairs by Fred and another mover. ""Easy does it!"" Fred called out as they carried it smoothly out the front door and set it down behind the van. Robert was the first to laugh, and soon they were all laughing, relieved it was over. They leaned against each other, gasping for breath and laughing uncontrollably. ""What's the joke?"" Fred asked, but his question only made them laugh more. As they walked down the path for the last time, the only tears Susan shed were tears of laughter."
CPE_11,"**Text: Online Literary Criticism for Everyone**

**Do-it-yourself literary criticism: Is it just harmless fun?**

From the beginning, one of the main ideas behind the Internet was that it should be open to everyone. In theory, anyone could publish their thoughts or share music online. However, in the early days, some technical skills were needed. Still, there was one area that truly became accessible to many people: literary criticism. By visiting Amazon.com, the first popular online bookstore, anyone could try writing book reviews. 

Amazon's approach to book reviews was simple: anyone could share their opinion and give a book a rating of up to five stars. Each book had its own page, and when a reader wrote a new review, it appeared automatically. This allowed Amazon to fill its site with free reviews, and potential buyers could see what other readers thought, rather than just relying on publisher descriptions or professional critics.

Other online bookstores, which also had physical stores, offered similar features. However, Amazon was the largest, controlling over 80% of the online market. This meant it had the most customers and received the most reviews, but it also faced issues with fake reviews. Thousands of reviews were submitted daily, and it was impossible to check them all. Instead, a team of editors ensured that reviews followed the company's rules. For example, one-word reviews or personal attacks on authors were not allowed. Reviews that revealed the ending or referenced other reviews were also banned. However, since reviewers could remain anonymous, inappropriate reviews were only removed if Amazon's editors noticed them. This created opportunities for mischief. 

For instance, authors could write positive reviews of their own books. One author, Lev Grossman, was upset by the negative reviews of his first novel, so he wrote several anonymous positive reviews to balance things out. His trick worked until he wrote an article about it, and then the fake reviews were removed. Authors could also comment on their books by clicking a link that said, ""I am the Author, and I wish to comment on my book."" Most authors used this feature to encourage readers to buy and enjoy their books. Some even shared their email addresses for direct communication. However, Amazon did not verify that these comments were truly from the authors, except for well-known writers. 

In one case, a lesser-known writer pretended to be famous author John Updike in a comment, claiming to be an ""over-hyped middlebrow author."" This was quickly identified as fake and removed. The real drama often came from readers, not writers. When James McElroy's book, *We've Got Spirit*, about a small-town cheerleading team, was published, it received good reviews from the press. However, many people mentioned in the book felt hurt and used Amazon to express their anger through negative reviews, which disappeared a few days later. 

Despite this, Amazon saw the large number of reviews as beneficial for business. Reviews were meant to be a place to discuss books, not just a chat room, so Amazon monitored bestselling books closely to ensure all reviews followed the rules. This meant that silly reviews were more likely to appear on pages for less popular books. For example, *The Story about Ping*, a classic children's book about a duck, inspired humorous reviews because ""ping"" is also a term used in Internet technology. One long review compared the book's story to Internet architecture, claiming it provided a ""good overview"" of networking concepts. 

However, such silliness was rare. Most reviewers on Amazon took their contributions seriously, and overall, the reviews gave a good idea of whether a product was worth buying. The writer George Orwell once said that reviewing too many books meant pretending to have feelings about books he didn't care about. This makes the open access to reviews a positive development."
CPE_14,"**Text: Art in Modern Times**

In recent years, especially over the last two hundred years, we often think that every artist must go against the art of their time. Art is celebrated for being unique, revolutionary, and sometimes shocking. We enjoy admiring artists whose work was not valued a hundred years ago. However, when it comes to contemporary art, we often hesitate and claim that an artist has gone too far, suggesting that their work is no longer art. The media often expresses these views for us, and we tend to agree because we expect to be confused by the constant newness of art. This expectation makes us overlook the old themes, methods, and qualities that are still present in today’s art. We want artists to be different from us, with special talents and energy that break free from traditional norms. In the past, people commissioned artists for specific purposes, and art was part of everyday life. Today, we leave artists to work independently and often become frustrated if they try to connect with us.

**Picture This**

I will describe a situation and then ask an important question about it. I hope it is not too confusing. Here’s the situation: An artist selects a piece of text from an art book that discusses the variety of pictures. The text asks, “What are they all about?” and then concludes, “There is no end to the different kinds of pictures.” This language seems childish, and it reflects simple thinking. But stay with me. After choosing the text, the artist asks someone to prepare a canvas for him and then to take it to a sign painter. He instructs the sign painter to write the chosen text on the canvas without making it fancy. The sign painter follows these instructions and writes the text in plain black letters on a white canvas. My important question is: Is this finished product a painting?

**Underground Encounters**

At the Mercury Gallery in London until June 26, there is an unspoken rule for painters: once you find success in one style, you should stick to it. Collectors expect artists to continue producing similar work, and if they try something new, it is often met with disappointment. I am not sure why this is the case. Gallery owners prefer safe choices, and perhaps art buyers feel more secure with familiar styles. Some artists, like Picasso and Hockney, manage to break this pattern successfully. Eric Rimmington is another artist who is now trying to change his style, and it will be interesting to see if he succeeds. His new exhibition replaces the still lifes that made him famous with paintings inspired by the London Underground. Rimmington finds a unique charm in railways. His sketches from the 1980s of King's Cross Station led him to explore what happens underground. These sketches have become the basis for ""Underground Encounters,"" an exhibition of 40 paintings and drawings that capture the fascinating world designed for people in transit.

**Extract from a Novel**

I have come to this island with a few books. I do not know why I say ""escape."" The villagers jokingly say that only a sick person would choose such a remote place to recover. So, I have come here to heal myself, if you want to see it that way. Besides an old peasant who comes daily on her mule to clean, I am quite alone. I feel neither happy nor sad; I am suspended like a hair or a feather in a mix of memories. I mentioned the uselessness of art but did not speak truthfully about its comforts. The comfort of my work with my mind and heart lies in this: only in the quiet moments of a painter or writer can reality be reshaped and shown in a meaningful way. Our everyday actions are like a rough cloth that hides the beautiful pattern underneath. For us artists, art offers a joyful way to deal with the pain or struggles we face in daily life. This allows us not to escape our fate, as ordinary people might try to do, but to fulfill it through imagination. Otherwise, why should we hurt one another?"
CPE_63,"**Family Business**

""Look, this isn't good!"" said my Dad. We were in the car heading back to London. My father, with my brother Maurice beside him, had just picked me up and my trunk from the fancy girls' school I attended. He had also just been to Parent's Day, where I received the Latin prize and the award for the best results in my final exams. He had a long talk with my headteacher, and now we were on our way home for the holidays.

""What isn't?"" I asked, though I had a feeling I knew what he was thinking because he was unusually quiet. Normally, he talked a lot. ""You can't fool me. You'll do what you want now,"" he said. ""With all those certificates, I heard you might get a scholarship to Oxford."" 

""So?"" I replied, trying to act tough. ""Isn't that useful?"" 

""I also heard,"" he continued, and I knew a serious talk was coming, ""that you want to be a barrister. A barrister!"" My father knew a lot about lawyers and the law. 

""I just said that,"" I replied. ""I couldn't think of anything else!"" 

""And apparently,"" he went on, ""you have the right personality - you can quickly understand complex information, you are good at speaking, and you enjoy performing."" 

""I don't know about that,"" I said. ""All I know is what I see on TV."" 

""Regardless,"" he said, gathering himself, ""I feel like your heart won't be in the family business. Clearly, you'll go to Oxford University, and after that, I can't see you wanting to join us."" 

The problem was that, like many children of family businesses, I felt trapped by my family's expectations. I could see many career options, and I wanted to explore them. At the same time, I didn't want to upset my father. I wasn't as scared of him as Maurice was - I was the favorite - but I still found him intimidating. 

""It's too soon to know,"" I said weakly. 

""I tell you, you're not going to want to join us,"" my father said, who often turned out to be right about such things. ""It's a shame because you have the talent - the intelligence, the courage, the vision."" 

""There's still Maurice,"" I said, feeling down. My father scoffed. We both knew Maurice disliked the business. 

""Anyway,"" I continued, ""you could always use me as a consultant."" My mother had passed away when I was young, and my father had raised me and Maurice. Maurice was two years younger than me, and since he was motherless, I had taken care of him from an early age. It wasn't hard; I loved Maurice. 

Because the business was successful, we lived comfortably - in a big house in London, attended nice schools, wore good clothes, and enjoyed parties, theaters, and operas. My father knew many people - politicians, actors, businessmen - and our home was always lively with interesting conversations. 

""I tell you what,"" my father continued. ""You can help us during the holidays until you leave Oxford, and then if you decide to leave us, you can. It will give you some pocket money and really help me."" 

""Okay,"" I said, relieved to avoid immediate choices and especially the sadness my father would feel if I disagreed. This was how he controlled us. 

So it happened. In my last term at school and during university breaks, I helped out, never more than twice a year, and always with the easier tasks. I became one of the top students, with a small house, a nice white car, designer clothes, and a black dress from Paris that I planned to wear for my final exams. 

In my last term, my father came to visit me and took me to a village for a meal and a chat. There were only a few weeks left. My tutor predicted I would get a First Class degree in Law, and I knew that if I focused and organized my thoughts, he might be right. I felt ready and confident. 

But then my father told me that in about a week, he needed me to do one last important task for the family business, the biggest one they had ever attempted, and he promised it would be worth my while. 

""But Dad,"" I protested, ""I have my final exams coming up, and I need to focus on that. It's really important that I do well, and I don't want to think about anything else right now."" 

I could tell that my father couldn't understand the pressure I was under (or maybe he was jealous of my life away from him?), and he would see my refusal as a betrayal. As he explained the task, I realized more than ever how focused and resourceful he was, how energetic and self-controlled he was. In his way, he was a genius, and I respected that in him. It made my own plans seem less significant. 

""All right,"" I said. ""I'll do it."""
CPE_56,"Simon Costello realized that buying the house in Pembroke Square was a mistake within a year of moving in with Lois. A home that requires strict budgeting is often not worth having at all. However, at the time, it seemed like a sensible and desirable choice. He had been successful in his work, and cases were coming in regularly. Lois returned to her job at the advertising agency just two months after giving birth to their twins and received a raise that brought her salary to thirty-five thousand. She strongly advocated for the move, and Simon did not resist her arguments, which seemed convincing: their flat was not suitable for a family, they needed more space, a garden, and separate accommodation for an au pair. These needs could have been met in a suburb or a less trendy part of London, but Lois wanted more than just extra space. Mornington Mansions was not a suitable address for a rising barrister and a successful businesswoman. She felt that even saying the name diminished her social and economic status.

Lois decided that one of them should use public transport to save money, and since her firm was on the other side of London, Simon was the one who had to commute. The crowded tube ride became a frustrating thirty minutes of brooding over his dissatisfaction. He often thought of his grandfather's house in Hampstead, where he had stayed as a boy, remembering the smell of dinner and his grandmother's insistence that the tired breadwinner should be given peace and comfort after a long day in court. She had been a supportive lawyer's wife, active in legal causes and present at all lawyer events, seemingly content with her life. But that world was gone. Lois had made it clear before they married that her career was just as important as his. This was a modern marriage, and both of their jobs were crucial for their lifestyle. Their whole standard of living relied on two incomes. Now, what they had worked hard to achieve was at risk because of Venetia, who had come to their office in a bad mood. Something had upset her, and she confronted Simon with intense anger. 

He regretted not leaving his room earlier; if he had, the confrontation might not have happened, and she could have had time to think. He remembered her angry accusations clearly. ""I defended Brian Cartwright today. He told me that when you were his lawyer four years ago, you knew he had bribed three jurors before the trial. You did nothing. Is that true?"" ""He's lying. That's not true."" ""He also said he gave shares in his company to your fiancée before the trial. Is that true?"" ""I tell you, he's lying. None of it is true."" His denial felt instinctive, like raising an arm to block a blow, but it sounded unconvincing even to him. He felt guilty, and the cold horror on his face was replaced by a hot flush, bringing back memories of being punished in school. He looked into her eyes and saw her contempt. If only he had been warned. He now knew what he should have said: ""Cartwright told me after the trial, but I didn't believe him. I still don't."" Instead, he had told a more dangerous lie, and she knew it was a lie. 

But why was she so angry? What did his past actions have to do with her? Who appointed Venetia as the guardian of their legal practice's conscience? Was her own conscience so clear? Was she justified in threatening his career? He wasn't sure what she could do or how far she would go, but if this rumor spread, it could ruin him."
CPE_36,"I chose this place to live because I thought I would be anonymous among people who didn’t mind if their rented houses were falling apart or if their gardens were messy. I was wrong. The shopkeepers, who are living their real lives, soon start to recognize me. The beautiful roses from next door remind me that gardens were once cared for. Usually, I stay inside, trying to forget that summer is happening outside, but tonight, I am watching the swifts flying between the trees and roofs. I have trimmed the rosemary and lemon balm to make space for a chair, and my arms are tingling from the scratches. It is a small London garden, where plants must grow tall or spread out to survive.

“Been doing some clearing, I see,” says my upstairs neighbor, Jaz, leaning out of her window. She has written several unpublished manuscripts, and sometimes I have to pretend to know about them as an English teacher. I have her latest manuscript with me now. “How’s the work going, Jaz?” I ask. “For goodness’ sake! In no other job do people ask you about your work so many times a day,” she replies, then continues, “Tell you what, Ann, I have something to drink in the fridge. I’ll bring it down.” I don’t want Jaz in the garden, and I realize it looks messy and sad. The only way to access the garden is through my flat, and Jaz is knocking on my door. 

“So, you’re on holiday now, you lucky thing,” she says, sitting in shorts and a tank top on the chair while I drop a cushion onto what used to be a small lawn. “Cheers,” she says, acting young. “I should have gone into teaching—writers don’t get holidays. But you know what they say, those who can, do; those who can’t, teach.” And then there are those who can do neither. “So, what are your plans for the holidays?” All my worries about the end of the school year come rushing back. Empty days. Hot sidewalks covered in melting gum. The walk to the shops and back. The little park with its fountain, and loneliness sitting beside me on the bench. “Actually, I’m going to Stonebridge tomorrow. I’ve been meaning to ask if you could feed the cats.” My heart races as I say this. “Of course I will,” Jaz replies, knowing she will be around. “So where will you stay? A nice bed and breakfast?” “No, I’ll be staying with my oldest friend, Ruby, at the Rising Sun. We’ve known each other since we were eight.” This isn’t true, but I often deal with fiction.

“Going back to your roots. So what do you think of my work so far?” My silence makes Jaz ask about her manuscript, The Cruelty of Red Vans, which is half-read on my desk. I like the title and tell her so. I can see how red vans could be cruel, always bringing gifts to other houses and delivering rejected manuscripts to hers. Something makes me speak honestly for once. “Let me give you a little tip, dear,” I start. “What?” she asks, looking offended. “Try writing about nice people for a change, people who at least try to be good: a little less self-centeredness, a bit more fiction…” “Teachers!” Jaz responds like a rebellious student about to take back a poorly graded paper. “I keep a journal, I have for years, where I write something good, no matter how small, about each day.” My words sound as old-fashioned as my dress. “Keep a journal! Nice people! Get a life, Ann.” Oh, I have a life. I have my work, and I go out sometimes, reading on the tube. When we finally go inside, my calm kitchen gives me a moment of comfort, but suddenly I remember my school geography teacher, Miss Tarrantine, who must have been my age now, closing one eye in a strange wink as she told us, “I’ve had my moments.” We nearly died laughing."
CPE_6,"**Heritage**

Heritage is important because it connects people and communities to their past. We often feel connected to our personal heritage through our grandparents and the stories we hear about them. However, there is also a broader need to understand our history to help us shape our individual and national futures. Heritage represents a desire for continuity; knowing about the past helps us feel secure about the future. Just as we inherit our genes, we also inherit a culture passed down through generations. While there may be aspects of our national heritage that we do not like, it is still a part of us, and it is comforting to feel connected to something larger. Heritage teaches us a lot and is essential for our well-being, influencing everything from traditions to material culture. In the past, we learned about our heritage through stories and legends from our ancestors. However, modern society has disrupted many of these oral traditions. Now, we often rely on places and buildings to remind us of our past. It is crucial to preserve these connections as a tribute to our ancestors' identities.

**The Fens**

Some time ago, I started writing a novel called *Waterland*, where the landscape of a region in England known as the Fens became very important. After the book was published, people often asked why I, a Londoner with no personal ties to the area, chose to write about it. The simple answer is that I found the Fens to be an unobtrusive setting for my story. However, I learned that the Fens are not just flat and empty; they are rich and strangely beautiful. It is surprising that in the heart of England, there is a place that many English people find unfamiliar, especially since many other unique areas of Britain have become part of the national culture. The Fens are both empty and full, cultivated yet wild, seemingly simple but deeply mysterious. My own exploration of the Fens while writing was not extensive; I have never visited Wisbech or Prickwillow. As a fiction writer, I prefer to imagine worlds rather than seek strict evidence. However, trying to envision the Fens has its own logic, as they are not just a landscape but also a state of mind.

**Museums**

Museums need to make their collections easy to access. In the past, this meant simply putting items in display cases with long descriptions that were hard for the average person to understand. Today, accessibility should involve more than that. Displays can be engaging and use creative techniques to attract visitors and evoke emotions. Museums should also reach out to the community. For example, some museums provide loan boxes of objects for teachers, and recently, similar materials have been offered to help elderly people with memory loss. Museums focus on real artifacts, not replicas. They exist to provide an authentic experience, showcasing items that have historical significance. This authenticity is what sets them apart from heritage centers, theme parks, books, and digital media. Museums that embrace this challenge and create exciting, accessible displays and outreach programs will find that their competitors in ""virtual history"" can actually help spark interest in the real experiences that museums uniquely offer.

**Architecture and Environment**

The desire to preserve things is not new, but changes in our towns happen so quickly and on such a large scale that they affect most of us. This can make some people very passionate about preservation and encourage others to think more deeply about the nature of our towns and their future. It can be argued that people who have lived through significant events, like world wars, are more inclined to value preservation than previous generations, as anything that represents stability becomes important. If there is a psychological need for preservation, planners must consider it. Change is not necessarily bad if we learn how to manage it. Changes in our towns reflect social changes, including shifts in population, welfare, and demands."
CPE_33,"**Text: Einstein**

If you stop someone on the street and ask them to name a scientist, they will likely say Albert Einstein. His image is often used to sell products that seem smart, like computers and encyclopedias. Most people know little about what Einstein actually did, except that he created some complex theories called 'relativity', which are known for being hard to understand and for making strange predictions that seem to go against common sense. Einstein was part of a major change in scientific thought, a revolution that led to the development of modern science in the twentieth century. Physicists and mathematicians were trying to create a new, clearer description of the universe by examining the relationships between matter and natural forces. Einstein made significant contributions by rethinking the basics: time, space, matter, and energy. Earlier ideas were based on Isaac Newton's view of a universe where stars and planets moved in a fixed space and time. Einstein changed this idea, arguing that time and space are not fixed but relative.

**Young Readers**

When we were children, Lydia and I often distrusted any book that won awards because we thought it would be boring. Our mother disapproved of our attitude, while our father would give us small coins as rewards to encourage us to read better books. He sometimes included a few good books in our Christmas and birthday gifts, marked with a note saying, 'This Book is NOT Literature'. Although we often dismissed his choices as 'boys' books', he did introduce us to some shorter works of good fiction and, once, to a famous collection of poetry.

**Language**

Jacob Grimm wrote in 1851, 'The origin of human language is truly secret and wonderful.' This mystery has led to many strange ideas. For example, Charles Caller suggested in 1928 that early humans made sounds like ""meuh"" when they sensed danger. This sound is sad. The early human who traveled through dangerous lands made desperate noises, and some words have kept a trace of this, like 'malaria', which means ""fever"", or the Latin word 'mors', which means ""death"". Many people avoided discussing the origin of language, thinking it was a topic for odd theories, but recently, studying how language began and evolved has become an important area of research. Language likely developed in East Africa about 100,000 years ago. Initially, speech was mainly used for friendly communication and was a key tool in struggles for power. Sharing information was probably not the main purpose of early language, which goes against the ideas of philosopher John Locke, who described language as a 'great conduit' for sharing knowledge."
CPE_20,"**Text: Writing Reviews**

Frank Kermode discusses the art of writing reviews from a practical perspective. Most reviews are created and shared in ways that limit their lifespan. They often have strict deadlines and length restrictions, and once published, they are only relevant for a short time—usually a day, a week, or at most a month. The temporary nature of reviews often affects how they are viewed. Many people, including writers, believe that reviewing is a task done out of necessity, often due to financial reasons, or because it is difficult to focus solely on writing a novel or serious book.

However, writing reviews is a skilled and complex task. Writing a concise review of six to eight hundred words for a newspaper is different from crafting a detailed review of six to eight thousand words for an international journal. The typical length of fifteen hundred words in weekly magazines presents challenges from both short and long formats. Additionally, reviewers must consider their audience, ranging from casual readers to those deeply interested in the subject.

A good reviewer needs to have knowledge about various topics and must write in a way that is clear and enjoyable for intelligent readers. It is common for reviewers to also write other types of work. For example, American novelist John Updike, who is not particularly fond of criticism, still engages in some reviewing while writing his novels. He collects all his reviews, no matter how brief, into books with modest titles.

Some might think that less prominent writers should accept the temporary nature of their reviews, but it is understandable if they wish to have a lasting record of their work, especially if they feel that some of their best writing is found in reviews. I share this sentiment about my own writing. My main work has been academic, and my serious books are typically academic in nature, which is what professors are expected to produce.

In the English-speaking world, there is no strict separation between reviewing and literary study, unlike in some other cultures. It is common for the same individuals to engage in both activities. The past stigma against professors who write reviews has diminished, and complaints from non-professors about professors taking opportunities away from them are now less frequent. This is partly because there are more reviewing opportunities available, allowing many people to participate, and also because the rewards for reviewing are often minimal.

I believe this situation benefits both readers and professors. Readers can trust that reviewers have some expertise, and professors can maintain their sanity through this work. It also serves as a reminder for professors to communicate clearly with non-professors. While they may feel the need to use complex language among themselves, they must ensure they are understandable when addressing a broader audience.

Ultimately, despite its value, reviewing is often a secondary activity. It is something that can only be done well if one is also engaged in other meaningful work."
CPE_40,"Ralph unlocked the door to his apartment and, as he stepped into the dark, still hallway, he felt a brief sense of ownership that still surprised him after three years of living there. When he first bought the flat, he would come home excited and curious, wondering what had happened in his absence. The flat felt like a welcoming space where he could focus without distractions. He thought he should worry about possible intruders or leaks, but his flat always seemed to wait for him, either looking independent or neglected, depending on how tidy he had left it. Over time, he began to see it as an extension of himself, a place where his thoughts and feelings spilled out. He grew frustrated with its inability to change.

There was often a small pile of letters by the door and the answering machine would sometimes blink to life when he returned. He was thankful that his windows were intact and that nothing had been violently disturbed, though he often wondered what the flat would look like if it had been. From his dull third-floor office on Holloway Road, Ralph looked forward to his few quiet evenings at home each week. After leaving the busy office and starting his bus ride home, he no longer wanted to be alone, even though he often thought he did. At his desk, he craved solitude and time to himself, but once he escaped, he felt drained and waited in vain for a sense of self to return. Instead, he felt a deep emptiness, making him suspect that the work he did not enjoy had changed him, moving him away from who he thought he was.

He would often read or listen to music as night fell, but now he found himself questioning why he did these things. His sense of direction had faded, and thoughts would come and go without finding a connection. He remembered a time when he felt more in control, when he might have recognized his own worth and escaped his situation. But he had been so eager to find something that he had followed the first opportunity that came his way, as if it was meant to be. After university, he had tried to make a plan for a better life, but when he looked for ambition, he only found a quiet wish to get by. He applied for jobs he had heard about from friends, trailing behind them as they rushed toward their futures, unable to see that he could find a role that would also bring him happiness.

He had gone to his only job interview with gratitude, not thinking to evaluate the position—a vague editorial role at a free local newspaper. After a pleasant twenty-minute conversation with Neil, his boss, he hadn’t considered the long-term implications of the job. Neil offered him the position on the spot, saying he was the only graduate who had applied, which Ralph took as a compliment at the time."
CPE_45,"**Goat Racing**

I was about to see goat racing on Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. I pushed my way through ice-cream vans, large crowds, food stalls, and loud music. Although everyone was moving towards the racecourse, I tried to find a good spot to watch. An area was blocked off to create a course for the goats. It wasn’t as fancy as regular racecourses, but the idea was the same: spectators lined up on either side of a stretch of ground where the goats would run. Keeping a few selected goats in line was a challenge, especially since goats are known for eating almost anything they find.

**Canoe Trip**

As the day ended, I began to worry about the night ahead. The canoe was too wet to sleep in, there was nowhere to stop, and we hadn’t seen any villages or huts since early morning. In the dim moonlight, we used our flashlight to see the cliffs, but the batteries were dying. We replaced them, but the new ones didn’t work. Clearly, we wouldn’t find a place to camp. A few miles later, Lesley shouted that she saw a distant flickering light, and we felt hopeful. However, the light was just moonlight reflecting on the waves. Soon, we heard the loud sound of rushing water, but we couldn’t see what was happening. Time seemed to stop as we continued on.

**How to be Presentation Perfect**

I am not good at making presentations, but as managing director, I often have to present to my colleagues and major shareholders. How can I improve my presentation skills and confidence? You are not alone. Giving a presentation requires different skills than running a company, but many senior executives are expected to be good at it. To convince your audience, you must first believe in what you are saying. Show your belief through the passion and enthusiasm you bring to your presentation. This means you need to prepare well. Test your ideas beforehand and ask colleagues to help you think of difficult questions your audience might ask. You should also create a positive atmosphere from the start. Begin with something everyone can relate to and gradually lead to the conclusion you want to reach."
CPE_64,"Text: 'Some activities cannot be rushed; they take the time they need. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you are impatient with mayonnaise and add the oil too quickly, it will curdle. If you pull on a tangled fishing line in frustration, the knot will only get tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some functions happen very quickly, while others take seconds, minutes, hours, days, or even years. Some tasks can be sped up, like solving crossword puzzles or doing math. However, others cannot be rushed, and if they are, they may fail, like the mayonnaise or the fishing line. The idea of 'Think fast; we need results' can be as unhelpful as trying to shorten a night's sleep. We learn, think, and understand in various ways, and these different modes of thinking work at different speeds and are suited for different tasks. 

There are three main processing speeds of the mind. The first is faster than thought. Some situations require an immediate reaction. For example, when my motorbike skidded on a wet road, my body instinctively moved to keep me safe, and only later did my conscious mind catch up. A concert pianist or an Olympic fencer cannot stop to think about their next move. This quick response can be called our 'wits'. 

The second speed involves actual thought, where we analyze situations, weigh options, and solve problems. A mechanic figuring out why an engine won’t start, a scientist interpreting an experiment, or a student working on an assignment are all using this logical thinking, often referred to as 'intellect'. People who excel at these tasks are often called 'bright' or 'clever'.

The third speed is slower and less direct. It is more relaxed and contemplative. In this mode, we might daydream or reflect. Sitting on a beach, listening to the waves, or drifting between sleep and wakefulness, we are in a different mental state than when we are planning or writing. This slower way of thinking is just as valuable as the faster types. Allowing the mind to wander is essential, especially when life gets busy. We need both the quick and the slow thinking. 

Some everyday problems are better solved with a slow mind. Complex issues often require a relaxed approach. Recent studies show that patient, less deliberate thinking is effective for understanding complicated situations. Deliberate thinking works well for clear problems. For example, deciding where to go on holiday may have obvious factors. But when the situation is unclear or complex, we need to use our slower thinking. If we are trying to manage a difficult team at work or considering a career change, it may be wiser to reflect rather than rush for answers. This slower intelligence is linked to creativity and wisdom. 

Poets and philosophers have long recognized the limits of fast, deliberate thinking and have sought to develop these slower ways of knowing. Recently, scientists have begun to study these slower, less conscious ways of thinking. The field of cognitive science is showing that the unconscious mind can effectively handle many complex tasks if given time. It can recognize patterns that our conscious mind might miss, understand complicated situations, and resolve difficult issues more successfully than quick thinking.'"
CPE_29,"**Text: Surviving in a Foreign Land**

I have been welcomed warmly. It’s a friendly and well-equipped base camp in a very isolated place. At any time, there are about forty people—scientists, students, weather experts, satellite trackers—in a close community where everyone helps each other. My basic French is just enough to communicate, but not to have casual conversations. I miss the subtleties of the language, and my phrasebook is not helpful at breakfast. This is not a practical problem for me, but at first, I struggled with my self-confidence. I found myself a bit anxious about mealtimes. I would hesitate, worried about which table to choose, scared of the silence that followed when I spoke, and feeling anxious like I did in the early weeks of school. I still smile awkwardly or feel nervous when people talk to me. I think this occasional sadness is not about missing company or communication; it’s because I have lost the social confidence that my ability to speak well used to give me.

**Elliot**

When I first met Elliot, I was just a young author like many others, and he did not pay much attention to me. However, he never forgot a face. When I saw him here and there, he would shake my hand politely but showed no interest in getting to know me better. If I saw him at the opera, for example, he would often ignore me if he was with someone important. But then I had a surprising success as a playwright, and I noticed that Elliot started to look at me more warmly. One day, I received a note from him inviting me to lunch, and I thought he was testing me. After that, since my success brought me many new friends, I began to see him more often.

**Alfred Hitchcock**

The film director Alfred Hitchcock always said that he didn’t care about the story of his films or the acting, but he did care about the visuals and the sound. For Hitchcock, it wasn’t a message that moved the audience, nor was it a great performance; he believed that people are excited by the pure experience of film, no matter their cultural background. So, if a film is made well in terms of its emotional effect, the Japanese audience should react at the same moment as the Indian audience. Hitchcock’s self-assessment was always clear and logical; he was a reasonable man and a brilliant craftsman who enjoyed hearing an audience react. He did not focus on speculation or complex ideas, and his view of his own characters was straightforward. He concentrated on film itself and the precise, measurable beauty of what a film can do to an audience."
CPE_57,"**Text: Amateur Astronomy**

Many things have changed in astronomy over the last fifty years. Until about thirty years ago, there were not many charts and catalogues available. Telescopes were limited, and there were few books on practical astronomy. Today, there is a wide variety of telescopes and equipment available for everyone. Electronic calculators and computers have changed how we create almanacs and charts, making it easier to analyze observations and publish results. This could be seen as the golden age of amateur astronomy. However, some things have been lost as well. Now, you may have to travel 80 kilometers to find a dark sky, unlike the skies in urban areas fifty years ago. Daytime skies are often filled with airplane trails that can last for hours and spread out, making it hard to observe the sun and stars at night.

**Too Much Choice**

Society is facing a problem of ""overchoice."" There are too many things to do, too many options, and too many opportunities. In today’s economy, the desire for new products and services has become an addiction, and technology speeds up this change. New goods and services keep appearing, creating more choices. Just as a new product is released, another one is ready to launch. This can be overwhelming and tiring, leading to a feeling of disconnection from life. While choice is important in the new economy, having too many choices can cause stress, take up time, and create complexity. As a result, people are looking for ""simplexity""—the simple things that bring meaning in a complicated world. However, simplifying life is challenging in an age of excess. There are more basic brands of detergent and breakfast cereals than we could ever need, along with countless software updates and calling plans.

**McAndrews Hotel**

Every summer, we spend two weeks at McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. This is a family tradition started by my grandmother, and it has become very important to us. Nothing can disrupt this ritual. We are a specific type of guest at McAndrews: perhaps old-fashioned or even snobbish. I dislike the bad manners and rudeness of shop assistants that some people see as equality today. I also dislike overly friendly waiters who seem to struggle to keep their hands to themselves. I know the names of most of the other guests—like me, they have been coming here since childhood—but I can be sure that when I see them in the hotel, we will only exchange polite greetings. This respect for dignity and personal space is rare in commercial places these days."

**Othello**  
A remarkable production of Shakespeare's play *Othello* has moved from Stratford to London. This gives me a chance to correct an unfair review I wrote when the show first opened last spring. At that time, I said that Ray Fearon was too young for the title role and I criticized his acting. I still believe that changing the age difference between Othello and Desdemona alters the tragedy, but I take back my comments about Mr. Fearon's outstanding performance. The entire cast is excellent. Memorable scenes include the one where Cassio's competitive games with other young officers become dangerous, and the moment when Iago starts to lose control and struggles to regain it. I challenge anyone not to be moved to tears during the scene where Emilia helps Desdemona prepare for bed. The pace and tension throughout the play are fantastic. Do not miss this production.

**Lake Vostok**  
In the center of Antarctica, there is silence. On the edges of the continent, there are many penguins, seals, and birds. But in the vast white interior, life does not exist. However, there is a large hidden body of freshwater called Lake Vostok, which lies beneath nearly 4 kilometers of ice, directly under the coldest place on Earth. The water has been cut off from air and sunlight for up to 25 million years. Biologists are eager to explore its mysterious depths and find out what strange organisms might be there. Geologists and glaciologists are also interested. For two years, researchers around the world have been planning ways to uncover the lake's secrets, and if they succeed, we will soon see a new era of discovery regarding Lake Vostok.

**Scientists**  
Last week, I heard something interesting on the radio. A group of scientists is debating what motivates them to be scientists; the phrase ""because it's there"" comes to mind. We all know it is the long-standing quest for knowledge, the wish to understand everything from atoms to black holes. But these scientists want to know why we have this desire for knowledge and why science cannot explain this motivation. I believe it is more important to determine whether what we scientists do is right, rather than get caught up in discussions about the purpose of it all. The key issue is not why we pursue science, but to recognize that science is a tool, and we should decide how, where, when, and why to use it."

**Food**  
Our relationship with food is very basic and fulfilling. Many people who enjoy cooking buy cookbooks like this one. However, we often think that cooking is only worth it for special occasions or complicated dishes. This is not true. By simply adding some chopped carrots, a leek, celery, and herbs to water, you can make a delicious soup. This is much more rewarding than buying a pre-made packet or tin. Instead of purchasing a sweet chocolate mousse filled with preservatives, you can quickly make a tasty dessert that both adults and children will enjoy. Cooking is also a way to show care and love by sharing your creation, no matter how simple, at the table. Sharing food symbolizes our basic human needs, which is why we celebrate events like birthdays and anniversaries around tables. No one would choose takeout for a wedding or anniversary party, nor would many want to discuss business over canned soup.

**In the Elevator**  
This morning, Alistair tried to tidy his office, but papers were still everywhere. Tax forms were overflowing from drawers and boxes, waiting for a day when he felt like organizing them. He also had a lot of paperwork from owning an apartment building. Many books and years of journals were close to the new bookshelves. As the elevator took him to his floor, he knew Mallory would arrive on time for their meeting. She would knock on his office door exactly on the hour. She was very punctual and neat. How would she react to the mess? She might think someone had broken in. He could walk in behind her and pretend to be shocked. Mrs. Wilson, his cleaning lady, had come while he was trying to clear some space on the floor. When he peeked out of his office as she was unlocking his apartment, he smiled at her, hoping for a good response. But her expression was cold. She seemed to think, ""No way am I going in there,"" as she entered his apartment, which was her responsibility. He knew Mrs. Wilson saw him as someone from another world, far away from her familiar streets in Brooklyn.

**KAREN**  
Karen had a simple wish: not to be like her mother. This desire led her to create her own story, a story of difference and strength. In her tale, there were important moments, like when she was twelve and her brother accidentally hit her in the eye with a golf club. At first, she thought she would go blind. But the bone protected her, as the doctor later confirmed. The club had missed her eye, and she only needed a few stitches that healed over time. When she opened her eyes in the doctor's office and saw her mother there, complaining about both miracles and small mercies, she realized she was saved for a reason.

**Miss Fogerty**  
Miss Fogerty was both excited and sad as she walked briskly across the wet grass of the village green. It is always thrilling to be the first to learn something important, especially in a small community, where her life was usually quiet. However, she felt deep sadness for Dr. Bailey's condition. He had been her doctor for many years, and she appreciated his care during her frequent laryngitis episodes, which were her only health issues. Miss Fogerty valued his ability to make patients feel like there was always enough time to talk and that he genuinely wanted to hear about their worries. This quality made the good doctor very loved in the village. He was always willing to share his time, knowledge, and humor, and in return, he received great loyalty and affection from the community."
CPE_59,"**Joanna's Lessons**

Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist. So, why has she decided to write books for young children learning the piano? Even someone who cannot hear music well would be moved by her performances. Watching her play the piano, quickly moving her fingers across the keys, is like seeing a musician push their abilities to the limit. However, at a recent concert for children, even her amazing skills did not impress one small boy. Like the other kids, he had enjoyed her performance, which included many different styles of music from her large collection. He watched as she played with the piano's insides, which usually excites children. But when she asked if anyone had questions, he asked, ""Can you play Match of the Day?"" Many experienced musicians would be surprised by such a request, but for Joanna, it was funny. She thought, ""In his eyes, I wasn't a real pianist until I played that."" Of course, she played it and probably remembered this moment for her next children's concert.

Joanna is unique among top concert pianists because she cares about how young children learn to play. She has just published her own beginner piano book for children called *Joanna MacGregor's Piano World*. She has done this despite her busy schedule. This summer, she seems to be at every music festival. Tomorrow, she will be part of a day-long event with nine young composers and artists. She also runs her own recording label, Sound Circus, and loves to suggest new projects whenever she meets other artists. So, why take on the extra work of writing a book? ""People who know me are surprised,"" she says. ""But I believe the first lessons are very important. The music world often focuses on the most talented children, but most people enjoy music in a more everyday way. I find that much more interesting!""

In writing her first three books, Joanna draws on her own experiences. From ages 18 to 25, before she became a concert pianist, she taught many beginners. Most importantly, she grew up with many children coming to her home to learn piano from her mother. ""I was not just playing the piano; I was surrounded by kids of all backgrounds wanting to play all kinds of music—classical, jazz, pop, and more. I didn't grow up in an environment that forced exceptional talent. I believe music should be available to everyone.""

Just as everyone should learn to swim or speak a little French, Joanna believes everyone should try to learn the piano. Some children have a natural talent and learn quickly, while others progress more slowly and may give up. This can happen at any stage. Some kids find the beginning too hard, while others feel pressured to perform like the talented children they see on TV. ""I worry that some people use music, like sports, to push their children to achieve, instead of just enjoying it. Many children quit because they feel they cannot meet their parents' expectations.""

Joanna's new teaching manual raises an important question: Does she think poorly of other piano books or teaching methods? ""I don't want to criticize others,"" she says. However, she acknowledges that her books, which are colorful and engaging, are not the only ones designed to make learning enjoyable. To attract young beginners, she includes stories in her books and CDs. The challenge at this early stage is to keep the lessons interesting. From the first lesson, there are fun accompaniments for teachers or parents to play along with the child's part. For children whose parents do not play piano, the accompaniments are available on the CDs. Joanna insists that learning should be fun. ""You need to let them improvise and encourage them to play all over the keyboard, including the black keys, and to use the pedals.""

As children progress, they face new challenges. They need encouragement to read music instead of just playing by ear. Joanna understands this well because she relied on her ear when she was young. However, she believes that practice is the most important factor. How can children be motivated to play a piece more than once? She admits that she did not practice seriously until she attended the Royal Academy of Music, where she began to build a challenging repertoire that required a lot of practice. Now, she loves it. The eight hours of practice she does each day are the most important part of her musical life, even more than performing. ""I really understand those who find it hard. People don’t talk about this enough."" 

The key, whether you practice for twenty minutes or five hours, is to have a clear goal, she says. Other tips include rewarding yourself by playing through a piece, even if you make mistakes, and mixing difficult pieces with easier ones."
CPE_54,"**Text: Writing by Hand and on Screen**

Dr. Johnson believed that ""what is written without effort is usually read without pleasure."" This means that good writing often requires hard work. When I look back at my handwritten school essays, I notice they had very few corrections. Today, I would rewrite them many times. I think this is because writing by hand was physically challenging. The slow pace of writing helped me think carefully. In contrast, typing on a computer can lead to careless mistakes. Many writers find that the time spent fixing early drafts on a computer is about the same as the time spent on handwritten work. 

Also, emails, unlike handwritten letters, often lack emotional depth. However, they have revived the art of the love letter, with millions of these messages now being sent, replacing casual conversations. At least these emails are written in a form of English and grammar. But words on a screen can feel dull. Writers may not fully understand the impact of their words and often exaggerate their meanings. Words typed quickly can lack the care and personality of handwriting.

**The CD**

I put down my cup and looked at the CD. The case was disappointing, but the shiny disc inside looked interesting. ""Wonderful little things, aren't they?"" Mr. Warriston said as he entered the room. I agreed, carefully handing the disc to him. ""It's amazing they can fit seventy minutes of music on these,"" he said, bending down to the hi-fi. He turned it on, and lights lit up. He pressed a button, and a small drawer opened. He placed the disc inside, pressed the button again, and the drawer closed. ""Some people say they sound sterile, but I think they..."" 

""Do you have to turn them over, like records?"" I asked. 

""What? No,"" Mr. Warriston replied, standing up. ""You only play one side."" 

""Why?"" I asked. He looked confused and then thoughtful. ""You know, I have no idea. I don't see why you couldn't make both sides playable and double the capacity..."" He stared at the machine. ""You could have two lasers, or just turn it over by hand... hmm."" He smiled at me. ""Yes, good point."" He nodded toward my wooden chair. ""Anyway, come on, let's get you sitting in the best spot for the stereo effect, okay?"" I smiled, happy to have asked a technical question that Mr. Warriston couldn't answer.

**Books vs. Electronic Text**

In comparing books and electronic text, the author Malcolm Bradbury made a good point when he said that if matches had been invented after cigarette lighters, we would have admired the improvement. Many people excited about new technology claim that electronic text is as important as the invention of printing and that it is almost complete. They forget that changes in how we think take generations, and this view is a form of egotism, believing that our generation is at a crucial moment in history. 

Take this quote from a book called Mighty Micro, published in 1979: ""In the 1980s, the book as we know it will slowly fade away."" So far, this prediction has been wrong. Reading long texts on a screen is often a frustrating experience, so most people avoid it. Additionally, the way information is organized on computers encourages people to skim through texts. Advocates of technology claim that this quick reading leads to new forms of storytelling. However, ""non-linearity"" is not new; many books have never been read from start to finish, like religious texts, dictionaries, and poetry collections. What is different now is that computers do not encourage the deep thinking that comes from reading a text in its entirety.

**The Office**

Charles walked into the office and saw a perfectly organized space. The carpet was clear of the papers that had covered it when it was first laid down, and the dark wooden desk looked just as he remembered from the Sotheby's auction five weeks ago. Neat file holders were being placed in their drawers. Twelve years' worth of trade journals filled one wall's shelves. Kathleen struggled to close the filing cabinet and then turned to him. ""You have to use computers, Charles. This is just too much."" 

""Hello, Kathleen. Oh, this is amazing,"" he said, admiring the room's antique furniture. He couldn't imagine a computer or any mechanical device in it, not even a pencil sharpener. ""Simply amazing,"" he said, avoiding the topic of computers. Over the two years he had known her, they had discussed this many times. She could never understand why he resisted technology, especially since he was skilled with computers and had even published an important paper on computer-based giftedness. She had inspired that paper. Through the keyboard, she could manipulate any software and create something new that could ""sit up and bark at the moon"" if she wanted."
CPE_32,"Text: ""You don’t take sugar, do you?"" shouted his secretary, not really asking but stating a fact—she had been making Lancelot coffee for many months. She often forgot details like this because he usually wasn’t supposed to be there. However, he had started coming in all the time, realizing that staying away only led to more problems. He thought about how he had gone from being a respected advisor, meeting authors and playwrights over lunch, to a stressed assistant trying to avoid disasters, struggling to find parking in the mornings.

""This came,"" she yelled, waving a manila folder before placing it in front of him. ""From that guy in Los Angeles. You said you wanted to see it."" A label read: ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert."" Below it, it said ""An Expanded Synopsis."" Lancelot didn’t want to see the word ""synopsis."" He preferred to see ""A First Draft."" He had already seen a synopsis of this book and didn’t want to see another, even if it was revised. Ian Cuthbert had received a large advance for this book when Lancelot had bought the company. Ian was one of several old friends Lancelot had mistakenly commissioned books from. Ian was a clear example that someone with a difficult personality often becomes even harder to manage when given a chance.

Lancelot skipped the introduction he had read many times and looked at the synopsis. He recognized almost every phrase. He closed the folder and pushed it aside. Clearly, at this rate, Ian’s manuscript would never arrive. The synopsis lacked the brilliance Ian was known for, and beneath its playful tone, it felt empty of real ideas. Lancelot remembered stories of a famous author whose last book was published incomplete after his death, written chapter by chapter, with payments made one at a time. In that case, the payments were small parts of an advance that had never been given. Ian’s advance had been huge, a clear violation of the principle that authors must deliver a manuscript before being paid.

Lancelot, who had studied modern languages at Oxford, recalled when Ian Cuthbert was seen as a great talent in a Cambridge full of promise. Ian’s peers aimed to take over British theatre and succeeded quickly. But Ian seemed lazy compared to them. He wore his overcoat like a cape and spoke about a famous French writer as if he had been there. Yet, for some reason, Ian’s creative talent remained hidden. While less talented people succeeded, Ian withdrew further. At the peak of his influence, he was already known to be very difficult to work with. Officially appointed to edit a major arts magazine, he was like a general stuck on the beach with too many resources but no action. The magazine used up the budget for many issues without being published. Similarly, his renewed contract with a fashion magazine led to stories about his high pay, which was increased in hopes of getting him to produce more, and then even more in hopes of getting him to produce anything.

At editorial meetings—always attended by famous photographers to capture the moment—Ian criticized others’ ideas harshly. Ten years later, he could hardly be counted on to show up for his own funeral. Lancelot was close to admitting that ""A World History of the Short"" had been a mistake from the start."
CPE_65,"**Text: England's Breakfast Revolution**

Health experts agree that a good breakfast is very important. However, in history, breakfast is a relatively new concept in England. There are few mentions of breakfast in medieval literature. Some travelers did eat a meal at dawn before long journeys, and sick people sometimes had breakfast for health reasons, but most people did not eat breakfast unless they were kings or nobles. 

In the sixteenth century, breakfast started to become common for everyone. Some writers believe this change happened because food became more available. However, they may not have considered other important social changes. For instance, new work patterns meant that more people had set working hours, often starting very early in the morning. As a result, eating a meal in the morning became necessary and was no longer just for the wealthy."
CPE_61,"**Text: Photography and Sport**

**Photography**  
When a photographer takes a picture, they choose visual information based on their technical skills, personal views, and experiences, along with social and cultural norms. In this book, we will explore how these factors influence the style, content, and meaning of a photograph, as well as how viewers perceive and react to these images. For instance, a casual newspaper reader may have an understanding of the photographs printed on the page. However, instead of accepting the photograph as it is, we might ask if it truly captured the scene as it appeared at that moment. Alternatively, does it express the photographer's perspective? Is the exact moment captured particularly important, or should the photograph be seen as a symbol representing a situation in the world?

**More than a Game**  
For me, sport has always been more than just a game. The most successful athletes have strong self-belief. To succeed in sports, you need to focus completely. There is only one path to being the best, and you must set aside everything else. Sports can be harsh, and no one will do the work for you. It’s a matter of survival. Sports have taught me discipline and determination, but they also show the value of teamwork. My sport allows you to shine individually, yet it is still a team effort, and you must balance both aspects. It is similar to life – you can achieve as an individual, but you must remember the people around you. Sports have given me a lot, not just money. They have opened doors for me and shown me things around the world that many will never experience. However, you also have to sacrifice a lot for these rewards.

**Tuning In**  
Some experiences are so vivid that they create clear memories. For me, such a moment happened one night in California many years ago when I lay awake listening to a mockingbird singing from a hidden spot in a tall tree in my neighborhood. I don’t have insomnia; it was the beautiful singing that kept me awake. As I listened to the bird’s complex melodies, I was drawn into a surprising artistic experience. To understand the patterns of the bird’s song, I had to recall my knowledge of jazz and Indian classical music. The bird made me feel like I was enjoying an incredible live performance of improvisation. I reacted with groans and cheers as one amazing musical variation followed another through the open window until I finally fell asleep."
CPE_52,"Text: 'Human culture has always had strong feelings about birds. But what does this reveal about us? Paul Evans reports. There is a bumping sound in the greenhouse as a small brown bird hits the glass. It is a wren: a bird often seen as a sign of something important. Is it trying to send a message from a world beyond my understanding? Or is it just a bird trapped in a greenhouse? Depending on how you look at it, both could be true. Wrens have been part of British culture for a long time. In medieval times, people believed that the direction in which wrens flew could predict their luck. Today, images of wrens can be found in many British homes. Although early beliefs may have faded or been forgotten, the wren still holds a special place in our hearts. A place without wrens feels empty. This is likely because there is a rich tradition of stories and beliefs about birds that goes back to when people were more connected to nature for their survival. When people rely on nature, they create a cultural language to express the importance of other creatures. This importance can change with cultural shifts, affecting how we view these creatures. A good example is the red kite. In the early 1500s, visitors to London were amazed to see red kites flying down to take bread from children. These birds were valued as urban scavengers. However, they soon became seen as pests and were nearly wiped out, except in Wales. Over time, red kites gained a romantic image linked to Celtic culture and have now become symbols of British conservation, being protected and reintroduced to help them thrive again. Our connection with other creatures goes back to the early days of humanity. The first birdwatchers likely paid close attention to birds because they signaled danger, bad weather, and food availability, and also connected them to their dreams. When we ask why birds matter to us, we are also exploring what it means to be human. Flight, song, and freedom—our fascination with birds reflects our own identity in relation to the wildness of nature. Some may see these feelings as outdated, useful in the past but not now. However, like the appendix and wisdom teeth, they are still part of us, and losing them would be painful. This is likely why, in recent years, birds have become indicators of environmental change: they signal the health of our environment. Conservationists in Britain report that 30 bird species are endangered, which is troubling not only because it means losing unique birds but also because it represents a significant cultural loss. These birds carry deep cultural meanings. For instance, the skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing symbolize spiritual love, romantic love, and magic. Anyone familiar with the poems of Shelley, the sonnets of Shakespeare, and Robert Graves's The White Goddess will feel sadness at the loss of these once-common birds. Yet, while we mourn the loss of these birds, we often overlook others that are not part of literature or folklore. Folklore is crucial. The stories, legends, and rhymes that endure over time have a stronger connection to their subjects than scientific terms. This connection is enhanced by the everyday language we use to share these stories, giving them the power to evoke feelings and attitudes from a deeper part of our consciousness. Whether we watch wildlife documentaries on TV or observe birds in our backyards, the joy we feel from these experiences cannot be fully explained by science. Birds engage us in ways that are difficult to understand or express, and the stories we tell about them help us interpret their messages. The wren in the greenhouse creates a link between the present and a distant past, holding onto its song and moving into the future—a mystery that keeps me wondering.'"
CPE_28,"**Maps**

The purpose of a map is to visually show the relationships between points and features on the earth's surface. These relationships are based on distance and direction. In ancient times, distance was often described in terms of time, such as ""a few hours' walk"" or ""a day's journey by river."" These descriptions provided more information about how easy it was to travel through local areas rather than the actual distance. Direction was also important, but for most travelers, the main questions were ""Where do I go from here?"" and ""How far away is it?"" Therefore, precise direction was not always crucial. For a long time, written directions were as important as maps. Even today, some maps, like those showing train routes, do not always represent true directions. 

Landmarks along a route were initially marked by signs, which could be realistic or symbolic, and their size indicated their importance. The conventions used in maps varied based on their purpose and location, so understanding these conventions is essential when studying early maps. The history of map-making, or cartography, is mainly about improving the accuracy of distance and direction and expanding the information included in maps. 

To achieve this, cartography has incorporated knowledge from other sciences. For instance, instead of determining direction by observing shadows or stars, people began using the magnetic compass and developed tools to measure angles accurately. The understanding of astronomy and exploration helped map the known world. Later, astronomers found that the earth is not a perfect sphere but slightly flattened at the poles, leading to further improvements in mapping large areas.

Over time, the needs of map users changed. Travelers and merchants were no longer the only users of maps. Soldiers, especially after the invention of artillery, required accurate maps to understand the terrain for military purposes. This need led to the creation of contour maps. Other users, like archaeologists, historians, and modern geographers, also had specific mapping needs. To meet these demands, today’s cartographers have developed methods to map various distributions, such as geological layers, climate zones, and land use.

The current recognition of the importance of maps in many scientific fields has sparked a modern revival of cartography. However, it is important to note that the development of cartography has not been a straightforward process. There have been times of decline or stagnation, interrupted by periods of rapid progress, where old ideas coexisted with new ones. Cartographers have often understood the theoretical basis for advancements but had to wait for better tools to implement their ideas. Since copying old maps is the easiest way to create new ones, and because map publishers have sometimes resisted change, maps should not be blindly accepted as accurate representations of current knowledge and techniques.

The many maps we have today are the result of significant human effort and thought. They serve as a valuable record for those studying human history. This aspect makes the study of historical cartography both fascinating and educational."
CPE_35,"**Simplified Text:**

I was taken into a young man's living room, which was a calm and cultured space surrounded by a messy collection of rooms where the less ambitious family members lived. Moving from the kitchen to his room felt like going from economy to business class. This room had the largest collection of records I had ever seen, the first stereo record player I had encountered, and the surprising fact that a teenager had spent money on fine wine glasses, pictures, and furniture. His name was Andrew Lloyd Webber. He had received a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford, to study history, and he had nine months before starting, during which he wanted to become England's version of the composer Richard Rodgers. My own dreams were just as unrealistic; I wanted to be a pop star for the usual reasons: women, money, and fame. The difference between Andrew and me was that my dreams were not life or death, although they might have felt that way if I had failed. So, when Andrew suggested that I try to become a famous lyricist like Oscar Hammerstein, I was open to the idea. This was partly because, within ten minutes of meeting him, he played me three of his own tunes, and I could tell he was very talented. As he confidently played selections from the many shows he had created at school, I was reminded of the best show albums from my parents' collection. He needed a new lyricist for the outside world. I didn’t have much to impress him with, except for my praise for his music and a seven-inch single of a song I had written with an unknown pop group that had not done well. We said goodbye, promising to meet again and write something together. I was still more interested in pop charts than in West End theatre, but on the bus back to my flat, I thought I had just met someone with rare talent and determination, and I would be foolish to miss the chance to work with someone who was likely to succeed in musical theatre soon. Even if we didn’t become top composers, we could try to compete with the Beatles and Rolling Stones later in the summer. The Everly Brothers had just made a comeback and would need new songs. 

The next day, back at my desk in the office where I was training to be a lawyer, the excitement I had felt about a life in show business with Andrew Lloyd Webber had faded a bit. I would still look at small ads in Melody Maker for groups needing a singer and write a few more simple songs that wouldn’t show off my limited singing ability. But it was likely that I would finish my exams and become a respectable lawyer by the time I was twenty-five. By then, I would probably have outgrown pop music, as my father had predicted I would by twenty-one. This worried me—if he was right, I only had a few more months to enjoy it. But for now, I felt I had nothing to lose by seeing Andrew again. It would be fun to go to a musical with him and write lyrics that imitated musical songwriters instead of pop stars. Andrew was an interesting person who talked about good food and Victorian architecture and supported the Leyton Orient football team. I wasn’t sure about the idea for a musical he had been working on for the past year, but in 1965, I was rarely sure about anything. His talent was undeniable, and he claimed to have all the right contacts. I soon found myself back in his living room. The idea was about the life of Dr. Thomas Barnardo, a nineteenth-century philanthropist who started the orphanages that carry his name. His story was important, but it didn’t really inspire me. The hero seemed too perfect in Andrew's version, and the idea felt unoriginal, too similar to Lionel Bart's hit show, Oliver. However, Andrew's strong belief in his music's brilliance was contagious and not completely unjustified. What did I know about musicals? As David Land, who would later be my agent for over twenty-five years, often said, if there is a demand for one hamburger restaurant on the block, there is room for two. We could be the second hamburger place. I began working with great enthusiasm, especially on the funny songs. Andrew explained the plot, played me the tunes, and often gave me the titles, most of which had likely been thought up by his school friend who had already tried. I even skipped a day at the law office, pretending to be sick, to write my first set of theatrical lyrics. I didn’t know it then, but I had changed my career."
CPE_5,"**Text:**

**Language**  
You and I are part of a species with a unique ability: we can influence each other's thoughts with great accuracy. Language is so deeply connected to human life that it is hard to imagine living without it. If you see two or more people together anywhere in the world, they will likely start talking to each other. When there is no one to talk to, people often speak to themselves, their pets, or even their plants. I like to think of language as an 'instinct.' This suggests that people know how to communicate in a way similar to how spiders know how to spin webs. Web-spinning was not created by a brilliant spider and does not require special education or skills in building.

**Climate and Weather**  
Climate and weather, which are mainly influenced by the air around us, greatly impact the lives and locations of animals and plants. Climate can strongly shape the character of landscapes. For instance, warm and wet conditions year-round allow tropical jungles to thrive, which are rich in diverse species. In contrast, cold and windy areas can only support a limited variety of life. The daily weather patterns that contribute to the overall climate are caused by large air masses rising and mixing, as the atmosphere is always in motion. Some of this movement is due to the fact that the layer of gases rests on a spinning Earth. Because air is light, it does not move at the same speed as the Earth and tends to lag behind. However, a more significant cause of air movement is the sun.

**Coffee**  
As a barista, my job included serving drinks, but more importantly, I was responsible for making coffee. In Lygon Street, Melbourne, a restaurant's success can depend on its coffee quality. I underwent several days of intense training in coffee-making, learning more than I ever wanted to know about cleaning and maintaining the restaurant's shiny espresso machine. I also learned the key principles for making the perfect rich, frothy cappuccino. By the end of the first week, I realized that making a good cup of coffee was not as simple as it seemed, and I feared I would be assigned to less important tasks again. Fortunately, my boss was patient. ""Making coffee is both an art and a science,"" he said, ""and you need time to develop the skill."""
CPE_41,"**Art on TV**

Why does television often struggle with programs about visual arts? Painting and sculpture are perfect subjects for the camera, which can show an entire artwork and then zoom in on the details. However, there are few TV series that successfully capture the joy and complexity of viewing art. A good example of this is Robert Hughes's eight-part series on American art, *American Visions*. Hughes is a respected critic with a strong presence, and he has nearly eight hours to introduce British viewers to an art movement that British galleries have overlooked. I expected the series to highlight great artworks, but instead, it focused on how American history and culture are reflected in its art and architecture.

**Dealing in Metals**

For 20 years, I worked as an international metals dealer and gained a reputation as a speculator. The metals market is less regulated than others. With some luck, a willingness to take risks, and a good understanding of the market, it is possible to earn a lot of money. Risk-taking is a key part of this industry. This adventurous culture fits well with a free-market global economy. However, free-trade economists who believed the market would keep the prices of scarce metals stable have found the opposite is true. More minerals are being extracted, and the cost of raw materials is falling. When considering inflation, the prices of most metals are about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to investigate claims against a multinational company that benefits from these low-cost raw materials.

**Extract from a Holiday Brochure**

Abaco and its offshore cays are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas, which stretch from Florida to Cuba. Each island has its own character and offers something unique. To explore the islands and cays of Abaco, a boat is essential. If a boat is not included with your accommodation, don’t worry. There are many ferries and water taxis available. You can also rent boats if you prefer to explore on your own. Sailing is the most popular way to travel here. Abaco is known as 'The Sailing Capital of the World' for good reason. The calm, protected waters are also perfect for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The cays and their beaches stretch for 200 miles like a string of pearls. At night, the lights of the restaurants and cafes in Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay shine brightly."
CPE_69,"**Text: Build Your Own Bamboo Bike at the UK’s First Workshop**

Join a course at the Bamboo Bike Club, led by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan, where you can create your own custom bamboo bike frame and enjoy a fun weekend of bike-building. It’s Saturday morning in Hackney Wick, east London, and the Bamboo Bike Club is busy with activity. This is the only bamboo bike-building course in Britain.

Bamboo is becoming a popular material for bike construction. Companies like Calfee Design from California and Bamboo Bikes from Yorkshire have brought back this method, which dates back to 1894. However, many cyclists find ready-made bamboo frames too expensive, costing around $2,995 or £1,868. This high price motivated James and Ian to spend years working in a shed in Brecon, Wales, to create a bamboo bike business that is affordable for average cyclists. They wanted to share the joy of making something unique and sustainable, rather than just selling bike frames.

The Bamboo Bike Club is more of a community than a business, and both James and Ian have full-time jobs—James works with wind turbines, and Ian is a civil engineer. They offer monthly courses where participants can build their own bikes at a reasonable price. 

As someone who struggles with DIY projects, I was curious about the quality of the bikes. On the first day, James and Ian teach us how to choose strong bamboo and create sturdy joints. They guide us as we glue the bamboo tubes together to form the bike frame. Alloy tubes are added for parts that need extra strength, like the handlebars and wheel forks. This process requires careful cutting and technical skills, but James and Ian are there to help if anyone has trouble.

The chance to build your own bike is exciting, and it’s interesting that most participants are engineers. Ian reassures us that everyone makes mistakes, and it’s okay to try again. Each piece of bamboo is checked for quality, allowing us to choose the look of our bike frame—plain bamboo, black, or mottled.

On Sunday, we focus on building the lugs, which are the joints of the bike. We wrap them with hemp bindings and glue them with epoxy resin to create a strong bond. After adding a waterproof coating, the bike is ready for wheels, brakes, gears, and personal touches. James and Ian claim that their bamboo bikes are just as strong as metal ones. Ian has used his bike for over a year on a 16-mile commute, and James has tested his bike off-road for three months without breaking it.

While bamboo bikes may not look as polished as professional ones, they are unique. James and Ian emphasize that individuality is important. Personally, I think bamboo bikes are best for relaxed rides rather than racing. I choose a 'Classic English' frame for a comfortable ride. 

I take James’s bike for a test ride, and it feels light and smooth, thanks to bamboo’s ability to absorb vibrations. James believes that the real joy of these workshops comes when you ride the bike. They are light and fun to ride, and the price is less than £500."

**Self-Help Books**  
Diane Reverend was an editor at Random House in New York when she first saw a manuscript by an unknown psychologist, Dr. John Gray. ""I knew it would be a bestseller,"" she says, and she was right. Dr. Gray is now very wealthy, and Diane Reverend has her own company. Dr. Gray's book on improving communication between men and women is a key part of a growing self-help industry that aims to meet many American desires for self-improvement. This industry also creates new desires and supports the New York publishing world. In Britain, people are discovering that this genre can produce many questionable books, but there are even worse ones. For every self-help book published, many more are rejected for being too similar or too specific. This is a good thing. As new editors search for the next big hit, the quality of writing is often overlooked. What matters most is how marketable the book is. ""How promotable is the author? What's the 'hook'? Is it universal enough?"" Ms. Reverend lists the important questions and adds, ""If someone comes to me with a catchy title, that's a big part of the success.""

**Autobiographies**  
There should be an understanding between an autobiographer and the reader that the truth is being shared. However, this understanding is often not fully respected. Writers may avoid sharing certain actions or thoughts because they feel ashamed or think they are not important. There are also more complex reasons for breaking this understanding. An autobiographer might believe that telling a more interesting story, even if it is not entirely true, serves the purpose of revealing the truth about themselves better than sticking strictly to the facts. Alternatively, they may choose to disregard this understanding from the start, calling their book an autobiography to gain the reader's trust, even if the story is mostly fictional. This can happen without any intention to deceive.

**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**  
Scholars of detective stories say that this genre reflects the conflicts of society in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The detective story often symbolizes deeper human desires like lust or greed, and solving the crime represents restoring order in society. In Hammett's stories, society is shown to be corrupt and false. The detective and the criminal are two sides of the same person. They understand each other and share a strange comfort. The detective is seen as too honest by criminals and too shady by the law. He exists between both worlds. His mission is sometimes influenced by his feelings of guilt, and sometimes his desire for justice is heightened by his worries about this conflict.

**Science Writing**  
Stephen Jay Gould is considered one of the best scientific essayists today. To discuss his writing, I met him at the Grand Hotel while he was promoting his new book. Neither of us felt comfortable there. Gould said he couldn't write in such a pretentious place. He believes that understanding the culture is essential for a successful writer. Science is its own world, and only those who are part of it can effectively communicate it. If you don't understand the community and its rules, you will struggle. One of Gould's key beliefs is to never write down to the reader. ""Make no concessions,"" he advises. ""You can simplify the language but must not dilute the ideas. Above all, do not simplify the argument. If readers feel patronized, your writing will fail."""
CPE_17,"**Text: Air-conditioning**  
At Cannons Gym, a popular spot for City of London workers, the air feels very cold. To cope with this summer's high temperatures, the gym has used a lot of air-conditioning. At quiet times, it feels like the Arctic. This shows how we often misuse air-conditioning today. It has become a common part of our lives, symbolizing our ability to control the climate. However, many air-conditioned buildings could use other cooling methods. They could use natural light and ventilation, and have thicker walls that keep heat out during the day and release it at night. These ideas may seem simple, but they can be very effective and would greatly reduce the need for air-conditioning.

**Sundials**  
It is interesting that as we enter a new millennium, there is a growing interest in sundials, which measure time based on the sun's position. A hundred years ago, sundials were essential for keeping clocks accurate. As clocks improved, sundials became just garden decorations—beautiful but outdated in our technological world. Now, they are being appreciated again. David Harber, a sundial maker, believes their charm comes from their connection to the planets. He says there is a magical moment when a sundial starts to work. They are calm, beautiful objects that remind us of our place in the universe.

**Paint Your Own China**  
My idea of china-painting came from a visit to an arts and crafts show where serious-looking older women showed how to paint delicate flowers on teacups. It was fascinating to watch, as each brushstroke created a perfect petal or leaf. Their hands were steady, and the paint never smudged. I thought these women must have practiced for years or had a special talent. Because of this, I wondered what kind of people would join a china-painting class. Would beginners have any natural skill? However, the atmosphere was not intimidating at all. Everyone was there to enjoy themselves, and even the teacher did not want to paint with the speed I had remembered."
CPE_47,"**Text: The Wrong Country**

Uncle chose a package holiday for them at a good price: a flight from Gatwick Airport, twelve nights in Venice, the beautiful city, at the Pensione Concordia. When Keith and Dawne went to the travel agency to book, the clerk told them that the other travelers were a school group from the south coast, all learning Italian. But something went wrong. Either at the travel agency, the check-in desk, or in a computer, a small mistake happened. Dawne and Keith ended up in a hotel called the Edelweiss, in Room 212, somewhere in Switzerland. 

At Gatwick, they gave their tickets to a girl in a yellow-and-red uniform. She called them by name, checked their tickets, and said everything was fine. An hour later, they were surprised to hear older people on the plane speaking with accents from the North of England. Keith thought there must have been a cancellation, or maybe the Italian class was on another plane. They ordered drinks, and then more drinks. 

When they landed, a stout woman with glasses said, ""The coach will take us on. Stay together now."" There was no mention of an overnight stop in the brochure, but when the coach arrived at its destination, Keith realized that this was clearly an unexpected stop. As they got off the coach, it was nearly midnight. Tired and dirty from travel, they did not question the beds they were offered. But the next morning, when they learned they would be staying there for their holiday, they became worried. 

""We have the lake and the water birds,"" the receptionist smiled and said. ""And we can take the steamer to Interlaken."" 

""An error has been made,"" Keith said calmly, trying to stay composed. He could feel his wife's nervous breathing beside him. ""We were supposed to be in Venice, at the Pensione Concordia."" 

""I do not know that name, sir. This is Switzerland,"" the receptionist replied. 

""A coach is supposed to take us on. An official said so on the plane. She was here last night,"" Keith insisted. 

""Your group is booked for twelve nights at the Edelweiss Hotel. If you have changed your minds—"" 

""We haven't changed our minds. There has been a mistake."" The receptionist shook his head. He did not know about any mistake. 

""The man who made the booking,"" Dawne interrupted, ""was bald, with glasses and a moustache."" She named the travel agency in London. 

""Is there a problem?"" a woman said, smiling at Keith. She was the stout woman he had seen as an official. They had noticed her talking to the girl at Gatwick. On the plane, she had walked up and down the aisle, smiling at people. 

""My name is Franks,"" she said. ""I'm married to the man with the bad leg."" 

""Are you in charge, Mrs. Franks?"" Dawne asked. ""We are in the wrong hotel."" Again, she gave the name of the travel agency and described the bald clerk, mentioning his glasses and moustache. 

""It seems we got into the wrong group. We reported to the Your-Kind-of-Holiday girl and left it to her,"" Keith explained. 

""We should have known when they weren't from Dover,"" Dawne added. ""We heard them talking about Darlington."" 

Keith made an impatient sound. He wished she would let him speak. ""We noticed you at Gatwick,"" he said. ""We knew you were in charge."" 

""And I noticed you. I counted you, although you probably didn't see me. Let me explain. There are many places Your-Kind-of-Holiday sends clients, with different holidays at different prices. There are villa holidays for adventurous people under thirty-five, treks to Turkey, and treks for singles to the Himalayas."" 

""What I am trying to say is that all tickets and labels look similar, yellow with two red bands."" Mrs. Franks suddenly laughed. ""So if you just followed others with the yellow-and-red label, you might think you could end up in a wildlife park! But of course,"" she added kindly, ""that couldn't happen."" 

""We're not supposed to be in Switzerland,"" Keith insisted. 

""Well, let's see,"" Mrs. Franks said unexpectedly, and then she walked away, leaving them standing there. The receptionist was no longer at the desk. They could hear typing. 

""She seems nice,"" Dawne whispered. 

Keith was not listening. He tried to remember everything that had happened: giving the girl the tickets, waiting, and then the girl leading them to the plane, and the pilot welcoming them aboard. 

""Nice to have some young people along,"" an elderly man said, interrupting Keith's thoughts. ""Nottage is the name."" His wife was with him, and they both looked like they were in their eighties. They had slept well, she said, thanks to the lakeside air. 

""That's nice,"" Dawne said. Keith walked out of the reception area, and Dawne followed him. Outside the hotel, they did not say that there was an irony in what had happened. On their first holiday since their honeymoon, they had found themselves in a package tour with older people when the whole point of the holiday was to escape the needs and demands of the elderly. Uncle had said so himself when they tried to persuade him to join them."

American business leaders are looking to the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a model for good management. Eluned Price reports. 

Most people in Britain know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and have a general idea of his achievements. However, America has only recently discovered him. The Wall Street Journal described Shackleton as ""an Antarctic explorer whose feats went largely unnoticed for most of the 20th century,"" which is an exaggeration. Now, Americans are enthusiastically learning about him. Biographies and stories about the voyage of the Endurance are being published quickly; the American Museum of Natural History is organizing a major exhibition, and Columbia Tristar is making a film about Shackleton's life.

Some American managers have also adopted Shackleton as a role model. His supporters share stories of his actions with admiration, drawing lessons in leadership and communication from his experiences. They even refer to each other as ""speaking Shackleton."" Shackleton, known for his determination and resourcefulness, has become a symbol for modern management consultants. Jim MacGregor, managing partner of Abernathy MacGregor Frank in New York, chose Shackleton as a role model years ago. His firm focuses on communication during mergers, acquisitions, and corporate crises. 

MacGregor explains that even if a company handles a crisis well, poor communication can still cause harm. ""Shackleton is a model for management because of his leadership and communication skills. He had clear values and was at his best when he and his team had a lot at stake, like their lives."" One of Shackleton's most interesting decisions was to turn back when he was only 97 miles from the South Pole. This choice showed his commitment to the safety of his men.

In a crisis, people want to know who is in charge. While many managers today avoid responsibility, Shackleton was willing to take charge. His 1914 expedition became legendary when his ship, the Endurance, was trapped in ice for nine months and eventually sank. When the ship went down, Shackleton told his men, ""We should all eventually reach safety if you do your best and trust me."" From the accounts and diaries kept during the expedition, it is clear that Shackleton was always in control. 

""Shackleton thought everything through, planned for every situation, kept his men informed, and valued their opinions,"" says MacGregor. ""He was flexible, ready to change plans when necessary. We have developed effective principles based on Shackleton's example. Clients can relate to his story without feeling criticized."" Shackleton believed that an explorer needs optimism, endurance, and patience. 

""One of the hardest things to do in difficult times is to be patient, especially in America, where there is a strong desire to fix problems quickly,"" says MacGregor. ""If you invest in bonds and make a wrong guess about interest rates, it is better to hold on and wait for your money back than to sell and take a big loss. Also, don’t hesitate to change your plans if they are not working. If a new product is failing, don’t keep selling it.""

Shackleton led by example. On the return journey from the Endurance, he noticed Hurley, the expedition photographer, without gloves. He insisted Hurley wear his gloves, saying he would throw them overboard if he didn’t. Another crew member remembered Shackleton doing something similar with a biscuit when they were near starvation on a previous expedition: ""He said he would leave it in the snow. Millions of pounds couldn’t have bought that biscuit.""

As Caroline Alexander, author of *Endurance*, says: ""The public's interest in heroic efforts is growing. Shackleton shows that true heroism is rare today. He stands out as a genuine example of the ideals we long for."""
CAE_15,"**Simplified Text: 'Finding Food in Madagascar'**

In the forests of Madagascar, there is a unique primate called the aye-aye. Its way of finding food is similar to that of a woodpecker. Both the aye-aye and the woodpecker dig into wood to find insect larvae. The woodpecker uses its beak to make holes and its long tongue to get the insects. The aye-aye, however, uses its sharp front teeth to chew into the wood and its long, thin third finger to reach inside and scoop out the insects.

Although the aye-aye's unusual feeding method was first described over a hundred years ago, scientists have only recently learned how it finds the insects hidden in the wood. Dr. Carl Erickson from Duke University studied the hunting skills of two male aye-ayes named Nosferatu and Poe, a female named Samantha, and her baby, Annabelle. He wanted to see if they could find insects by looking for signs, like holes in the wood where insects might have entered to lay eggs.

Dr. Erickson gave the aye-ayes logs with narrow holes. Some holes led to spaces with mealworms, while others were empty. The aye-ayes went directly to the holes with food, showing they did not need to see the surface holes to find the insects. It was thought they might be using smell or sound, but further tests showed they did not rely on these senses either. They could find mealworms even when their smell was blocked and could locate dead mealworms that made no noise.

So, how did the aye-ayes find the insects? Dr. Erickson found that they would chew through both empty spaces and those with mealworms. It seems they can sense the hollow spaces. When looking for food, an aye-aye taps the wood with its middle finger and moves its large ears forward to listen closely. Dr. Erickson believes the aye-aye is using a method similar to echo-location, listening for sounds that show there is a hollow space below. They might also hear insects moving when disturbed by their tapping.

The idea that the aye-aye fills the role of woodpeckers in Madagascar's forests is interesting. However, there are birds like the Sickle-billed and Nuthatch Vangas that also look for insects in wood, so the woodpecker role may not be empty. The aye-aye can be seen as a mix of a woodpecker and an echo-locating bat, but it also acts like a squirrel. Its front teeth grow continuously like a squirrel's, and it has been seen in the wild chewing through nut shells and using its long finger to get the nut meat inside."
CAE_19,"**Text: Ordinary People, Ordinary Lives**

Many of us have photos of our grandparents, but how many of us truly understand their lives and who they were when they were young? The few diaries we find often leave us wanting more, and family stories are often only partly remembered. What will our grandchildren know about us? We often plan to write down our stories but never seem to do it. We might leave behind videos instead of photos, but those will only show a flat image.

Hannah Renier has found a solution: she writes autobiographies for other people, creating a hardcover book of at least 20,000 words, with illustrations if needed. Her focus is not on famous people, but on ordinary lives. The idea came to her when she spoke with her family and realized how much of the past was fading away. ""When I started, I didn't take it as seriously as I do now, after meeting people who have interesting stories to tell,"" she says. ""They often say they are doing it for their children or for future generations, but they also enjoy the process.""

The promise of confidentiality helps her subjects feel free to share their true feelings. ""I felt confident to be honest,"" says a 62-year-old man who has experienced both success and failure in his life. ""I was surprised by what I revealed. There were painful memories, like my divorce, that still affect me.""

""I did it for my family, so they could learn something, but I haven't let my children, who are in their thirties, read it yet. They were hurt by things in my life, and there are details I don't want them to know right now. If they really want to read it, I might let them, but I prefer they read it after I'm gone."" He also noticed patterns from his childhood that led him to repeat the same mistakes. Ms. Renier has seen this in others as well. ""It's surprising how many people are influenced by their parents,"" she says. ""The messages they received as children can affect them for their entire lives. They often find themselves repeating the same behaviors, whether by marrying people their parents liked or rebelling against them.""

""Many disappointments come up. Even after sixty years, people still regret or resent unresolved issues with their parents. There is no specific age when these feelings go away. If someone had problems in their youth, they often carry them into middle age. They may live their lives trying to impress a parent who was never impressed, and if that doesn't work, some seek permission to express their feelings, like saying 'I can't stand my mother.'""

As a recorder rather than an interrogator, Ms. Renier maintains a respectful distance. ""This is not for public sharing, and I'm not a nosy person. Sometimes people share something and then say, 'I'm not sure if that should be included.' I include it anyway, and they can remove things when they see the draft. But generally, people want to be honest, flaws and all.""

""This is not vanity publishing; it's not about people saying, 'Look at my interesting life.' Things are changing quickly in our world, and we are losing touch with our past. This work helps provide a connection to our ancestors because families no longer gather as they used to. People seek a sense of immortality.""

Each book involves up to 30 hours of recorded interviews, which Ms. Renier uses to write the life story, organizing the events and interpreting them. Modern technology allows her to create everything except the binding, which features gold lettering. Clients can choose the color of the cover and the title. The final product is appealing to the intended audience and is not a cheap version of a life story. Ms. Renier organizes her material well and writes skillfully, ensuring the final content reflects the subject's life. The finished book does not look cheap and costs nearly £3,000, with additional copies priced at £25 each. She receives about ten inquiries a week, but the high cost, due to the time required, discourages many potential clients. ""I thought it would be a more affordable product than it is,"" she says. ""But the people I've worked with tend to be well-off, often readers of Harpers & Queen, a magazine where I advertise. They are the kind of people who, in the past, would have had their portraits painted to pass down to their descendants."""

The Museum of Classical Archaeology is one of the few collections of casts of Greek and Roman sculptures in the world, with over six hundred works. It is important to note that none of the sculptures are original; they are all accurate replicas made from the originals, mostly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Museum is located in a specially designed gallery with great natural light. The benefits of plaster casts are many: sculptures that were originally displayed together but are now in different museums across Europe can be seen together as they were meant to be. Most of the famous works of Greek and Roman sculpture can be viewed in just one afternoon.

By making resin copies, known as facsimiles, the center preserves the originals while making brass rubbing an enjoyable activity for everyone. The brass plates, which serve as an alternative memorial to tomb statues, spread from Germany across medieval Europe and Scandinavia. Many beautiful brasses were destroyed during various revolutions, but most of the remaining examples are found in Britain, with the widest range available at the Cambridge Centre."
CAE_13,"**Text: From Here to Fatherhood**

**A. The Theatre Director**  
I have had a unique personal life, and while I can't say I'm proud of everything, I have enjoyed 35 years with young children. This morning, I fed the baby, and that is what being a father means to me. I feel very lucky with my children. We share many interests: opera, theatre, books, and music. This has created a strong bond, especially now that they are mostly grown up and I see them more as a friend than just a father. I do not believe in physical punishment. I have slapped my children in anger before, but I do not support it. I may not have been the most attentive father, but I have always tried to be available. I am here for them if they need me, but I believe they should reach out to me. If I start asking them why they haven't contacted me, it creates unnecessary guilt. My parents did that to me, and I would never do that to my children.

**B. The Advertising Executive**  
I was quite young when my children were born, around 25, and I found the responsibilities challenging. It made me feel older quickly, but it also kept me young, which I appreciate. As they became teenagers, they introduced me to music, youth culture, and fashion, which helped me stay connected in my work. I missed some important moments when they were young, like their first concerts and sports days, and I regret that. However, now I can take them on trips to the south of France, and they enjoy spending time with my friends and attending parties and advertising events without feeling out of place. I think it helps that my job is seen as exciting.

**C. The Politician**  
My first child was born just as I was about to be elected to the Greater London Council, and the others came soon after. My wife and I promised to make time for them, but as my political career grew, finding time became difficult. I only accept weekend meetings and public events if my children can come with me. This way, they can see what I do when I am not with them, and they don’t feel like I am disappearing. I have noticed more politicians bringing their children to work, which shows we are becoming more aware of the importance of including our children in our lives.

**D. The Writer**  
My first marriage ended when my daughters, Kate and Bonnie, were young, which made me think more about fatherhood. I worked hard to stay connected with them. My ex-wife and I even tried living next to each other for a while so they could visit easily, but I think that confused them. Kate has said in interviews that I was always there for her, but I wonder if I was a good father. I was around a lot, but I treated my children like adults too soon. Kate recently said we were too lenient. I wish I had set more rules and structure instead of being so relaxed. I still worry about my older daughters just as much as my youngest. In that way, your children never really leave you.

**E. The TV Presenter**  
I was ready for children. I was 30, had met my wife, and we had a nice home, so we thought, ""Why not have a child instead of just buying new furniture?"" Having my daughter, Betty, has helped me understand who I am. Creating a child feels very special, and it is. But it also makes you just one of many parents. It can be frustrating at times, but any irritation disappears with just one look at her. A baby's smile is incredibly powerful; it can melt anyone's heart."

CAE_46,"**Text: 'Science Defying Gravity'**

Journalist Tom Mumford joins students who are using weightlessness to test their ideas. From the outside, the aircraft looked normal. The pilot informed the young passengers that it was built in 1964, a Boeing KC-135 refueling tanker, based on the Boeing 707 passenger plane. However, the 13 students from Europe and America who boarded were about to experience an extraordinary flight. Inside, the aircraft resembled a long white tunnel. There were very few windows, and it was dimly lit by lights along the padded walls. Most of the seats had been removed, except for a few at the back, where the nervous young scientists sat, feeling anxious. For a year, they had competed with other students from across Europe to earn a spot on this flight. The challenge, offered by the European Space Agency, was to propose creative experiments to be conducted in weightless conditions. Those with the best ideas won a place on this unique flight, which could be described as an incredible roller-coaster ride. 

For the next two hours, the Boeing's flight would mimic that of a large bird that had lost its way, soaring upwards before diving back down. The goal was to reach a state of weightlessness at the top of each curve. As the pilot cut the engines at 3,000 meters, the aircraft climbed higher due to its own momentum before gravity took over and it fell back to Earth. In the brief moments between rising and falling, the aircraft and everything inside it became weightless, and the 13 students would, in theory, feel closer to the moon than to the Earth.

The aircraft took off smoothly, but any remaining thoughts that we were on a regular passenger flight vanished when the pilot put the Boeing into a steep climb for about 20 seconds. The engines roared, blood rushed from our heads, and bodies were thrown across the cabin. Then the engines stopped, and we quickly transitioned to weightlessness. For 20 seconds, we floated in silence: the floor felt like a giant trampoline, and a single step could send us soaring towards the ceiling. We drifted aimlessly; the idea of moving anywhere became confusing. Directions like left or right, up or down lost their meaning. Only gravity, by keeping us grounded, allows us to understand the idea of moving elsewhere.

After ten seconds of freefall, the pilot pulled the aircraft out of its dive. The return of gravity was not as sudden as its loss, but it was still quick enough that some students landed hard. After completing our first curve, some students felt uneasy at the thought of the 29 more to come. Thirty curves added up to ten minutes of 'space time' for experiments, and the Dutch students began studying the movements of Leonardo, their robotic cat, hoping to learn how cats always land on their feet. At the right moment, the device they created to test this was released, floating upside down, and one student managed to turn it right-side up using a remote control. However, the next curve nearly ended badly when another student landed on top of it during a less controlled return to gravity.

Next to the slightly dazed robotic cat, a German team from the University of Aachen studied how the quality of metal joints is affected by the absence of gravity, with plans for future space stations. Another team from Utah State University explored the possibility of creating solar sails from thin liquid films hardened by ultraviolet sunlight. They hoped that once perfected, satellites could use solar sails to harness the sun's radiation, similar to how a yacht's sails catch the wind.

After two hours of swinging between heaven and Earth, breakfast felt unstable, but the main feeling was excitement, not sickness. This feeling would stay with us for a long time. ""It was an unforgettable experience,"" said one student. ""I was already planning to become an astronaut, but now I want it even more."""

**With the Trees, I Planted My Stake in New Zealand**  
**JONATHON PORRITT TALKS TO DANNY DANZIGER**  
Jonathon Porritt is the author of *Seeing Green - The Politics of Ecology*.

I had a strange time in my life when I didn’t experience any summers. I went to New Zealand every summer, which was actually winter there, so I had nine winters in a row. I enjoyed it because I like winter. My parents had the idea to buy a small piece of land for my brother, sister, and me to take care of. My mother said, “If you can plant trees on it, then you can have it.” The idea was that we would always have a connection to New Zealand, which is nice because my father grew up there. They found a piece of land about 20 miles north of Auckland in a place called Rangitoupuni. The land was not very good, but it was suitable for planting trees. I have always been interested in land. I spent a year in Australia working on sheep farms and doing various farming jobs, so the idea of planting trees excited me, and I was eager to start. My family became enthusiastic as we went along. I began planting in 1968, and by the end of 1972, the three of us had planted the entire 70 acres.

In New Zealand in 1968, it was one of those rainy winters. It rained a lot, almost every day we were planting. It seems strange to remember it as a happy time since I was often wet and cold. Every morning was a challenge: getting ready for planting. I would come out of the Land Rover warm and dry, but then the rain would start, and I would struggle with wet clothes and slippery shoelaces. “The brain begins to take over and allows for many strange thoughts and reflections about life.” In that first year, I had a helper who was an experienced tree-planter, which was very useful since I had never planted trees seriously before. You wear a planting bag around your neck, filling it with as many trees as you can. When the bag is full, it’s heavy, but it gets easier as it gets lighter.

The hardest part of the job was getting the lines straight. You decide how far apart to plant the trees, then set up three poles in a straight line. These poles guide your planting. Once you are in line, you plant all the way down and then turn around and come back. I enjoy hard physical work, and it kept me fit. After a while, you can plant trees almost automatically, getting into a rhythm and using the fewest spade strokes needed to dig a hole. This rhythm is important in many farming jobs; you train your body to perform standard moves, making the work easier. You develop a regular process: taking the tree from the bag, digging a hole, placing it in the ground, stamping it down, and moving on. 

Mentally, it’s interesting. My mind starts to wander, and I think about many things, including our connection to nature. A lot of my thoughts about the natural world began during those days. I have returned to New Zealand four times since then and watched the trees grow, which is very satisfying because I planted them and feel a connection to their success. I always worry when I read news about strong winds or droughts in New Zealand. Such news makes me anxious. However, everything turned out well, and those trees are now 20 years old and healthy.

I should add that I took a break from teaching and went back in 1984 for three months by myself. I wrote my first book there, *Seeing Green*. There is a simple cabin on the tree farm with just a bed, a table, and a chair. In the mornings, I wrote; in the afternoons, I pruned the trees; and in the evenings, I did research. My connection to that area is still very strong. It is the place I feel most connected to in terms of the bond between people and the earth. It is a powerful connection."
CAE_10,"**Text: 'CARING FOR BADGER CUBS'**

""What now?"" was my first thought when one of my helpers brought a cardboard box to me. My husband Derek and I have run an open farm in Somerset for six years, known for caring for orphaned animals. The noise from the box—a mix of a cackle and a bark—was unfamiliar, so I looked inside and found three small grey badger cubs, each about eight inches long. Their soft coats were covered in fleas, and their milky eyes looked up at me from their tiny black-and-white striped heads. I had never seen badger cubs before. Most are born between mid-January and mid-March and spend their early lives underground. If they are orphaned, they often die from starvation without being found. These three were brought to me by builders who accidentally disturbed their home while laying drain pipes. Their mother was found dead, with her babies still trying to suckle. I could see they were healthy but cold and whimpering. After removing the fleas, I took them into the farmhouse kitchen and placed them beside the stove for warmth. There were two females, Primrose and Bluebell, and a male, Willow. At first, I used a syringe to feed them, but I had to wipe each cub with a warm cloth first to mimic the mother’s licking. This helped them to relieve themselves. For the first few days, they were fed every four hours. Within a week, the cubs learned to drink from a bottle and started moving around, though a bit unsteadily. They were happy with each other and a heated pad as a substitute for their mother. 

However, three weeks later, I noticed that Willow seemed tired, even though he was eating normally. This was a warning sign. I should have acted quickly; when I checked the next morning, I found him dead. The vet's examination showed that Willow had died from a lung infection. When bottle-feeding any animal, it is important not to let it drink too quickly, as liquid can enter the lungs. In Willow's case, this caused an infection that would have been hard to treat, even with antibiotics, because he was so small. Feeling sad about my loss, I continued to care for the other two cubs. Then, six days later, a local farmer, who had heard about our cubs, came to see me. He had found a single male cub abandoned by its mother behind some silage bags. He knew she would not return, as the area had been disturbed too much, and the cub was cold and hungry. Willow II joined us. At six weeks old, he was about two weeks younger than the females, and I soon learned why his mother had left him. He was very difficult to feed. I had to keep moving the bottle's teat around and squeezing it to get him to drink. After ten minutes, he would finally latch on as if he hadn’t eaten all day. By the end of April, the females were eating creamed rice and anything else they could find. Willow was happy to stop using the bottle but struggled to eat without making a mess. Eventually, I offered him a sausage, which he slowly chewed, played with, and finally ate. After a week of sausages, he was ready to try other foods. At nearly five months old, they were all eating cereals for breakfast, a meat and vegetable meal for lunch, and fruit, nuts, cheese, hard-boiled eggs, and sunflower seeds in the evening. Normally, badgers eat 60% earthworms, along with beetles, bugs, baby rabbits, mice, voles, and even plant shoots or roots. My badgers were better off than other cubs that year; the summer was very hot, making it hard to find earthworms. 

By August, my foundlings had started to become nocturnal, going for walks at dusk or late at night. We often walked through the cider orchard, where the long grass made it easy to play. The cubs would get excited, fluff up their fur, and chase each other's tails. As ""human badgers,"" we joined in their fun. I learned to avoid their playful nips, but Derek, who joined us less often, sometimes got caught and had colorful reactions to his bruises. During two of these late-night walks in the dry weather, I saw other badgers in our field. They were likely expanding their territory to find food, even though badgers are very territorial and will fight others that enter their area. We were warned that they might come into our badger pen and harm the cubs, so we covered the gate with sheet metal to keep it secure. The local press took pictures of me walking the badgers, and the response led us to start a campaign to build a sett on the farm for the badgers to live in. With help from others, we designed a new home for them. Daniel, one of our sons, drew the plans, and we built a sett with tunnels, an enclosure, and a badger gate that faced their usual walking path. It had three chambers, one larger than the others, with a glass side so people could see inside from a darkened area. As the sett took shape, the badgers explored it before their walks. Eventually, they became so excited about the tunnels that they forgot about their walks. The building costs were higher than we expected, but a local bus company called Badgerline sponsored part of the project, and local businesses donated materials. Everyone wanted to see the badgers have a home. One evening, they finally moved in. After watching them for a while, we left them to settle. Half an hour later, I quietly returned to check on them and saw three badgers curled up in their chambers, sound asleep. 

These days, I don’t walk with them as often, especially since they don’t fully wake up until midnight. We see Primrose only occasionally, as she has joined a nearby sett, but Bluebell and Willow II still come to greet me before they dash off into the night. This is their territory now, a place they know well and a home they have happily accepted."
CAE_67,"**Text: In Search of True North - The Man Behind Halley's Comet**

Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, wants to follow in the footsteps of Sir Edmund Halley, who studied compass variations. Anjana Ahuja reports.

Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is famous for the comet named after him. However, one of his most important achievements was mapping the 'variations of the compass' during his sea voyages on the warship Paramore. These variations, now called 'declination', refer to the angle between magnetic north and true geographical north. Understanding declination was crucial for sailors to correct their compasses and navigate accurately.

Halley, one of only two men in England at that time who were paid for scientific research, set out for the Cape Verde Islands to chart declination in the North and South Atlantic. His first trip was cut short due to crew problems, but he later sailed to Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, Newfoundland, and back to England. In 1701, he published a 'New and Correct Chart showing the Variations of the Compass in the Western and Southern Oceans'. This early chart was essential for sailors for over a century until changes in the Earth's magnetic field made it less accurate.

Dr. Clark, a passionate sailor, plans to celebrate the 300th anniversary of Halley's journey by retracing the Paramore's route. He needs to raise £70,000 before starting, with support from Sir Vivian Fuchs, who led the first expedition across Antarctica. Dr. Clark became interested in Halley while working at Halley Station in Antarctica, where he read about Halley's life. ""Halley had an extraordinary life,"" Dr. Clark says. ""He was a respected scientist and led expeditions. He was not only an astronomer but also studied geophysics. While he was Astronomer Royal, he mapped stars and worked on other projects.""

During this time, Halley invented a diving bell and advised Sir Isaac Newton on his book, Principia Mathematica, which is a key work in physics. Dr. Clark believes that recreating Halley's voyage will give him the recognition he deserves. His expedition, called 'In the Wake of the Paramore', will also have scientific value. It will involve taking measurements similar to Halley's but with more advanced tools. These measurements are important because the Earth's magnetic field is always changing. The data collected will help improve the current model of the Earth's magnetic field, known as the international geomagnetic reference field.

""It is common to measure the strength but not the direction of the magnetic field,"" Dr. Clark explains. ""To measure direction, you need to know true north."" On this expedition, they will use global positioning satellites to find true north. The British Geological Survey and the United States Navy will provide instruments, and a Danish satellite will also be taking similar measurements. Dr. Clark hopes his measurements will fill in any gaps in the satellite's coverage of the Atlantic Ocean, and having ground-based measurements will be useful for comparison.

Halley's journey was significant as it was the first scientific expedition at sea, and he was the first civilian appointed as a naval captain to study declination. Does Dr. Clark have the qualifications to succeed in his journey? He has spent two years in Antarctica and worked in the geomagnetic group at the British Geological Survey. He has already sailed the 13,000 kilometers from Rio de Janeiro to England. He plans to complete the expedition in four stages with different crews.

Does he share Halley's obsessive nature? ""I am willing to dedicate eight months to this, so some might say I'm obsessed. But I wouldn't want to sail across the Atlantic again without a good reason. Halley and his remarkable life have given me a strong sense of purpose."""
CAE_27,"**Text: 'POWER DRESSING'**

Every summer, the peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show off their beautiful tail feathers to the often critical hens. This behavior puzzles scientists, including Charles Darwin, who wondered how such a display could evolve in a competitive world where survival is key. Darwin believed that evolution happens through natural selection, where the strongest and most suited individuals survive and reproduce. However, he found peacocks' tails to be a burden rather than an advantage, leading him to propose a different idea called 'sexual selection.' He suggested that females are attracted to beauty for its own sake.

Darwin's friend, Alfred Russel Wallace, disagreed. He thought that if peahens preferred males with the most impressive tails, there must be another reason behind this choice that was not obvious to humans. According to Wallace, the tail was not just for show; it indicated some real quality that helped with survival.

Now, a century later, researchers like Marion Petrie are studying peafowl at Whipsnade to answer two main questions: Do peahens really prefer the males with the most extravagant tails? And do these males have any real advantages, or is it just about appearance? Observations show that hens do seem to prefer males with more eye spots on their tails, which are linked to tail length. However, it is still unclear if these males are better in other ways.

William Hamilton from Oxford University has suggested that showy male birds might be healthier and free from parasites, and their bright feathers could signal this health. While there is evidence for this in other bird species, Petrie and her team have not yet been able to test this idea with the peacocks at Whipsnade. This year, they are comparing the offspring of attractive and unattractive males to see if the attractive ones produce healthier and faster-growing young. If so, it would support Wallace's idea that female choice is practical.

There is also an interesting theory from mathematician R A Fisher, known as 'Fisher's Runaway.' He proposed that if a female chooses a male with a slightly better tail, her sons will inherit that tail, and her daughters will inherit her preference for long tails. This could lead to a situation where, over generations, males with the longest tails attract the most mates, reinforcing the preference for long tails. Modern computer models suggest that this process could explain the evolution of the peacock's tail, supporting Darwin's idea that females might eventually select beauty for its own sake."
CAE_66,"**THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS**

Tom Cunliffe believes that the best boat design should mix traditional and modern elements. He applied this idea in his own boat, 'The Westerman'. This week, the Summer Boat Show in London showcases many beautiful yachts filled with new technology. Most of these boats are descendants of a major design change that happened 25 years ago. In contrast, my boat rests quietly in a tidal creek on the south coast. Although she was designed last year, she looks like she is 100 years old, which might make you think her owner is a romantic. Perhaps I am, but I’m not sure.

This boat benefits from the charm of classic design, but modern technology has made the process easier. However, it is important to note that advanced technology often separates sailors from the real challenges of life at sea. These challenges are often what they wanted to experience by going sailing in the first place. I am not saying that sailors should go back to facing every difficulty. I believe it is essential for my boats to have a coal stove for warmth and comfortable sleeping areas. But why go sailing if every sail operates automatically? Dealing with a flapping sail is part of being a sailor.

Why should we give up common sense and move our steering positions from the safe back of the boat to a less secure spot near the front? Unfortunately, this change creates a cabin that resembles an ocean liner, with a bed larger than one at home. For me, a boat should always be a boat, not a house on the water. When I bought my previous boat, Hirta, to sail around Britain for a TV race series, the previous owner noted that she had all the comforts but no luxuries. During my time with her, I learned how true that was. Hirta had heavy sails, no running water, little electricity, no fridge, no central heating, no winches, and no electronics, especially for navigation. Yet, she was the kindest and easiest boat I have ever sailed.

However, classic boats require a lot of maintenance due to their age. When I injured my back, I realized that my 15-year relationship with Hirta had to end. I looked for a younger replacement but found none that were suitable, so I decided to build a new boat from scratch. The Westerman has never let me down. Although designer Nigel Irens and his assistant Ed Burnett are skilled with computer design programs, Irens first sketched this boat on a paper napkin before moving to the computer. After creating a set of lines, he carved a model, just like boat builders did in the past. Together, we reviewed the initial design and then made adjustments using the computer. The next version was almost perfect, and by the time we finished, the design was flawless.

The completed boat has crossed the North Atlantic and won four out of her first six races. She has a timeless look, moves beautifully at sea, and her interior, made from reclaimed pitch pine, creates a peaceful atmosphere. Perhaps this is because she was designed solely as a sailing boat, without considering any furniture we might add. This is a traditional approach in boat design. In her calm presence, she proves that this method works; there is no need to follow modern trends to find happiness, and sometimes it is wise to learn from history. Built with wood treated with a special glue, she is completely waterproof. Therefore, she has all the advantages of a fiberglass boat while looking, feeling, and sailing like a true classic."

Health farms and country house hotels with spa facilities are becoming very popular. We asked five journalists to visit some of these places.

**A. HENLOW GRANGE**  
I was happy to spend six days at Henlow Grange because I was tired and needed to relax. My room in the large 18th-century house was very comfortable, and I felt calm right away. On the first day, I did nothing and slept a lot. From the second day, I started attending body conditioning classes, including stretch and tone, yoga, and body alignment. The instructors are very skilled. I was surprised at how flexible I felt as the week went on. They offer many treatments, such as aromatherapy (which helped me relax), seaweed baths, manicures, and pedicures. The facial treatment, which lasts an hour, truly makes you feel rejuvenated. The staff in the treatment rooms were friendly, nice, and professional. The atmosphere is full of energy and enthusiasm. Henlow plans to renovate this year, adding a half-size Olympic swimming pool and a Light Diet Room. Bicycles are available for riding around the grounds. If you prefer to relax, you can read a magazine or take a peaceful walk in the garden. During my stay, my mood and appetite improved. I left feeling wonderful and energetic, which lasted a long time. I definitely want to visit again. This is the perfect getaway for a stressed working woman. Save Room 5 for me!

**B. SHRUBLAND HALL**  
The calm and relaxing atmosphere of this stately home was clear as soon as I entered the reception area. The Hall has a beautifully decorated library, a lovely conservatory, and plenty of space, so you can avoid talking to others if you wish. Upon arrival, everyone receives a medical check, including an examination of weight and blood pressure. We were all called patients, which felt a bit strange since I am healthy. However, I was impressed that a shoulder issue found during the exam was quickly addressed by the fitness instructor, and we worked on it in group workshops and individual sessions. Each patient follows a specific diet. I lost weight without fasting, but I was still hungry enough to get a bad headache on the second day. My daily menu included grapefruit and honey for breakfast, salads for lunch, and a mix of exotic fruit, yogurt, and hot broth for dinner. If you are not on a light diet, you can eat in the main dining hall, where the food is tasty and well-presented. You receive a massage or water therapy every other day. All extra treatments are reasonably priced.

**C. CAREYS MANOR**  
Careys is not a health farm and does not claim to be one. It is a charming old manor with cozy log fires and a spacious lounge. If you are counting calories, you might want to skip the gourmet food. The French chef prepares rich sauces and delicious creamy desserts. Luckily, the hotel has a fully-equipped gym and a soft-water pool, so I could work off some of the tempting dishes. (You can choose a 'health-conscious' diet if you want to lose weight.) There is a spa bath, steam room, Swiss shower, sauna, and treatment rooms. A major attraction is the sports injury clinic. I received expert advice on an old shoulder injury. The physiotherapist suggested good posture, exercises, and massage. Careys is both comfortable and luxurious, relaxed and calm. If you want to explore, there is beautiful countryside nearby.

**D. CLIVEDEN**  
Cliveden is a grand country home and a five-star hotel that treats its guests like royalty. It offers health and beauty treatments, a well-equipped gym, saunas, a swimming pool, tennis, horse riding, and more. There are beautiful woodland walks and gardens on the 376-acre National Trust estate. Waldo's, a highly-rated restaurant, serves dishes that are truly delightful. It took me half an hour to read the dinner menu because there were so many choices. The meal was fantastic, especially the sticky-toffee pudding with banana ice cream. I went to bed feeling very happy! The next morning, I spent a few hours in the gym using exercise equipment to burn off some calories before my next meal. In the Pavilion, I enjoyed a facial with gentle heat and essential oils, followed by an aromatherapy massage. I thought about the other reports my fellow journalists would write about fitness assessments, workouts, and beauty treatments. Cliveden offers all these options if you want to use them before enjoying a meal at Waldo's.

**E. SPRINGS HYDRO**  
The best and worst thing about Springs Hydro is the carrot cake. The best because it is the most delicious I have ever tasted. The worst because it has 360 calories, which can be a setback if you want to lose weight. You have been warned! The second best thing is the amazing aromatherapy massage. I chose a relaxing oil blend and fell asleep twice during the massage. I returned to my room and had the best night's sleep in years. The facilities are modern and well-organized, with luxurious bedrooms. There are many therapists and beauty rooms, making it easy to schedule appointments. A variety of treatments are available, from manicures and pedicures to deep-cleansing facials and body treatments. The guests are a diverse group, including football teams, mothers and daughters, best friends, and singles. Ideally, I would take a break here about once a month.

CAE_22,"**NATURAL TALENTS**

In the seven million years since humans separated from chimpanzees, we have not developed many differences; genetically, we are still over 98% similar to chimps. This suggests that the traits that make us different from animals are very recent. Our biological history indicates that our ability to create art and other unique human traits must come from just a small number of our genes. This is a significant responsibility for a limited set of genes. 

Recent studies of animal behavior have reduced the list of traits once thought to be unique to humans, showing that most differences are just variations in degree. For instance, tools are used not only by humans but also by wild chimpanzees, which use sticks to eat and as weapons, and by sea otters, which use rocks to open clams. Regarding language, monkeys have a basic system with different sounds for 'leopard', 'eagle', and 'snake'. These findings suggest that there are few absolute differences between humans and animals, aside from art.

If human art comes from a unique genetic trait, it is curious that our ancestors did not create art for almost 6.9 million of the 7 million years since separating from chimps. The earliest forms of art may have been wood carvings or body painting, but we cannot know for sure because these materials do not last. The first clear evidence of human art appears around 35,000 years ago with cave paintings, statues, necklaces, and musical instruments.

If we argue that our recent artistic explosion sets us apart, we must consider how our art differs from that of animals. Three common claims are that human art is non-utilitarian, created for aesthetic pleasure, and learned rather than instinctive. Let’s examine these claims.

First, as Oscar Wilde said, ""All art is quite useless."" A biologist might interpret this to mean that human art does not help us survive or pass on our genes, unlike most animal behaviors. While some human art communicates ideas to others, this is not the same as passing on genes. In contrast, birdsong serves clear purposes, such as defending territory or attracting mates, which helps transmit genes. By this standard, human art does seem different.

The second claim is that only human art is motivated by aesthetic pleasure. We cannot ask birds if they enjoy their songs, but it is likely they sing mainly during mating season, suggesting they do not sing just for beauty. Again, by this measure, human art appears unique.

The third claim is that human art is learned rather than instinctive. Each human culture has its own art styles that are learned. For example, songs in Tokyo and Paris are easily distinguishable. However, these differences are not genetic. People from different cultures can learn each other's songs. In contrast, some bird species inherit the ability to sing their specific songs, even if they have never heard them before. 

The role of learning in human art is evident in how quickly our art styles change. Roman writers described geese honking 2,000 years ago, and they still do today. However, human art evolves rapidly; even casual museum visitors can tell that most twentieth-century paintings are newer than the Mona Lisa. Art experts can often identify when and who painted a work, but they might confuse two mid-twentieth-century artists named Congo and Betsy, who were actually chimpanzees. Congo created up to 33 paintings in one day, seemingly for his own enjoyment, and became upset when his pencil was taken away. Congo and Betsy had a show of their paintings in 1957 at London's Institute of Contemporary Art, and many of their works sold, which is something many human artists cannot claim.

These paintings by our closest relatives blur the lines between human art and animal behavior. Like human art, the ape paintings served no practical purpose; they were created for the satisfaction of the painter. One might argue that human art is different because most human artists intend their work as a means of communication, while the apes did not care to share their paintings. However, this argument is not entirely convincing, as some famous human art was also created for personal satisfaction."
CAE_39,"**Text: An Amazing Adventure**

The Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last unexplored places on Earth. It is also very dangerous. Charles Blackmore crossed it and lived to tell the story. There are very few big adventures left and very few heroes. Children's stories used to be about brave explorers with sunburnt skin and eyes squinting to see far away on their journeys into the unknown. Nowadays, you rarely find such people in stories or in real life. Or so I thought until I met Charles Blackmore.

Blackmore's great adventure was leading a team across the Taklamakan Desert, one of the last unexplored places on Earth. Its name means ""once entered, you never come out,"" but local people call it the Desert of Death. He remembered the dangers and excitement of that incredible journey while sitting calmly at home with his family. The team he led included four Britons (one was the medical officer), an American photographer, four Chinese experts on the area, 30 camels, and six camel handlers. It later turned out that the camel handlers had never worked with camels before; they were long-distance truck drivers. This misunderstanding could have cost everyone their lives and put the expedition at risk.

This diverse group set out to cross 1,200 kilometers of the world's harshest desert, and Charles Blackmore wrote a fascinating account of their journey. At that time, he was about to leave the Army after 14 happy years. He started the expedition for fun, to fill a gap in his life, and to discover who he really was outside the Army. ""I had always thought I would spend my whole life in the Army. I had been offered a promotion, but suddenly I wanted to see who Charles Blackmore really was. It was a big risk. My wife, Tina, was very worried that I wouldn't come back since nobody had ever done that route before; we went into it without knowing what to expect. In the end, it took 59 days to cross from west to east, and the desert was surprisingly good to us.""

Anyone reading his remarkable account of that journey will be surprised by the word ""good."" The team faced terrible hardships: severe stomach illness, extreme temperatures, intense thirst, and losing part of their precious water supply. ""But,"" Blackmore explains, ""when we were at our limits and the camels had gone without water for seven days, we found some. We didn't experience the Taklamakan's famous sandstorms, and we never faced the freezing cold that could have stopped us completely. That doesn't mean we weren't constantly facing challenges. The fine sand got into everything, especially blisters and wounds. The high dunes were hard to climb for us and for the heavily loaded camels, which often rolled over onto us.""

""What pushed me on more than anything was the need to survive. We had no backup plan. Our budget and time did not allow for one. No aircraft ever flew over us. Once we entered the sandhills, we were completely on our own. I knew I had the mental strength for the trip, but I was very scared about my physical ability to do it. I remember the first day — we sat at the edge of the desert, and it was so hot that it was hard to breathe. I thought, 'We have to do it now!' At that moment, I was very scared.""

If it was like that at the beginning, how did they feel towards the end? ""After walking for 1,000 kilometers, you are not going to give up. You have endured so much; you have come so far. We were very thin but also very strong despite our exhaustion. My body was fit, and my legs felt powerful. I could walk over anything.""

Midway through the book, Blackmore describes lying in the desert, looking up at a full moon, and thinking of his family. How aware was he of how hard it must have been for them? ""Inside me, there is someone trying to find peace. When I have doubts about myself now, I think back to the image of the desert and remember that we managed to complete that journey. I feel prouder of that expedition than of anything else I've done. Yet, when I think of my life as a whole, I think of my family and the happiness we share — by that measure, the desert does not compare.""

Has Charles Blackmore found peace? ""I long for the challenge — for the open spaces — the excitement of it all. We were lifted by our sense of purpose. I find it hard now to fit into the sameness of modern life."""

Life was becoming overwhelming for Susan Harr, so she decided to unplug her gadgets and enjoy manual work again. Many people love technology because it provides us with amazing devices that make life easier and give us more free time. However, this reliance on technology has led us to believe that it is essential and acceptable. The truth is clear: using our hands does not harm the environment like machines do. 

After a frustrating experience with a broken word processor, which cost a lot to fix, Susan realized that gadgets often aren't worth the money or hassle. She started to let her household technology fade away as it broke down. This made her question what ""time"" technology really gives us. Does it just allow us to do more things that require even more gadgets? If that’s the case, then the marketing experts are tricking us.

When her broken machine started making strange noises, even after being unplugged, she left it outside, where it now sits quietly. She enjoys not being tied to a noisy machine and can take her time with her sewing. Although she appreciates some gadgets, like her washing machine, she found joy in giving up others. 

Feeling that they were spending too much time in front of the TV, she returned their rented color television and went back to a small black-and-white one. This change helped them focus on what was truly worth watching and allowed them to spend more time walking their dog, reading, talking, and enjoying other hobbies. For Susan, one of these hobbies is sewing, and her old sewing machine has become a plant table. Since she cannot afford to replace it, she has started sewing by hand.

People often think they cannot live without their gadgets, but Susan believes that life can be better without them. She feels sorry for those who had to endure hard, boring work. Computers now do many tasks for us, but Susan finds that sewing by hand is enjoyable and fulfilling. She can listen to the radio or talk with family while sewing. If the task is simple, she can even watch her favorite TV shows without feeling guilty, as she is also being productive.

Sewing by hand gives her a comforting feeling, and she has come to appreciate the skill involved. She finds that things get done quickly, and life slows down to match her own pace. She no longer feels the pressure to rush from one task to another. While washing dishes, she can relax and daydream. 

Now, Susan looks around her home and wonders if they really need all their appliances, like the freezer, microwave, or electric lawnmower. She realizes they could save a lot of money by living without electric lights!"
CAE_62,"Text: 'The Cabinet-Maker Charles Hurst makes a living from beautifully crafted furniture. Joanna Watt meets him. Charles Hurst seems like a man in a hurry. When I arrive at his workshop, located under a railway arch in East London, he greets me with a quick handshake and says, ""Well, fire away then!"" It is not clear if this brusqueness is genuine or if he is hiding a shy side. However, looking around the workshop shows that Hurst is very busy, with good reason not to waste any time. The arched space is filled with half-finished furniture and wooden planks in many natural colors. Hurst has been a cabinet-maker for ten years and has built a strong reputation. His order book is always full for several months ahead, even though he does not actively promote himself. People know that if you want a good cupboard, table, bookcase, or kitchen units, Hurst is the one to contact. 

Finding a furniture-maker is not difficult, as the craft is alive and well in the countryside. However, it is harder to find a cabinet-maker who takes pride in creating beautifully crafted furniture with clean, simple lines. ""There are few real cabinet-makers now. Many call themselves furniture-makers,"" Hurst says tiredly. As a craftsman with high standards, he is often disappointed by some modern furniture. ""I am amazed by what some furniture-makers get away with, and saddened by what people accept."" He criticizes poor-quality, mass-produced furniture and craftsmen who produce second-rate pieces. This quest for perfection is clearly a key to Hurst's success, along with his talent. He is not shy about his skills. In fact, his strong self-confidence is surprising given his initial brusque manner. ""I have a huge natural ability,"" he says seriously. ""I have always been good at making things."" If it were not for his modesty towards the end of our interview, I would have thought he was completely serious.

Hurst is self-taught. So how did he learn his craft? ""I asked the right questions and picked it all up,"" he says casually. Most of his work comes from private clients. ""I used to do some commercial work for companies, but it was soul-destroying."" Some clients return to him repeatedly. ""You end up doing their whole house. That is very satisfying."" However, he honestly admits that not all client relationships are easy. ""The most frustrating clients are those who don’t know what they want, and then decide too late. My favorite clients are the exacting ones."" 

While Hurst has every reason to be proud, he is also generous in praising others when it is deserved. With a sudden touch of modesty, he says, ""There are people far better than me. I can admire others. After all, I wasn't trained at Parnham,"" which is a leading college of furniture design. However, he is also very critical of craftsmen who ""try to be artists and take a year to make one piece."" He has little patience for degree shows, where students display their work while trying to make fashion statements. ""That can be pretentious. A piece of furniture is not about making a statement. It has to be something people can really use."" 

Confident and sometimes brusque, Hurst is never pretentious, and his final words show a practical approach to his craft along with a humility that contrasts with his earlier self-confidence. ""After all, I am only making furniture,"" he says as I leave.'"
CAE_49,"**Three Theories About Sleep**

People spend about one-third of their lives sleeping. This suggests that sleep is very important. However, scientists do not fully agree on why we need to sleep. There are three main theories.

The first theory is the most popular. It says that sleep is mainly for our physical health. It suggests that while we sleep, our bodies work to repair damage from the day and to help us feel better.

The second theory focuses on learning. It claims that sleep helps us process the information we learn during the day. According to this theory, without sleep, we would not be able to learn effectively.

The third theory is about energy. It states that we need to sleep to recharge our energy, so we are ready for the next day."
CAE_31,"**ECCENTRICS**

An eccentric is someone whose behavior is unusual and does not follow the accepted norms of society. This raises the question, ""What is normal?"" Most of us have our own quirks and odd habits. It could be a love for entering newspaper competitions, a habit of collecting beer mats, or a tendency to write letters to the editor about various topics. Eccentricity is a way of expressing our individuality. 

Inside us, there is often a struggle between two opposing forces. One is called individualism, which represents our desire to be unique, and the other is conformity, which represents our need to fit in. For many, the desire to be accepted and liked by others is stronger than the desire to stand out and be different. 

People with unusual hobbies or strong opinions often come together. They form clubs, hold meetings, and organize events to share their interests or concerns. The key word here is 'common.' They seek others who understand what their friends and family might see as odd. Being part of a group, even a small one, can be comforting.

Most of us feel a tension between individualism and conformity. While we may follow the crowd, we often dislike being told that we are doing so. We feel a need to show our individuality, like when a man at a bar declares, ""I say what I think,"" or when a newcomer insists, ""You must take me as I am."" 

At any moment, we can choose to embrace our individuality. Many people succeed in their careers by doing just that. For example, Bob Dylan, the American singer, has said, ""When you feel strongly about what you are doing and pursue it with determination, you will surprise many people."" However, this assertion of individuality is not the same as eccentricity, especially in the beginning. 

When a pop singer wears strange clothes for attention, or a socialite makes shocking comments to be noticed, that is not eccentricity. But if they continue these behaviors until they become part of who they are, then they may be considered eccentric. The key aspect of eccentricity is its naturalness. Eccentrics do not try to be odd; they simply are. 

A true eccentric is not focused on what others think. They act according to their true selves. This sets eccentrics apart from enthusiasts, practical jokers, clever criminals, attention-seekers, and recluses. These individuals are aware of the world around them and often act in response to it. Some want to impress society, while others want to escape from it. In contrast, eccentrics live their lives freely, regardless of societal expectations."
CAE_58,"**Natural Books**

We asked four well-known naturalists to share the wildlife book that has influenced them the most.

**A. Geoffrey Lean**  
Choosing the author was easy for me. As an environmental journalist, I have had the chance to meet some of the great thinkers in this field. Among them, Barbara Ward stands out. She has been at the center of environmental issues in Europe after the war. She combined her experiences from various environmental movements into a powerful philosophy. As a young journalist, I found that she helped me understand these complex topics better than anyone else. Choosing her book was more difficult. It could have been *Only One Earth* or *Progress for a Small Planet*, but I believe *The Home of Man* is her most important work. It discusses the rapid growth of cities and addresses the big themes she cared about. It is a passionate call for what we now call ""sustainable human development."" I have read many books since, but none have matched its impact.

**B. Linda Bennett**  
When I read *Signals for Survival* by Niko Tinbergen, I can hear the calls of herring gulls and remember the smell of guano in the sun. This book wonderfully explains the world of animal communication through words and pictures. After reading it, watching a gull colony becomes fascinating; what seems like chaos turns into a well-organized social structure. You can see which birds are partners and recognize families later in the season. Niko Tinbergen was a respected behaviorist who wanted to share his findings with everyone. His collaboration with talented wildlife artist Eric Ennion made this book special and interesting for anyone who loves wildlife. Ennion's paintings, created from years of observing birds, show how one gull can be aggressive while another is calm. This is the work of a true naturalist.

**C. Lee Durrell**  
The book that has influenced me the most is *My Family and Other Animals* by Gerald Durrell. This book not only led me to a wonderful husband and a career in conservation, but it also defined my love for the natural world. I was studying animal sounds in Madagascar when I first read it. After two years of challenges, opening this book made my world brighter. It beautifully connects animals, people, joy, and beauty—a small version of a world worth saving. Many believe humans are the worst because of the harm we have caused to other species. However, I remember Gerald as a boy in this book, viewing all living beings as a family, connected and inseparable. This is a concept we all need to understand.

**D. Bruce Pearson**  
I found *The Shell Bird Book* by James Fisher in my school library shortly after it was published in 1966. I was immediately attracted to it, especially the 48 colorful bird illustrations by Eric Ennion. These images caught my eye. I already had other bird books and had spent holidays learning to identify birds. They inspired me to start sketching what I saw. But *The Shell Bird Book* offered so much more. Along with the beautiful illustrations, it included chapters on bird migration, the history of birds in Britain, and even a chapter on birds in music, literature, and art. The wide range of information and exciting images encouraged me to appreciate birds and nature more broadly. The book showed me that my emotional and creative responses to nature are just as valid as scientific ones. Since art was my stronger subject, I began to see new possibilities for myself."
CAE_37,"**Text: 'DO REVIEWS SELL BOOKS?'**

We asked five leading British publishers about how book reviews affect a book's success. Here is what they said.

**Publisher A**  
Reviews are very important for publishers; they are the first thing we look at in newspapers. A study by the Book Marketing Council showed that many people said they bought a book because of reviews, more than any other reason like ads or recommendations from friends. Authors feel differently about reviews. Both authors and publishers are upset when there are no reviews, but publishers are usually more accepting of bad reviews. They believe that any mention in the press can help sales, as readers want to form their own opinions. Publishers enjoy reviews that match their own views of a book since they are often the first to read it.

**Publisher B**  
Publishers and newspapers both care about book reviews, but they have different needs. Newspapers want to entertain their readers, while publishers want their books to be reviewed, ideally in a positive way. Book reviews today are more varied and accessible than they were 40 years ago. However, there is still a tendency to overlook paperbacks, which many people read. Weekly summaries of books are often not enough, and original paperbacks rarely get serious attention. Still, publishers need reviews because they are a cost-effective way to promote a book and its author. A good review from a trusted source can significantly boost sales, especially if there are multiple reviews.

**Publisher C**  
Reviews are essential for literary publishing; without them, we would struggle. Our books are usually not by well-known authors, and we rarely advertise, so we rely on literary editors to give our books space. Positive reviews are much more valuable than ads because readers trust them. Publishers often say they care more about the size of the review than its content. The impact of reviews on sales is complex. Good reviews can launch a book and a career, but they need to be supported by other factors like recommendations from readers, a strong response from booksellers, and smart marketing.

**Publisher D**  
The connection between publishing and reviewing in Britain is unclear. In the U.S., a single review in the New York Times can make or break a book. In Britain, booksellers often ignore reviews. Sometimes, it takes many years of great reviews for a good writer to gain readers. Interestingly, some poorly received books or those without reviews can still sell very well. The situation is unpredictable, although non-fiction reviews often focus more on the subject than the book itself.

**Publisher E**  
All publishers and writers hope for long, positive reviews. But do they actually sell books? I once published a biography that received excellent reviews, but it failed to sell because people felt they could just read the reviews instead of buying the book. Does the reviewer's name matter? Thirty years ago, if certain reviewers praised a book, people paid attention. Today, it can also be the unexpected reviewer or the creativity of the review that encourages buyers to visit the bookstore."
CAE_2,"**WEATHERVANE MAKER**

The craft of making weathervanes is very old, dating back to ancient Egypt. Today, this skill is still practiced in the workshop of Graham Smith. He is one of the few people in the country who makes weathervanes by hand. Graham creates unique designs based on what his customers want. ""This way, I can make a special item just for them,"" he says. Many of his customers are women looking for gifts for their husbands. They want something unique that reflects the man's interests.

Graham's work is different from the traditional cockerel design, which is the most common type of weathervane. The first weathervane he made was not a cockerel, but a witch on a broomstick. His friends liked the surprise gift he made for his wife and asked him to create weathervanes for them. ""I realized that there are endless possibilities for designs,"" he explains. Graham decided to focus on making weathervanes as a business. He had trained as a precision engineer and worked in that field for 15 years before he and his wife, Liz, switched roles—she went to work as an architectural assistant while he stayed home to care for their children and grow the business. This change happened five years ago, and he has no regrets. ""My previous job was not creative, but this work is exciting and artistic,"" he says. ""I really enjoy designing.""

Graham has now created over 100 original designs. He pays close attention to detail and always gets the customer's approval on the design before he starts cutting it by hand. He also keeps many traditional designs available, as they are just as popular as the unique ones. ""People seem to love handmade items,"" Graham says. ""They appreciate having something a little different.""

Graham does not plan to expand his business because he wants to keep it as a rural craft. ""I have found my place in the market. People enjoy the uniqueness, and I feel satisfied when I see a simple shape turn into something almost lifelike,"" he explains. ""For centuries, weathervanes have helped communities understand the weather by showing changes in wind direction."" He adds that with more people moving to the countryside, they want to add a special touch to their homes, which has helped crafts like his.

Graham has become busier, sending flat-packed weathervanes to customers around the world, especially in America and Denmark. ""The price depends on how detailed the design is,"" he explains. His latest request was for a curly-coated dog. No matter the occasion, Graham can create a unique gift."
CAE_68,"**Text: Beginner Takes All**

Before it was published, *The Horse Whisperer* was the most talked-about book of the year. This first novel by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans made him a lot of money. Here, he shares his inspiration and success.

The beginning of the year was tough for Nicholas Evans, who was a screenwriter, producer, and hoping to be a director. Things started badly when a film project he had worked on for months fell apart suddenly. He felt disappointed and worried because he hadn’t earned money in two years, and the film was his only hope to calm his angry bank manager.

A sensible person in Evans' situation would have found a job. He could have returned to being a television executive or started a television project he had paused. Instead, he made a choice that many, including himself, would think was crazy. He bought a ticket to America and spent three months researching for his first novel.

Although he acted on impulse, the idea for the story had been in his mind for a while. It was inspired by a farrier he met in Dartmoor while visiting a friend. The farrier told him about a gentle horse that suddenly became aggressive for no reason. Its owners were desperate until they heard about a gypsy who could calm the horse just by talking to it. These people were called ""horse whisperers."" This story captured Evans' imagination.

He started researching the topic to write a screenplay, as he was a filmmaker. However, after the failure of his film project, he decided to write the story as a book. Throughout the spring, he traveled across the US, visiting ranches and learning about horses and the people who work with them. ""It was a strange time,"" he recalls. ""I was watching people, but I felt alone and thought my life was falling apart. I had tried for ten years to succeed as a filmmaker, and now I was in debt, worried about how to support my children, and wondering if it was all a mistake.""

By the end of August, after returning home and writing the first half of the book, he felt the pressure from his bank manager. He needed to know if it was worth continuing. He bravely showed the manuscript to a friend who was a literary agent. The agent read it and said it was ""fine."" When asked, he suggested that Evans might receive $30,000 as an advance for the book. Evans thought about how much he needed to pay off some of his debts, and it was more than that. He had spent seven months on *The Horse Whisperer*, with at least two more months of work ahead. $30,000 was a challenging amount. He was also advised to write a 12-page summary of the rest of the book.

In October, along with the first two hundred pages of the novel, he sent this summary to seven UK publishers just before they left for the famous Frankfurt Book Fair. Within days, his agent called to say he had turned down the first offer of $75,000. ""What?"" Evans replied. The agent said, ""It's okay; I feel something good is happening.""

What happened next is now part of publishing history. Within a week of competitive bidding, the novel was sold to Transworld Publications in the UK for £550,000 and to Delacorte in the US for $3.15 million, both record amounts for a first novel. ""We couldn't believe it; we were shocked. We had never sent the manuscript to New York, and we still don’t know how it got there,"" Evans said. They also didn’t send it to Hollywood, but soon major studios were competing for it. ""My UK agent wisely involved an agent in the US, and when he called to say, 'I think we can get $3 million outright,' we laughed in disbelief."" 

As they all agreed to this amount, they decided that each studio should present their case to Evans. One night in October, he sat in his study while four famous filmmakers called one after another, asking to pay $3 million for an unfinished novel. Evans shared this story with me while we enjoyed coffee on the wooden porch overlooking his garden. He mentioned that he had turned down an offer to write the screenplay for *The Horse Whisperer*. ""It's been like a fairy tale so far. I don’t want to ruin it. Writing at that level is very challenging, and I don’t want to become an employee of these people I like who have paid me so much. I would hate to write a draft and then have them say, 'Thanks, Nick, but we’ll bring in someone else.'""

He said he would stay involved but from a distance. The success of his novel led to new support for *Life and Limb*, but he was unsure if he wanted to make it. ""I think it would be foolish not to write another novel,"" he said."

Bobby Fischer is facing challenges as he tries to return to the world of chess. Chess has become a game for younger players. After being away for 20 years, Fischer is back and playing against his old rival, Boris Spassky. Fischer won the first game, showing great skill, but he is not the same player he was in 1972. Now, at 49 years old, he is out of practice and not in great shape. Spassky is even older. 

The game of chess has changed a lot in the last 20 years. Fischer helped make chess popular, leading to a new era of professionalism. Now, winning is the main goal for modern players. In international chess, a player’s nerves and stamina are just as important as their intelligence. The pressure in chess has always been high. Players use a chess clock to make sure they finish their moves in time; if they don’t, they lose immediately. Nowadays, games can last longer, and many are played without breaks, increasing the pressure on players. 

In the last 30 years, each new world champion has been younger than the last. Currently, eight of the ten highest-ranked players are under 30. The way chess is played has also changed. Much preparation happens off the board, not just in the psychological battle. Players must prepare seriously before matches, especially with the rise of computer databases that can store millions of chess games. In recent matches, players have used teams of assistants to find weaknesses in their opponents’ strategies. The opening moves of a game are analyzed in great detail, and being well-prepared can be crucial.

Today, there are more top players than ever before, with many grandmasters competing for modest prizes worldwide. Success in chess requires both physical and mental effort. A single game can last up to eight hours, and players must stay focused. A moment of distraction can lead to losing the game. The chess clock adds to the stress, especially during the final moments when players have only seconds to make their moves. In these intense situations, players must act quickly and decisively, showing skills that any athlete would admire. 

At the highest level, losing is very painful, while winning brings great joy and a chance to recover from the stress. However, one win is not enough to win a tournament. Chess tournaments usually last 9-11 days, with games played every day, and there are competitions throughout the year. World championship matches are even tougher. For example, the 1984 match between Anatoli Karpov and Gary Kasparov in Moscow had to be stopped after several months due to exhaustion, with Karpov losing about 10 kg.

Can Bobby Fischer overcome these challenges? He once said, ""All I want to do is play chess."" This makes his long absence from the game seem strange. However, it also made him a legendary figure. If he has returned for money, he is in a good position, as both he and Spassky will earn millions from their match. But if Fischer believes he can prove he is still the best player, the outcome could be very disappointing for him."

Imogen Edwards-Jones interviews some new British talents, from poets to pop stars, who are on their way to success.

A. Nick Grosso, in his early 30s, has written three well-received plays. He is now turning his first play, *Peaches*, into a movie script. ""It's low budget, but we don't know how low,"" he says. ""It won't be over £30 million, but it could be as little as £30."" Remarkably, Nick had never seen or read a play before writing *Peaches*. ""When I wrote the play, I never thought it would be performed,"" he shares. ""It's set in a car. I probably wouldn't do that now because I understand the challenges."" He left school at 16 but returned a year later. After completing his A-levels, he joined the Young People's Theatre. ""I realized I wanted to write for actors. I wanted my writing to be heard, not just read, because of its rhythm and rhyme,"" he explains. ""Suddenly, I was with people who thought like me. It was the first time I enjoyed being in an educational setting. It was very inspiring.""

B. Comedian Simon Pegg, 28, has made great progress in his career since studying drama at Bristol University. He is currently writing a TV comedy series and has just finished a demanding tour with comedy star Steve Coogan. He has always worked hard. Even back in Bristol, he was practicing his comedy in clubs. ""University was very theoretical,"" Simon recalls. ""It made me realize I didn't want to be a serious actor; I was always more interested in comedy. People think comedy is the hardest job, but it really isn't. If you have courage and good material, it's wonderful to make people laugh."" He has performed with the comedy group Funny Business, but his partnership with Steve Coogan has been the most successful. ""He saw my show, and since I was a big fan of his, he probably noticed I was imitating him,"" Simon admits.

C. Ciaran McMenamin, 24, became known when he starred in the series *The Young Person's Guide To Becoming A Rock Star*. The response was very positive, and his career has quickly taken off. ""It's been a great opportunity for me,"" he smiles. ""Now I can choose what I want to do, which is what I've always wanted."" This is a rare and comfortable position, especially since he has just graduated. Looking back at his early career, it's clear that such recognition was likely. Encouraged by his mother, he moved from leading roles in school to the Ulster Youth Theatre, where he spent four years. ""I was basically using acting to avoid homework,"" Ciaran laughs. ""But then I decided I wanted to pursue it because I had a talent and passion for it."" Now, he is waiting for the praise to come in, but when asked about fame, he becomes thoughtful. ""When you're 18, you think you'll love the photos and interviews, but you soon realize that's not why you act. It's about earning respect for good work.""

D. Neil Taylor, 25, is the lead singer of the pop band Matrix, which has just signed a three-album deal with Domino Records. Neil and his bandmate Rick Brown are expected to be successful when their single, *Chimera*, is released soon. ""The record company's idea of good sales is different from mine,"" he says. ""They want a big hit, but I just want to be happy if two people buy it."" Unlike many new pop stars, Neil has worked hard for his success. He left school at 16 and has been trying to enter the music industry ever since. ""It's funny how things happen,"" he says. ""I had been performing at student gigs for eight years and was starting to feel tired. I was about to give up when I met Rick Brown, who had connections at Domino, and we formed Matrix. It couldn't have come at a better time. There were moments when I felt very down, and I was in some terrible bands. But hopefully, it will all be worth it.""

E. Poet and author Stephen Richards is 27 years old and has won more awards and honors than many people twice his age. He is already well-known in the poetry world, where he has been touring and giving readings several times a week for the past six years. His first novel, *Hidden*, will be published in March. ""It's a story about obsessive love. It was a strong idea that I couldn't express as a poem."" Stephen loved creative writing in school but became disillusioned with education later. ""I chose not to go to university, but I became bored stuffing envelopes at a theater and decided I should go."" After university, he published his first work, a children's book, in 1992. ""I don't think my parents expected me to be a writer; they thought I would just be a reader because that's all I did as a child."" With his poetry receiving much praise, his move to novels is indeed bold. ""Poetry has a structure, and there's less chance of making a big mistake,"" he explains. ""A novel can be any length, so there are more words that could be bad. My main goal is to avoid falling into a routine where I just produce work without caring about quality."""

A. Isabel, our main character in this fun novel, thinks she looks good in jeans but rarely wears them because she doesn’t want to be seen with the wrong people. She is a 31-year-old art student who loves historical romance stories and is looking for Mr. Right. She worries that her knobbly knees might ruin her chances. However, she remains hopeful, which helps her and others in the story. The author writes with great energy, using a style similar to early silent films, with chapter titles like ""Our Hero Feels Inspired.""

B. This story celebrates the rise and near-fall of a local radio station in America. It is told from the perspective of a smart, shy child named Francis With. Francis works for WLT (With Lettuce and Tomato) Radio, a station created by Roy and Ray Soderbjerg to promote their sandwich shop. The station soon broadcasts a mix of singers, preachers, soap-opera stars, and announcers. The small-town setting allows the author to use dry humor and simple writing, taking readers back to the kinder days of the 1940s and 1950s, filled with dime stores, old cars, and radios.

C. In the author's world, it is normal for a second husband to talk with his wife’s first husband. When professor Richard Vaisey falls for a beautiful Russian poet, he shares his feelings with his wife’s ex-husband. The poet writes bad poetry, which bothers Richard, and she is also trying to get his help for her wrongly imprisoned brother. However, the way the author resolves these issues is even more interesting. He moves the story forward with a strong sense of humor and carefully examines relationships, making it a very enjoyable and clever read.

D. In 1960s London, two sets of best friends—two women and two men—become connected for 25 years through life and death. At the beginning of this long novel, one of the friends, James Hudson, an American businessman, is starting a newspaper that his friend Richard Blake is editing. The newspaper launch is important, but so is the fact that the woman they both loved (and one of them married) was killed years ago. The story includes murder, ambition, love, and jealousy, all written well. This book allows you to really get to know the characters and become deeply involved in their lives.

E. This touching and funny story, written by a top American author, follows Ian Bedloe, who feels guilty about a past mistake. To make up for it, he becomes a 'father' to his brother's three orphaned children. At 40, he is slowly becoming an eccentric bachelor while dealing with everyday life. The story explores many emotions and highlights the special bond Ian forms with the youngest child, Daphne. It is a warm book that perfectly balances sadness and humor."
CAE_53,"**Volunteer Tourism**

Four academic writers discuss international voluntary work. 

A. It is difficult to say that volunteer tourists make a significant contribution to development. While they can help build homes or schools, they often pay a large fee to participate in this work. This money, if given directly to a local community, could pay for more labor than the volunteer could provide. This is especially true for gap year volunteers, who usually have little technical skill or professional experience. Therefore, many studies question whether gap year volunteering is mainly driven by a desire to help others or if young people are more interested in gaining experience that will help their careers. However, these projects may help develop individuals who will act ethically in favor of those who are less fortunate in their future careers.

B. Volunteering can lead to better international understanding, improved conflict resolution skills, and increased participation in global issues through civic organizations. It can also help build international social networks among ordinary people. In this way, the overall benefits can be greater than the individual contributions, helping both volunteers and host communities, and contributing to the global good. However, if volunteering is mostly done by wealthy individuals, it may provide them with a broader perspective and career advantages, but it will not significantly help those who lack access to international volunteer opportunities. Volunteers may continue to benefit personally while using host organizations and communities to advance their own goals.

C. At its worst, international volunteering can be seen as a form of imperialism or self-serving charity by wealthy Westerners. At its best, it can provide benefits to both volunteers and the organizations they work with, allowing for the exchange of skills, knowledge, and cultural experiences in developing communities. Most importantly, volunteering can raise awareness and commitment to addressing issues of power inequality, poverty, injustice, and unsustainable development.

D. Volunteer tourism aligns with the growing trend of individuals wanting to help others. These limited efforts, focused on making a small difference, can seem positive in a time when political action is less popular. The personal aspect appears appealing as it avoids large government and business involvement. However, it also overlooks the need for democratic governance and reduces development to individual acts of charity, often failing to address the deeper issues faced by poor rural communities. While skepticism about volunteering is often misplaced, the act of volunteer tourism can sometimes be just simple charity. However, when it is promoted as sustainable development and when gap-year companies market their programs as such, it can dilute the true meaning of development. The politics of volunteer tourism can distract from understanding global inequalities and the poverty experienced by many in developing countries."
CAE_55,"**Text: Sound the Alarm**

Stuart Harris reports that many people listen to the radio in the morning and need something to help them get out of bed. This is why clock radios are popular. But how do you choose a good one? A panel, including myself, inventor Tom Granger, and broadcaster Paul Bridges, tested five models currently available.

The 'dual alarm function' advertised with one model does not let you wake up with the buzzer, snooze, and then get up later, as I first thought. The instruction booklet suggests using this function to set two different wake-up times: one for weekdays and one for weekends. However, who really plans their life this way? This model costs about the same as another we tested, but it includes a cassette player, which is a nice feature. You can fall asleep to your favorite tapes and wake up without news. We all agreed that the radio quality was excellent, but the size was an issue—it was as big as a rugby ball. Paul Bridges mentioned that any clock radio he buys must leave enough space on the bedside table for his keys, wallet, glasses, and phone. He also said he always books a wake-up call just in case the alarm fails.

This model was voted the best in terms of appearance and overall performance. Paul Bridges said he was 'in love with it,' even though the clock he tested kept getting stuck at 16:00. I found the digital display interesting, with its stylish grey numbers on a soft green background. The wide snooze button allows you to tap it without opening your eyes. Unfortunately, the smooth buttons made me want to touch them like piano keys, which led to confusion when I finally looked at the instruction booklet. The clock has a backup power feature, so you don’t have to reset it if someone unplugs it to use a hairdryer or vacuum cleaner; everyone liked this feature. However, we all found it difficult to set up, though mastering it made us feel 'cool' and sophisticated.

Tom Granger described another model, which has a built-in lamp, as 'unbelievably tacky.' He had to pull the light out of its socket to make it work, raising concerns about its quality. He read the instruction booklet twice because the clock kept jumping from 12:00 to 02:00. The lamp was hard to position; it only lit up the clock, which was already illuminated. Paul Bridges found the lamp idea amusing but agreed that the radio was difficult to tune. The buzzer sounded like an alarm on a submarine and made me want to throw it across the room. Interestingly, this model is the third most popular on the market. Aimed at young people, with its bright colors and matching strap, it appealed to the child in Tom Granger and me. Tom said, 'I would choose this one because it stands out more than the others.' The traditional controls made it the only model we could set up without reading the instructions. Unfortunately, the alarm has a funny 20-minute error margin; the manual states, 'the alarm may sound about 10 minutes earlier or later than the set time.' Paul Bridges laughed at this idea, saying the model was 'terribly fiddly' and 'completely useless.'

The simplest and cheapest model scored points with Tom Granger because it 'seemed very standard and took up little space,' and it has old-fashioned dial tuning. He said, 'It's easier to set up. With modern push-button tuning, you’re never sure if you pressed all the buttons correctly, so you can’t be confident it will work.' He acknowledged that manufacturers had to improve radio quality because of button-tuning. I thought the tuning was a bit rough, as did Paul Bridges, but we agreed that the radio quality was good. The buzzer on this model worked well; it got me out of bed in just two beeps!"
CAE_50,"**Hedgehogs**

A hedgehog is a small mammal known for the sharp spines that cover its body. Hedgehogs are found in many parts of the world, but none are native to America or Australia. All hedgehog species can roll into a tight ball when threatened, with their spines pointing outward. The effectiveness of this defense depends on how many spines the hedgehog has. Some desert hedgehogs have adapted to carry less weight, so they have fewer spines and are more likely to run away from danger, using their ability to roll up as a last option. Hedgehogs are mainly active at night and sleep during most of the day, often hiding under bushes or in holes in the ground. Although all hedgehogs can hibernate, not all do; in good conditions, some will stay awake all year."
CAE_25,"**Text: Great Sportswomen on a Winning Streak**

Excelling in any sport is challenging, even for men, but women often face even greater difficulties. Training and competing leave little time for a normal life, requiring many sacrifices. Despite these challenges, women are overcoming prejudice and setting new records. Here, we highlight some remarkable British sportswomen who are achieving their goals.

A. **Jill, 27, Skier**  
""It's an amazing feeling to soar through the air and land safely, but it can be frightening. Sometimes I feel unwell or the weather is bad, making it hard to see, but I push through. Having a career outside of skiing is tough because we train for ten months each year. I have to give up much of my social life and time with friends, but it was my choice. There are six men and three women on the British team. We all compete on the same courses and are treated equally—it's a young sport.""

B. **Caroline, 22, Cyclist**  
""Two years ago, I borrowed a bike to join a charity race and surprisingly won because I cycled faster than everyone else, even though I had never cycled before! I earn a good salary as a professional cyclist, and there are many opportunities for sponsorship. However, I worry that people might think I succeeded because of my looks rather than my skills. So, I focus on cycling instead of making money. I train for at least four hours every day on the bike, plus I do stretching, swimming, and running. My boyfriend is also a cyclist, so he understands the commitment needed.""

C. **Annabel, 26, Rower**  
""Rowing is difficult for girls to start because very few schools offer it. Most girls begin at 19 or 20, which makes it harder to compete internationally. Additionally, coaches often change frequently, leading to a lack of stability in the women's team. Despite these challenges, I enjoy it and love staying fit, plus there is a good social aspect.""

D. **Ffyona, 24, Long-Distance Walker**  
""When I was 13, I dreamed of walking around the world, not realizing how vast it is! I found Britain too small and safe. I was very determined and disliked anyone controlling me. Now, I am more diplomatic. Each walk has been unique. My walk across Australia was the most painful experience I've had, covering 50 miles a day with little sleep and many blisters. But I set a record! I had to, as my sponsorship money would run out after 95 days. Some men believe women are more likely to fail, making them hesitant to sponsor us.""

E. **Lisa, 26, Saloon Car Racer**  
""Some men have big egos when driving, which you can see on the roads. When I perform well, they often ignore me. Being a woman has its challenges. When I approach a corner, men think, 'I must beat her,' so I've faced many tough moments! You need to be competitive and assertive. It's hard to earn money, and what I do make goes back into racing. Women have been racing since the 1920s and have often been seen as unusual. It's encouraging that more women are joining the sport each year. For me, the thrill of saloon car racing comes from striving for perfection and aiming for the perfect lap.""

F. **Alison, 28, Triathlete**  
""I wake up at 5:30 three mornings a week to swim. I need Tuesday and Thursday mornings to catch up on sleep. In the evenings, I either cycle or run. Yes, I sometimes fall asleep at my desk! There is a lot of pressure before races, and during competitions, I really push myself—if I don’t, I feel bad. I’ve often wondered why I do this. The answers are: a) I feel happier when I stay fit, b) I would be lazy if I didn’t force myself to do this, and c) racing is very social. Men and women usually compete together, but when events are covered in the media, 90% of the focus is on the men's events, with only 10% mentioning the women's results. The prize money is also lower for women. However, we have now established an International Triathlon Women's Commission to address these issues."""
CAE_34,"**Simplified Text:**

The day I met Picasso, Richard Cork remembers how, as a 78-year-old student, he encountered one of the most famous artists of the century. Even from a distance, eating lunch at an outdoor restaurant in Cannes, Picasso was easy to recognize. I was an 18-year-old student traveling around Europe and Morocco in an old, unreliable van. After running out of money, I found a job painting boats by the waterfront. However, I spent a lot of time drawing and was lucky to have a large sketchbook with me when I met the elderly artist.

Picasso was known to be a private person who usually worked alone in the hills. So, I was very surprised to see him sitting at a table with his wife, Jacqueline, and three friends. Without my friend's encouragement, I would never have approached him to ask for his signature. I was nervous as I introduced myself and offered my sketchbook, but to my surprise, he agreed. He wrote his name at the top of the page and then added a lively drawing below. Picasso's art, even when abstract, often related to real things. So, the lines he drew might represent a cloud, the sea, or the shape of Cannes harbour.

I thanked him and started a hesitant conversation. Since Picasso's English was worse than my French, an American woman at the table helped translate. She kept calling him the Maestro, which made it hard for me to speak. But I managed to tell Picasso about my strong interest in art and my admiration for his work. After a while, I went back to my boat and proudly showed my friend what I had. But he noticed that Picasso's lunch was still going on. ""Is that all?"" he asked, looking at the signature. ""Why don’t you go back and take advantage of this chance? He probably wouldn’t mind if you drew his portrait.""

With my sketchbook in hand, I returned to Picasso's table. I thought it was best not to ask if I could draw him, as he might say no and ruin the moment. So, I just stood by the table, set my pad against a screen, took out a crayon, and began to draw. When he noticed, Picasso smiled playfully and made it hard for me to draw. He acted out funny expressions, rolling his eyes and sticking out his tongue. His playful behavior felt like a challenge, and I didn’t want to give up. Despite his antics, I felt he was testing my determination.

Eventually, Picasso relaxed and allowed me to study him without distractions. I saw how strong and alert he looked, wearing a blue-and-white striped shirt. He seemed more like a fit 60-year-old than a man about to turn 84. His dark eyes were youthful and intense, and I tried to capture that in my drawing. Even though he was surrounded by friends, he seemed distant and alone, quietly focused on his own thoughts.

When the American lady told me that Picasso wanted to see my portrait, I felt embarrassed and said it wasn’t good enough. However, Picasso insisted, and when I showed him my sketchbook, he nodded approvingly. Then, to my surprise, he said it was his turn. I quickly gave him my crayon, and he made a few quick strokes on the paper. In seconds, he drew a bearded face that was very different from my careful drawing. He had moved one of my eyes onto my nose and captured my smile with a single lively line. I looked like a character from one of his playful artworks.

I thanked Picasso and asked if he would sign my drawing. After talking with the American, she explained that he said I already had his signature. So, there were limits to his generosity! Still, I look back now and feel very lucky. Meeting Picasso and receiving his attention meant a lot to me."
CAE_12,"**Text: Shopping Strategies**

Have you ever gone into a store and ended up buying more than you planned? Here, we explain the techniques that shops use to encourage you to spend more money.

A. **Freshness Appeal**  
Supermarkets understand that customers value fresh food. They often place fruits and vegetables at the entrance or display house plants to create a fresh atmosphere. In-store bakeries fill the air with the smell of fresh bread, making the store more inviting. The colors used in the store, like green, are chosen because they remind shoppers of fresh produce. However, most items sold, like frozen foods and cleaning products, do not match this fresh image.

B. **Product Placement**  
The arrangement of products in a store is crucial for sales. Supermarkets use technology to find out which areas attract the most shoppers. They place high-profit items in these spots, while also using eye-level shelves to catch attention. Special offer bins attract bargain hunters, and complementary items are placed near each other to encourage additional purchases.

C. **Strategic Layout**  
Supermarkets often place low-cost essentials like bread and sugar far from the entrance. This forces shoppers to walk past more expensive items, increasing the chance of impulse buys. Stores also position popular products away from the entrance, betting that loyal customers will search for them, thus encountering other tempting items along the way.

D. **Minimalist Display**  
Chain stores have changed how they display products. For example, the Next chain has moved away from cluttered displays to a more stylish presentation, making their clothing seem exclusive. Their success comes from both good design and appealing clothing.

E. **Total Cost Awareness**  
Shoppers tend to focus more on the total cost of their shopping rather than the price of individual items. Supermarkets mix low-cost staples with higher-priced items, so not everything is cheap. They may sell some items at a loss to attract customers, known as ""loss leaders."" They also get discounts from manufacturers by buying in bulk or promoting certain products.

F. **Pricing Strategies**  
In chain stores, customers often buy fewer items and pay more attention to prices. For example, pricing a blouse at £14.99 instead of £15 can influence buying decisions. This pricing strategy also helps reduce theft, as employees must ring up sales to give change.

G. **Lighting Effects**  
Both supermarkets and chain stores carefully consider lighting. Chain stores aim for natural light to show the true colors of clothing, while supermarkets use special lighting to highlight fresh foods.

H. **Store Navigation**  
Many chain stores use different carpet patterns to guide shoppers through the store. These paths, called the ""Yellow Brick Road,"" help direct customers to sales areas. Some stores, like Marks and Spencer, use attractive flooring to encourage shoppers to explore.

I. **In-Store Advertising**  
As you enter a supermarket, large colorful images of delicious food catch your eye, especially if you are hungry. In the U.S., some supermarkets are testing ""video trolleys"" that display ads while you shop. These trolleys aim to attract impulse buyers and claim to increase sales significantly."
CAE_26,"**Text: Sea, Ice & Rock**

Mountaineer Chris Bonnington (58) is famous for reaching the summit of Everest in 1985. He has also created new climbing routes in Britain and the Alps and has written many books, such as *Quest for Adventure* and *Everest the Hard Way*. Robin Knox-Johnston (53) started his career at sea in the Merchant Navy. In 1968-9, he became the first person to sail around the world alone in his yacht, Sunhaili. He set a record for crossing the Atlantic, taking just 10 days to sail from New York to the Lizard in England. 

Chris and Robin worked together to sail and climb in Greenland, documenting their journey in their new book: *Sea, Ice and Rock*. In 1979, while I was working on *Quest for Adventure*, I called Robin for an interview. He invited me to join him for a sail. I could teach him some climbing techniques, and he could teach me the basics of sailing. It was my first time on a yacht. We sailed for a while and then anchored. Robin's wife and daughter stayed on the boat while we paddled to shore to practice climbing. The route was challenging, but I was impressed by how steady Robin was in difficult conditions. 

After a while, we reached a steep drop. I asked Robin if he had ever climbed before. He hadn’t, so I showed him how. When I finished, Robin politely asked if he could descend using the ropes from his boat. He was used to using his arms, but I wanted him to use his legs. I was a bit worried, but he managed to lower himself down safely. During that trip to Skye, Robin and I formed a strong friendship. His suggestion that we combine our skills for a trip to Greenland was a natural progression from our Skye adventure. 

I was very impressed by Robin as a leader. Normally, the captain makes all the decisions, but Robin always consulted the crew first. Most of the time, no one dared to give him advice, but it felt good to be part of the decision-making. To be honest, I found sailing challenging and quite boring. The moments of crisis were easy to handle because of the adrenaline, but spending days in the middle of the sea was hard for me. I prefer being on land and am not very handy. In contrast, Robin is a natural sailor and enjoyed fixing the engine or repairing the toilet. I realized that Robin didn’t really need my help, which sometimes made me feel useless. 

The crew was also cramped: six people on a 32-foot yacht meant for four. At least on a mountain expedition, you can get some space from each other. When we arrived in Greenland and it was my turn to lead the expedition, I found it hard to take responsibility for Robin’s safety. There were many times when, if Robin had fallen, he could have pulled me down with him. I had to be careful about that. I underestimated how difficult the Cathedral, Greenland's highest mountain, would be. Robin is not a natural climber, which made his efforts even more impressive. 

The first time we tried to reach the top, we were active for 24 hours. On the way down, we were so tired that we almost fell asleep on steep slopes, 1,500 feet above the ground. Robin faced many challenges, but he completely trusted me and just followed my lead. When it became too difficult and I realized we had to turn back, he accepted it. I also knew that Robin was worried about the boat: whether we could get it through the ice and if it was still intact. Yet he was eager for us to try climbing the mountain again. 

The only time our relationship almost faced a crisis was on the yacht on the way home. We were taking turns to keep watch. I was supposed to wake up at 4 am for my shift, but Robin decided not to wake me, thinking he could handle it alone. The night before, I had almost fallen asleep. I felt he didn’t trust me, which made me feel insecure, and I expressed that. Robin quickly reassured me that I had misunderstood his intentions. While we enjoyed the trip to Skye, we truly got to know each other by the end of the Greenland expedition. I discovered that beneath his tough exterior, Robin was a kind-hearted and sensitive person."
CAE_8,"**A History of the Apple**

Apples have been part of human life for thousands of years, existing in many colors, shapes, and sizes. However, in the late twentieth century, we risk losing this rich heritage.

**Prehistoric Times (8,000 BC)**  
Humans have eaten apples since ancient times. In neolithic Britain, they would spit out apple seeds. Around 10,000 years ago, they left apple remains near lakes in Switzerland and Italy. In these areas, early humans even stored dried apple halves for winter. These apples were wild crab apples, small and shriveled, known in Ancient Britain as ""windings."" They were very different from the apples we eat today.

**Norman Influence (1000 AD)**  
The French learned advanced fruit-growing techniques from the Romans, which were further developed in monasteries. This knowledge included cider-making and was brought to Britain. One dessert apple, called Decio, was likely introduced by the Roman general, Etio. However, many Roman apple varieties did not thrive in Britain, and Norman varieties quickly became more popular. British monks continued to experiment and create new apple types, which are the ancestors of most Western apples today.

**Medieval Favorites (1200)**  
During the thirteenth century, several apple types became common in Britain. The Old English Pearmain, noted in 1204 for its pear-like shape, was the main dessert apple until the eighteenth century. The Costard was a popular cooking apple sold in Oxford markets from 1296 until the late seventeenth century, giving rise to the term ""costermonger,"" meaning a street seller of fruits and vegetables. However, the country faced challenges like droughts, the Black Death, and the Wars of the Roses, leading to fewer apples being produced and more being imported. This trend continued until the sixteenth century when King Henry VIII sent his chief fruit expert, Richard Harris, to France to learn about apple growing. Harris returned with many grafts, including the famous Pippins, and established the first modern orchard in Teynham, Kent.

**Settler Treasures (1750)**  
By the seventeenth century, apples were so popular in Britain that the first settlers to Canada, Australia, the US, South Africa, and New Zealand took apples and seeds with them, considering them precious. Captain Bligh of the Bounty brought the first apples to Australia, Jan van Riebeeck took them to South Africa, and the Pilgrim Fathers carried them to America. In North America, the well-known apple planter was John Chapman, known as ""Johnny Appleseed."" Born in 1774, he planted apple nurseries from Pennsylvania to Indiana. Native Americans saw him as a medicine man, and his love for apple trees, unique clothing, and religious beliefs led to many folktales about him, including stories of his kindness to animals.

**Modern Delicious (1850)**  
Around this time, a Quaker farmer named Jesse Hiatt in Iowa discovered a new apple tree growing from the roots of a dead tree. He named the apple ""Hawkey."" After showing it at a fruit exhibition, a judge tasted it and exclaimed, ""Delicious!"" In 1895, this apple was marketed as ""Delicious"" and became one of the most widely grown apples globally.

**Granny Smith (1850)**  
Another famous apple, the Granny Smith, was found in Australia by Maria Anne Smith, the daughter of convicts. She was independent and worked as a midwife in Eastwood, New South Wales. Known as ""Granny Smith,"" she took care of her family's farm and orchard. In 1868, she discovered a small tree growing from discarded fruit. She transplanted it and soon harvested the first major crop of green apples, which became famous worldwide. When asked about the tree's origin, she said, ""Well, it's just like God to make something useful out of what we think is rubbish,"" referring to both the apple and her own background.

**Uniformity Issues (1950)**  
Today, apples are grown worldwide, from northern India to Africa. However, most apples come from only a few varieties, chosen for their red skin or ability to travel well, rather than for their taste. This lack of variety is harming our enjoyment of apples and reducing genetic diversity. While amateur gardeners in the UK have preserved many old apple types, the US has lost most of its apple varieties from a century ago. Fortunately, consumers are beginning to seek more variety. We cannot rely solely on amateur gardeners to save apple diversity; we must advocate for a world that values and protects natural diversity for everyone's benefit."

CAE_30,"Text: 'Richard Nerurkar, a long-distance runner from Britain, visits a high-altitude training camp in Kenya. Located ten miles south of the equator, a sunny mountain path leads off a quiet road from Nairobi. This path begins the journey up Mount Kenya, the country’s highest peak. This beautiful but isolated place is called Nanyuki. For the past three years, it has been my base for winter training in Kenya's Central Highlands. However, I had never trained with Kenyan runners before. On my fourth winter training trip to Kenya, I decided to change that. I participated in my first race in Kenya and stayed at the national team training camp, where the best runners prepare for the World Cross-Country Team Championships. I was invited by the national team coach after finishing fifth in the World Championship 10,000 meters race, behind three Kenyans and a Moroccan. It was an opportunity I could not miss. Training at high altitude increases the number of red blood cells, which helps carry oxygen better. This has been proven by the success of many Kenyan runners. My first race in Africa was also significant; it was the first international cross-country race held on the continent, in Nairobi. It was a humbling experience, as 41 runners finished ahead of me, and all but three were Kenyan. I felt I had run well, but I believe Kenyan success is not only due to altitude. Kenyan runners have a simple and effective approach to running. Their running style looks effortless, their diet is straightforward, and they enjoy competing. However, the most important question is: how do they train? My time at the training camp gave me the answers. The camp is at St Mark's College, 6,200 feet up the southern slope of Mt Kenya, surrounded by beautiful fields and tropical plants. It is quite basic, with few comforts. The athletes live with regular students and share rooms in dormitories. Their daily routine includes three workouts: a relaxed morning run, interval training mid-morning, and a steady run in the late afternoon. The day starts at six. We would wake up and gather for a briefing from the coaches before the morning run. ""Run easy, you have a hard day ahead,"" the coach would say. Each day, we covered about 40 kilometers, which is just under a marathon distance. The only exception was Sunday, when we only ran 20 kilometers, a welcome break from the usual three workouts. Outside of running, life was simple. A splash of water on the face and brushing teeth was enough for morning preparations. Breakfast included tea, bread, and boiled eggs, eaten in a small, dimly lit dining area. Lunch and dinner were similar, with ugali (a maize dish), stew, cabbage or spinach, and tea. After running, we would drive to bathe in one of the streams from Mt Kenya's melting glaciers. By the end of my stay, I had a deeper appreciation for Kenyan success. It cannot be explained by genetics, upbringing, or altitude alone. I began to think that the simplicity of life in the mountains, the hard training, and the passion for success might be the true reasons behind Kenya's dominance in distance running.'"
CAE_7,"**Text: The Challenges of Mass Marketing**

Almost everyone knows that advertising is struggling. This issue is not just because of the recession; advertising began to decline in early 1989, before the recession really affected the economy. The problems with advertising are deeper and are happening all over the world. The sad truth is that advertising has not kept up with changes in the economy. Advertisers often think about large markets and mass media, but as brands and media have increased, target markets have become smaller and more specific. Even campaigns for well-known brands should focus on smaller audiences, but they usually do not.

Think about your own shopping habits. When you go to a supermarket, you might buy 30, 40, or even 50 items. Most of these items are not from advertised brands, and you may buy several of the same brand. In total, you probably only buy a few advertised brands from the thousands available in the store. Over a year, you are unlikely to buy more than a few hundred different brands. For durable goods, you might buy about a dozen brands a year. If you buy a new car, it is likely provided by your employer, and if not, you may only buy one every three years. You probably do not buy many clothes either, and most of them are not from advertised brands. Even when you consider all the other products and services, it is very likely that you do not buy more than 400 different brands in a year. 

In comparison, there are about 32,500 branded goods and services that are advertised. If we ignore the 23,000 brands that spend less than £50,000 a year on advertising, we can focus on the 9,500 brands that are individually listed and analyzed. The average consumer buys about 400 of these 9,500 brands, and not all of these purchases are due to advertising. This means that only about 4 percent of advertising is effective. 

When you watch TV tonight, count how many commercials are for brands you buy or might buy in the future. Most people find that only about one in 16 commercials (6 percent) are relevant to them, meaning that the other 15 (94 percent) are likely wasted. You might think you are different and not influenced by advertising, but most people feel the same way. The reality is that most people do not buy the brands they see advertised. 

There is always some waste in advertising because not every person who sees an ad will rush out to buy the product. People only remember a small number of ads and ignore the rest, so waste is unavoidable. However, this does not mean that advertising is not effective. Many advertisements have shown that it can work. Advertisers need to reach a large audience to connect with the smaller group that will respond, as they cannot know in advance who will be interested. 

Even with careful targeting, advertisers can reduce waste by reaching more people who will respond, but they can never know exactly who will. Even the best direct mail campaigns do not achieve a 100 percent response rate. This is a key difference between media advertising and personal selling. A salesperson might succeed with every potential client they meet, but this is not possible with media advertising. If advertisers knew exactly who would respond, they would not need to use mass media at all; they could contact those individuals directly.

Any advertiser who can gain one million new customers (about 2 percent of the adult population) is doing well. For popular soap brands, gaining a million extra customers would be a great success. Therefore, any advertising campaign that can attract more than 2 percent of the population would be considered very successful, and this is just a small part of the population. While mass media can be a cost-effective way to reach people, if advertising is to improve, its messages will need to be more focused than ever before."
CAE_43,"**Text: 'Solar Survivor: Charles Clover Visits Britain's Greenest Home'**

Charles Clover explores one of the most environmentally-friendly homes in Britain, located in Southwell, Nottinghamshire. This area has some interesting features. First, it is home to Southwell Minster, an ancient cathedral that is not well-known. Writers who care about the environment appreciate the pagan 'green' men figures carved by medieval craftsmen in the cathedral's thirteenth-century chapter house. The second surprise is the 'autonomous house,' built by Robert and Brenda Vale, which is considered the greenest home in Britain.

The Vales have created a home that uses rainwater for washing and drinking, recycles sewage into compost for the garden, and heats the house using waste heat from electrical appliances and their own body heat, along with that of their three teenage children and two cats, Edison and Faraday. The house looks traditional, with a clay tile roof, and is located 300 yards from the Minster. It was designed to match the burnt-orange brick of the town's nineteenth-century buildings and received approval from planners, even in a conservation area.

When you ring the solar-powered doorbell, you will notice complete silence. The house is very well-insulated, with triple-glazed windows filled with krypton gas, which keeps outside noise out. Inside, after removing your shoes as Robert requests, you will find a peaceful atmosphere. On a sunny summer day, the windows are closed, and the conservatory warms the air before it circulates through the house. Robert opens clever ventilation shafts and windows to create airflow, as the house is designed to be draught-proof, even having a small air-locked door for the cats.

The Vales, who teach architecture at Nottingham University, have cared about the environment for many years. They wrote a book on green architecture in the 1970s called *The Autonomous House*. They aimed to create a building that produced no carbon dioxide and eventually decided to eliminate the need for mains water as well. They designed composting toilets, installed rainwater tanks in the cellar, and used copper gutters to keep drinking water safe, filtering it before use. Water from washing goes into the garden, and they do not use a dishwasher because they believe using strong detergents is wrong.

Robert explains, ""We wanted to show that it is possible to design a house that is much less harmful to the environment without living in darkness."" The only medieval feature of the house is its design: the hall, which includes the fireplace and staircase, extends to the top of the building. The Vales do not pay water bills, and last winter, their house used only nine units of electricity a day, costing about 70p, which is much less than what other four-bedroom houses use for heating.

Soon, they will install £20,000 worth of solar water heating panels and equipment in the garden, which will allow the house to generate more electricity than it uses. They will still need to draw some electricity from the mains for cooking and appliances, but they expect to have enough surplus electricity to eventually charge an electric car. The only source of heat in the house is a small wood-burning stove in the hall, which they claim to use only during the coldest winter days.

When I visited in February, Robert was reading and said it was too warm to light the fire. The temperature on the first floor was 18°C, which is lower than what is usually expected, but he found it comfortable because there were no draughts and everything felt the same temperature. He noted that a woman from the early 1900s felt comfortable at 12.5°C because of her warm clothing. He suggests that people living in homes built before 1900 should adapt to that lifestyle again, though this idea may not be popular.

The secret to the house's success is its simplicity and low-tech design, which means there is little that can go wrong. Most materials were sourced from local builders and installed by local craftsmen, making the house affordable to build—costing the same per square meter as low-cost rental housing. Unsurprisingly, commercial building companies are resistant to this approach."
CAE_51,"Text: 'The Camera Never Lies

Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Sherlock Holmes, thought of himself as a rational man and even a scientist. However, in 1920, he saw photographs of fairies taken in a garden and believed they were real evidence of these tiny creatures. He published the photos with an article, accepting fairies as magical beings. It was not until 1939 that the two women who took the photos confessed they were fake. They had simply cut out pictures of fairies from a book and placed them among flowers. The photos are undeniably beautiful, but the simplicity of the trick challenges a basic idea about photography: that the camera cannot lie. In fact, it can, and always has been able to. Today, we often use computer software to change our digital images, and it is a myth that photography ever had a time when it was completely honest. From the very beginning, when cameras started capturing reality, that reality was being changed.'"
CAE_11,"**Text: Blacksmiths**

Throughout history, iron has captured human imagination, and blacksmiths have often been seen as more than just skilled workers. Before the Industrial Revolution, blacksmiths held a status similar to that of doctors and astrologers because they were the only ones who made weapons, armor, and farming tools. They were also celebrated as artists. In the 18th century, blacksmiths created beautiful ironwork for St Paul's Cathedral. The elegant metalwork in French and Belgian Art Nouveau buildings was also crafted by talented blacksmiths. However, by the late 1960s, the number of blacksmiths in Britain had greatly decreased, as heavy industry no longer needed their skills, and modern architects rarely used graceful wrought-iron features.

In the last ten years, there has been a revival of interest in decorative architecture and a more open approach to interior design. Still, much of the work produced seems clichéd, with manufacturers of gates and balconies promoting their products as ""classical"" or ""Victorian-style."" You can hardly enter a trendy design store without seeing rusty candlesticks with unnecessary decorations. Fortunately, there are alternatives, and a series of events in the coming weeks aims to promote the blacksmithing craft. The first event, an exhibition of forged ironwork by members of the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA), opened last week at the Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey. Alan Dawson, the secretary of BABA, states, ""We could be at the start of a new Iron Age, as both the public and blacksmiths are seeing things differently.""

Power tools have freed blacksmiths from the hard work of using a hot anvil, allowing them to bend, split, twist, and weld metal more easily. ""In short,"" says Dawson, ""these artists now have a material that lets them express themselves."" About 250 pieces have been created for the exhibition, including bookends and a spiral staircase. Prices start at £90 and can go up to several thousand pounds. Most of the money will go to the individual makers, but a portion of each sale will be kept by the Association to promote good ironwork, according to Dawson. His own contributions include an eight-foot gate and a lamp with a hand-blown glass shade. ""My style comes from letting steel bend and flow into shape when it's hot. It's like drawing with metal in space,"" he explains.

Many artists are fascinated by iron. Unlike most metals, which are soft when cold, iron and steel are tougher and more challenging to work with. Susan May, a trained jeweler, says, ""It's quite magical because it's very soft when hot, but as soon as it cools, it becomes hard and unmovable again."" Ann Catrin Evans creates mild steel door knockers and handles that seem inspired by the dark castles often seen in horror films. One of her designs looks like a ball and chain, while another resembles a Celtic cross. ""I love that steel is cold and hard,"" she says. ""It feels like it will last forever."" No other metal has given people as much visual pleasure or a greater sense of security. The chances of iron being used decoratively for the next thousand years are high, as long as we don't have to see any more rusty candlesticks!"
CAE_14,"**Text: 'THE DAY I GAVE UP SMOKING'**

I thought everyone would be happy when I stopped smoking, but one of my colleagues was very angry. ""What do you mean?"" she shouted. ""If it was that easy, why didn't you stop years ago?"" I found it hard to explain how I went from being a heavy smoker to not smoking at all in just a few hours. It was a bit annoying. I still find it strange. The stop-smoking session I attended was a mix of group therapy and hypnotherapy, and it happened two months and three weeks ago. I had not planned to stop smoking, and I didn't really want to. I felt pressured by anti-smoking groups, which I still resent. I also had low blood pressure and a healthy family. I didn't cough or feel sick, and I seemed to recover from colds faster than friends who lived healthier lives.

On that ordinary Thursday afternoon, I went to the Birmingham session of The Easy Way to Stop Smoking to write an article about others trying to quit. I said, ""I won't be trying to stop myself; that wouldn't be fair."" I thought it was reasonable because I enjoyed smoking. It gave me real pleasure. The counsellor seemed to understand me. We were encouraged to smoke as much as we wanted, and the room was so full of smoke that we had to open the windows. I noticed that when I was told to smoke, I didn't want to, and neither did the others. 

What happened was that the messages about stopping smoking made sense to me. Just as smoking had become a challenge because of opposition, the idea of quitting started to feel appealing. The thought of not being a smoker made me feel strong. It was a personal feeling. Could I also achieve other things? In many ways, it was easy. The physical cravings for nicotine, which felt like hunger, went away after a minute or two and lasted only four or five days. The one thing I thought would be hard to do without cigarettes was my work, but it turned out to be fine. I had believed I wouldn't be able to meet deadlines without nicotine and that I would fail to write a story. Surprisingly, the hardest part was doing simple things at home on weekend mornings, and it still is. 

I am starting to think that smoking helped me deal with boredom; having a cigarette was an activity. Yes, I do miss smoking, but not too much. Every new experience as a non-smoker is something I have to get used to—eating out, waiting for a flight, checking into a hotel, or during a theatre break. These are all moments when I would have smoked before."
CAE_63,"Text: 'Dorothy who? The only British woman scientist to win the Nobel Prize should be well-known in her own country, says Georgina Ferry, but she is not. For the past four years, I have been testing friends and acquaintances on their knowledge of Dorothy Hodgkin. It’s simple: when I tell them I am writing her biography, if they respond with excitement and say things like, ""Surely there's one already!"" they pass the test. Why should people in Britain know about Dorothy Hodgkin? The fact that she is the only British woman scientist to win a Nobel Prize should be enough. Anyone with the same achievement in literature would be famous. But Hodgkin, who died in 1994, was an extraordinary person, as complex as the crystals she studied. Her life reflects significant changes of the 20th century, including the progress of women's education and the globalization of science. 

When I started my research, I wanted to read some scientific biographies. One of Hodgkin's friends suggested a new biography of Linus Pauling. Pauling was a close friend of Hodgkin, worked in the same field, and campaigned against nuclear weapons. I rushed to the main bookstore in my university town, only to find that there were no biographies of Pauling available. I now realize I was naive to think Pauling would be interesting to British readers, even though he was a highly influential chemist of the 20th century and won Nobel Prizes in both chemistry and peace. Even scientists have questioned the value of scientific biographies. Peter Medawar, another Nobel laureate, once said that the lives of scientists are often dull to read. If scientists believe this, it is not surprising that publishers and booksellers do too. 

Treating scientists differently from others in biographies shows the 'two cultures' mentality, the idea that there is a big gap between the arts and sciences, which still exists in the literary world. Only a few great scientists make it into the biography sections of bookstores. It is not true that scientists lead less interesting lives than artists, writers, actors, or politicians. Some scientists are very careful about their public image. A leading geneticist once told me he was happy to discuss his work but did not want to be quoted or photographed because he did not want to seem 'self-promoting'. This avoidance of personal stories gives a false impression of science and may discourage young people from pursuing it.

Fortunately, things are changing. Contemporary scientists now often appear in public in ways other than just scientific interviews. For example, Professor Richard Dawkins presents awards on a TV quiz show, and geneticist Steve Jones advertises cars on television. These activities may raise eyebrows in laboratories, but they help make scientists more relatable than many academic papers do. The publishing world is also changing. Scientific biographies and autobiographies used to be very serious and dull. The personal lives of scientists—like marriage and children—were often briefly mentioned. This changed with Richard Feynman's book, Surely You're Joking, Mr Feynman?, which is a funny and touching memoir of a man who was also one of the greatest theoretical physicists of the century. Recently, even famous scientists like Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, Albert Einstein, and Marie Curie have been shown with their flaws. 

To readers, it does not matter that Einstein's family life is 'irrelevant' to his General Theory of Relativity. The way creative geniuses deal with emotional ups and downs and everyday life is interesting in itself. Dorothy Hodgkin was dedicated to her scientific work. Her major achievements included solving the structures of penicillin and vitamin B12, which earned her the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1964, and insulin, which her team solved in 1969. She pushed scientific techniques to new levels of complexity. However, she also had three children and a husband who was often away due to his job as a historian. Her personal life may not be directly related to her work as a scientist, but we can learn from how she balanced different parts of her life. 

There is much in her life that is universally interesting, but it would be unfair to suggest that this does not include her scientific work. Scientific inquiry was the passion of Hodgkin's life, as it must be for any successful scientist. Communicating this passion is the biggest challenge for a scientific biographer. Most readers do not have enough basic scientific knowledge to understand complex ideas without a lot of explanation. Understanding scientific concepts is not harder than reading Shakespeare or learning a foreign language—it just requires effort. It is unfortunate that educated people, who would feel embarrassed if they did not recognize a famous literary or artistic figure, remain unaware of the rich legacy represented by scientists like Dorothy Hodgkin.'"
CAE_56,"**Text: Margaret and Her Water-Finding Skills**

Margaret Wilkins is known for her special ability to find water. She can use a forked hazel stick to locate underground water sources. Many farmers whose wells have dried up are seeking her help. Along with her husband, Margaret runs a well-drilling business that uses modern tools like drilling rigs and air-compressed hammers. However, to find water, she relies only on her hazel stick. The couple has a success rate of over 90%.

This ability to find water, known as dowsing, is often described as a ""sixth sense."" There are various theories about how dowsing works, including ideas related to magnetism and spirituality. One popular theory suggests that everything on Earth vibrates, and water vibrates more than other materials. Some dowsers believe they can sense these vibrations, while others claim they can smell water, as smell is a very strong sense.

In recent years, due to drought, Margaret has been very busy, with a waiting list of almost six weeks at one point. Most of her clients are farmers with dry wells. She explains, ""We usually see customers only once because wells last a long time."" Other clients include owners of remote cottages or barns that have become holiday homes, where installing long water pipes is too costly. There are also golf course developers who need water for their clubhouses.

Margaret typically looks for water between 50 and 70 meters deep. She emphasizes the importance of avoiding areas where waste could contaminate the water supply. The water she finds is usually in cracks in solid rock, and if they bring it up correctly, it should be clean. However, in Cornwall, where they work, there are many minerals, so they must be careful about iron in the water.

Electricity is also needed to run the pump, and it is expensive to bring power over long distances, so it is best if the well is close to existing power sources. Once she considers these factors, Margaret begins her search for water. For large areas like golf courses, she starts with a map and a pendulum. She holds the pendulum still and moves it over the map; it swings when she is above a water source.

After identifying possible locations on the map, Margaret walks over the fields with her hazel stick, which is forked and equal in size on both sides. ""When I am above water, I feel a strange sensation; I sway a little. When that feeling goes away, I use the stick to find the exact spot to drill."" She holds the two forks of the stick with both hands and pulls them slightly apart to create tension. ""When water is directly below, the straight part of the stick rises. It is crucial to drill exactly where the stick indicates. If we drill even a little off, we might miss the water completely.""

Margaret's husband also dowse the same area. Usually, but not always, they agree on the exact drilling spot. If they disagree, they will not drill until they reach a consensus. Margaret is not alone in her practice; many anthropologists and writers have been intrigued by this mysterious skill. She describes it as an ""intuitive perception of the environment,"" which is the best way to explain how she finds water so accurately. If she did not have this ""sixth sense,"" it would be hard to understand how her family could continue to thrive in their well-drilling business year after year."
CAE_36,"**Simplified Text: 'We Changed Lives for a Day!'**

Have you ever thought about living someone else's life for a day? It might be fun to try something new! We arranged this for four people - here’s what happened.

**A. Amanda's Story**

I had never been to a place like this before. It was dark and loud, with many people and a great atmosphere. It was very different from my hometown, and honestly, I wasn't sure I could handle it! Being a mother is busy, but this was something else! I had just fifteen minutes to learn how to carry a tray of drinks with one hand. The other waitresses made it look easy, but just as I was getting the hang of it, the drinks slipped off the tray and spilled everywhere. I felt so embarrassed, but the other waitresses laughed. Everyone makes mistakes at first!

By opening time at 11:30 am, there was already a line outside, and I started to feel nervous. I worried about remembering all the orders, but luckily, everything was automated. After a couple of hours, my feet hurt, and I couldn’t get used to the loud music. Every time a customer spoke to me, I had to say 'Pardon?', which was embarrassing! By the end of my shift at 5 pm, I was completely tired and wanted to soak my feet in hot water. I couldn’t believe it when one of the waitresses said it had been a 'quiet' day! I never realized how tiring waitressing could be. I always thought it was an easy job, but you really need to be friendly and able to handle a lot of customers at once. I’m quite shy, and I don’t think I could manage on a busy Saturday night. I wasn’t impressed with the pay either. Sadly, I must have been a bad waitress because even the rich customers didn’t tip me! I was very happy to return to my children. It felt easy compared to waitressing!

**B. Cindy's Story**

I was a bit nervous about being a 'mum' for a day, but I was also excited. I had been told the girls were cheeky, but I thought I could manage. As Amanda left for the restaurant, I had to get the two girls dressed and fed. After dropping Sophie at school and Katie at nursery, I thought I would have three hours of peace. I was wrong! A note from Amanda reminded me that I still had to make the beds, clean the house, and do the laundry.

At 1 pm, I picked up Katie, rushed through the supermarket, and then took her home for lunch. But when I brought Sophie home from school, the real trouble began. They turned the couch into a trampoline and played a game that involved screaming loudly! I thought they would tire out soon, but I was wrong again. I thought I had a lot of energy, but they wore me out! After much effort, I got them to bed by about 8 pm, but then the fun began! How many glasses of water can a child drink? I realized they were just trying to come downstairs to watch TV, but it was exhausting to spend all evening negotiating with them. I never knew how tiring it could be to take care of two small children. You don’t have a moment to think about yourself, and the responsibility is overwhelming. Still, I really enjoyed the day.

**C. Rosemary's Story**

On the farm, I wake up at 5:30 am, so sleeping in until 7 was a treat! I took a long time deciding how to dress. I couldn’t show up in my farm clothes, could I? Looking at about 400 students at assembly, I hoped I blended in and that my fresh face didn’t make me stand out as a farmer. After that, I went to a math class. The children worked in small groups with different levels of difficulty - very different from my school days when we recited tables together! Then I helped with a nature project, identifying and feeding snails. By lunchtime, I was tired and looking forward to a break, but teachers only have about five minutes to eat. There’s so much to do before classes start again. I attended a staff meeting about reports and ended up helping with athletics trials. After lunch, there was a silent reading lesson (which was nice!) and then a French lesson in the video room. This was fun because all the children wanted to practice on me, which showed how rusty my French was. Finally, we went to the gym for Physical Education. I was exhausted, but the children had endless energy. The hardest part was speaking in front of the class - even for just two minutes, it was scary. Teachers may have more holidays, but I think I’ll stick to farming!

**D. Hilary's Story**

I arrived at White House Farm at 8:30 am, only to find out that Rosemary had been up for three hours! Rosemary’s farm has 100 Jersey cows, 15 calves, and about 800 sheep! She also makes ice cream, yogurt, and cream, which are sold in shops and restaurants. I spent most of the morning in the ice cream shop, filling milk containers, making ice cream, and putting on labels. It was hard not to taste everything!

At lunchtime, I checked on the sheep. I drove to one of the fields and helped a sheep that had fallen over. If they are left for more than 12 hours, they could die, so they need to be checked every day. What a nightmare it must be in winter! After feeding the calves, I started milking, which took two and a half hours. Rosemary does this twice a day, starting at 6 am, every day of the year! I found it quite lonely. I was surprised how much I missed the children - animals don’t talk back! The worst part of the job is that you can’t take time off. The cows need to be milked twice a day, so it’s hard to plan any time away. Rosemary will only get about three days off this year. Farming seems romantic, but the reality is very different. The income is unstable, and I wouldn’t want to depend on the weather."
CAE_6,"Text: 'A trumpet isn't just for Christmas... It is interesting how many musicians, even famous ones, come from families without music. Hakan Hardenberger, the only son of non-musical parents in a rural area of southern Sweden, has, at the age of 30, become a unique trumpet player in the world today. His recordings are constantly introducing new music, not only concertos by lesser-known composers from the baroque and classical periods but also new pieces. When you meet him, bright-eyed and attractive, he seems even younger than he is, as fresh and open in his manner as the sound of the trumpet. Recently, in one of London's top concert halls, he performed the Hummel Trumpet Concerto, a piece he often plays, while a television feature was made about his work and growth, filmed in both London and Sweden. Born near Malmo, his career began with a Christmas gift when he was just eight years old. His father, who did not play music but liked Louis Armstrong, decided to give his son a trumpet. Instead of a toy, he chose a real instrument after seeking advice. The gift was a success, and the boy never stopped playing. His mother contacted the second trumpet player in the Malmo Symphony Orchestra, who agreed to give her son lessons. Bo Nilsson was a rising musician who quickly recognized Hardenberger's natural talent. Hardenberger is grateful to have had such a dedicated teacher from the beginning, one who was so passionate about the trumpet that he sought out players worldwide and was always looking for new mouthpieces. Hardenberger distinguishes himself from his teacher by saying, 'The trumpet is a simple instrument; you can't create a perfect trumpet. There will always be flaws. Also, no two mouthpieces are exactly alike. For me, it’s about understanding these flaws and building a relationship with them.' From the start, Hardenberger seemed to have a talent for finding the right balance and making that connection. Without boasting, he notes that even as a child, his unique sound was already recognizable, 'the first thing I developed.' Unlike the great British trumpet player John Wallace, who came from a brass band background and later played in orchestras, Hardenberger has always seen himself as a solo artist. As a child, he looked up to the French trumpeter Maurice Andre, another musician who avoided orchestras. He bought all of Andre's records and admired him. His parents supported his desire to practice and encouraged his ambition to pursue a career in trumpet playing. When he was 15, the question arose of where he should study. America, Bo Nilsson's first choice, was considered too far and dangerous, so at 16, he went to Paris to study with Pierre Thibaud. Thibaud confirmed Hardenberger's belief against joining an orchestra, saying that 'Playing in an orchestra is like digging in the garden.' He was realistic about his skills, knowing he played better than many his age, but it was only after his first competition at 17 in Paris that he realized he had a special ability to connect with people. Thibaud suggested he enter the competition for experience. Hardenberger prepared only for the first round but advanced to the second. Fortunately, he already knew most pieces for that round too, but in the final, he faced a concerto that had intimidated him before. He did not win first prize, but he enjoyed the performance, realizing that even though he 'played poorly,' people still listened. Hardenberger's honest view of his work and career may seem arrogant, but that would be a misunderstanding. He thoughtfully avoids analyzing what makes his communication special, saying, 'You risk losing it by trying to explain. The power of music is that it can always move people.'"

**A.** The story of Tristan Smith, a citizen in the made-up republic of Efica, is a remarkable tale about human power, history, and humor. The author skillfully creates a world with its own history, traditions, and customs. The book is also known for its humor and the author's unique perspective, combined with deep psychological insight, making it a challenging but rewarding read.

**B.** Harriet is a composed, middle-class woman with an architect husband and her own business. Normally, she would not have met Sheila, a traditional working-class woman who cares for her aging father and has raised her grandson, Leo, since he was three. Their lives change dramatically when Leo violently attacks Harriet's son, Joe, in the street. After the court case, both boys refuse to discuss what happened. Leo, who had always been a good student and never fought before, cannot explain his actions, while Joe physically recovers but becomes withdrawn. Harriet is deeply affected by her son's situation, and caring for him takes over her life. Sheila feels so guilty that she asks to meet Harriet, leading to an unexpected friendship. The author excels at showing how people respond to major changes in their lives and captures the mother's feeling that she can never do enough for her son.

**C.** This book, shortlisted for the Booker Prize, tells the story of one of the most isolated Scottish Orkney islands and its people over a long, quiet history. The narrative is set against important moments in Scottish history, vividly imagined through the daydreams of the young character, Throfinn Ragnarson. He disappears suddenly in the story but returns after World War II, having learned to appreciate the simple lives of his ancestors.

**D.** After his recent success, the author has written a sequel filled with the same gentle irony and sharp observations of family life that made the first book popular. Fifteen years after her daughter's death, Aurora Greenway approaches her seventies with her lively friend, Rosie Sunlap. Aurora's way of living remains a mix of vanity, charm, and reluctant kindness, while Rosie supports her in her enjoyable manipulation of both suitors and friends. By the end of the book, Aurora must face the passage of time and the arrival of a new generation. The author skillfully reveals the sadness that lies beneath the ordinary aspects of life, focusing more on the shadows than the bright moments.

**E.** Six different people are brought together by millionaire Logan Urquhart to sail around the South Pacific islands on his yacht, the Ardent Spirit. The author uses beautiful descriptive language to explore the personal journeys of self-discovery that each sailor experiences, returning home with renewed spirits after their time adrift on ""the desert cities of waves."" The author employs striking images to express themes of memory and awareness, which are both isolating and enlightening."

**A. THE BRAIN SURGEON**  
**Name:** Anne  
**Age:** 34  

**ANNE'S DAY**  
""I wake up at 6:30 am, go to the gym at 7 am, and arrive at work by 8 am. I start surgeries at 8:30 am. I perform surgeries all day on Mondays and Wednesdays, and sometimes on Friday afternoons. Most brain surgeries take about three hours, but some can last all day. There have been times when I worked for ten hours straight without eating or taking a break. Deciding when to operate can be stressful. While I don’t feel stressed during surgery, I sometimes worry about the next day’s tasks. Brain surgery is often a last option for patients, but when it succeeds, it is very rewarding, even if there are failures. From 10 am to 1 pm, I run an out-patients' clinic where I explain the surgeries to patients. I enjoy this and find it easy to talk to them. If they get upset, I try to comfort them, but time pressure can make this hard. I usually leave work between 6 pm and 8 pm. Some nights and weekends, I am on call, and I always carry my pager. During holidays, I often worry about my patients for the first few days, and I dream about operating at night. I find it hard to relax.""

**B. THE SENIOR DESIGNER**  
**Name:** Marita  
**Age:** 31  

**MARITA'S DAY**  
""I wake up at 7:45 am, leave home by 8:20 am, take the train to work, and arrive by 9:15 am. On Mondays at 10:30 am, we have a meeting to discuss our work, any issues, or if anyone needs help. I work in a team with three senior designers, a partner who oversees everything, and a junior designer. My work is mostly about production, with only 10 to 15 percent being design. I receive a brief from the client, and if they have clear ideas, I spend three to four weeks designing and developing the project. After that, I present my ideas to the client. Once they approve, we create estimates and budgets, and I start hiring photographers and illustrators. I also coordinate with printers to ensure everything is done on time. Managing multiple projects can be very stressful, and deadlines are always tight. I usually have lunch at 1 pm for an hour, often going to the pub, but sometimes I eat sandwiches while working. It feels great when a client appreciates my designs, but it’s disappointing when a project I worked hard on gets rejected. I usually get home by 7:30 pm, but it can be as late as 8:30 pm or later. I find it hard to relax after a busy day.""

**C. THE CHAUFFEUR**  
**Name:** Linda  
**Age:** 42  

**LINDA'S DAY**  
""I usually wake up around 7 am, but on two or three mornings a week, I have to get up between 4:30 am and 5 am to meet long-haul flights from Heathrow or Gatwick. At around 10:30 or 11 am, I might go for a bike ride or swim. Since chauffeuring is a sitting job, I need to watch my diet and exercise. I usually have a big breakfast and snack throughout the day. People often ask for my recommendations for restaurants or shops, so I need to know the area well. Many jobs are pre-booked, which allows me to plan my routes. Not all passengers are polite; some can be rude or unfriendly. However, most are well-behaved, and I have good relationships with my regular clients. Sometimes I hear conversations in the car and have to focus on driving. I work seven days a week, up to fifteen hours a day, so I must be careful not to get too tired. I try to go to bed by 11 pm.""

**D. THE LANDSCAPE GARDENER**  
**Name:** Tracy  
**Age:** 27  

**TRACY'S DAY**  
""I wake up around 7 am, leave home at 7:30 am, and start my first job. My assistant and I mainly maintain gardens we designed. We do some commercial work, but most is in private gardens, spending about an hour and a half at each location. Around 11 am, we take a break and go to a local café for a big breakfast. Sometimes I wish time would pass more slowly. In summer, I may work until 10 pm, and in winter until 4:30 pm. I run the business from home, so when I return, I check messages and return calls. If someone wants a new garden, I usually set up a consultation in the evening around 7 or 8 pm. We focus on using old materials to make gardens look historic. Sometimes clients have specific ideas that aren’t great, but it’s very satisfying to see a garden we designed bloom. I find it hard to relax in the evenings because I can hear the business phone ringing. I sleep well because my job is physically demanding, and I’m always tired at the end of the day. I may not be very strong, but I am fit. It’s a tough job, but it allows for creativity.""

I check that the contractors are following the schedule and safety rules while minimizing environmental impact. I help coordinate the site professionals and solve any problems. The contractors start work at 6 am, so my first task is to find out what happened since I left the night before. The rest of my day depends on what I learn from the clerk of works. I usually have paperwork to review or design questions to answer. Lunch is typically from 2 pm to 2:30 pm, but I often eat on the go. The contractors have set meal times, so I use that time to check the site. Since we monitor their work, it can lead to conflicts, so we need to maintain a good relationship. I see the duty resident engineer once a day, but if something urgent arises, I act immediately. I usually leave the site around 6 pm and am on call all the time."""

**A. Credit Card Executive**  
I wake up at 6 am to reach the office by 7:30 am. I manage customer development programs for our regular credit card users. My job includes launching and managing the Membership Rewards scheme in major European markets. I keep in touch with current card users, attract new ones, and build relationships with partner companies. I spend the first 45 minutes organizing my day and then respond to emails. I oversee advertising for the membership program across Europe, so I meet with marketing staff and advertising agencies to create strategies and plan future projects. I have meetings throughout the day, but I keep my door open for anyone who has questions. There are nine customer service units in Europe, and I travel to different markets once or twice a week to address any issues. When I’m in London, I usually leave work between 6:30 pm and 7:00 pm.

**B. Record Company Executive**  
I arrive at work by 10:00 am and go through the mail, which includes ten to twenty demo tapes daily, letters from producers, concert information, and invoices from session musicians and studios. The phone starts ringing around 10:30 am with calls from producers and publishers, and I have meetings throughout the day to discuss campaigns or projects for specific artists. When I listen to demo tapes, I know that people are sharing their hard work, so I try to provide constructive feedback. I can tell if the sound fits our record label. Once I sign a band, we begin working on their first album, choosing songs, a producer, and additional musicians. I also communicate my vision for the album to the rest of the company for marketing and sales. I manage budgets and expenses. I leave work by 7:00 pm at the earliest, and most evenings I attend gigs, sometimes seeing up to five new groups in one night. After a gig, I might visit an artist in the studio. Most of my social life revolves around my work, and I often don’t get home until 1:00 am, when I listen to a record to relax.

I wake up at 8:00 am and drive to work, arriving by 9:30 am. I open the mail, check the diary for client meetings, and wait to see who arrives. I enjoy showing people around the showrooms; there’s nothing better than selling a piece of furniture and knowing it’s going to a good home. We sell antiques priced from £1,000 to £6,000, buying from London auctions, country house sales, private clients, and overseas. Many items need restoration, and I work closely with our full-time restorer, as well as gilders, picture framers, and paper repairers. I read the Antiques Trade Gazette while drinking coffee to stay updated on the business, and I often visit the Victoria and Albert Museum to compare furniture. I handle accounts once a month and do tax returns every three months. I leave work at 5:30 pm, and it usually takes me about an hour to relax after work.

**D. Air Traffic Controller**  
I work a set shift pattern. On early shifts, I leave home at 6:00 am. At 7:00 am, I take over from the night shift and control one of the four positions in the tower. We have a rotating schedule, working about an hour and a half at one station, then taking a half-hour break before moving to a different station. The air traffic controllers, a supervisor, and the watch manager work closely together to manage aircraft movements. In winter, we handle about 1,000 movements a day, and even more in summer. Night shifts are quieter, allowing me to read about new air traffic requirements between 12:00 am and 4:00 am. It’s crucial to stay alert in this job, so if I feel unwell, I don’t hesitate to take a sick day. The work can be stressful, and it takes time to unwind after a shift. I hope to become a watch manager and eventually the general manager of the airport.

**E. Shop Manager**  
If I have an early shift, I leave home by 8:00 am. The first thing I do is start the electronic point-of-sale system. I ensure someone is watching the till and coordinate lunch and break times for staff. In the morning, I assist customers in finding and ordering books. I enjoy helping customers, although it can be frustrating when they come in with reviews and expect me to gather many books quickly. From 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm on weekdays, publishers’ representatives visit the shop, and I discuss new titles for the upcoming months. I need to estimate how many copies of a particular title the shop might sell. When we want to feature a new title, I must ensure it arrives on time. The early shift ends at 5:45 pm. Two days a week, I work a late shift, during which I close the computer system, lock up, and go home.

**F. Financial Analyst**  
I listen to the news at 7:00 am, then get up and take a taxi to work, arriving by 8:45 am. First, I contact our freelance reporters to find out what is happening in my region. I assess financial risks for multinational companies operating abroad, warning clients about potential issues in those countries. I provide three services: an online executive preview or newsflash, a security forecast that includes a six-month outlook, and a travel information security guide. From 9:15 am to 9:30 am, I meet with our editors to discuss the stories I will follow. My first executive preview must be online by 10:00 am, and my second deadline is 11:00 am, so I need to work quickly to gather stories. I type them up, send them to my editor for review, and make any necessary changes before they are published. I travel to Africa about three times a year to report on specific events or to stay updated on the situation. I leave work around 6:00 pm, and it can be hard to relax afterward; I often find myself awake until 1:00 am."

A. **What Makes a Good Leader?**  
A leader inspires others and helps create change. Leadership is not about being tall or having a high IQ. According to Pat Dixon, author of *Making the Difference: Women and Men in the Workplace*, leadership is about ""making things happen through people who are as enthusiastic and interested as you are."" Enthusiasm is important, and a good leader should communicate clearly and confidently. Dixon says it’s about having the confidence to say ""I believe"" instead of ""I think.""

B. John van Maurik, who runs a Leadership in Management course, states, ""Most people have more potential for leadership than they realize."" Becoming a leader involves recognizing and developing your hidden talents. In a way, we are all born leaders; we just need the right environment to grow. While it’s easy to see leadership in famous figures like Emmeline Pankhurst or Mahatma Gandhi, it can be harder to see it in our own workplaces. However, leadership is now seen as essential for effective management.

C. Think about the best and worst boss you’ve had. They might have been equally good at setting goals and meeting deadlines. But how did they achieve these goals? The best leader motivated you and provided support. The worst leader made you feel unimportant and withheld information, blaming you when things went wrong. The first was a great leader; the second was a poor manager.

D. Leaders and managers are different. Managers like to work within set rules, while leaders create new possibilities. Micheal Shea, author of *Leadership Rules*, writes, ""A good manager can keep a struggling company running smoothly, but a good leader can change a discouraged organization, whether it’s a business, a sports team, or a country.""

E. Whether you are the boss or a middle manager, improving your leadership skills can be beneficial. Here are some lessons to learn:  
- Leadership works best when you choose to lead. Discover your passions and act on them when you feel inspired.  
- Start seeing yourself as a leader. Your ability to lead is an important part of who you are.  
- Collaboration is good, but sometimes strong leadership is necessary. Try different leadership styles. If you usually negotiate, try taking charge. Notice how this changes the results.  
- Set goals and strive to exceed them. Identify areas in your job where being a leader can improve your effectiveness and career opportunities.

F.  
- Leadership does not happen by itself. It develops through taking the lead, taking risks, and learning from mistakes. Learn to delegate, motivate, organize, and provide feedback.  
- Don’t assume your leadership style will be accepted right away. It might even push people away. Keep improving your communication skills. You don’t need to be liked, but your ideas and achievements should be respected.  
- Be visible and approachable to those who matter. Remember, you don’t have to lead all the time. Know when your input is crucial and how you can help others become leaders."
CAE_64,"**Simplified Text: Films on Video**

**Film critic Nick James reviews some recent releases.**

**A. Abyss**  
Before Titanic, director James Cameron created a tense Cold War thriller about oil workers and navy experts trying to rescue a nuclear submarine deep underwater. The friendly banter and brave attitude of foreman Bud and his team remind us of tough heroes in movies by Howard Hawks. The film's design and special effects are very impressive, but the dialogue and character development are weak. Despite the skill in making the film, the story feels like a simple B-movie.

**B. The Thin Red Line**  
This video version of James Jones's novel about the battle for Guadalcanal, directed by Andrew Marton, offers a different take compared to Terrence Malick's new film. While Malick's version is mystical and poetic, Marton's film is more traditional, focusing on one soldier and his difficult relationship with his tough sergeant. Malick's film is richer and more complex, but Marton's version has its strong moments. The flashback where the soldier dreams of his wife is presented with a harshness that may be more effective than Malick's softer imagery.

**C. On Guard**  
This film, loosely based on Paul Feval's 1875 novel, is a fun swashbuckler that stands out among musketeer stories. Fabrice Luchini plays a clever villain who causes chaos behind the scenes. Vincent Perez is an energetic hero, though his role is short. Daniel Auteuil, while perhaps too serious for a light-hearted film, also has his moments as a swordsman. The filmmakers use familiar costume-drama elements with such charm that it doesn't feel like a problem.

**D. Character**  
This serious story is set in early 1900s Rotterdam. The detailed production and costumes make the film look like a museum piece. Jan Decleir plays the harsh bailiff Dreverhaven, who is cruel when evicting tenants. His troubled relationship with his son is central to the story, but the filmmakers focus too much on the period details to fully explore the dark themes.

**E. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly**  
This newly remastered video release highlights director Leone's skill. The sound editing is particularly impressive, making every sound clear. The storytelling is harsh, and whenever there is a quiet moment, Morricone's powerful music brings excitement. Morally, there is little difference between the good (Clint Eastwood), the bad (Lee van Cleef), and the ugly (Ell Wallach), as they all act unscrupulously in the post-Civil War West.

**F. The Longest Day**  
The publicity for this three-hour war epic boasts ""Forty-eight International stars."" With four directors and 23,000 extras, the film feels overdone. The early scenes, where battle-hardened veterans wait for news about the invasion, drag on for both the audience and the soldiers. Logistically impressive, the film cries out for a big screen experience. Watching it on video feels less satisfying."

**BOOK A** Steve Martin's *Compelling Evidence* is indeed compelling. The narrator, a lawyer trying to start a new practice after leaving a powerful law firm, is forced to defend his boss's wife when she is accused of murdering her husband. The trial scenes are exciting, with the outcome uncertain until the verdict, and there is a surprising twist at the end. This is a strong debut in a crowded genre.

**BOOK B** *Curtains for the Cardinal* starts with excitement and throws the charming Sigismondo, a troubleshooter for the Italian Renaissance aristocracy, into a mix of politics, church intrigue, and serious murder. We are confident he will uncover the guilty parties. The plot is complex, and the book is a bit long, but it is still enjoyable.

**BOOK C** *File Under: Deceased* introduces a unique new detective from first-time author Sarah Lacey. Leah Hunter is a tax inspector, well-suited for investigating when a strange man collapses at her feet. Despite facing criticism and the disapproval of a handsome local detective sergeant, brave and adaptable Leah is a strong character.

**BOOK D** *Double Deuce* by Robert B. Parker features the intelligent private investigator Spenser, who helps his friend Hawk clear drug dealers from a poor neighborhood in Boston. The quick dialogue matches the fast-paced action, but there are fewer deaths and more philosophical discussions than usual. It is high-quality entertainment, as always from Parker.

**BOOK E** *False Prophet* by Faye Kellermann features her regular detectives, Pete Decker and Marge Dunn, investigating an attack and burglary at the home of a famous film star's daughter. The author's easy writing style and keen observation of unusual human behavior make this an entertaining mystery.

**BOOK F** Husband and wife team Diane Henry and Nicholas Horrock write together. *Blood Red, Snow White* features another lawyer and another female client, but the action takes place outside the courtroom, and the defender becomes a victim as the plot unfolds. The story combines romance, money, and violence to create an engaging suspense novel.

**BOOK G** *Dead for a Ducat* by Simon Shaw presents actor Philip Fletcher as the intended victim. A funny group of characters comes together to film a story about Robin Hood, but Philip feels this is not the right direction for his career. Simon Shaw usually entertains, but this time, moving his star actor from dark comedy to farce results in a performance that is not up to his usual standard.

**BOOK H** *Fall Down Easy* is Lawrence Gough's best book in a while. Canadian police are searching for a clever bank robber who targets female bank tellers. The slow, expertly crafted build-up of tension and the portrayal of the intelligent, troubled robber elevate this novel above the average detective story."
CAE_57,"Text: ""I might be too old for this adventure, but here I go! At 34, Tim Pozzi has left a good job to go backpacking. He thinks about why he and others his age have decided to take this step. This summer, I quit my job and decided to rent out my flat to travel in South East Asia for a year. You might think I'm lucky, but I'm 34 years old and feeling nervous. It's not like I haven't traveled before. After university, I spent two years backpacking in North and South America, and when I returned, I promised myself I would do it again someday. But then life happened: I fell in love, started a career, bought a flat, and got used to earning a salary. Gradually, I realized I was sacrificing my own happiness for my salary. When I handed in my resignation, it felt like I was taking control of my life again. I have no ties now. Many of my friends are married with children, and while they wouldn’t trade places with me, they envy my freedom. I'm no longer in a relationship, and I don’t have strong career goals. I feel I should make the most of this freedom, if only for my friends' sake! Why am I so nervous? First, I need to make all the arrangements. How could I let someone else live in my home? How do I organize the rental? And I also need to decide where to go. I tend to procrastinate and am already behind my planned schedule. I thought, 'I might as well enjoy the summer in England,' and then, 'Why not wait for the start of the football season?' Letting go of emotional ties makes it harder. I’m delaying because I wonder if I can still handle backpacking. Will I adjust to a simpler way of life? Will I feel out of place among younger backpackers? Maybe not. I've noticed that more Britons in their late twenties and thirties want to break free from their lives and travel abroad. Jennifer Cox from Lonely Planet says that more people are realizing that adventure is available to them: 'People who used to say ""I wish I had that opportunity"" now understand they can have it whenever they want. They just need to be brave, organized, and confident enough to do it.' For Danny, a 30-year-old accountant, and his girlfriend Tammy, a 28-year-old teacher, this trip is a chance to enjoy life before settling down. They bought a round-the-world ticket for a year. 'I'm willing to give up job security for this trip,' says Danny. 'There’s always a worry that I won’t move up in my career and will return to the same position, but I think it’s a risk worth taking. When I left the office, I threw my calculator into the river as a symbolic act of defiance!' For Matt, who just left the Army, his year of travel was a time of change. 'In the military, there’s a strict way of doing things. I needed to change that to live well as a civilian.' While there are many reasons for traveling at my age, some common factors exist. 'Today, we have a more flexible workforce,' says Angela Baron from the Institute of Personnel Development. 'More people work on short-term contracts, so if your contract ends, you have nothing to lose.' Larger companies are even allowing career breaks. 'If you’ve invested time and money in training someone, it’s good to know they’ll return instead of going to a competitor.' Dan Hiscocks, managing director of Travellerseye, a company that shares stories of 'ordinary' travelers, says that more thirty-somethings are reevaluating their lives. 'If you’re not happy with your job—and many aren’t—it’s no longer just about sticking it out. People now know that opportunities exist and that a job isn’t permanent. Travel allows you to reflect and think about your life.' Is giving in to wanderlust just another sign of my generation's struggle with adulthood? Jennifer Cox disagrees. 'It shows a better-educated, more stable society where we care less about paying bills and more about living a balanced life. We’re taking the time to ask, ""Is this what I want?"" Ben, a 32-year-old picture researcher going to Central America for a year, doesn’t think he’s running away. 'It’s more about running towards something. I want to pursue things for myself.' But he does feel some anxiety. 'I’ll miss my comfortable routine—going to the office every day, saying ""hi"" to everyone, and having coffee.' I share Ben's concerns about leaving behind a structured life with few challenges, and I’m not sure I would be making this journey if I hadn’t found my boss so unbearable. As Jennifer Cox points out, 'This is common. There’s often a trigger, like a breakup or job loss, that pushes people to travel.' It may have taken a push to get me moving, but I’m now looking forward to the next 12 months with growing excitement. No matter what happens, I’ll take pride in having embraced life. I believe I speak for all of us older backpackers."""
CAE_42,"**Text: 'Transforming the Home Office'**

Georgina McGuiness took a long break from journalism and felt disconnected from the changes in technology. In this text, she shares how she turned her home into an effective workplace.

The Christmas before last, I turned 37 and realized that I needed to revive my journalism career, which I thought was lost due to technology. A quick look at my resume showed that I was stuck in the past, back in the 1980s, when typewriters were the latest technology. I worried that no one would trust me to use a computer in a newsroom. Many job ads required experience in desktop publishing, which I didn’t have. I felt more likely to host a seminar on nuclear physics than to design a page on a computer. I was known as the family technophobe; even calculators confused me, and I still didn’t know how to use the timer on the video.

I knew I had to act quickly to fill the gap in my career. I thought leaving home before my children would be difficult, but then I entered a competition in a local newspaper. To my surprise, my family and I won a computer package. We received a laptop for my husband and a personal computer for the family. We jumped into this new world, and terms like cyberspace, Internet, and surfing became part of our everyday language. We started chatting online with strangers from around the world. The children stopped watching television, and I set up a small office in the kitchen with a phone, a fax machine, a CD-ROM, and a modem connecting me to the Internet. I had everything I needed to work from home while still taking the kids to school. The children were already comfortable with computers from school, while I was more nervous, fearing I would lose my work by pressing the wrong button. I was wrong. Although I wasn’t very skilled, I learned the basics quickly; it was logical and straightforward. With practice, I improved a little each day.

I recently started freelancing for a magazine, writing about two articles a month, and I feel proud to have the best of both worlds. How has the computer helped me? Since school, my desk has always been a chaotic mess, and I often lost important papers. The computer has made me more organized, especially with office tasks. Spreadsheets help me track income and expenses, and ready-made invoices and letterheads save me a lot of time.

For a journalist, being online means I can research stories, ask for information on journalism forums, and discuss working from home with people worldwide. However, there are downsides to working from home. You can feel isolated without face-to-face contact. There are also distractions, like household chores, and when the children are home, we sometimes argue over who gets to use the computer.

Many people are now buying multimedia PCs, not just for education and entertainment. In my neighborhood, a new type of home-based business is emerging because it’s convenient to avoid the daily commute to the city. 

What defines home workers as we enter the next century? A report called PC Usage in UK Homes gives this profile of the modern computer user: they are 38 years old and well-educated; 93% own a personal computer, 32% have a CD-ROM, 38% have a laser printer, and 50% have a modem. Considering this, I feel I am ahead of the game. Who knows, one day I might be emailing a column to a newspaper in Melbourne or even publishing my own magazine from home. It seems that the possibilities are endless."
CAE_59,"**The Tartan Museum**

The modern buildings of Scotland's national museum stand out in historic Edinburgh. But are its exhibits just as impressive? Sally Varlow visited the museum just before it opened.

You cannot miss it. The new Museum of Scotland is located on the corner of Chambers Street in Edinburgh, featuring a large yellow sandstone tower and unique buildings topped with a hanging garden. Last winter, the building received mixed reviews, with some calling it a ""masterpiece"" and others expressing doubt. Now, as the inside prepares for opening, the exhibitions may face similar opinions.

Forget the debates about whether it tells a nation's story or if it is chronological. The answer is yes; it presents a rich collection of stories linked to important historic objects, with a timeline to help visitors navigate without restricting the displays. It does not let its national treasures, like Mary Queen of Scots' jewels and Holyrood chapel silver, be overshadowed by national pride.

The main concern is whether people will find the museum interesting enough to return. Dr. David Clarke, the head of exhibitions, believes a visit should be enjoyable and is designed for those with little prior knowledge. Despite this openness, Clarke insists on a strict approach to what is displayed. Imaginative recreations of the past are not included, as he believes they misrepresent history. The public deserves the truth.

The challenge for visitors is whether the stories of the objects can be told effectively through explanation panels, captions, and multimedia, with only about 30 computers available in the museum. Just days before the opening, it is still uncertain. However, some impressions are clear, and the views of Edinburgh Castle are breathtaking.

Inside, the layout is striking. Galleries connect to one another, each with different sizes and shapes, featuring pale walls designed to resemble large stone blocks and deep display cases. Natural light pours in through narrow windows and roof lights, allowing visitors to appreciate each item on display.

Thanks to a 12-member Junior board made up of 9- to 12-year-olds from across Scotland, the museum includes a Discovery Centre. The group wanted to create an interactive experience, and while they did not achieve that, they succeeded in establishing a children's hands-on center in what was meant to be a temporary exhibition gallery. Consequently, the Twentieth Century gallery on the top floor is the only temporary exhibition, set to change every three years. It features a mix of objects chosen by Scottish people and notable figures that have significantly impacted life in Scotland during the twentieth century. Suggestions included an electric guitar, televisions, thermos flasks, and favorite toys. While the idea is entertaining, it feels somewhat trivial and does not fully address serious topics. However, it may gain depth when the computerized collection of personal stories goes live next week.

Overall, Dr. Clarke is correct in saying that ""objects open windows on the past more vividly than anything else."" As for the modern architecture, it is impressive from the inside and top, but whether it fits the location is another question."
CAE_54,"**Text: The Future of Newspapers**

The idea of newspapers changing from print to online is a big topic. Change can be scary for some people, but it usually means moving from the present to the future. However, the shift of newspapers to the online world is uncertain and uncomfortable. Many believe it will happen eventually because print newspaper sales are falling while visits to their websites are increasing. For example, the print sales of The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian have dropped by 8% to 10% each year, but their website traffic keeps growing.

However, not everything fits this pattern. A recent survey by the World Association of Newspapers showed that global newspaper circulation actually increased by 1.1% last year, reaching 512 million copies a day. While sales in Western countries have decreased, Asia has compensated for this decline. News magazines, which many think would struggle in the digital age, reported a 5.4% increase in sales.

The same trend can be seen with books. E-readers like Kindle are very popular, with sales rising significantly this year. Yet, when bookstores looked at the sales of physical books over the last six months, they found only a small decrease of 0.4%. This suggests that people are enjoying both digital and print formats.

The idea that young people are completely giving up reading newspapers is exaggerated. According to the latest National Readership Survey, nearly 5 million people aged 15 to 35 still read major national newspapers. Different countries in Europe show different trends. In Britain, there has been a 10.8% drop in newspaper sales, but in Germany, the decline is only 7%, and in France, it is just 3.1%.

These differences suggest that the situation is more complex than some people think. In the past, analysts believed that online advertising would support the shift to digital newspapers. However, digital ad revenues are now falling, making this assumption seem outdated. Many US newspapers have started charging for online access. The best way to attract paying readers seems to be offering both print and digital subscriptions together. This means that print newspapers are still important for selling online subscriptions, as they generate much more advertising revenue than online ads.

Maintaining both a website and a print edition is challenging and costly for newspaper companies. However, print newspapers still have a strong presence, and being noticed online is much harder."
CAE_32,"**Text: Photographing People**

People are the most interesting subjects to photograph. A picture with a person is usually more engaging than the same scene without anyone in it. However, photographing people can be challenging. Besides technical skills, photographers must pay attention to actions, gestures, and expressions. The presence of a camera can sometimes change how people behave.

**A. Grouping People**  
Avoid straight lines when taking group photos. Ask people to stand at different angles and distances, and if possible, at different heights. You can also have some people sit or kneel in front so that all faces are visible, or raise your camera to get a better view.

**B. Posing for Pictures**  
People often feel stiff in front of a camera. Help your subject relax by suggesting a comfortable position, like folding their hands or putting them in their pockets.

**C. The Right Approach**  
Do not pretend you are not taking a picture when it is obvious you are. This can create tension. Most people will agree to have their picture taken, even if they hesitate at first. They may feel self-conscious, so you might need to guide them. A picture can be less interesting if the subject looks away from the camera.

**D. Eye Contact**  
A picture is more powerful if the subject looks at the viewer. Ask your subject to look into the lens, and they don’t have to smile. They may not be able to do this for long, so remind them just before you take the shot. You can also say something funny to get a natural reaction.

**E. Candid Concentration**  
Instead of looking directly at the camera, your subject can focus on something else in the picture. This can make it easier for them and allows the viewer to see what the subject is interested in. Candid shots can be very captivating, and the subject's expression is important.

**F. Expressions and Gestures**  
Expressions and gestures reveal a lot about a person in a photograph. For example, a laughing child can make viewers smile, while a sad face can evoke sympathy. Look for common expressions like shrugs, winks, or smiles; they communicate feelings instantly.

**G. Situation Interest**  
While close-up shots of a person can be striking, the background can add more context. When including a background, avoid distracting details and focus on what is relevant. Ensure the subject stands out against the background, which can be achieved with a wide-angle lens.

**H. Interaction**  
Capturing moments where people are interacting—like talking, laughing, or working together—can lead to great photos. Couples, mothers with babies, and teams can create appealing images. Look for moments of connection, such as eye contact or gestures that show how one person is reacting to another.

**I. People and Places**  
Many photos of people are taken during trips. To improve these pictures, use a standard or wide-angle lens and step back to include the entire background, like a building or landscape. Position your subjects close to the camera while ensuring the background is visible. A slightly higher camera angle can help achieve this balance.

**J. To Pose or Not to Pose?**  
Decide why you want to take the picture. If it’s to remember someone you met briefly, a clear posed picture against a nice background is good. However, family photos can become boring if they are all formal poses. Candid shots of events are often more lively and can capture genuine moments, making them more memorable in the future."
CAE_65,"**Text: Under Sarah's Spell**

Sarah Janson is a trompe-l'oeil artist, which means her paintings create an illusion of reality. In this interview with Joanna Watt, we learn more about her.

Not many artists choose not to sign their work unless asked, but Sarah Janson is one of them. She believes that the artwork is more important than the artist. ""It's not the artist who is important, but the work,"" she says. Sarah is very modest and almost makes it seem like her paintings create themselves. This attitude makes for an interesting magazine interview. ""I just don't like to talk about myself,"" she admits, and she looks shocked when asked if she minds being photographed.

After a short time, Sarah becomes more comfortable, and the interview turns into a fun and engaging conversation. She has been a trompe-l'oeil artist for sixteen years, after studying drawing for two years at art school, earning a degree in graphic illustration, and working at a publishing house. However, she found illustration unsatisfying and began working with a specialist decorator named Jim Smart. He asked her to create one trompe-l'oeil piece, and that sparked her interest. ""Suddenly my interest got focused,"" she explains. She started her own business, unsure of where it would lead but feeling it was the right path.

Sarah's keen observation skills and attention to detail, developed through her illustration work, are crucial for her trompe-l'oeil art. ""People often ask me where they can learn trompe-l'oeil, but no one can teach you. Trompe-l'oeil is about life experience and observation,"" she insists. She believes that learning never stops. ""The moment you think you've mastered something, you might as well give up."" She is also honest about her weaknesses, saying, ""I can't paint bread; it always looks like grey concrete,"" and admits she struggles with math. When she had a big project for the ceiling of Lulworth Castle, she felt confused by the measurements. ""I thought, 'You're not Michelangelo. Who do you think you are?'"" This self-doubt leads her to speak about her work in a distant way, saying things like, ""When I finished that ceiling, I thought, 'Well, I didn't do it; she did.'""

However, her trompe-l'oeil works are exceptional. Janson's art stands out from others who have tried to imitate the style, which has become popular again but not always successfully. She has completed many important projects for both businesses and private clients. Much of her work is inspired by architecture. For example, she created a trompe-l'oeil dining room based on a Venetian palace and a painting in a flat that makes it look like there are two more rooms beyond it.

There is a challenge with trompe-l'oeil art: once you understand the trick, you might lose interest. Janson is aware of this. ""Trompe-l'oeil must do two things. First, it must draw you in and trick you. Second, it must keep your attention and engage your imagination. That is the most important part."" She believes that trompe-l'oeil should also be personal to the client. ""I love working with clients; that's where the ideas come from,"" she says. ""Without a good relationship, creating a trompe-l'oeil becomes difficult."" Some clients have clear ideas, while others do not, so she must be open to listening and understanding their vision. Many clients become friends, especially since she often works closely with them on-site.

Sarah appreciates her clients, saying, ""I am very grateful for the adventurous ones who let me work on their walls."" They seem happy with her work, which is why she stays busy, even though she tends to downplay her talent. ""I really don't like to talk about myself,"" she repeats. ""Like my work, I am very modest. I don't want it to be loud. You get tired of things that are loud."" This may be true, but you could never get tired of Sarah or her art. Her work deserves more recognition, and I am willing to risk her annoyance by praising her."
CAE_61,"**Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success**

Daniel Goleman explores the 'people skills' that are important for success in any profession.

A. The rules for work are changing. We are now judged by a new standard—not just by our intelligence or training, but also by how well we manage ourselves and interact with others. This new standard is increasingly used to decide who gets hired or promoted. It helps identify who is likely to excel and who may not perform as well. These skills are important for our future job opportunities. This new standard is different from what we learned in school, where doing well on tests was seen as the most important. Now, it is assumed that we all have enough intelligence and skills to do our jobs. The focus is on social skills and personal qualities, such as initiative, empathy, adaptability, and persuasiveness—what we now call emotional intelligence.

B. In a time when job security is low, personal qualities are becoming more important in the workplace. For many years, these qualities were referred to by various names, such as 'character' or 'soft skills.' Now, we have a clearer understanding of these abilities, which we call 'emotional intelligence.' This is defined as the ability to understand and manage our own feelings and those of others, and to use these feelings to guide our thoughts and actions. In the workplace, emotional intelligence includes self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills. Some people think it just means 'being nice,' but it can also mean being direct and honest when necessary. Emotional intelligence is not about expressing feelings freely; it is about managing feelings so they are expressed appropriately, helping people work together towards common goals.

C. More businesses are recognizing that promoting emotional intelligence is vital for good management. The more complex a job is, the more important emotional intelligence becomes. A lack of these skills can limit a person's ability to use their technical knowledge. While some people have succeeded despite lacking emotional intelligence, as work becomes more collaborative, companies that encourage teamwork have a competitive advantage. In today’s workplace, where teamwork and customer focus are essential, emotional intelligence is increasingly important for success in every job around the world.

D. Unlike IQ, which does not change much, emotional intelligence can grow as we gain life experience. Studies show that most people become better at managing their emotions, motivating themselves, and developing empathy and social skills over time. This growth in emotional intelligence is often called maturity. We can learn emotional intelligence and add these skills to our toolkit for success, especially in a time when job stability is uncertain. Emotional intelligence is not a guaranteed solution for struggling organizations, nor does it ensure greater profits. However, if we ignore the human aspect, nothing else will work as effectively."
CAE_52,"Text: 'Should the media profit from content they do not own? Digital cameras and camera phones have made it easier to capture important news events, but social media has changed how citizen photography works. With news often breaking on social networks, some journalists are now using these platforms for images as events happen. Unfortunately, some reporters have shared user-generated content (UGC) without asking for permission. Although there is guidance stating that images on social media can be used without permission in special cases or when there is strong public interest, there is still debate about whether this is right. Research shows that about one in ten people would film or photograph a news event, indicating that UGC will play a significant role in the future of the media. However, to maintain a good relationship with the public, the media must ensure that people are fairly compensated for their work and that permission is always requested.'"

**Ancient Chinese Medicine in the West?**  
Acupuncture is a practice that is over two thousand years old. It comes from traditional Chinese medicine, which also includes herbal remedies, massage, diet, and exercise. Acupuncture is used to treat many health issues, but it is especially known for helping with pain. Some general practitioners (GPs), midwives, and physiotherapists use it regularly for pain relief.

**A. What is it about?**  
Traditional Chinese medicine views health as a balance of energy in the mind, body, and spirit. This energy, called Qi (pronounced ""chee""), flows through the body along pathways known as meridians. There are twelve main meridians, each connected to an internal organ, and many smaller meridians that carry Qi to every cell. When the flow of Qi is blocked or weak, it can lead to illness or weakness. During a visit to an acupuncturist, they will check for imbalances in your Qi by feeling your pulse, looking at your tongue, and assessing your overall health. They will ask about your medical history, current health, mental state, and your eating and sleeping habits. An acupuncturist uses fine needles that are inserted into the skin. They may also use heat from burning herbs or apply pressure to certain points to help the flow of Qi.

**B. Over three hundred points**  
The acupuncture points are linked to the meridians and may not be close to where you feel pain. Many people report feeling a mild ache or tingling when the needle is gently moved. This can be done by hand or with a machine that uses electrical stimulation. Acupuncturists believe this sensation means the needle has reached the Qi in a meridian. There are over three hundred main points used in acupuncture, with many more that are used less frequently.

**C. Science explains how it works**  
Even though many doctors do not accept the ideas of traditional Chinese medicine, they recognize that acupuncture can help relieve pain. They have found scientific reasons for its effectiveness. For example:  
- It is thought that stimulating certain nerves can block pain signals from reaching the brain.  
- Some scientists believe that acupuncture releases natural pain-relieving chemicals in the body called endorphins.

**D. What types of pain can be treated?**  
Many people with long-term pain try acupuncture as a last option. Commonly treated pains include back pain, sports injuries, arthritis, headaches, and pain after surgery. Acupuncturists also claim to treat menstrual pain, facial nerve pain, and pain in terminally ill patients.

**E. Modern use of an ancient treatment**  
Although acupuncture has been practiced in China for over 2,000 years, its use as an alternative to anesthesia during surgery began in the 1950s. This helped convince some doctors outside China that acupuncture has real benefits. In China today, acupuncture is used in many types of surgeries, from tonsil removals to heart surgery. Needles can be used alone, with electrical stimulation, or with medication. While some people report little to no pain, experiences can vary. Many might find the idea of being awake during surgery unappealing, but acupuncturists say that acupuncture does not have the side effects of regular anesthesia (like nausea), and recovery is often quicker.

**F. Effectiveness**  
Like many alternative therapies, it is challenging to conduct clinical trials on acupuncture. However, studies show that 50 to 80 percent of people find it effective for chronic pain. Acupuncturists generally agree with this success rate. They acknowledge that it may not work for everyone and that individual responses can vary. Traditional acupuncturists suggest that for long-term pain, it usually takes six to seven visits to feel significant relief, but some improvement may be noticed after just two or three visits.

**G. A different approach to pain**  
Western and Chinese medicine view pain differently. An acupuncturist looks at the patient as a whole, not just the specific symptoms. They spend time diagnosing the problem and looking for underlying issues with the Qi. They also consider external factors that may affect the pain, such as weather conditions. These details are important in deciding how to use acupuncture for treatment. Most medical doctors may not consider these factors.

**H. Traditional or not?**  
Some medical professionals have training in traditional acupuncture, while others, including many GPs, prefer scientific explanations and do not follow traditional Chinese theories. However, many traditional acupuncturists believe that using traditional methods is necessary for achieving deep healing, which can be hard to measure in studies. It is important to choose a qualified acupuncturist, who should refer you to a medical doctor for further investigation if needed."

P.D. James is a well-known crime writer, whose gentle appearance hides a clever and imaginative mind. Her full name is Phyllis Dorothy James. She has a calm presence that makes it easy to imagine her as a headmistress of a girls' school. However, it quickly becomes clear that this confident look is actually a cover for her shyness. She admits that Adam Dalgliesh, the detective in her books, is based on herself, or how she might have been if she were a man. Dalgliesh likes to solve crimes alone, just like P.D. James prefers to write in solitude. She says, ""I need time alone, especially when I am writing. I can write almost anywhere as long as I have complete privacy.""

P.D. James is too humble to agree with the idea that she is the most famous crime writer in Britain, even though millions of people read her 12 major detective novels. She is a big fan of her close friend Ruth Rendell and enjoys her psychological novels written under the name Barbara Vine. The books she reads are often by women writers like Iris Murdoch, Anita Brookner, and Penelope Lively, but she also appreciates male authors like Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh, whom she believes were the best novelists of their time.

P.D. James found success later in life. She was 42 when her first crime novel, *Cover Her Face*, was published. Born in Oxford, she grew up mostly in Cambridge, where her family moved when she was 11. She met her husband there, who was a university student, and she has always loved the city. This is why she chose it as the setting for her book *An Unsuitable Job For A Woman*.

She shares that her life has been difficult at times. Her husband, Connor Bantry White, returned from World War II very ill. ""I had to work long hours to support him and our two young daughters, Clare and Jane. I had many ideas for stories, but I had no time to write. My husband's parents were wonderful and helped take care of my daughters, giving them security during those tough years.""

While working full-time in administration for the National Health Service, she used her excellent organizational skills. At one point, she managed five psychiatric outpatient clinics. She then spent 11 years at the Home Office, first in the Police Department, working on forensic science research, and later in the Criminal Law section, focusing on juvenile crime. While working in forensic science, she became used to seeing dead bodies. However, it was not the idea of death that inspired her. ""I was more interested in the structure and process of writing a crime novel. I have always loved reading detective stories and knew I wanted to be a writer.""

""I didn't want to use the painful events of my life in my fiction. Writing detective stories was a great way to learn how to be a serious novelist, and it was different from my own experiences. I realized that I could follow the traditional rules of a detective story and still write a meaningful novel about people. Writing detective stories,"" she explains, ""is a way to create order from chaos. Solving a crime shows the value of life, even if that life is not admirable. No one truly enjoys violence."""

**The Pen is Mightier than the Psychoanalyst**

The study of handwriting to understand a person's character is becoming more popular. In some countries, if you apply for a job, you will likely be asked to provide a sample of your handwriting. This handwriting sample can significantly influence whether you are considered suitable for the job. Handwriting analysis, known as graphology, is recognized as a real science in many places. Researchers believe it can help identify certain health issues, like heart disease and cancer, and can show psychological states and emotional problems. 

More companies are using handwriting analysis for job guidance and as a supplement to interviews. Many large companies now hire graphologists to examine the handwriting of job candidates. However, many doctors and psychiatrists are skeptical about the usefulness of graphology. Patricia Marne, a professional graphologist for over 20 years, argues that it should be taken more seriously. She believes handwriting can reveal psychological traits and some medical conditions. She states, ""Handwriting is a strong indicator of social class and intelligence. It can also help determine if someone should focus on arts or sciences and whether they have a deceitful or honest character.""

According to Ms. Marne, graphology can be especially helpful in identifying possible criminal behavior: ""Criminals often have disturbed handwriting, which is usually poorly shaped. Many criminals come from difficult backgrounds and have emotional issues that can be seen in their childish handwriting and in the way they write letters multiple times."" 

Ms. Marne claims she can tell if people are honest, manipulative, or reliable employees. ""Young male offenders often have very high ascenders in their writing, which suggests they live in a fantasy world and dream of success. Graphologists can predict if someone is about to become violent, if they are under extreme stress, or if they have psychopathic traits. Handwriting can even indicate potential suicides."" She also mentions that heart and lung problems can be reflected in handwriting. ""You cannot diagnose a condition from just one sample unless the writing is clearly shaky or disturbed. However, if handwriting changes over time or becomes disjointed, or if there is a break in the signature that was not there before, it could mean something serious has happened."" A significant emotional upset can also be shown by a temporary change in a person's signature.

Ms. Marne explains that handwriting can reveal other psychological traits. For example, people whose letters connect in a 'thread' style may be clever and deceitful. Those who write mostly in capital letters may be hiding their true selves. Very light pressure in writing suggests sensitivity and low energy. Originality in handwriting—how much it differs from standard writing—shows confidence and creativity. Disconnected writing often indicates a person who prefers to be alone. Very small signatures can suggest feelings of inferiority, while circles over the letter 'i' indicate a desire for attention. Crossing the 't' heavily over the whole word can show intolerance and a condescending attitude.

Ms. Marne states that it takes six years of study and experience to analyze handwriting accurately, along with empathy and intuition. She believes more research is needed to establish graphology as a scientific field. She thinks this will happen soon, saying, ""It is actually more accurate than psychoanalysis because it reveals a person's entire history, including emotional crises, without asking them questions that they might answer incorrectly.""

Despite how interesting this may sound, there is little solid evidence to support these claims. Some psychiatrists are very critical of them. They argue that handwriting is influenced by education, artistic skill, and the type of writing taught, and does not have any other significant meaning."

Is your office working well? Fresh air and good chairs are important for a happy and healthy workplace, according to a new survey. We visited four different offices to see how healthy and happy they were as work environments. Our expert panel included a building health consultant, an ergonomist who studies working conditions, and an occupational psychologist. Here are their opinions.

**Office A: Advertising Agency**  
*Building Health Consultant:* This office is very simple; it has no central heating or mechanical ventilation, and the windows open directly to the street. It is surprising that this space works, but the small, active team seems happy. They adjust to the seasons by opening doors and roof panels or using electric heaters, much like they do at home. This may be the key: the seven-person team has created a comfortable, home-like work environment without much outside control.  
*Ergonomist:* The furniture here is mismatched and creates bad postures. The chairs are old, most are not adjustable, and many are broken. However, the staff have a varied work schedule that they control, which includes office work, client meetings, and presentations. This variety helps reduce fatigue, boredom, and muscle problems.  
*Occupational Psychologist:* The staff enjoy the variety of work and the flexible office space. They feel the office is ""just the right size""—small enough to know what colleagues are doing, but large enough to focus on personal tasks. I found the office attractive and fun, showing both efficiency and creativity.

**Office B: News Service**  
*Building Health Consultant:* This office may not be very exciting, but it is comfortable and the staff do not dislike it. The air quality and maintenance are good, helped by a No Smoking policy.  
*Ergonomist:* I was not surprised to find that the company had hired an ergonomist. The chairs are excellent, and the lighting and computer equipment are good. The space is adequate, but the layout could be better. However, the environment feels impersonal and dull, with grey, bare walls.  
*Occupational Psychologist:* The walls are mostly bare, except for year planners and a poster about maternity rights. Most staff have worked there for at least five years, and relationships are good. The office could improve if the desks were arranged to make sharing information easier. Success stories or project updates could be displayed on the walls.

**Office C: Bank**  
*Building Health Consultant:* This office gets mixed reactions from employees. It feels like being in a glass case, where people can see and be seen. Despite a mix of smokers and non-smokers in a small space, the air does not feel stale. Even standing close to a smoker, the smell is not strong.  
*Ergonomist:* The office is very standard and uninspiring. The desks are just adequate, and not all chairs meet the needs for computer work, but this is a choice of the users. Computer screens are often on low desk units, which is not suitable for modern equipment.  
*Occupational Psychologist:* Staff support each other well and have good technology. Many communication awards are displayed. The wood paneling and brown carpet create a serious atmosphere. The office is busy with activity.

**Office D: Newspaper**  
*Building Health Consultant:* There is not much good to say about this building. The air conditioning is poor, causing big temperature changes. The space is cluttered, and most people do not have enough desk space. The office is very dusty, with many places for dust to collect. The roof also collects dust, which falls on those below.  
*Ergonomist:* The furniture looks more like it belongs in a workshop than a modern office. Many chairs are not suitable for keyboard users, especially those shorter than 1.75 m. Most chairs are old, lack proper adjustments, and have armrests that make it hard to get close to the desk.  
*Occupational Psychologist:* The office has old brown chairs, dirty carpets, and dust everywhere. There is a lot of room for improvement—the place needs cleaning, individual achievements should be recognized more, and the air conditioning needs to be fixed immediately, especially with so many smokers. When we visited, there were few conversations; everyone seemed stressed and focused on deadlines. The company should encourage teamwork."
CAE_38,"**Chewing Gum Culture**

Chewing gum is popular, accessible to everyone, and Americans chew 12 million sticks of it every day. This text explores how an ancient practice became a large industry. Chewing gum has fewer than ten calories per stick, but it is considered food and must meet the standards of the American Food and Drug Administration. Today’s gum is mostly made from synthetic materials, with added pine resins and softeners to keep the flavor and improve texture. 

In ancient times, the Greeks chewed a resin from the bark of the mastic tree, which grows mainly in Greece and Turkey. Greek women especially liked mastic gum for cleaning their teeth and freshening their breath. American colonists learned from the Native Americans in New England and chewed the resin from spruce trees. In the early 1800s, lumps of spruce for chewing were sold in the eastern United States, making it the first commercial chewing gum in the country.

Modern chewing gum began in the late 1860s with the discovery of chicle, a milky substance from the sapodilla tree found in Central America. Gum made from chicle was smoother, more enjoyable, and more elastic, leading to the growth of a whole industry. However, attempts to grow sapodilla commercially have not succeeded. As the chewing gum market expanded, synthetic alternatives were created.

Today, the few remaining chicle gatherers, known as chicleros, struggle to make a living. They trek for miles to collect sapodilla in very humid conditions. The environment is dangerous, with poisonous snakes and many insects. One particularly troublesome insect, the chicle fly, lays its eggs in the ears and noses of the gatherers. Despite these dangers, experienced chicleros climb trees to collect the sap, which they carry back to a camp where it is boiled and made into bricks. Life at the camp is difficult, with a boring diet mainly of maize and local alcohol made from sugar cane. 

Even though this work is hard, chicleros worry about their jobs. Not long ago, the United States imported 7,000 tonnes of chicle each year from Central America. Last year, only 200 tonnes were collected in the entire Yucatan peninsula of Mexico. As chewing gum sales have increased, manufacturers have turned to synthetic materials to lower costs and meet demand. 

Meanwhile, gum producers are finding clever ways to market their products. They claim that gum helps you relax, boosts your energy, and reduces stress (soldiers in both world wars were often given gum). The most significant claim is that it helps reduce tooth decay. Plaque acid, which forms when we eat, causes tooth decay. Our saliva helps neutralize this acid and provides minerals like calcium, phosphate, and fluoride, acting as the body’s natural defense. Gum manufacturers say that chewing for 20 minutes can increase saliva production. Research continues on new textures and flavors. Glycerine and other vegetable oils are now used to mix the gum base. Most new flavors are artificial, but some still require natural ingredients. Additionally, 137 square kilometers of land in America is dedicated to growing mint for the two most popular chewing gums in the world."

**A. INDIA - GHANERAO HOTEL, RAJASTHAN**  
Ghanerao Hotel is located at the edge of the Aravalli Hills in a small village known for its craftsmen. It combines the calmness of an English country house with Indian culture. The Ghanerao family has lived here for 400 years, and now, Sajjan Singh and his wife welcome guests into their home. The facilities are basic, with hot water provided by bucket, but this simplicity adds to the hotel's charm.

**B. NEW ZEALAND - HERMITAGE HOTEL, MOUNT COOK**  
One of my favorite hotels is the Hermitage Hotel on New Zealand's South Island, which I discovered while climbing. After being flown close to the top of a glacier and climbing to the peak, we walked down. To my surprise, we found this hotel at the bottom, set in stunning countryside, very wild and high up. Arriving tired and finding such luxury, with a pianist playing Cole Porter, was amazing.

**C. MAURITIUS - PARADIS HOTEL**  
On the south-west of Mauritius, the Paradis Hotel is located on a quiet peninsula. The road to the hotel winds along the coast, passing empty beaches where only fishermen are present. The hotel is large and offers many free water sports, but you can easily find solitude along nine kilometers of private beach. Swim a little way out into the Indian Ocean, and you can hardly see the hotel for the palm trees. In the evening, when everyone has left, you can sit on the beach and feel far away from everything.

**D. ST LUCIA - LADERA HOTEL**  
The Ladera Hotel in St Lucia has one of the most stunning views in the Caribbean. It is quiet and remote, standing at 1,000 feet above sea level, with open rooms that look out between the twin peaks of the Pitons to the Caribbean Sea. The hotel has a colonial style, with mahogany and greenheart wood furniture, and four-poster beds with muslin netting.

**E. TURKEY - THE SPLENDID HOTEL, ISTANBUL**  
This hotel, located on Buyukada in the Princes Islands, is a perfect escape from the noise of Istanbul. The islands are just an hour away by boat and are very picturesque. There are no cars, only horse-drawn carriages and beautiful wooden buildings from the 1920s. The Splendid Hotel, made of wood and painted white with red domes, is modeled after a historic hotel on the French Riviera. Although it is a bit worn down now, it still has its charm.

**F. FRANCE - CHATEAU D'ETOGES, EPERNAY**  
In the small village of Etoges, in the Champagne region, there is a lovely seventeenth-century chateau. Surrounded by a moat with two swans, the chateau has 20 unique rooms, some with four-poster beds, and one even has a billiard table. They offer special weekend rates for two nights, including breakfast and dinner, plus complimentary champagne (their own brand, which you can take home).

**G. KENYA - THE FAIRVIEW HOTEL, NAIROBI**  
The Fairview is a rare find in Africa - a comfortable hotel that is not overly luxurious. It is a popular stop for travelers recovering from safaris and planning their next adventure. Guests often arrive, see the beautiful gardens and dining options, and decide to stay for a week. There are even apartments for those who want to stay for months. The hotel is set on Nairobi Hill, away from the busy city center, making it a great place to enjoy the stunning African sunset while sipping beer and looking forward to a hearty dinner.

**H. ITALY - HOTEL SPLENDIDO, PORTOFINO**  
The Duke of Windsor was the first to sign the guestbook at the Hotel Splendido. Since then, many famous people have visited, including Lauren Bacall, Humphrey Bogart, Liz Taylor, and Richard Burton. Today, you might meet a billionaire or a rubber-tyre heiress. This former monastery turned villa and hotel is still splendid, offering simple yet delicious food and beautiful Persian rugs along with homemade pasta."
CAE_47,"Text: 'Sue Brown is a hotel inspector. Christopher Middleton observed her during an inspection. Just one minute into the annual check, problems are already appearing at the Globe Hotel, although the staff are unaware. The receptionist is busy giving room rates over the phone to a potential guest and does not notice Sue and Christopher. ""She hasn't even acknowledged us,"" Sue comments quietly. ""Very poor."" This is a common mistake during the arrival phase, one Sue has seen many times in her 11 years as an inspector. ""But this isn't just any three-star hotel,"" she argues. ""It has three red stars, and I expect better."" Having red stars means the Globe is among the top 130 hotels out of 4,000 in the guide published by her organization. However, even before the cold welcome, there is an uncomfortable atmosphere. Access from the car park is through an unmanned door with a buzzer, leading to a long, empty corridor to the hotel entrance. ""Again, not what I expected,"" Sue says. Could it get worse? Yes, it could. ""We have no record of your booking,"" the receptionist says in a cheerful voice. It turns out that out of the hotel's 15 rooms, 12 are empty that night. One room on the top floor does not meet Sue's standards: it is stuffy, and there is a large hole in the wall behind the wardrobe. When she started her career, she earned a reputation for being tough. ""I was known as the Woman in Black,"" she remembers, ""which was funny because I never wore black. And I was never really that tough."" The next morning, after paying her bill, she reveals her identity to the hotel’s general manager, Robin Greaves. His face shows fear. Before she says anything else, he apologizes for a bad smell in the main lounge. ""We think there’s a blocked drain,"" he sighs. ""The whole floor might need to be replaced."" Sue kindly suggests that he should also tell his staff not to quickly show guests to that room. ""It might be better to guide them to the other lounge,"" she advises. Greaves nods sadly and takes notes. He has only been at the Globe for five months and struggles to believe Sue when she says her feedback is for the hotel's benefit in the long run. However, not everything is negative. Emma, the assistant manager, and Trudy, the young waitress, receive praise for sharing information about the hotel’s 400-year history. Dinner is also good enough to keep the hotel’s two-rosette food rating, encouraging Greaves to ask, ""What do we need to do to get three rosettes?"" Sue's advice includes, ""Don’t serve a dessert that falls apart."" Greaves' brief excitement fades. It is Sue's difficult job to express the complaints that many customers do not have the courage to voice. ""Sometimes, it can be very sensitive. I remember a woman complained that I got her son fired. All I could say was the truth: he served me apple pie with his fingers."" She receives letters with false claims about everything from being arrogant to asking for bribes. ""You start to expect it, but it still hurts,"" she says. Sue must not only share her findings verbally with the hotelier but also send a full written report. After all, they pay for her to help them improve. (There is an annual fee to be included in the guide.) Still, being recognized with red stars makes it worthwhile. So, it is good for Greaves to hear that Sue will not recommend taking away the Globe's red stars. That is the good news. The bad news is that another inspector will return in the next two months to ensure everything is fixed. ""Good,"" Greaves says with a forced smile. ""We’ll look forward to that."""

Doug Scott, a mountaineer, shares his experiences of climbing the highest mountains on each continent, known as the Seven Summits. He began this journey later in life and will describe each mountain in the order he climbed them.

**A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)**  
While resting in a snow cave below the summit, Doug and his climbing partner, Dougal Haston, talked about sleeping bags, which Doug found odd since they were alone. He thought he was losing oxygen and even started talking to his feet, which were getting cold. They were not just worried about surviving but also about how well they would survive. Over the next two days, Doug remembered their time on the summit ridge and felt confident climbing with Dougal. He focused on finding a better rhythm to reach the summit.

**B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)**  
This mountain is known to be very dangerous. In April 1976, Doug and Dougal arrived at the Kahiltna Glacier and spent four days carrying equipment and food. After the first day, they realized how difficult their climb would be. They followed a route from 1967 but then chose a new path to the summit. They decided to climb with everything on their backs, which was a new approach for this mountain. After a tough climb, they finally reached the summit and felt victorious.

**C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m)**  
In September 1976, Doug and his friend Paul Braithwaite flew to Nairobi to climb Mt. Kenya. However, they ended up climbing Kilimanjaro after getting a free ride. They got lost in the jungles at the base, which was serious because water was hard to find. On the second day, they found a trail marked by arrows and some rubbish, which led them to a rock pool. They tried to climb a steep wall but decided to take a safer route instead.

**D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)**  
The usual route up Aconcagua is easy. In January 1992, Doug and his wife, Sharu, arrived at Punta del Inca and met a guide named Phil Erscheler. He invited them to join his group, which was taking a different route. After waiting for bad weather to pass, they left base camp. The Polish Glacier was icy and dangerous, so they chose to go along the standard route instead. They met other climbers and decided to join them. The wind was strong as they reached the summit, and they camped outside before heading back.

**E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)**  
Doug learned that climbing Vinson Massif could be funded by guiding others. In November 1992, his team left Britain for the South Pole. During this time, the sun stays above the horizon, and the air is refreshing. On December 7, they set out for the summit. Despite strong winds and very low temperatures, they all reached the top within eight hours, although they could barely see due to a storm.

**F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)**  
In the summer of 1994, Doug's team gathered in St Petersburg. After arriving at Terskol, they had to pay a fee to their guide, which was later waived. After a few days of getting used to the altitude, they took a cable car up to 3,900m and then walked to a refuge at 4,200m. Two days later, they faced strong winds as they climbed. They thought they reached the summit but found there was still more to climb. They returned to the refuge and descended the volcano the next day.

**G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)**  
On their expedition to Carstensz, Doug and his team wanted to create a new route and spend time with the local Dani people. They were warned about possible dangers from bandits but decided to continue. On May 12, they climbed, and the weather improved. Two team members went ahead while Doug and another member climbed more slowly. They reached the summit by 11 am, and Doug received a warm welcome for completing his seventh summit. Mission accomplished!"

**Ned Ingham: Dress Designer**  
Ned Ingham creates beautiful, romantic wedding dresses. He advises people to avoid traditional, stiff dresses and the overly frilly look, suggesting simpler styles instead. Ingham has been designing wedding dresses since he was a child. At 16, he attended fashion school, where he learned how to cut and make clothes. However, you don’t need to be a bride to wear an Ingham dress; he also designs elegant evening dresses in modern colors and fabrics. For those who prefer classic styles, he offers a timeless navy-blue summer suit, a staple in women's wardrobes throughout the 20th century, but he gives it a fresh look.

**Sally Quail: Jeweller**  
Sally Quail previously worked for an art dealer but has no formal training in jewellery design. She started designing her own engagement ring when she couldn’t find one she liked. This led her to become a designer in 1990, and now her pieces are popular among many celebrities. Her unique style features large semi-precious stones set in gold, creating stunning necklaces, bracelets, and rings inspired by 18th-century designs. Recently, she has begun using diamonds, saying, ""I reached that moment in every woman's life when she wants a diamond.""

**Lily Grimson: Handbag Designer**  
Just four years after starting her career in the competitive fashion industry, Lily Grimson has had two of her designs chosen for a major exhibition, despite only taking an introductory art and design course. Her handbags are always noticed, as they are handmade in the UK. A Grimson handbag is more than just a bag; it exudes glamour, whether made from fine calfskin or luxurious silk. The combination of style and quality makes a Grimson bag truly special.

For over 20 years, Peter Little has styled the hair of many famous people. He believes most women want hair that looks natural and is easy to manage at home. His unique approach ensures that clients don’t look like they just left a salon. However, this casual style comes at a price—£250 for the first appointment, with a three-month waiting list. Leveraging his celebrity status, Peter has created his own line of hairdryers and styling tools, allowing those who can’t visit his salon to achieve their own styles at home.

**Penny Pratt: Florist**  
Penny Pratt runs a small flower shop and also works as a consultant for a large supermarket chain, providing floral ideas for top restaurants. Despite having no formal qualifications in floristry and leaving her teaching job ten years ago for a new path, her modern floral designs have won numerous awards. She has even started her own London Flower School and has enjoyed successful lecture tours in Japan and the USA. She believes that flower arrangements today should be simple yet striking, with fewer leaves, as they can be too large and overpowering. For wedding bouquets, she emphasizes that all flowers should be of the same type."

The new five-star Merrion Hotel in Dublin combines luxury with the latest technology. It was created after extensive research into what customers want and nearly two years of work converting four large 18th-century houses. This approach allowed for the installation of advanced technology that benefits both staff and guests.

General Manager Peter MacCann expects his staff to know guests by name, but he uses the hotel's computer system to keep track of guests' preferences. This system helps the hotel provide special treatment for returning clients. Although it cost £250,000 to install, MacCann believes it will be worth it over time due to its efficiency. For instance, if a guest requests specific music CDs during their first stay, those same CDs will be ready for them on their next visit, thanks to the guest-history feature.

Room temperature is a common complaint among hotel guests. The Merrion has a high-tech system that allows guests to adjust the temperature within three degrees of the normal 18°C. Additionally, the front desk can change the temperature in each room between 14°C and 25°C.

Business travelers are a significant part of the hotel's clientele, making up to 65% of its business. To cater to their needs, the hotel has equipped each room with three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that also works as a photocopier and printer, and video-conferencing capabilities. The hotel has also prepared for future technological advancements by laying extra cables and renting televisions, allowing for easy upgrades.

Despite all this technology, MacCann emphasizes that they want guests to feel comfortable, not overwhelmed. The hotel has 145 spacious and well-furnished bedrooms that are inviting. Guests can also enjoy a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a lovely garden.

The food at the Merrion is of high quality, with Chef Patrick Guilbaud's restaurant already holding two Michelin stars before moving to the hotel. This move has allowed him to create a modern kitchen and improve parking facilities. For the hotel, having a renowned restaurant on-site is a great advantage without financial risks. With the help of technology and a skilled staff, the Merrion Hotel is poised for success."

Artist Susan Shepherd is well-known for her flower paintings, and the large garden around her house provides many of her subjects. It is filled with her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wildly and spread throughout the garden. The two long flower borders along the paved path that runs from east to west show a beautiful mix of colors, shapes, and structures. This is largely thanks to the previous owners, who were passionate gardeners and left behind plants that Susan liked. She also kept the gardener, Danny. ""In fact, it was really his garden,"" she says. ""We got along very well. At first, he would say, 'Oh, it's not worth it' about some of the things I wanted to add, but when I told him I wanted to paint them, he understood what I meant.""

Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than painting the entire garden. Sometimes, she paints a group of plants together, but usually, she picks them and takes them to her studio. ""I don't set everything up at once,"" she explains. ""I take one flower out and paint it, which might take a few days, and then I bring in another one to add to the painting. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.""

Her busiest time is spring and early summer when the tulips bloom, followed by the poppies. ""They all come out together, and you're so busy,"" she says. However, she also finds beauty in the gradual decay of the flowers. For example, with tulips, ""you bring them in and put them in water, then leave them for a day, and they each change into different shapes. They open up and look amazing. When you first put them in a vase, they seem dull, but they keep changing with twists and turns.""

Susan has always loved plants: ""I studied botany in school and used to collect wildflowers from the countryside,"" she says. ""I wasn't really interested in gardening back then; in fact, I didn't like garden flowers. I thought they looked like the fake ones sold in some flower shops - to me, the only real flowers were wild ones. I was fascinated by how they could grow in difficult places, like cracks in rocks or on cliff tops.""

Today, her garden includes many plants from distant lands, but they seem just as comfortable in her garden as they did in China or the Himalayas. She has a relaxed attitude towards the garden, like a caring aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don't cause serious trouble. With two upcoming exhibitions to prepare for and plenty of subjects right outside her door, finding time to work in the garden has been challenging lately. She now hires an extra gardener, but despite needing to paint, she knows that to stay connected with her subjects, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""

Many trees in the Brackham area were damaged in the strong storms that March. The town lost two large lime trees from the old market square. The loss of these trees changed the look of the town center completely, which upset some of the local residents. Normally, Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, the head of the local police, would have been among those upset. However, during the storm, when the wind knocked down the walnut tree in his garden, Pelham was too unwell to notice. He was a big and healthy man, but he had become seriously ill for the first time in his life with bronchitis. When he first felt pain in his head and tightness in his chest, his wife, Molly, urged him to see a doctor. Believing the police needed him, he ignored her and tried to keep working. This made him forgetful and irritable. It was only when his colleague, Sergeant Lloyd, took him to the doctor that he finally agreed to go. By then, he was too weak to argue. Soon, she took him to the pharmacy for his antibiotics and then home to his wife, who sent him straight to bed. 

On Thursday morning, when Molly told him that the walnut tree had fallen during the night, Pelham could hardly believe it. On Thursday evening, he weakly asked about damage to the house and felt relieved to hear there was none, then pulled the sheets over his head. It was not until Saturday, when the antibiotics worked, his fever went down, and he got up, that he realized the loss of the walnut tree had changed the living room forever. The Pelhams' large house was in a big garden. It had cost a lot, but Pelham had no regrets about buying it. The green garden had given them privacy. Now, however, the storm had changed his view. Before, the living room had a beautiful walnut tree that let in interesting light and shadow, hiding the worn furniture they had brought from their old house. With the tree gone, the room felt harshly bright, showing the old furniture in all its wear. The view from the window was not pleasant either. The tall house next door, which had been hidden by the tree, was now visible, with its unattractive purple bricks and pipes. It had many upstairs windows that seemed to watch the Pelhams' every move. 

“Doesn’t it look awful?” Pelham said weakly to his wife. But Molly, standing in the doorway, sounded more happy than upset. “That’s what I’ve been saying since we moved here. We need to buy a new sofa, no matter the cost.”"
FCE_16,"**Text: Living in the Valley**

We had been living in our valley for sixteen months when we first realized the dangers that could come from the surrounding hills and threaten our survival. It was the year when the storms arrived early, even before November ended. Until then, we felt safe and protected in our valley below the hills. Soon, snow began to fall. Within a day, it was about 15 centimeters deep. It almost completely blocked our lane and made the path by the stream slippery and dangerous. But on the nearby hills, the snow was much deeper and lasted longer. Up there, the wind blew fiercely. In our valley, we only felt sudden gusts of wind; the trees swayed, but their branches stayed strong. Still, we knew we had reasons to worry. The snow and wind were annoying, but they did not really trouble us much. It was the river, the Ryburn, which usually flowed gently, that worried us the most. It reminded us of what could happen if things were different, if the flow of water from the hills had not been controlled by a series of dams many years ago.

Soon, the snow started to melt. Day after day, we watched dark clouds gather over the hills to the west. These grey clouds spread over the valleys, twisting and turning, warning us of what was coming. We had seen enough of the sky; now we began to watch the river, which was becoming fuller and wilder each day. The snow was washed away as more rain fell from the clouds, but high in the hills, the reservoir was filling up and getting close to a dangerous level. Then it happened – for the first time in years, the reservoir overflowed. It was like Niagara Falls as the water surged over the dam and poured into the stream below. The river seemed wild as the waters rushed down to its lower parts. Just a couple of meters from our cottage, the stream looked furious beneath the bridge. It was much deeper than we had ever seen it so close to our home, crashing against its banks. For three days, we prayed that it would stay below its wall. Luckily, our prayers were answered as the dam held and the waters began to go down.

In the past, before the dam was built, the river had flooded nearby villages in such a rage. Now, the dam controls the river's flow, and usually, everything is fine; the large amount of water from the hills, caused by snow and heavy rain, stays behind the dam with only occasional overflow. Because of this protection, we can enjoy, rather than fear, the huge clouds that hang over the valley and appreciate the great power of the river. Thanks to this safety, we feel our home in the valley is still secure and safe."

Film critic Mark Adams reflects on his ten years of work for a newspaper called The Front Page. Writing articles about films for The Front Page was my first real job. Before that, I had done some reviews—books for other newspapers, films for a magazine, and anything I was asked to do for the radio. That is how I met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, who also worked in radio and television. He hired me, but Tom was not mainly a journalist, or he would have been more careful in choosing his staff. 

At first, he wanted a team of critics to cover art forms that didn’t need special knowledge: books, TV, theatre, film, and radio. We would have a weekly lunch to choose what to review from the artistic material Tom selected, and there would be guests to make it social. It felt like a dream: a new newspaper, and I was part of the team. It seemed unlikely that a new paper could succeed in a crowded market. I even thought a millionaire was helping me personally and pretending to hire me because I lacked self-confidence. The first time I saw someone reading the newspaper on the London Underground and turning to a page with my review, I didn’t know where to look.

Tom's idea for a team of critics never really happened. It was a good plan, but we didn’t meet as intended, so everything was done by phone. It turned out that the public preferred to have a reviewer focus on one subject area, so I chose film. Without Tom's initial support, we might not have developed the current system, where I write a weekly piece, usually about one film. This way of working suits me well. I wouldn’t have liked the typical film critic role, which involves reviewing every new film. That routine would make me tired quickly. I would soon be sitting in my seat on a Monday morning, sighing, ""What awful film must I watch now?""—a sigh often heard in screening rooms worldwide.

The freedom I have allows me to expand my arguments or, in a dull week, to create something interesting from little. But what is my role in the public eye? I think people choose films based on the stars, the advertising, or the director. There is also loyalty to certain types of films. It is rare for someone who dislikes westerns to buy a ticket for one after reading a review, or for a romantic film lover to skip a love story because of a review. So if a film review isn’t really a guide for consumers, what is it? I don’t feel I must be ""right"" about a movie. I also don’t think there should be a set number of ""great"" and ""bad"" films each year. My job is to present an argument. I’m not a judge, and I wouldn’t want to be one."
FCE_46,"Text: 'Why would a schoolgirl want to swim 1500m, cycle 40km, and then run 10km? Because ""it's fun."" A teenager who loves endurance sports is looking for a training partner for triathlons, preferably female. This is a chance to work with a potential Olympic champion. The partner should be very interested in distance running (regular 15km sessions), distance swimming (enjoying winter training in cold rivers is helpful), and distance cycling (a love for 100km rides is a plus). Being able to do all three activities without resting is essential. Triathlons are becoming one of the most popular Olympic sports. They attract large crowds who are fascinated (and sometimes horrified) by athletes who swim 1500m, cycle 40km, and then run 10km without stopping. It may be exciting for spectators, but what drives triathletes to push their bodies so hard? What makes a talented 17-year-old, with great academic results, give up so much for the challenges of this sport? 

Melanie Sears has not yet learned the usual phrases about personal satisfaction and mental challenges that most athletes use when asked similar questions. ""You swim 1500m, then run out of the water and jump on your bike, still wet. Of course, then you freeze. After the 40km bike ride, you have to run 10km, which feels long when you're tired. But it's great fun, and it's all worth it in the end,"" she says. Melanie entered her first triathlon at 14. ""I won the junior section - but I was the only junior competing. It felt so easy that I waved at my teammates as I went around."" Feeling confident, she entered the National Championships. Although she had the second fastest swim and the fastest run, she did not place well. ""I was following a man, and suddenly we reached the sea. We realized we had gone the wrong way. I ended up cycling 20 kilometers too far. I cried all the way through the run."" But she did not give up and is determined to keep going. ""Sometimes I wish I could stop, because then the pain would be over, but I am afraid that if I let myself stop just once, I would want to do it again."" 

Such determination earns admiration from Steve Trew, the sport's director of coaching. ""I've just been testing her fitness,"" he says, ""and she worked so hard on the running machine that it finally threw her off and into a wall. She gave it everything, but while most people stop when they realize they can't go further, she just kept going."" Melanie was the top junior in this year's European Triathlon Championships, finishing 13th. ""I was almost as good as the top three in swimming and running, but much slower at cycling. That's why I'm working very hard at it."" She is trying to convince her supportive parents, who will pay the £1,300 cost of her trip to New Zealand for this year's World Championships, to buy a £2,000 bike (""It's a special deal, with £1,000 off"") so she can compete in national 25 km and 100 km races later this year. But there is another cost. Her intense training has made her somewhat of a recluse. ""I don't have a social life,"" she says. ""I'm not a party person anyway. After two hours of hard swimming on Friday nights, I just want to sleep. But I call and write to the other girls on the team."" What do they talk about? Boys? Clothes? ""No, we talk about our times."" 

Where will all this focus lead? Melanie has tried other events. She has participated in the triathlon ""sprint,"" where you only swim 750m, cycle 20km, and run 5km. She wants to enter even tougher events than the triathlon. ""The big problem is, I have no one my age to train with,"" she says. It's interesting, isn't it?"
FCE_70,"**Text: The Collectors**

Amanda Roy discusses her passion for collecting and why many people share this hobby. Collecting is a popular activity, with one in three adults participating. It is a world filled with passion, envy, enthusiasm, and joy. However, if you decide to collect, remember this: only collect items you truly love. 

Since ancient times, people have felt the need to collect. Early humans collected pebbles and wore them as necklaces. Attracted by their shapes and colors, these pebbles were among the first objects people gathered for intellectual and spiritual reasons. Over the years, not much has changed. Children still collect stones and seashells simply for their beauty.

I have been collecting for as long as I can remember, from flowers like tulips to pottery and paintings. My first collection was stones I found in my parents' garden. When I was six, I was sent to a school in a remote, cold part of England. When my parents visited, they took me to a local museum filled with objects collected by others. I was captivated by these items. 

Interestingly, I am not alone in my interest in collecting. One in three adults shares this passion. The reasons behind collecting have become a topic of great interest. Some believe it is the only part of their lives where they feel in control. For me, it is simply something I enjoy.

One famous collector was the Duc de Berry in France, who had a ""room of wonders"" filled with natural and artificial curiosities, like cups made from coconut shells and carved ivory beads. Another notable collector, Catherine the Great of Russia, owned over 4,000 paintings. However, you don’t need to be wealthy to start a collection. I have collected various items, from tulip bulbs to china cups, with great determination. 

I remember convincing another tulip collector to sell me a special bulb. I planted it and cared for it, but one year it disappeared—stolen by another collector. I also collected 350 American rag dolls, searching all over the USA for different designs. Unfortunately, this collection was lost in a house fire. The next morning, I stood in my front hall, looking at the remains of my furniture and my collection, unsure which loss hurt more.

I have always been fascinated by how collections change hands. A silver spoon that once belonged to a king or a poet adds value to items traded in markets. As certain objects become popular among collectors, their prices rise. For example, toys from the 1950s can now be valuable, especially if you kept the original boxes. (I, unfortunately, threw away both the boxes and the toys.)"

Four people talk about their jobs.

**Lisa - Exhibition Programmes Organiser, Science Museum**  
I organize temporary exhibitions. This means I plan and design the exhibition and promote it. I research the exhibition topic and talk to experts to understand the main themes and goals. I decide what objects and pictures to display. I also create interactive displays, workshops, and theatre to help the public understand the exhibition. I work with engineers and electricians to ensure the display is safe for visitors. Before the exhibition opens, I help design and write brochures and leaflets to inform people about it.

**Janet - Teacher of London Taxi Drivers**  
When I arrive at 7:30 a.m., I check the accounts. Then, I see what new maps and documents need to be created for the taxi-driver test. By midday, about 50 students are in school, learning the routes. They find the most direct paths, using one-way streets and making the right turns. I help when there are disagreements, like whether a right turn is allowed at a junction. As they prepare for the test, I give them a simple route but tell them they must take a different path because the road is closed. This forces them to think of alternative routes.

**Sarah - Marine Conservationist**  
I live by the coast and work from home. My job involves answering phone inquiries, creating educational materials, and setting up training courses. I occasionally go to our main office, but I mostly work along the coast. I collaborate with schools and study centers, running courses for coastal managers and decision-makers about the ocean. I take them out to sea to help them understand marine life better, which often changes their perspectives. I feel lucky because conservation is my passion, but since I work for a charity, I always need to find more funding, which limits what I can achieve.

**Chris - Map and Atlas Publisher**  
My job is quite varied. I ensure our publishing program meets market needs and maintain a stock of about 300 books. We have high standards for information and content. We receive many letters from readers about issues like international boundaries, which require careful responses. I discuss future projects and current sales with co-publishers. I work with a dedicated team, which makes the job enjoyable. However, like many jobs, there is too much administration, leaving less time for interesting tasks like product development and design."

Every June, we went to Ireland. Since the four of us started going on holidays together, we spent the first two weeks of the month at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. It is a large house by the sea, near the village of Ardbeag. The English couple who own the house, the Malseeds, have made some additions to it, but they did so very carefully. Strafe found Glencorn for us. He saw an advertisement when the Malseeds still needed to promote their place. One evening, he said, ""How about this?"" and read the details. The summer before, we had gone to a hotel recommended by friends, but it was not a good experience because the food was terrible. The four of us have been playing cards together for a long time: Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia, and me. They call me Milly, but my real name is Dorothy Milson. Dekko got his nickname at school; Dekko Deacon sounds nice, I guess. He and Strafe were schoolmates, which is why we call Strafe by his last name, like the teachers did. We are all about the same age and live close to the town where the Malseeds lived before moving from England to Ireland. We always think it’s a funny coincidence.

""How very nice,"" Mrs. Malseed said, smiling to welcome us again this year. She seems to know when guests are arriving because she is usually waiting in the large hall that always smells of flowers. ""Arthur, take the luggage up,"" she told the old porter. ""Rose, Tulip, Lily, and Geranium,"" she said, naming the rooms we would stay in. Mrs. Malseed painted flowers on the doors instead of using numbers. In winter, when few people visit Glencorn Lodge, she takes care of little details like that; her husband handles repairs and redecorating. 

""Well, well, well,"" Mr. Malseed said as he entered the hall from the kitchen. ""A hundred thousand welcomes,"" he greeted us in the Irish way. He was smiling widely, and his dark brown eyes sparkled, making us feel like we were more than just another group of guests. Everyone smiled, and I could sense that the others felt our holiday had truly begun. Nothing had changed at Glencorn; everything was fine. Kitty from the dining room came out to greet us. ""You look younger every year, all four of you,"" she said, making everyone in the hall laugh again. 

Arthur led the way to our rooms, carrying as much luggage as he could and returning for the rest. After dinner, we played cards for a while but didn’t play too long because we were still tired from the journey. In the lounge, there was a man alone and a French couple. There were other people at dinner, of course, because Glencorn Lodge is always full in June. From our table by the window, we could see some guests walking on the lawns and others taking the path down to the beach. In the morning, we would do the same: walk along the sands to Ardbeag and have coffee at the hotel there, returning in time for lunch. In the afternoon, we would drive somewhere. I knew this because over the years, we had developed this routine. Since we first came here, we had all fallen in love with the beautiful landscape in every season."

Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex, shares her experiences as a chalet girl in Val d'Isere, France. This is her second year in this role, where she cooks and cleans for visitors who come to ski and stay in wooden houses called chalets. Sarah graduated last summer from Oxford Brookes University with a degree in French and History of Art. She views being a chalet girl as a fun way to spend a year or two before starting a more permanent career. ""It's a good way to meet successful people,"" she says.

Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to work. The chalet can host up to 18 guests each week. She has her own breakfast before preparing breakfast for the guests, which includes porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants. After breakfast, around 9:30 a.m., she cleans up and either makes afternoon tea for the guests or cleans the rooms, which she finds the least enjoyable part of her job. By 11 a.m., she is ready to ski, often staying on the slopes until 4:30 p.m.

After skiing, Sarah returns to the chalet to prepare dinner. She takes a shower first but avoids sleeping, as she believes it would make her feel worse. Dinner, a three-course meal, is served at 8 p.m., and coffee is usually ready by 10 p.m. After dinner, she cleans the kitchen, as she dislikes coming back to a messy space the next morning. Sometimes she chats with the guests, but other times they prefer privacy. ""Good guests can make a week wonderful,"" she notes, recalling a fun breakfast experience.

Sarah lives in the chalet with friends, and they often go out around 11 p.m. They usually start at Bananas, then might visit G Jay's and Dick's T-Bar. However, she avoids staying out too late on Saturdays because Sundays are her busiest days. ""It's a tough day,"" she says, ""especially when you have to cook breakfast with a headache.""

On Sundays, she starts work earlier, preparing breakfast for guests leaving by 7 a.m. Once they leave, she cleans quickly, clearing breakfast, stripping beds, and getting everything ready for new guests. If she hasn't done the shopping on Saturday, she does it now. By around 3 p.m., after finishing the cleaning, she prepares tea for the new guests arriving around 4:30 p.m. Sometimes they seem confused and have many questions, which she finds amusing.

Between tea and dinner, Sarah helps guests who need ski equipment by taking them to the ski shop and getting a ride back. Soon, it's time for dinner again, and sometimes she enjoys a drink afterward, but if she's too tired, she prefers to go to bed early."
FCE_27,"Miss Rita Cohen was a small, pale girl who looked much younger than Seymour's daughter, Marie, but she said she was six years older. One day, she visited his factory. She wore overalls and large, unattractive shoes, and her curly hair framed her pretty face. She was so small and young that Seymour found it hard to believe she was studying at the University of Pennsylvania, researching the leather industry in New Jersey for her Master's degree. A few times a year, someone would contact Seymour to ask if they could visit his factory. Sometimes, he would help students by answering their questions over the phone or giving them a short tour if they seemed serious. 

Rita was almost as small as the children from Marie's third-grade class, who had visited the factory years ago to see how gloves were made. Seymour remembered how Marie loved to watch the workers shape and press each glove using steam-heated brass hands, which she called ""pancake hands"" because they looked flat and shiny. 

Seymour heard Rita ask, ""How many pieces come in a shipment?"" He replied, ""Between twenty and twenty-five thousand."" She took notes and asked, ""Do they come directly to your shipping department?"" He was pleased to see her interest in every detail. ""They go to the tannery first. The tannery is a contractor. We buy the material, and they prepare it for us. My grandfather, father, and I all worked in the tannery here in town. Have you ever been inside a tannery?"" 

""Not yet,"" she said. 

""Well, you should visit a tannery if you want to write about leather. I can help arrange that for you. They are basic places. The technology has improved, but it’s not that different from what it was hundreds of years ago. It’s tough work. Tanning is said to be one of the oldest industries. They’ve found six-thousand-year-old tanning relics in Turkey, I think. The first clothing was just animal skins that were tanned by smoking them. It’s a fascinating subject once you get into it. My father is an expert on leather; you should talk to him. If you start a conversation about gloves, he could talk for two days. Glovemakers really love their trade. 

""Have you ever seen anything being made, Miss Cohen?"" 

""I can't say I have."" 

""Never seen anything manufactured?"" 

""I saw my mother bake a cake when I was a child."" 

He laughed; she made him laugh. She was innocent but eager to learn. His daughter was at least 30 cm taller than Rita, fair where Rita was dark, but otherwise, Rita reminded him of Marie. He remembered how Marie would come home from school, full of what she had learned, everything neatly written in her notebook and memorized overnight. 

""I have an idea. We will take you through the whole process. Come on! We are going to make you a pair of gloves, and you will watch them being made from start to finish. What size do you wear?"""

Chris Arnot asks four people with dream jobs if they are as great as they seem.

**A. Raquel Graham**  
Raquel Graham calls from a taxi on her way to the airport. She cannot meet tomorrow because her boss needs her in Los Angeles instead. As a personal assistant to a pop star, she must travel around the world quickly. Raquel loves her job and has a good relationship with her boss. However, she has one small issue—she dislikes flying. ""On a nine-hour flight to California, I usually take sleeping pills to help me relax,"" she says. Her worst experience was flying on Concorde. ""It felt so closed in with those tiny windows."" When she is not traveling, she works in offices in Manchester and London. She handles some boring tasks like organizing schedules, attending meetings with lawyers and accountants, planning trips, and making more travel arrangements. She did not apply for this job; a chance meeting with a pop group manager led to her working behind the scenes. She also took a secretarial course in evening classes. Five years later, she was in the right place when her boss needed a personal assistant.

**B. David Brown**  
David Brown has worked as an accountant and a golf caddy, which is someone who carries a golfer's bags. Overall, he prefers caddying because golf is his passion. However, there are downsides. He earns a small flat fee plus a percentage of the winnings, which averages between £25,000 and £35,000, but much of that goes to travel and hotels. He was 31 when he first caddied for golfer Greg Norman. ""You're not just carrying bags. You give advice, use your knowledge about the game, and try to understand the course,"" he explains. His skills in accounting were recognized by European Tour Productions, which made him a statistical data administrator. He collects and analyzes statistics from the caddies, which are valuable to TV commentators, golf magazines, and the players.

**C. Martin Fern**  
Martin Fern is the editor of the ""Food and Drink"" section of a daily newspaper, and one of his easier tasks is to taste food at fine restaurants. What does he think about restaurants with high prices? ""For those who can afford it, it's their choice,"" he says. ""I would rather spend £120 on a memorable meal than buy a microwave."" His cooking talent led to a friend, who was an editor of a Saturday Review, offering him a food column. At that time, Martin was the creative director of an advertising agency, and it provided him with extra income. He was 42 when another newspaper offered him a full-time job. ""It meant a 50% cut in guaranteed income,"" he says, ""but it was a chance to turn my passion into a career."" He still cooks at home and tries to stay fit by cycling a couple of miles to the nearest subway station.

**D. Dick Prince**  
""I started writing children's stories about 20 years ago,"" says Dick Prince, one of Britain's most popular children's authors. ""Before that, I loved words and enjoyed using them, but I mainly wrote poetry. Then I had an idea for a story. I had been a farmer and knew about chickens being killed by a fox. So, I wrote a story called The Fox Busters, which became my first published children's book."" Where do his ideas come from? ""It's not easy; I have to work for them,"" he says. ""I usually do this in the mornings. I don't wake up at dawn, I'm afraid. After lunch, I spend a couple of hours typing what I wrote in the morning—all with one finger on an old typewriter instead of a laptop, which I dislike.

FCE_66,"In the lumberyard by the lake, where trees were turned into boards for building, there was an old two-story brick building. Around it, there were large piles of soft sawdust, creating golden mounds that reached down to the blue lake. That afternoon, feeling bored, all the boys followed Michael up the ladder to the roof of the old building. They sat with their legs hanging over the edge, looking out at the lake. Suddenly, Michael said, ""I dare you to jump down,"" and without thinking, he jumped off the roof and landed in the sawdust, rolling around and laughing. ""I dare you all!"" he shouted. ""You're all cowards,"" he teased, trying to get them to jump too. 

Still laughing, he watched as they looked down from the roof, nervous and unsure. One by one, they jumped and got up smiling with relief. In the warm afternoon sun, they lay on the sawdust pile, telling jokes until one of them suggested, ""Let's go back up to the roof and jump down again."" There wasn't much excitement, but they all climbed back up and began to jump off in a determined way until only Michael was left. The others were down below, grinning and calling, ""Come on, Mike. What's wrong with you?"" 

Michael wanted to join them, but he stayed on the edge of the roof, nervously licking his lips and grinning foolishly, wondering why the drop had seemed shorter the first time. For a while, they thought he was just joking, but then they saw him clenching his fists. He tried to count to ten and then jump, but when that didn't work, he took a deep breath and closed his eyes. Soon, the boys started laughing at him; they were tired of waiting, and it was almost dinnertime. ""Come on, you're a coward! Do you think we're going to sit here all night?"" they shouted. When he still didn't move, they began to get up and walk away, still teasing him. 

""Who started this? What's wrong with you all?"" he called out. But he stayed on the edge of the roof, staring unhappily at the ground. He was alone for nearly an hour while the sun slowly set over the lake. His clothes were damp from nervous sweat. Finally, he closed his eyes, jumped off the roof, and landed heavily in the sawdust, lying there for a long time. The yard was quiet; the workers had gone home. As he lay there, he wondered why he had been unable to jump earlier. Eventually, he got up slowly and walked home, feeling ashamed and wanting to avoid everyone. He was so late for dinner that his stepmother said coldly, ""You should be able to get home on time by now. If you won't come home, you might as well stay out tonight."" She was a strong woman with fair skin, a bit of grey in her hair, and a patient smile. She spoke with controlled seriousness, but Michael, with his dark, gloomy face, hardly heard her; he was still thinking about the grinning faces below and their laughter."
FCE_44,"**Careers Advice**

Are you unhappy in your job and unsure how to change it? Kitty Doherty offers some helpful advice. Many people looking to change jobs seek help from a careers adviser. You will need to write a brief history of yourself and take several tests called 'psychometrics'. Afterward, you will receive a summary of the results, along with suggested careers and any retraining you might need.

I decided to try Career Analysts, one of the largest career advice organizations. Taking the careers test felt like being back in school during science exams. I was in a group of about ten people, answering questions under time pressure. I reminded myself that it wasn't about passing or failing. It was difficult to see how the psychometric tests could accurately represent me. They included tasks like finding mistakes in lists of names and numbers and matching similar shapes.

After the tests, I had a long conversation with an adviser. Based on our discussion and the test results, he created a report with his observations and recommendations. I agreed with most of his conclusions, although I was a bit disappointed to learn that I had performed poorly in the scientific and technical tests. I’m sure many sick people are relieved I didn’t become a nurse! However, it was comforting to hear that I had made the right choices regarding journalism.

Changing your career doesn’t always mean a complete shift. Last March, after losing her job as a marketing manager at a large insurance company, 25-year-old Donna Laney sought help from Career Analysts. She said, ""Losing my job was a great chance for me to reflect on my career. I wanted to reassess my skills and interests."" Some of the results surprised her. ""I didn’t realize I had a talent for design. But I had to weigh the cost of retraining in design against my financial situation,"" she explained. Other suggestions included taking a year off to work in the Far East. Ultimately, she chose to use her existing skills and moved into a role that suited her better than insurance. She is now a Public Relations officer. Donna believes she could have reached this point without Career Analysts, but they helped her understand what she truly wanted to do. She has recommended the service to several friends, all of whom are satisfied.

Not everyone finds career advice helpful. Amanda Margetts, a 24-year-old sales representative, said, ""I reached a point in my career where I felt lost. I thought a careers adviser might suggest something new. Although I received many ideas, I rejected them because they either meant a significant pay cut or required a lot of retraining. I didn’t learn anything new about myself,"" she said. ""You have to share a lot of personal information with the adviser, and I felt that if I had told a friend the same things, they would have given me similar advice."""
FCE_22,"**Text: Fun at the Dentist's**

If you visit W. Lloyd Jerome's dental office in the center of Glasgow, you will notice bright, modern paintings on the walls and a stylish blue couch for patients to sit on while he checks their teeth. Jerome says, ""Fifty percent of people only go to the dentist when they are in pain instead of for regular check-ups. This is often because they are scared."" To change this, he has tried to create a space where people feel comfortable. He decided not to wear a white coat because many people connect it with pain. He believes that dental treatment should happen in a relaxing, interesting, and enjoyable atmosphere.

This idea is surprising for many, as most people think of dental visits as painful or very formal. Jerome explains, ""If people are relaxed, entertained, and treated well, they will forget their past bad experiences."" One of his new relaxation methods is using virtual-reality headsets. ""We were the first dental practice in Britain to use them, and they are very popular. The headsets are used during the first check-up, where the patient sits comfortably on the blue couch and watches a film about underwater wildlife while I examine their teeth. Then the headset switches to a special camera that shows the patient a view of their mouth.""

Surprisingly, most patients enjoy this part of their visit. Another important detail is that the office smells more like a perfume shop than a dentist's office. Today, it has a pleasant orange scent. Jerome explains, ""When people walk in, I want them to feel with all their senses that this is not a typical dentist's visit. Smell is very important. The usual dental smell can make people anxious if they are afraid of dentists."" I found the gentle scent in the office very nice.

Although Jerome is known as Glasgow's most stylish dentist, he emphasizes that he takes his work seriously. The relaxation techniques are important, but the quality of treatment is the most crucial aspect. For example, Jerome uses a special tool that sprays warm water on the teeth to clean them instead of scraping. It feels a bit unusual at first, but as long as people are relaxed, it is not painful at all.

Five years ago, Jerome traveled to the United States to study dental techniques. ""One thing I learned there is that when you make it easier for the patient, it also makes it easier for you,"" he explains. He believes that his patient-focused approach is the beginning of a gradual change towards a less formal style in British dentistry.

At that moment, a patient arrives. Jerome quickly goes over, offers him a cup of tea (herbal or regular), asks what video he would like to watch, and gently leads him to the chair. The patient seems to enjoy this five-star treatment, and it is easy to see why. The office feels more like an elegant beauty salon than a typical dental practice."
FCE_39,"**Text: 'Bitter Water Hits the Big Time'**

Chocolate, which comes from South America, is now a huge global business worth millions. In the UK, people spend over £230 million on chocolate during Easter, which accounts for eight percent of all chocolate sales. Only at Christmas do people buy more chocolate. Although large-scale chocolate production started in the last century, the cacao plant was first grown by the Aztec, Toltec, and Mayan civilizations in Central America over three thousand years ago. The cacao tree is a tropical evergreen plant found in Africa, South and Central America, the West Indies, and Southeast Asia. Its fruit is the size of a melon and contains 20 to 40 seeds. When dried, these seeds become cacao beans, used to make chocolate. In English-speaking countries, they are often called cocoa beans, a term that originated from a misspelling in the 17th century.

The Aztecs used cocoa beans as money and made a drink called xocoatl, which means 'bitter water' in the Aztec language, Nahuatl. In Aztec times, this chocolate drink was flavored with spices and used for ceremonies and to welcome guests. The Spanish found it more enjoyable when mixed with cinnamon and sugar, but this recipe did not reach the rest of Europe for another hundred years. In the late 17th century, chocolate houses opened in major European cities where people gathered to drink chocolate. Until the last century, the drink was made from solid chocolate blocks that had to be melted in hot water. In 1826, CJ van Houten from the Netherlands invented chocolate powder by removing most of the cocoa butter from crushed beans. The modern chocolate bar began in 1847 when a Bristol company, Fry and Sons, mixed cocoa butter with pure chocolate liquor and sugar to create a solid block. A Swiss company later added milk solids, leading to the creation of milk chocolate.

At the start of the 20th century, French companies dominated the British chocolate market. In 1879, the English company Cadbury named their Birmingham factory Bournville, hoping to attract some French charm. Then, Cadbury introduced the famous Dairy Milk bar, originally called Dairymaid in 1905. Smart advertising linked it to the healthy qualities of milk from the English countryside, making it a strong competitor to rich French brands. Currently, chocolate consumption in Britain seems stable at about four bars per week, prompting manufacturers to find new ways to attract customers. One recent marketing strategy is the 'extended line,' where chocolate bars are transformed into ice cream, soft drinks, or desserts to appeal to chocolate lovers who want something new.

Meanwhile, cacao farmers are still struggling due to a drop in cocoa bean prices in the late 1980s. Many small-scale farmers went out of business. So, as you enjoy your next chocolate bar, consider the challenges faced by these farmers."
FCE_18,"**THE SHELL ARTIST**

At 83 years old, Peter Cooke has become a master of his craft. He still has many interests, including paper-making and feather-work, but for now, he focuses on creating delicate and unique objects from shells. ""Let me know if I am boring you,"" he says as he shows me his work in his apartment. There is a fine line between being boring and being passionate, but Cooke is clearly the latter, thanks to his charm and the beauty of his creations.

He points to some shell-covered ornaments above his fireplace. ""I won’t mind if people don’t buy them because I have grown so fond of them. I never intended to sell my work. About five years ago, some friends suggested I have an exhibition so more people could see my art. They even spoke to a gallery owner."" This led to an exhibition in London, where 70% of his pieces sold. His second exhibition opened yesterday. Given the high prices of his work—around £2,000 for the ornaments—Cooke seems willing to sacrifice the empty space above his fireplace.

There are 86 pieces in the exhibition, with prices starting at £225 for a shell-flower in a crystal vase. Cooke insists he has no control over the prices and is open about them. He believes no one else creates work like his, and as the gallery owner told him, ""One day you will stop, and everyone will want your pieces because there won’t be any more.""

""I wish I had started this earlier,"" Cooke says, ""because I could have made even more wonderful things. Although I still have ideas and do my best now, I am more limited physically than when I began."" Nevertheless, his work is far from the typical shell crafts found in seaside shops. ""I have a miniature mind,"" he explains, which has led to boxes covered in thousands of tiny shells, shaded pictures made from shells, and baskets of incredibly realistic flowers.

Cooke has developed his own method and uses materials he finds. He repurposes cardboard from laundered shirts for flower bases, uses a special glue bought in bulk from a sail-maker, and washes the shells with dish soap. ""I have an idea of what I want to create, and it just happens,"" he says about his process. However, the detail, color variations, and symmetry in his work look very intentional.

His search for beautiful, especially tiny, shells has taken him beyond his home in Norfolk to beaches in France, Thailand, Mexico, South Africa, and the Philippines, where he lies on his stomach to find treasures to bring back. He insists he only collects dead shells and defends himself against critics who accuse him of damaging the beaches. ""When I collect shells, I hear people stepping on them much faster than I can gather them. The ones left behind are broken by the sea. I would never collect shells with living creatures inside or dive for them, but once the animals have left, why shouldn’t I collect them?"" This argument, based on the limited amount of shells one person can carry, makes a strong case for his actions."
FCE_62,"**The Schoolgirl Model**

Kira Langer is a 15-year-old model who travels to exciting places and appears on magazine covers. When she is not modeling, she studies for her school exams. Jane Laidlaw shares more about her.

The receptionist at Kira's agency told me, ""I'm afraid Kira will be a little late."" I thought, ""That's fine."" I had read some negative things about models, like they can be difficult or vain, and I worried about how late she might be. Would she be an hour late? Three hours? What if she decided to go to the hairdresser instead of meeting me? If she was late, she might be in a bad mood and not want to talk. 

However, when Kira, the winner of the Looks magazine supermodel competition, arrived, she was smiling, relaxed, and accompanied by her mother. She wore a simple black dress and trainers, not fancy designer clothes. She seemed friendly and down-to-earth. Kira explained that all models under 16 must bring an adult with them to work, and her mother, who looked proud of her daughter, was just a regular mom.

Kira seemed a bit surprised by her sudden fame, which was unexpected. It was her older sister who encouraged her to enter the modeling competition. ""She saw the competition and told me to join,"" Kira said. ""I said no, but she sent some photos anyway."" When she learned she was a finalist, she was at school. Being chosen gave Kira the confidence to continue, and she performed well, winning easily. The Select model agency in London quickly offered her work.

Now, Kira finds it challenging to balance her two lives. Her friends and teachers are proud of her, but some classmates make rude comments about her success, saying she thinks too highly of herself. Kira finds this hard to handle, as she is not self-important. She said, ""They think that because I became a model, I can't stay the same. The only thing that has changed is that I am more confident, but not in a bad way. I can stand up for myself more.""

Being a busy model affects her social life. The Select agency can call her at any time for a job the next day. ""If my friends are going out, I can't promise to join them because I don't know my schedule. I can't make plans, and sometimes they get canceled, but my friends understand. They don't complain that I am always modeling and don't have time for them.""

Kira has the looks, talent, and support to have a great career ahead of her, even before finishing her school exams. As I was about to end the interview with this remarkable girl, I asked what she would like to do if she didn't have her beauty. She paused and said, ""I'd like to do what you're doing."""
FCE_49,"**Text: Father and Son Start Gold Rush**

Terence and Chris Madden have traveled from the cold north of Canada to the warm lands of Africa in search of valuable metals. This father and son team—one an explorer and the other a mineral expert—believe their mine on a Welsh mountain could hold up to 10,000 ounces of gold. After ten years of digging in the Welsh hills, they are sure they are very close to a gold vein worth five million dollars. ""As we dig, we are finding high levels of gold; now we just need to dig a few more meters to where it is concentrated,"" said Terence, 68, from Liverpool.

The pair have dedicated their lives to finding gold. Their search began when Terence read about gold worth millions buried in the 'Dolgellau gold belt,' an area near the Welsh town of Dolgellau. While reading old mining journals and newspapers at the Welsh National Library in Aberystwyth, they chose the most promising land to explore. Since they first cleared the area and found pieces of gold in the rocks, they have spent the last ten years getting permission from landowners, taking soil samples, and removing old cars and trash. They have dug out 150 tonnes of greenstone rock to create a tunnel and a 10-meter shaft.

Now, they are running low on money. After spending their savings on this dream, they need to convince an investor to put £50,000 into the project to dig a few more meters to reach the gold. Chris Madden says, ""Right now, this seems unlikely, although we have several people we can contact.""

As news of their dig spread through the valleys last week, the allure of gold began to attract the attention of local residents as well as other gold diggers. Dolgellau depends on tourism, and locals are cautiously optimistic. ""If they are right, it would bring more visitors here,"" said Peter Woolven, manager of the Royal Ship Hotel, ""but if these two find gold, I hope millions of people do not come and disturb the hillside.""

The Welsh gold industry has greatly declined since its peak in the late 1880s when thousands worked in many mines across the countryside. One of the last remaining mines, Clogau-St David's, which made wedding rings for the Queen and the Princess of Wales, closed a month ago. However, individual gold diggers are returning. George Hall, another prospector, plans to dig a tunnel deep into the hill on the other side of the ridge from the Maddens. ""Searching for gold is very emotional,"" said Hall, 70. ""It's adventurous and exciting, the thrill of uncovering hidden treasure. Maybe I will be lucky this time."""
FCE_31,"**Text: IN HOT WATER**

Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends a lot of time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She teaches and researches marine geochemistry, which means she studies the chemical processes in the sea. Rachel is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she is not teaching, she gets into a small steel vehicle designed for underwater exploration and dives three kilometers down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes. 

Inside the vehicle, space is very limited, and she can touch the two pilots. They are used to these conditions, where they cannot stand up or move, and they must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last for 16 hours: three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours collecting rock and water samples, and three hours to return to the surface. If there is a problem and she needs to get to the top quickly, she can press a panic button. This releases a small escape vessel that rises quickly to the surface. ""No one has tested it yet, but I don't think it would be a pleasant journey,"" she says.

Rachel remembers her first time in the vehicle. It was on a ship, and she got in with an instructor who explained the emergency procedures, including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack. They were testing how she would react in such a small space. Now, Rachel has made six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian crew to a site five days west of the Canary Islands in the Atlantic. There, on the ocean floor, is a large area of underwater volcanoes, with their chimneys releasing black smoke. The Russian team was dropping off scientific equipment to study the effects of a program that would create a hole 150 meters through a volcano.

When she is not at sea, Rachel works in her office at the Oceanography Centre in Southampton. ""Two-thirds of my salary comes from teaching, which I love, but I do it so I can continue my research on the 'black smokers,'"" she explains. This is another name for underwater volcanoes, where water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke. This smoke flows out at a rate of one meter per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees Celsius.

""The only time I was scared was during my first dive with the Americans. We were towing equipment on a 50-meter rope when suddenly there was an explosion. There was a huge bang as the shock waves hit our vehicle, and I thought, 'I'm going to die.' We looked at each other in silence, waiting. When nothing happened, we couldn't believe it. The relief was incredible—we were still alive!""

""Diving to the deepest part of the ocean is such an adventure. Every time I look out of the porthole and see those chimneys, I feel a sense of wonder. Here I am at the bottom of the sea, and no one else on this planet has ever seen them before. I studied the black smokers for three years for my PhD. When I finally saw them for real, it was an amazing feeling."""
FCE_58,"Text: 'I was dirty, smelly, hungry, and a bit sunburned. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. My body was exhausted, and my mind was tired of dealing with foreign schedules, currencies, and languages. ""Never again,"" I said as I stepped onto home ground. I repeated this the following year and the next. All I needed to do was buy one train ticket, and since I was under twenty-five, I could travel anywhere in Europe for a whole month. Ordinary beds feel different once you learn to sleep in a train corridor, rocked into a deep sleep. Carrying all your belongings in a rucksack leads to a simple way of traveling and encourages wastefulness, like burning socks that have become too dirty and getting rid of books after reading them. However, this carefree attitude is part of the Inter-Rail spirit, where common sense can be set aside along with the paperback book and the socks. All it takes to feel this freedom is one of those tickets in your hand. Any system that allows young people to travel through multiple countries in a day is special. On my first trip, my friends and I initially thought this train ticket was just a cheap way to reach our campsite in southern France. But the idea of continuous travel was too tempting, as there was always one more country to visit, just a little further away. And what did the extra miles cost us? Nothing. We were not completely uninterested in culture, but this was our first holiday without parents, like most other Inter-Railers. In planning our own schedule, we focused only on the most accessible sights. This was a chance to escape guided tours and do something different. I took pride in the fact that, in many places, all I wanted to see was the view from the station. We were just there to get by and enjoy ourselves. In this, we were like most other Inter-Railers with whom we shared train corridors, food, water, money, and music. The excitement of travel comes from the sudden reality of a place that was once just a name. It feels like the city you arrive in never existed until the train pulls into the station, and you see it with your own tired eyes for the first time. Only by seeing Europe, watching the changing landscapes, and noticing the differences in attitudes and lifestyles can you truly understand the continent. Everyone knows what is there, but it means nothing until you experience it yourself. This is why other people's holiday photos can be boring. While the train trip may not reveal new things about the world, it is a valuable personal experience. Europe is vast, and Inter-Rail offers the best chance to appreciate this, though it didn't happen for us right away.'"
FCE_37,"Text: 'There is nothing more disappointing than arriving at an airport in another country and finding out that your luggage has been left behind. At best, you will have to wear the same clothes for hours or days until the airline returns your luggage. At worst, you may be in a different climate, far from home, and stuck in unsuitable clothes. Although airlines do not often share how many bags they lose, it is a common issue that regular travelers will eventually face. Even the best airlines make mistakes sometimes, and it is impossible for any airline to guarantee that your checked luggage will travel on the same flight, especially when your journey involves changing planes.

The system works like this: Airlines require passengers to check in early, which is meant to give enough time for luggage to be processed and loaded onto the plane. Minimum connecting times (MCTs) are the shortest time needed to transfer between two flights, and these times are also extended to allow for luggage transfers. Normally, this system works well. However, extra security checks and air traffic issues can lead to delayed flights, which can disrupt the baggage system. Human error or accidents, such as a torn destination label, can also cause problems. These issues can be worse at large airports, known as 'hubs', because they handle many bags. 

For example, last year, London’s Heathrow airport served over 41 million passengers, with nine million changing planes. British Airways alone managed two million transfer passengers at Heathrow, most of whom transferred between Terminal 1 (for domestic and European flights) and Terminal 4 (for long-distance flights). Even efficient airports like Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Singapore, and Zurich can have bad days. The risk of losing luggage when changing planes is higher at certain airports. In the United States, Miami airport is known for luggage going missing when transatlantic passengers connect to flights in Latin America.

To reduce the chance of losing your luggage, choose direct flights whenever possible and check in well before the official time. If you must change planes, try to fly with the same airline for all legs of your journey. Allow extra time for connections by taking an earlier flight to the transfer airport, and make sure to label your luggage inside and out with your home and holiday addresses, including your flight numbers. If your luggage still goes missing, contact the airline staff in the baggage area and fill out a property irregularity report (PIR) before leaving the airport.'"
FCE_2,"**Text: The Kingfisher**

Wildlife photographer Charlie James is an expert on the kingfisher, a beautiful blue-green bird that lives near streams and rivers and feeds on fish. Old trees hang over the stream, providing shade to the shallow water. The main colors are soft greens, browns, and various yellows from the sunlight, as gentle as the sound of water in the breeze. The bird moves quickly and gracefully, like a flash of light, so striking that you can almost feel its presence. It disappears in an instant, but the image stays with you, its impact greater than its size.

Charlie James fell in love with kingfishers when he was young. His deep feelings for this little bird are shown by his uncertainty about what exactly attracts him to it. The kingfisher is part of many legends. In Greek mythology, it is a moon goddess who became a bird. Another story says that the kingfisher flew so high that its upper body turned blue like the sky, while its underside was burned by the sun. There is some truth to this. Despite the many shades of blue in their feathers, kingfishers do not have blue pigment. Instead, the structure of their feathers scatters light, reflecting blue. This is why a kingfisher can look bright blue or rich emerald green depending on the angle of the light.

It is no surprise that many wildlife photographers are passionate about them. The combination of their colors and the fact that kingfishers, although shy, can be observed easily from a hidden spot creates a perfect opportunity for a lifelong interest. Charlie's first hideout was an old blanket he put over his head while waiting near a kingfisher's favorite place. The bird returned within minutes and sat just a meter away. However, it took him another four years to take his first good picture. During this time, the European kingfisher became a major part of his life. He spent as much time as possible by a stream full of kingfishers, but school limited his time with the birds. He missed classes and considered himself an ""academic failure."" Yet, his passion for this widespread kingfisher, the only one of its family that breeds in Europe, was noticed. At 16, he was hired as an advisor for a nature magazine, then worked as an assistant to the editor, and eventually became a freelance wildlife film cameraman.

Now, he dreams of making the ultimate kingfisher film: ""No speech, just beautiful images that say it all,"" he says. ""I’m drawn to the simple approach. I like to photograph parts of kingfisher wings..."" His voice trails off as he thinks of the colors of the bird he has spent more than half his life observing, which still fascinates him. His photographs express some of his feelings, but Charlie knows that there is much more to his connection with the kingfisher than his work can ever show."

Giving directions to an orchestra is challenging. Anne Inglis speaks with five new conductors about their experiences.

**A. ANNE MANSON**  
Anne Manson, 30, asked to attend conductor Claudio Abbado's practice sessions in Vienna and ended up filling in for an absent assistant. She was later invited to help with another opera the following season. ""I had to lead the first orchestral rehearsal for Abbado. No, I wasn't nervous. I have always felt confident standing in front of an orchestra."" Manson, who is from America, works with a well-known opera company in London that focuses on modern works. She is also gaining recognition in other European countries, supported by the British Arts Council. Since that first experience, she has assisted Abbado on several more projects.

**B. ANDREW CONSTANTINE**  
The hardest part of being a conductor is figuring out how to get the right opportunities, says Andrew Constantine, 31. He won a major competition in 1991 after unsuccessful attempts in two others. Looking back, he feels lucky about the timing: ""If it had happened any sooner, I would have been forgotten."" The competition gave him many performance opportunities and a chance to work as an assistant to a famous conductor. However, Constantine struggles with being known only for the competition: ""If in three years my name is still linked to the competition, I will be concerned. But orchestras like the English Chamber Orchestra, who hired me after the competition, are now inviting me back. If that doesn't happen, my career could suffer.""

**C. WASFI KANI**  
Wasfi Kani, who founded Pimlico Opera, enjoys the long practice periods that come with opera productions. ""The music deserves four weeks of focus,"" says Kani, who began conducting seriously in her late twenties. After university, she worked in London's commercial center until Pimlico Opera became fully professional two years ago. Starting lessons with Sian Edwards was a turning point for her. ""I saw her conduct and realized she was my size—previously, I had only learned from much larger conductors, which makes a big difference."" She appreciates the complexity of opera: ""There are many disagreements, and you have to consider the personalities of the singers.""

**D. ROGER VIGNOLES**  
""Conducting surprised me, but it fascinates me,"" says Roger Vignoles, 48. This career choice is not so unusual; he began as a resident musician at an opera house and worked with skilled conductors. Last year, he was asked to direct Handel's Agrippina from the piano at a festival, something he had never done before. ""It was easier than I expected. I knew the music well, understood how I wanted it to sound, and did my best to achieve that. Thankfully, people respect my skills as a musician. I benefit from every experience I've had, both in musical style and performance. Now, I will accept any opportunity to discover what I enjoy.""

**E. WAYNE MARSHALL**  
In 1986, conductor Simon Rattle noticed a young assistant conductor during one of his productions and informed his agent about Wayne Marshall. Now 32, Marshall soon found himself conducting a musical in London on short notice, a tough start. He even had to manage some relaxed professional musicians reading newspapers during the show: ""I was firm with them. I always kept a clear beat and aimed for the best result. Many orchestral musicians I’ve seen don’t seem to need guidance from a conductor. But I’m never afraid to express what I want. If people see you're anxious, it only gets worse. I have never formally studied conducting, and no book teaches you how to conduct, but people have been supportive. I am determined and know what I like."""
FCE_23,"**Variations on a Theme**

If you are considering taking children to a theme park, there are many options in Britain. We asked five families to review some of the best parks.

**Fun Island - The Burns Family**  
Last year, we visited a large theme park in the US and thought Fun Island would be boring in comparison. However, we were pleasantly surprised. The park is designed for younger children, so our three-year-old felt included. The kids loved the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. There is a special dodgems ride for very young children, which was a big hit. For older kids, there are more thrilling rides, like Splash Out, where you end up in a pool! After five hours, Steve and I were ready to leave, but the children wanted to stay because they were having so much fun. Our only complaint is that the park could use more atmosphere, and the scenery was not very impressive. However, the staff were very helpful, and we found the park to be clean, well-organized, and safe.

**Wonderland - The McMillan Family**  
None of us had been to a theme park before, so we were unsure what to expect. We thought Oscar might be too young, but he loved it. He enjoyed the Mountain Train and especially liked Little Land, which has small models of famous buildings that he could see easily! The older children liked the ferris wheel and enjoyed driving toy cars on a real road layout. We spent six hours there and appreciated the places to relax. The landscaping was beautiful, and the staff were friendly and helpful. There was something for everyone, including adults.

**Adventure World - The Jeffree Family**  
After seven hours, we felt there was still much to explore. The children loved the Big Top Circus, which had an amazing trapeze act that kept us excited. We tried the Terror Line, and although the girls were scared and kept their eyes closed, they said they enjoyed it. Their favorite ride was Running River, where you think you will get wet, but you don’t. For younger children, Toy Land is a lot of fun. The kids looked at the new ride, Fear Factor, but we were relieved when they found out they were too small to go on it! The park is so well designed that even waiting in line for rides is not too boring. It was very clean, and the staff were excellent. On one ride, I couldn’t sit with both girls, so a staff member kindly went with one of them.

**The Great Park - The Langridge Family**  
We arrived at one o'clock and were disappointed that the park closed at 5 p.m. This is a great theme park for younger children because the rides are not too scary. I am quite timid, but I still had fun. We all loved Exotic Travels, a boat ride that starts slowly and then becomes very exciting. We waited for half an hour for Lightning River, and it was over too quickly! I wouldn’t go on the Big Leap, but it looked fun if you are brave. If the children had been a bit older, they might have found it a little boring, but they were the right age and enjoyed it.

**Fantasy World - The Break-all Family**  
According to the park's advertising, there is 'No Limit to the Fun', and we certainly felt that was true. Europe's tallest roller-coaster, the Rocket, stands out in the park, and Ben thought it was the scariest ride, while Jennie said the Hanger, where you hang upside-down 30 meters above the ground, was even scarier! There are about a dozen main rides, which the older children went on several times. Sarah was too small for some rides but enjoyed the Long Slide. We found the staff's attitudes varied. Some were great with younger children, but the welcome was not always warm. You need a full day to enjoy Fantasy World. We wouldn’t have dared tell the kids we were leaving early."
FCE_60,"**Text: Running a Business in the Countryside**

Five women share their experiences of starting a business in the countryside.

A. ""My customers are friends,"" says Christine Hogan, who runs a computer-aided design business that earns over £200,000 a year and has four full-time employees. ""My husband and I moved from London to the countryside when our children were young, and I wanted a job I could do from home. I had worked with computers before marriage, so my husband suggested I start a computer-aided design business. It required a lot of money, and the beginning was tough. I was careful and always informed the bank manager if I might overspend. Working from home saves money, and I can work in the evenings if I choose. The business has stayed small, and we rarely deliver work; customers from the area usually pick it up.""

B. ""I enjoy being independent,"" says Maggy Sasanow, who designs greeting cards from home. ""I studied art at university and wanted to work in a museum. But when I got married, we moved to the countryside, where such jobs were not available. So, I decided to start my own business and now create a range of 50 greeting cards that I sell to museums. I work in a large room upstairs. The downside of working from home is that there are always chores to do, like mowing the lawn. My business relies entirely on word of mouth; I don’t advertise. People send work from London because I am cheaper than other artists. Working alone means I miss exchanging ideas with others, but overall, the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.""

C. ""It has been hard at times,"" says Delia Turner, who runs a curtain-making business that has had ups and downs. ""I started my business eight years ago when this type of work was growing. In two years, my earnings increased from £24,000 to £80,000. I used to manage six full-time curtain-makers, but I had to let them go due to the economic decline, which was painful because finding other jobs in this area is difficult. Now, I am back to making curtains at home with my husband’s help and using women who work from their homes. I must be ready to lower my prices when needed and explore new opportunities.""

D. Tessa Strickland manages her children's book publishing business from her farmhouse. ""I moved to the countryside three years ago for two reasons: it was cheaper than London, and I love the countryside. I enjoy being able to work when I want. Eighty percent of my income comes from deals with Australia, the Far East, and North America, so I have to take calls at unusual hours. The downside is that I need discipline to close the office door. I publish children's books from different cultures, working with authors and artists. I had all my professional experience in London, so I felt very alone at first.""

E. Meg Rivers runs a cakes-by-post business and a shop that earns £250,000 a year and employs six people, some part-time. ""I started ten years ago at home. I am very interested in health, so I began making fruit cakes with high-quality flour and eggs. Soon, I received requests from friends and family, and I started sending cakes all over the country. Seven years ago, I rented a small building where everything is made; we have a baker, an assistant, and a professional cake decorator. I don’t bake anymore, as I manage the business side. My biggest challenge has been the financial aspect, which has been tough because we didn’t have a lot of money to start with."""
FCE_1,"**Text: Meet the Amazing Watkins Family**

The Watkins family is special because they are all involved in music. The sons are composers and award-winning musicians, while their dad makes musical instruments. Matthew Rye reports.

Many families have musicians, but it is rare to find one with writers, performers, and an instrument maker. When John and Hetty Watkins, who are schoolteachers in South Wales, needed a cello for their ten-year-old son, Paul, they were surprised by the high prices. John says, ""We looked at different shops, and it was clear it would be very expensive. So, I thought about making one myself. I found out that the Welsh School of Instrument Making was nearby, and I took evening classes for about three years.""

Paul, now 28, adds, ""After trying to make violins and violas a few times, Dad made his first cello. It turned out really well. He made me another one later, which I used until a few months ago."" John has now retired from teaching to work full-time as a craftsman, making up to twelve violins a year. Selling one to the famous American musician Jaime Laredo was a great achievement for him.

Both Paul and his younger brother, Huw, were encouraged to play music from a young age. Paul remembers, ""I started with the piano as soon as I could reach the keys. But soon, I wanted to play the cello. My parents wanted me to play the violin because Dad played the viola and needed another violin for his music group. I tried the violin for about six weeks but didn't enjoy it. I was inspired by the cellist in Dad's group, who I thought was really cool. He offered to give me lessons, and that started my journey.""

Huw says, ""My parents were supportive but not pushy. I think I would not have done well if they had forced me. Instead of feeling jealous of Paul's success, I found it motivating."" Now 22, Huw is starting to make a name for himself as a pianist and composer.

John's cello has helped Paul achieve great things. With it, Paul won the string final of the BBC Young Musician of the Year competition. At just 20 years old, he became the principal cellist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra, using his father's cello until last year. Now, he plays a Francesco Rugeri cello, which he has on loan from the Royal Academy of Music. Paul says, ""Dad hasn't said anything about my new cello, but he did try it and admitted it sounds nice! The only thing my dad's cello might gain over time is the ability to project sound in large concert halls. It will get richer with age, just like my Rugeri, which is already 304 years old.""

Soon, Paul will perform on television with the Rugeri cello in Elgar's Cello Concerto, which is part of a new series called Masterworks. He says, ""The history of the piece doesn't change how I play it. I will always do it my way."" However, Paul won't be able to watch himself on TV because he will be performing at the Cheltenham Festival that same night. Huw will also be busy, as his String Quartet will have its London premiere at the Wigmore Hall that evening. John and Hetty will need to be organized and energetic to keep up with all their sons' musical events in the coming weeks."

**The National Trust**

The National Trust is an organization that aims to protect the British countryside. Gill Page visits the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and speaks with one of the wardens employed by the Trust to care for the beautiful areas it manages.

Common sense is essential for a National Trust Warden, according to Gareth Roberts. ""You also need to be good at dealing with people because you are always interacting with farmers, visitors, conservationists, and construction companies."" Gareth grew up on the Lleyn Peninsula and worked on his parents' farm until he got married. About 80 people applied for the position of National Trust Warden for the Lleyn Peninsula. In the end, Gareth's local knowledge and farming experience helped him get the job, even though he did not have formal training. ""It helps that I still farm with my parents, so I can relate to farmers and understand their issues. They can't fool me!"" he says. His farming background also means he can handle the physical demands of the job, such as building fences, planting trees, and constructing walls.

Since joining the Trust, Gareth has learned more about nature conservation. ""When I was younger,"" he remembers, ""I used to pick flowers, collect butterfly larvae, and find old birds' nests. Recently, I thought about where I would find those flowers and nests now. It has become clear to me that farming has changed the countryside. It's not the farmers' fault; they were just following government instructions.""

Gareth notes that when he started, farmers and conservationists were often in conflict, each wanting things done their way. Now, they are communicating and understanding each other's perspectives. ""We are at a turning point, and it only takes a small step to bring them together,"" says Gareth.

Conservation is a key part of Gareth's work, along with allowing public access to the Trust's land, planting trees, and working with tenant farmers. ""My job is to ensure tasks are completed efficiently and with minimal fuss. What I enjoy most is seeing projects finished, although I spend about half my time on reports and paperwork.""

Gareth is passionate about his job and, despite always being on duty, he enjoys every moment, especially interacting with the public. Most of them, anyway. ""I dislike the attitude of some visitors,"" he admits. ""They come in, demand everything, and leave as if they have a right to it. Being polite to those people can be frustrating!"" But as Gareth says, it all comes down to common sense. 

So, if you have plenty of that and like the idea of working outdoors, you might consider applying to become a warden like Gareth. However, don't expect a position to open up on the Lleyn Peninsula for quite some time!"
FCE_55,"**The Netball Captain**

In our series about women in sports, Suzie Ellis met England's netball captain, Kendra Slowinski. Kendra is the captain of the England netball team. When I met her, she had a busy day, typical for the weeks before the World Championships next month. She taught at a local school and then had a training session in a supermarket car park. 

""Don't you get strange looks?"" I asked her. She replied, ""I'm too focused on my movements and my feet to notice anything else. I might see cars slow down out of the corner of my eye, but that's it."" 

Kendra said, ""My whole life now is about being my best for the Championships. I follow a strict schedule to be as fit as possible."" This will be her fourth World Championships, and it is expected to be the biggest yet, with 27 countries participating. ""We will have home support, which is very special,"" she said. ""It's important to improve the reputation of netball in this country. Playing at home means there will be more pressure than usual. The crowd will have expectations and will support us more. People expect us to start the tournament with a strong game."" 

Their first match is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. ""As far as I know, we have always beaten them, but they will be exciting to play against. They have a lot of talent."" The England team is currently ranked fourth in the world. However, Kendra notes that the World Championships will be challenging. ""You have to push yourself to play every day; there is no rest between games like in a series. You can still win a series if you lose the first game, but the Championships are different because you only have one chance, and you must be ready to make the most of it."" 

In the fifteen years she has played at a high level, the sport has become harder and faster. Players are more aggressive on the court. ""You don't train hard not to win,"" Kendra says. ""But once the final whistle blows, you become a different person. We are all friendlier after the game."" 

Netball is also using a more scientific approach to fitness testing. ""It is essential that we all think and train like world-class players,"" Kendra explains. ""As captain, I believe it is important to have a strong mental attitude and lead by example. I see my role as supporting and encouraging the team."" 

Kendra adds, ""From the start of my netball career, everything has been carefully planned. I decided some time ago that this competition would be my last as a player."" She will likely coach young players in the future, but for now, she is focused on her final big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she may very well have a tear in her eye."
FCE_50,"**SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS**

How can parents support a child with exceptional musical talent? It can be challenging to know how to nurture their abilities. Some parents may not recognize their child's needs until frustration leads to difficult behavior. While most schools can help academically gifted children, musically talented students often need special attention that regular schools may not provide, especially if music is seen as less important.

Children who are musically gifted, or whose talents are encouraged by their parents or teachers, may benefit from attending a specialist music school. In Britain, there are five such schools, which have been established recently. These schools offer a supportive environment for children aged seven to eighteen to develop their musical skills under the guidance of professional musicians.

At specialist music schools, students spend a significant part of their day—between one third and one half—on music-related activities. This includes individual lessons (up to three hours a week for their main instruments), playing in orchestras and chamber groups, voice training, conducting, and music theory. They also practice in well-equipped private rooms, sometimes with a teacher. The rest of their time is spent on a limited academic program focusing on essential subjects like English, math, basic sciences, and languages, although students can study more subjects if they wish.

All five British specialist music schools are independent, with small class sizes and a high teacher-to-student ratio. Most students live at the school, which allows them to spend their formative years with peers who share similar goals and interests.

However, there are some disadvantages. The cost is a significant issue, with fees ranging from £12,000 to £17,000 a year for boarders. Each school tries to help families with scholarships and financial aid for exceptionally talented children. Additionally, not all parents want to send their children to boarding school, especially at a young age. Many directors of these schools have concerns about admitting children as young as seven into such a demanding environment. They emphasize that their goal is to develop well-rounded individuals.

Separating musically gifted children from their peers at an early age can create stress. Some early signs of musical talent may fade during the teenage years, and the pressure to succeed can lead to feelings of failure. However, specialist schools closely monitor each student's progress and provide support when needed.

While many former students feel they gained a lot from the high-quality music education, some worry about the limited academic program, which often takes a back seat to music. Many musically talented young people are also very intelligent and can handle academic challenges, so they may feel frustrated if their intellectual needs are not met. For these reasons, it might be better to wait until a child is older and can make their own choices before pursuing a specialist education.

Students who excel academically may thrive in a less specialized setting, such as a school with a strong music program, or by combining regular schooling with music training at junior departments of music colleges. These colleges offer Saturday morning lessons with excellent teachers, along with orchestral and chamber music experiences. However, this option may not be feasible for families living far from London or other major cities."

Artist Susan Shepherd is well-known for her flower paintings, and the large garden around her house provides many of her subjects. It is filled with her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wildly and spread throughout the garden. The two long flower borders along the paved path that runs from east to west show a beautiful mix of colors, shapes, and structures. This is largely thanks to the previous owners, who were passionate gardeners and left behind plants that Susan liked. She also kept the gardener, Danny. ""In fact, it was really his garden,"" she says. ""We got along very well. At first, he would say, 'Oh, it's not worth it' for some of the things I wanted to add, but when I told him I wanted to paint them, he understood what I meant.""

Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than painting the entire garden. Sometimes, she paints a group of plants together, but usually, she picks them and takes them to her studio. ""I don't set everything up at once,"" she explains. ""I take one flower out and paint it, which might take a few days, and then I bring in another one to add to the painting. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.""

Her busiest time is spring and early summer when the tulips bloom, followed by the poppies. ""They all come out together, and you're so busy,"" she says. However, she also finds beauty in the gradual decay of the flowers. For example, with tulips, ""you bring them in and put them in water, then leave them for a day, and they each change into different shapes. They open up and look amazing. When you first put them in a vase, they seem dull, but they keep changing with twists and turns.""

Susan has always loved plants: ""I studied botany in school and used to collect wildflowers from the countryside,"" she says. ""I wasn't really interested in gardening back then; in fact, I didn't like garden flowers. I thought they looked like the fake ones sold in some flower shops - to me, the only real flowers were wild ones. I was fascinated by how they could grow in tough places, like cracks in rocks or on cliff tops.""

Today, her garden includes many plants from distant lands, but they seem just as comfortable in her garden as they do in China or the Himalayas. She has a relaxed attitude towards the garden, like a caring aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don't cause serious trouble. With two upcoming exhibitions to prepare for and plenty of subjects right outside her door, finding time to work in the garden has been challenging lately. She now hires an extra gardener, but despite needing to paint, she knows that to stay connected with her subjects, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""

Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex, shares her experiences as a chalet girl in Val d'Isère, France. This is her second year in this role, where she cooks and cleans for visitors who come to ski and stay in wooden houses called chalets. Sarah graduated last summer from Oxford Brookes University with a degree in French and History of Art. She views being a chalet girl as a fun way to spend a year or two before starting a more permanent job. ""It's a good way to meet successful people,"" she says.

Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to work. She has her own breakfast before preparing breakfast for the guests, which includes porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants. After breakfast, around 9:30 a.m., she cleans up and either makes afternoon tea for the guests or cleans the rooms, which she finds the least enjoyable part of her job. By 11 a.m., she is ready to ski and enjoys being on the slopes until about 4:30 p.m.

After skiing, Sarah returns to the chalet to prepare dinner. She takes a shower first but avoids sleeping, as she believes it makes her feel worse. Dinner, which is a three-course meal, is served at 8 p.m., and coffee is usually ready by 10 p.m. After dinner, she cleans the kitchen, as she dislikes coming back to a messy space the next morning. Sometimes she chats with the guests, but other times they prefer privacy. ""Good guests can make a week wonderful,"" she notes, while acknowledging that some weeks are more challenging.

Sarah lives in the chalet with friends, and they often go out around 11 p.m. They usually start their night at a place called Bananas, then might go to G Jay's and finish at Dick's T-Bar. However, she avoids staying out too late on Saturday nights because Sundays are her busiest days. ""It's a tough day,"" she says, ""especially when I have to cook breakfast early.""

On Sundays, breakfast for guests must be ready by 7 a.m. After the guests leave, Sarah quickly cleans the chalet, clearing breakfast and changing the beds. If she hasn't done the shopping for the week on Saturday, she does it on Sunday. By around 3 p.m., after finishing the cleaning, she prepares tea for the new guests who arrive around 4:30 p.m. Sometimes they seem confused and have many questions, which she finds amusing.

Between tea and dinner, Sarah helps guests who need ski equipment by taking them to the ski shop and getting a ride back to the chalet. Soon, it’s time for dinner again, and she may chat with friends, but sometimes she is too tired and goes to bed early."

Mandie Currie, a zoo-keeper, spent a day at the magazine Marie Claire. ""Choosing what to wear for my day at Marie Claire was difficult because I usually wear a uniform at work. First, I went to a photo studio, then to press previews, all before lunch. The zoo is a calm place, and here I was rushing around when I could be quietly cuddling an animal. Some members of the fashion team seemed stressed, but my job is not very pressurized. At a fashion shoot in the afternoon, I laughed thinking that I would usually be cleaning cages or handling rats. I am interested in how magazines work, but I really enjoy my job at the zoo, so I will stay there.""

Alice Cutler, a fashion assistant at Marie Claire, spent a day at London Zoo. ""I arrived at the zoo in my leather boots and dark blue trousers. The zoo gave me a green polo shirt to work in, which was good because I got very dirty. As I stroked one of the elephants, I thought Mandie would probably be packing clothes in a cupboard. By five o'clock, I smelled bad, but I had a great day. When I retire from fashion, I could see myself working with elephants, maybe in Africa.""

Karen Hodson, a nurse at Hammersmith Hospital, worked with the television gardening program Ground Force. ""I was very excited to meet the team, and Alan Titchmarsh, the presenter, was really nice. I enjoyed being in the fresh air because I sometimes don’t see daylight due to my shifts. Even though it was hard work, it was fun. I thought I was strong, but I felt weak compared to the rest of the team. My idea of gardening did not include hard physical work or careful planning. I am more enthusiastic than effective, so I don’t plan to quit my other job.""

Charlie Dimmock, a landscape gardener with Ground Force, worked a shift at Hammersmith Hospital. ""I made beds and handed out tablets. I thought I would faint doing some tasks, but I surprised myself by managing well. The friendship among the nurses is great, and it felt very friendly compared to my usual male environment. I feel my job is less important than nursing. My day at the hospital was not pleasant, but it gave me a great sense of satisfaction.""

Lucy Harvey, a personal trainer, spent a day with Ryanair as cabin crew. ""I changed into the uniform, and as soon as I put it on, I felt different—people looked up to me. Before the flight, our supervisor talked about safety and what to do if someone had a heart attack, which I knew from my fitness training. When the passengers boarded the flight to Paris, I handed out magazines. Everyone stared at me, and I felt very self-conscious. On the return journey, we had 80 schoolchildren on board who wouldn’t sit still. I wished I was back in the gym with one sensible adult to manage them.""

Sonia McDermott, an air hostess with Ryanair, spent a day as a personal trainer in a gym. ""I was nervous about this swap because I don’t exercise. I was surprised by how much attention you give to one person. In my job, I meet 130 passengers four times a day. At lunch, I was surprised to see that some trainers didn’t eat very healthily, but they all drink a lot of water. I wouldn’t change my job for this, but it has inspired me to join a gym and try to be healthier."""

**A. Andrea Thompson - Newsreader**  
I fell in love with the south of France a long time ago and try to visit as often as I can. There is a local train from Cannes along the coast that crosses into Italy. It takes you past some of the most beautiful sea views. No matter the weather or the time of year, it is always magical. Out of the other window, you can see some of the best gardens and homes in France. It feels like you are peeking into the lives of the rich and famous. The passengers are always lively, with a mix of tourists and locals, all enjoying the stunning journey.

**Raj Patel - Explorer**  
I have had many great train journeys, but my favorite is the Nile Valley Express, which travels across the northern Sudan desert. When I was young in South Africa, I missed a family train trip from Cape Town to the Kruger National Park because I was considered too young and troublesome. I was sent to stay with an aunt. When I moved to England as a teenager, I still hadn’t traveled by train. London Waterloo was the first real station I ever saw, and its large glass dome amazed me.

**Betty Cooper - Novelist**  
I am grateful to one train in particular: the Blue Train, which took my husband and me on our honeymoon across France to catch a boat to Egypt. On the train, my husband gave me a pink dress, which I thought was wonderful. Someone said that pink is good for the brain, and I have worn it ever since. What I remember most about the journey is how lovely it was to travel through France and then by boat up the Nile. It was the perfect way to relax after all the wedding planning.

**Martin Brown - Journalist**  
We were working on a series of articles about a round-the-world trip and had to cross a desert in Africa. There was no road, so we had to take the Desert Express. The schedule was unreliable; we were just given a day. We heard that the driver would often wait for days to leave if he knew people were still coming. When the train arrived, there was a rush of people climbing into and onto the carriages—some even traveled on the roof for free. At night, the train passed through some of the most beautiful landscapes I have ever seen. It felt like a dream, like traveling across the moon.

**Arisu Mezuki - Actress**  
I think most people form their favorite memories of trains when they are young, but that’s not true for me. I grew up in Singapore and Cyprus, where I saw very few trains and hardly traveled on them. It wasn’t until I was a teenager that trains became important in my life. I made a film that featured a railway in Yorkshire. Most of the filming took place on an old, unused part of the line that volunteers had carefully maintained. That’s where my love for steam trains began. When we weren’t filming, we took every chance to ride the train, and when I returned last year, it felt like time had stopped. Everything was still there, even the gas lights on the station platform!"
FCE_8,"Text: 'Want to get published? If you’re unsure where to send your story, our expert Margaret Stubbs has some helpful advice. Many readers of this magazine ask, ""I have written a story/book. Who should I send it to?"" One important thing to know is that you need to research your markets and learn about publishers while also improving your writing skills. Turning your words into something that can be sold requires a good understanding of the ""writing game."" No matter what type of writing you do, you should learn about the markets you want to reach. There are several ways to do this, but the best way is to read as much relevant material as you can. Visit your local library and explore nearby bookstores and newsagents. Reading widely will help you understand what kinds of writing publishers are currently accepting. This knowledge needs to be updated regularly since new publications are always appearing—editors change jobs, and magazines change focus. Publishers are always looking for new talent, so as writers, we must provide what they want. 

At first, you might be unsure about what to write. For example, if you think you want to write short love stories, the first step is to find out which magazines publish love stories, a limited market these days, and get recent copies of those magazines. Then, learn about the types of stories they are buying and who their readers are. These readers will have different expectations, and the editor wants to meet those needs. Writers often send me their stories asking, ""This has been rejected three times—am I wasting my time? Do I have a chance?"" As a former teacher, I would never discourage anyone, but it’s unlikely that the work is ready for publication. I try to give honest feedback while remaining positive. The issue is that many new writers are too eager to submit their work, often before they are ready. If you have only written one story or article, it is very unlikely to be published. This almost never happens. When you read about someone’s ""success,"" you usually find that they have been in publishing or journalism for years before achieving that success.

When you finally send out your work for the first time, start writing more while you wait for a response; write ten more stories, or even twenty. Each one will be better than the last, and you will start to see yourself as a writer, which will boost your fluency and confidence. Don’t discard any of your work—improve it instead. I also recommend not sharing your work with others, especially in the early stages. Remember, every successful writer has faced many rejections before succeeding. Do everything you can to advance your writing career. Look for a creative writing course nearby. If there isn’t one, consider joining a local writers' group to gain ideas and confidence from other aspiring writers. Think of yourself as a writer and practice writing every day if possible.'"

On the last day of a difficult year, I was leaning against a pillar in the Baltimore train station, waiting for the 10:10 train to Philadelphia. There were more people waiting than I had expected. The usual clean and bright feeling of the station was gone. Elderly couples with matching luggage filled the benches, and groups of college students had left their bags on the floor. A grey-haired man was walking around, talking to different strangers one by one. He looked well-off: tanned skin, nice sweater, and a soft beige coat. He approached a woman sitting alone and asked her a question. Then he came over to a girl near me. She had long blond hair, and I thought I wouldn’t mind talking to her. The man asked, ""Are you traveling to Philadelphia?"" 

""Well, northbound, yes,"" she replied. ""But to Philadelphia?"" 

""No, New York, but I'll be..."" 

""Thanks, anyway,"" he said, moving to the next bench. Now he had my full attention. ""Ma'am,"" I heard him ask an old lady, ""are you traveling to Philadelphia?"" When she said, ""Wilmington,"" he just walked on to a couple with matching luggage. I straightened up from my pillar and moved closer, pretending to look at the platform. I was going to Philadelphia. He could have asked me. I understood why he didn’t; I probably seemed unreliable. He glanced at me quickly and then went to the other end of the waiting area. He looked stressed now. 

""Please!"" he said to a woman reading a book. ""Tell me you're going to Philadelphia!"" She looked up from her book. She was in her thirties, maybe thirty-five—older than me. A schoolteacher type. ""Philadelphia?"" she said. ""Yes, I am."" 

""Then could I ask you a favor?"" I stood a few feet away, pretending to check my wrist (even though I didn’t have a watch). I could tell she was becoming cautious. The man must have noticed too, because he said, ""Nothing too difficult, I promise!"" They were announcing my train now. People started moving toward Gate E, older couples pulling their wheeled bags behind them like pets on leashes. 

Next, I heard the man talking. ""My daughter is flying out this afternoon for a study year abroad, leaving from Philadelphia. I put her on a train this morning, stopped for groceries, and came home to find my wife upset. She hardly said 'hello' to me. My daughter forgot her passport. She called from the station in Philadelphia; she didn’t know what to do."" The woman nodded sympathetically. I would have stayed quiet and waited to see where he was going with this. 

""So I told her to stay put. Stay right there in the station, I said, and I would get someone to bring her passport."" I thought this was a strange story. Why didn’t he go himself if it was such an emergency? ""Why don’t you go yourself?"" the woman asked. 

""I can’t leave my wife alone for that long. She’s in a wheelchair."" I thought this was a weak excuse. It seemed like too much bad luck for one family. I looked at them. The man was holding a packet, not a plain envelope, but a padded one the size of a paperback book. Aha! Padded! So you couldn’t feel what was inside! And from where I stood, it looked stapled shut. Watch yourself, lady, I thought silently."

John Moore, the owner of a restaurant, talks about his relationship with his son Gary, who is a well-known TV chef. He believes everyone has a chance in life. Gary had his chance with cooking, and John had his chance to run a restaurant. When John learned about a restaurant for sale, he quickly went to see it. The place was in very poor condition, but it was just what he needed. Starting this business reminded him of his childhood. He remembered how his mother worked in a factory, and he felt sad being left alone. Because of this, he wanted to make time for family. His wife took care of the children and managed the finances while John ran the restaurant. They lived above the restaurant and always made sure to have meals together. This focus on family helped their children, Gary and Joe, become very confident. From a young age, they would talk to the regular customers, which gave them a good start in life.

Gary was a lively child. When he was about seven, he jumped into a corner bath like it was a swimming pool and accidentally knocked himself out. As he grew older, he had to earn pocket money. He started with small jobs and by age ten, he was working in the kitchen every weekend, which meant he had plenty of money at school. He was disciplined and often woke up before his father. In a family business, everyone helps out, and John enjoyed seeing Gary contribute. Although Gary was not very good at school, he excelled in the kitchen. By age 15, he was as skilled as the adult chefs and sometimes even managed the kitchen. He could prepare over a hundred meals, and John knew Gary would pursue a career in catering because of his talent.

When Gary needed to do work experience for school, John sent him to a friend’s restaurant. Recently, Gary started playing the drums and formed his own band. John wonders what will happen to Gary’s cooking if his music career takes off. He advised Gary to focus on one goal, saying, ""If you chase two hares, you catch neither."" John also told him, ""If you want to achieve something in life, you need to do it by age 30. After that, it’s too late."" 

At 17, Gary went to catering college. On his first day, while other students struggled, Gary quickly chopped vegetables and sliced meats, finishing his work in just an hour. He even helped his classmates. No one can believe how successful Gary’s TV cooking show has become, and John is very proud of him. He always tells Gary that hard work is necessary to achieve anything because nothing is given for free. Gary recognized the opportunity he had and took full advantage of it. John reflects that as children grow, parents can only hope they remember some of the advice given. He feels that Gary must have listened at times, given the things he says and does."

Finding a good flat in Dublin that you could afford was very difficult. The best way to find one was through personal connections: if you knew someone who knew someone leaving a place, that often helped. But if, like Jo, you had just arrived in Dublin, you had no personal contacts to tell you about available rooms. So, Jo had to stay in a hostel and search for a flat. For her, Dublin felt like a big unknown. She felt nervous when she took the train to work there. She didn’t question why she was going; everyone at school expected her to leave. Who would stay in a small town? That’s all she had heard for years. Her friends wanted to escape, experience life, and have a real existence. Some of her classmates had moved to towns like Ennis or Limerick, where family helped them settle in. But none of Jo's classmates were going to Dublin. She was going alone.

Jo's mother thought it would be great if she stayed permanently in the hostel run by nuns, believing it was safe. Her father hoped the hostel was warm, as they were often cold. Jo's sisters, who worked as waitresses, thought she was crazy for staying a whole week in a hostel. But Jo didn’t know they were still talking about her as she answered an advertisement for a flat in Ringsend. It said, ""Own room, own television, share kitchen, bathroom."" It was very close to the post office where she worked and seemed too good to be true. She hoped it would be nice, that they would like her, and that it wouldn’t be too expensive! 

There wasn’t a line for this flat because it was more about needing a ""Third Girl"" than just a flat to rent. The mention of ""own television"" made Jo wonder if it was too fancy for her, but the house looked normal—an ordinary red-brick house with a basement. The flat was upstairs. A cheerful girl with a college scarf, clearly a failed applicant, was coming down the stairs. ""Desperate place,"" she told Jo. ""They're both awful. Common as dirt."" 

""Oh,"" Jo replied and continued up the stairs. ""Hello,"" said the girl with ""Nessa"" on her T-shirt. ""Did you see that stuck-up girl leaving? I can’t stand that kind."" 

""What did she do?"" Jo asked. 

""Do? She didn’t have to do anything. She just looked around, made a face, giggled, and said, 'Is this all there is? Oh dear, oh dear,' in a posh accent. We wouldn’t want her here, would we, Pauline?"" 

Pauline, wearing a very colorful shirt, was a punk, which surprised Jo. She had seen punks on O'Connell Street but had never talked to one. ""I’m Jo, I work in the post office and I called about the flat."" 

Nessa said they were about to have tea. She brought out three mugs; one had ""Nessa,"" one had ""Pauline,"" and the last one had ""Other"" written on it. ""We’ll put your name on one if you come to stay,"" she said kindly."
FCE_43,"**Text: Behind the Dolphin's Smile**

People love dolphins. We enjoy watching them in seaside marinas, movies, and TV shows. However, according to the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society, dolphins are in serious trouble. Mark Simmonds reports on the decline of these animals.

Dolphins are special to us. They are among the smartest animals, sensitive to human feelings, and they inspire us with dreams of freedom in the ocean. Our affection for dolphins has been supported by television shows. First, there was Flipper, and now there is Darwin from Seaquest. But these happy images hide the harsh reality of dolphins living in polluted and overfished seas.

The population of North Sea harbour porpoises, a type of dolphin, has decreased by up to 89,000. You might think that such beloved animals would be protected by law and cared for in marine reserves. Unfortunately, this is not true, and the lack of protection could lead to a major wildlife disaster.

There are forty different types of dolphins worldwide. In northern Europe, the most common are the striped dolphin, the common dolphin, the bottlenose dolphin, and the smaller harbour porpoise. The striped and common dolphins usually live far out in the open sea and are seen only in small groups. We know very little about them. Bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises were once often seen near European coasts. Bottlenose dolphins are very social and used to be found along the Channel coast and in rivers in Britain, including the Thames. Now, they can only be found in a few places, like the Moray Firth in Scotland and Cardigan Bay in Wales. The few that remain show signs of stress, such as skin injuries.

The complex behavior of dolphins makes it hard to understand why their numbers are decreasing. Overfishing is greatly reducing fish populations and threatening local fishing industries, which also endangers porpoises and dolphins. Porpoises need to find food quickly, and if fish are removed from one area, they may not survive long enough to find food elsewhere. They can also get caught in fishermen's nets, which they cannot see. Many modern fishing methods use large nets that are either left floating or pulled quickly through the water. In recent years, hundreds of dead dolphins have washed up on the beaches of France and Cornwall. Marks and cuts on their bodies show that they died after being caught in these nets.

Pollution in the sea can also harm dolphins. For example, pesticides can build up in their bodies because they dissolve in fat. Female dolphins produce milk that contains these harmful substances, which can poison their young. There is already one recorded case of a young dolphin dying from its mother’s milk.

Another serious threat to dolphins comes from human activity. Dolphins live in groups and rely on sound to understand their environment. Noise pollution from ships and oil drilling travels much better in water than in air, which may disturb dolphins in ways we do not fully understand."
FCE_51,"**Text: GETTING FIT**

Exercise is important for your mind, body, and spirit. It helps you stay balanced, especially when life feels chaotic. You might be tired of hearing about fitness, but there are many good reasons to exercise, and very few reasons not to. 

Exercise improves your muscle tone and can quickly change your body shape. It makes your muscles stronger and helps you maintain good posture, which is how you hold your body when sitting or standing. It also helps prevent muscle imbalances that can lead to injuries. Additionally, exercise can improve specific areas like your thighs, stomach, and upper arms. It benefits your heart, lungs, and blood circulation.

You may have heard these benefits before, but here’s something new: exercise can help reduce feelings of depression and tiredness, and it can help you sleep better. It also helps manage stress and can relieve some medical conditions. 

If you’re not convinced yet, just think about it—exercise is good for you. There are many types of exercise you can try, such as aerobics, jogging, or using weights. However, be careful not to overdo it, as training too hard can cause injuries. If you’re unsure about what exercises are right for you, it’s a good idea to talk to your doctor.

Good posture is essential for improving your body shape. If you have poor posture, it can make you look and feel less energetic and can lead to health issues. To improve your posture, imagine that a helium balloon is pulling the top of your head up towards the sky. This can help you lift your chest for better breathing and make your body look slimmer.

Stretching your muscles is also important. It improves flexibility and helps you move easily, which can prevent injuries. If you stretch four or five times a week, you will become more flexible and fit. Stretching should be a key part of your exercise routine, and it should be done slowly and carefully.

The best exercise routine includes a warm-up, stretching, an energetic workout, and a cool-down period."

What keeps filmmakers Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman away from their homes for months? They are searching for the perfect shot. Among all the animals in the jungles and plains of East Africa, two of the hardest to find are Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman. They are currently in the Ngorongoro Crater, which has experienced six months of almost continuous rain, leading to many unexpected problems. Newman explained that they had to buy an expensive piece of equipment so that if one of their vehicles gets stuck in the mud, Amanda can pull him back to safety. Their partnership has produced some of the best wildlife films on TV, including a well-received film about leopards. While this film was being shown, they were already back in the field, this time tracking the shy jackal.

Traveling filmmakers have been exploring the world to film exotic wildlife since television began. I spoke to Newman during one of his rare meetings with other people at a safari lodge. ""We do have occasional arguments, but we usually resolve them quickly,"" he said about working with Amanda. Neither sees themselves as the leader, and they get along well because they view the animals similarly. ""When we travel, we set up our tents each night. But this time we have a more fixed camp, so we make tea the night before and keep it warm in a vacuum flask."" Their daily meals consist of pre-packed food that is heated and served by whoever is available. ""It's not unusual for us to be out for up to eight weeks, so cooking can be stressful,"" Newman said. 

It can be a tough life, but being in remote areas allows them to get close to the animals. Newman recalled filming a family of lions, where one lioness would often wander off. When she returned, she would greet all the pride members, and eventually, she included their vehicle in her greetings. 

Newman first worked with Barrett in 1988 on a film called ""The Great Rift,"" and two years later, they began filming Arctic foxes together. Since then, they have learned to spend four months on location to gather enough material for each half-hour film. Before they can start, they must submit a script for approval. ""Amanda and I developed a strong working relationship from the beginning,"" Newman said, ""because we shared the same ideas and vision. We aim to create a film that captures the true spirit of the place and the animals, and that touches people's hearts. I believe evoking an emotional response is more powerful than just appealing to logic."""
FCE_14,"**The Netball Captain**

In our series about women in sports, Suzie Ellis met England's netball captain, Kendra Slawinski. Kendra is the captain of the England netball team. When I met her, she had just finished a typical day of teaching at a local school, followed by a training session in a supermarket car park. I was surprised by her training location. I asked her, ""Don't you get strange looks?"" She replied, ""I'm so focused on my movements and my feet that I don't notice much else. I might see cars slow down out of the corner of my eye, but that's it.""

Kendra said, ""My whole life now is about being at my best for the Championships."" She follows a strict schedule to achieve maximum fitness. This will be her fourth World Championships, and it is expected to be the largest ever, with 27 countries participating. ""We will have home support, which is very special,"" she said. ""It's important to improve the reputation of netball in this country. Playing at home means there will be more pressure than usual. The crowd will have expectations and provide more support. People expect us to start the tournament with a strong game.""

Their first match is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. ""As far as I know, we have always beaten them, but they will be exciting to play against. They have a lot of talent."" The England team is currently ranked fourth in the world. However, Kendra notes that the World Championships will be challenging. ""You have to push yourself to play every day; there is no break between games like in a series. You can still win a series if you lose the first game, but the Championships are different because you only get one chance, and you must be ready to take advantage of it.""

In the fifteen years since she started playing at a high level, the sport has become tougher and faster. Players are more aggressive on the court. ""You don't train hard to lose,"" Kendra says. ""But once the final whistle blows, you become a different person. We are all friendlier after the game.""

Netball is also using a more scientific approach to fitness testing. ""It is essential that we all think and train like world-class players,"" Kendra explains. As captain, she believes it is important to have a strong mental attitude and to lead by example. ""I see my role as supporting and encouraging the rest of the team.""

Kendra says, ""From the very beginning, my netball career has been carefully planned."" She decided some time ago that this competition would be her last as a player. She will likely coach young players in the future, but for now, she is focused on her final big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she will probably have tears in her eyes, knowing her loyal supporters are with her every step of the way."

Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends a lot of time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She teaches and researches marine geochemistry, which means she studies the chemical processes in the sea. Rachel is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she is not teaching, she gets into a small steel vehicle designed for underwater exploration and dives three kilometers down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes. 

""Inside,"" she says, ""the space is so small that I can reach out and touch the two pilots. They are used to these conditions, which means we can't stand up or move, and we must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last for 16 hours: three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours collecting samples of rock and water, and then three hours to return to the surface.""

""If something goes wrong and you need to get to the top quickly, you can hit a panic button. The outside drops away, leaving a small escape vessel that is released, and it rises quickly to the surface. No one has tested it yet, but I don't think it would be a pleasant journey.""

""I didn't know how I would react the first time I climbed into the vehicle. It was on the deck of a ship, and I got in with an instructor. He explained the emergency procedures, including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack! They were testing how I would react in such a small space."" 

Now Rachel has made six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian crew. ""We went to a site that was a five-day sail west of the Canary Islands in the Atlantic. Here, on the ocean floor, there is a large area of underwater volcanoes, with their chimneys blowing out black smoke. It is where the Atlantic Ocean comes alive. The Russian team was dropping off scientific equipment to study the effects of a program that would create a hole 150 meters through a volcano.""

When she is not at sea, Rachel is in her office at the Oceanography Centre in Southampton. ""Two-thirds of my salary comes from teaching, which I love, but I do it so I can continue my research on the 'black smokers.' This is another name for underwater volcanoes—water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke. This flows out at a rate of one meter per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees.""

""The only time I was scared was when I first went down with the Americans. We were towing equipment on a 50-meter rope when suddenly there was an explosion. There was a huge bang as the shock waves hit our vehicle, and I thought, 'I'm going to die.' We looked at each other in silence, waiting. When nothing happened, we couldn't believe it. The relief was incredible—we were still alive!""

""Diving to the deepest part of the ocean is such an adventure. Every time I look out of the porthole and see those chimneys, I feel a sense of wonder. Here I am at the bottom of the sea, and no one else on this planet has ever seen them before. I studied the black smokers for three years for my Ph.D. When I got down there and saw them for real, it was an amazing feeling."""
FCE_56,"**Interview Tips**

First impressions are very important. Research shows that people form opinions about us within the first few minutes of meeting. They notice how we dress, our eye contact, our body language, and how we speak, including our speed, volume, and tone, as well as the words we use.

Mary Pearce studied to be a teacher. She worked hard to earn her degree and felt confident when she graduated. She applied for a job at a nearby primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher. On the day of the interview, she noticed a small hole in her jacket. She thought about changing but decided it would make her late, and she believes being on time is very important. Unfortunately, Mary did not get the job. A friend who teaches at the school told her that the Head Teacher said, ""If someone doesn't take the time to present her best image at an interview, what kind of teacher will she be?""

Simon Grant, a hotel manager, explains that interviewees who care about their appearance are more likely to care about their jobs. While many believe that what is inside matters most, it is important to present yourself well in an interview.

Janet Goodwood worked for ten years as an administrative assistant in a large accounting firm. When the office manager retired, she applied for the position but did not get an interview. She thought it was a mistake and asked the Director of Personnel what happened. He told her she did not fit the image of an office manager and suggested she improve her wardrobe before applying again. Janet was shocked because she believed her work performance should matter more than her appearance.

Movement and gestures also affect an interviewer's first impression. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian found that only 7% of our message about feelings comes from the words we use, 38% from our voice, and a surprising 55% from our facial expressions. When our facial expressions and words send different messages, the listener will pay more attention to the non-verbal message. Therefore, it is important that your words match your body language. Mixed messages can confuse the interviewer.

It is also important not to seem too desperate for the job or overly eager to please. Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, applied for a promotion and had a great interview, leading to an immediate job offer. She was very happy but showed too much excitement. Once her boss sensed her enthusiasm, he offered her a lower salary than she expected. She believes she could have negotiated a better salary if she had controlled her excitement.

Finally, what we say and how we say it can greatly affect the success of an interview. David Artesio, a manager of an employment agency, suggests learning about the company before the interview. For example, the annual report can provide information about the company's activities. Mentioning an area of interest during the interview can create a positive impression and show your interest in the company. Business consultant Marian Woodall advises having a few questions ready and avoiding long, confusing sentences. She states, ""Poor communicators talk in paragraphs. Successful communicators talk in short sentences and key points."""

**The Farmer**  
Matt Froggatt used to work as an insurance agent in London, but now he runs a sheep farm. ""After 14 years in the business, I found that working in the City was no longer exciting; it became a grind. I had planned to stay for another five or ten years, but then I was unexpectedly made redundant. I didn’t receive a great pay-off, but it was enough to start the farm. My big break came when I met the head chef of a local hotel with one of the best restaurants in the country. By supplying them, my reputation grew, and now I also sell meat through mail order. I’m happy to be out of the office, but it’s surprising how little has changed for me: I still work 80 to 90 hours a week and sell a product.""

**The Painter**  
Ron Able White was a manager in advertising, but now he makes a living as an artist. ""I started painting as a hobby, but I found it much more exciting than my job. Choosing to take redundancy and become an artist felt like the right decision. The career counselor I spoke to was very supportive. I think I was the first person to tell him, 'I don’t want to go back to my old job.' He was surprised because most people in their mid-forties need to find work quickly for financial reasons. My wife and I married young, and our children no longer need our support. It was a leap into the unknown. We moved to the north of England, where we didn’t know anyone. We left our friends behind, but we’ve been lucky; many of them visit us now.""

**The Hat Maker**  
After working for five years as a company lawyer, Katherine Goodison started her own business in her London flat, making hats for private clients. ""My job as a lawyer was enjoyable and well-paid, but the hours were terrible. I realized I didn’t want to become a senior partner, working even more hours, so I left. Many people said I would get bored, but that has never happened. The key is to have deadlines. Since it’s a fashion business, there are always collections and new designs to work on, so I have to keep a strict schedule. I feel happier now and much less stressed. However, I miss the social interaction with colleagues. What I love about this job is that I am fully responsible for the product. If I do a poor job, I am the one who faces the consequences. Of course, you care when working for a company, but when your name is on the promotional material, you care even more.""

**The Masseur**  
Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16 years before becoming a masseur at the Life Centre in London. ""I had been in financial markets since I was 22, setting up deals. I enjoyed the excitement, but I never found the work fulfilling. I almost lost my job in 1989, but I left voluntarily and traveled for a year. During that year, I tried to figure out what I wanted to do. I was interested in health, so I visited some of the best gyms in the world and spoke to the owners about how they started. I knew I needed qualifications to change careers, so I took various massage courses. Then I was offered part-time work at the Life Centre. I have no regrets. I used to feel out of control, but now I have peace of mind and control over my future. That is the best part."""
FCE_6,"**Text: 'Dedicated to Their Sports'**

Four young athletes share their experiences.

**A. Darius (Runner)**  
I have always been active in sports. I tried many sports, but I was best at football and athletics. When I was 14, I tried out for a professional football team, but I chose to focus on athletics instead. My biggest achievement was competing for my country in the youth team and winning a medal. Unfortunately, it did not get much media attention, which was disappointing. I hoped to get some sponsorship because training can be expensive. I train at home all winter and then go to Florida for three weeks before the season starts. It’s enjoyable there with great facilities and nightlife. However, I must be disciplined. If friends invite me out the night before training, I have to decline. I wish I could go, but dedication is important in this sport. My main goal is to compete in the next Olympics—that would be amazing.

**B. Gabriel (Surfer)**  
The surfing community is small, so I often see the same people at competitions. Professional surfers take their sport seriously, and the best waves are usually at dawn, so I have to avoid late-night parties. I don’t mind this too much, but I do enjoy sleeping in, which I often have to give up. However, it is worth it because my dedication helped me win the National Championships last year. After a win, I always celebrate with a big night out, and if I win money, I treat myself to a nice getaway. The sacrifices are worthwhile because winning that championship led to me hosting a surfing series on TV. I guess I’m a bit of a celebrity now.

**C. Dieter (Yacht Racer)**  
Being on a boat with five guys is always fun. We have a traditional way of celebrating our wins. Some say we act a bit childish when we celebrate, but we don’t seek media attention. Sometimes, reporters seem more interested in our celebrations than our race results. I spend eight months a year away, so it’s nice to return home and hang out with friends from different backgrounds. You can’t focus on the sport all the time; it’s not healthy. I am known in the sailing world, but I can count how many times I’ve been recognized in public on one hand. I wouldn’t want to be a celebrity. I do receive many nice letters from fans asking for signed pictures, and I make sure to reply to each one, even if it takes time.

**D. Tomas (Tennis Player)**  
It feels great to walk onto the court and feel the support of the crowd. At my last tournament, things got a bit hectic with fans crowding around. Still, I enjoy being recognized by fans when I’m out shopping. However, it has its challenges. My last girlfriend didn’t like it when I received too much attention from female fans. Tennis players travel a lot, and that’s part of why we broke up. It was tough, but sacrifices are necessary in any sport; you must be serious and professional. I’m focused on my game now and plan to enjoy other aspects of life after I retire, which comes early in this sport."
FCE_33,"**Text: Young Shoppers**

Shopping in supermarkets with children can be very challenging for parents. One mother explains, ""They want everything they see. If it’s not the latest sugary cereal, it’s a Disney video or a comic. Usually, they want all three. I can’t afford all this, and if I give in to their requests, I feel guilty about buying unhealthy food. I hate saying no all the time, and I get anxious before we even leave home. I try to avoid taking them shopping, but then I worry that I’m not letting them learn how to make their own choices. It’s a tough situation.""

Research shows that children ask for something to buy every two minutes when they are in a supermarket. Over £150 million is spent each year on advertising aimed directly at children, mostly on television. This amount is expected to grow, and supermarkets are where this advertising is most effective. Children often do not understand why their parents say they cannot buy certain things, and arguments about the dangers of sugar are not convincing when compared to attractive advertisements.

Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, ""Most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, but these ideas are not always correct. It’s important for parents and children to talk about food, because if children only hear about products from TV ads, they get a very one-sided view. Parents feel frustrated because they are competing with the advertising industry and often have to disappoint their children.""

The Independent Television Commission, which oversees TV advertising, does not allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy products. However, Dibb notes, ""The goal of advertising is to persuade people to buy things. So even if they can’t say, 'Tell your mom to buy this,' that is still the effect.""

Shopping with children can be stressful for parents because they have to decide which requests to agree to and which to refuse. One mother says she is patient when discussing food with her children, but she feels unhappy about how she handles their shopping requests: ""My son pays attention to ads but is critical of them. We talk a lot about different products and look at labels together. I’ve talked about it so much that he thinks all ads are bad. Now, we have very little conflict in the supermarket because the children don’t ask for things I don’t want to buy.""

Parents also admit they can be inconsistent in their responses to their children’s requests. Mike, a father of a seven-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter, says, ""We refuse to buy him sweets because we say they are bad for him, but we load our trolley with cream and chocolate for ourselves. It’s nice to buy good things, and it’s normal for children to want to share that. But I still get annoyed by their requests. It depends on my mood. If I’m feeling good, I’m more likely to say yes. It’s hard to be consistent.""

Supermarkets could help reduce conflicts between parents and children by removing sweets from checkout areas or providing supervised play areas. Although parents might spend less if their children are not with them, the idea of shopping without their children’s demands could attract enough extra customers to make up for it."
FCE_20,"**Text: Five-Star Luxury and Modern Technology**

The new five-star Merrion Hotel in Dublin combines luxury with the latest technology. It was created after extensive research into what customers want and nearly two years of work converting four large 18th-century houses. This approach allowed for the installation of advanced technology that benefits both staff and guests.

General Manager Peter MacCann expects his staff to know guests by name, but he uses a computer system to track guests' preferences. This system helps the hotel provide special treatment for returning guests. Although it cost £250,000 to install, MacCann believes it will be worth it over time due to its efficiency. For instance, if a guest requests specific music CDs during their first stay, those same CDs will be ready for them on their next visit, thanks to the guest-history feature.

Room temperature is a common complaint among hotel guests. At the Merrion, a high-tech system allows guests to adjust the temperature within three degrees of the normal 18°C. Additionally, the front desk can change the temperature in each room between 14°C and 25°C.

Business travelers are a significant part of the hotel's clientele, making up to 65% of its business. To cater to their needs, the hotel has equipped each room with three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that also works as a photocopier and printer, and video-conferencing capabilities. The hotel has also prepared for future technological advancements by laying extra cables and renting televisions, allowing for easy upgrades.

Despite all this technology, MacCann emphasizes that they want guests to feel comfortable, not overwhelmed. The hotel has 145 spacious and well-furnished bedrooms that are inviting. Guests can also enjoy a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a lovely garden.

The food at the Merrion is of high quality, as Chef Patrick Guilbaud, who has two Michelin stars, has moved his restaurant to the hotel.

Emma Marsden asked six women who live life fully to share how they find their energy.

A. **Jeanette Kupfermann, Journalist and Author:** ""I think excitement gives me energy. I need to be challenged and learn new things. Right now, I'm learning flamenco dancing, which is very energizing. If I'm bored, I feel drained. Being effective, even in small ways, boosts my energy.""

B. **Linda Kelsey, Magazine Editor:** ""I have a lot of work, but I enjoy it. Work is not a chore for me. When I get enough sleep, I feel great. I know exercise helps, but sometimes it's hard to find the energy to do it. I attend a yoga class weekly and try to work out at home. After exercising, I feel much better. I often feel low in the afternoon, so I think it's good to have a snack then.""

C. **Annie Nightingale, Disc Jockey:** ""I don't eat healthily for energy; I think it's my natural enthusiasm and positivity. I dislike negative people. I believe we should enjoy life and set goals. I love my job, and the last two years have been exciting. Being around lively young people energizes me. I enjoy taking photos and writing lyrics for fun, which helps me relax while traveling.""

D. **Floella Benjamin, Author and Children's TV Presenter:** ""My energy comes from doing things I enjoy. I believe in my work and being positive. I love working with kids; they are full of energy and resilience. Energy is like a natural spark that comes from connecting with others. Smiling at people can create a wonderful feeling. I try to eat healthily and avoid smoking and drinking, but I don't have a strict exercise routine. I get my energy from playing with kids.""

E. **Deborah Moggach, Author and Playwright:** ""What I love most is turning a wasteland into a garden. I once transformed a concrete area into a beautiful garden, which was more energizing than any workout. Knowing that someone wants to read my writing also gives me energy. I enjoy sneaking into nature, and if caught, I playfully say I didn't know it was private.""

F. **Katherine Monblot, Therapist:** ""I believe it's important to have an interest in what you do. I like taking risks and get bored easily, which keeps me motivated. Doing things I don't want to do drains my energy. I used to be part of many committees, but I found them exhausting. You have limited energy, so focus on what matters most to you."""
FCE_45,"**ICE SKATING**

Ice skating has been around for thousands of years. Archaeologists have found skates made from animal bones, which were used until iron was introduced to Scandinavia around 200 AD. Among the upper classes in Scandinavia, skating was considered an important skill. In the early 1900s, skating was seen as elegant and formal, but at the 1924 Winter Olympics, 11-year-old Sonja Henie brought a more athletic style that made skating very popular. Today, skating combines art and athleticism, making it both beautiful and physically challenging.

For beginners, balance and control are very important, and speed comes with practice. The way you position your body affects your balance. Keeping your legs slightly bent and your knees relaxed helps you stay centered, with your body leaning slightly forward. Relaxation is crucial in skating, more than in many other sports. To start, your heels should almost touch, and your feet should point outward. As you push forward with your back foot, make a small movement with the other foot. If you can maintain this for a while, you can gradually increase the length of your movements as you gain experience.

Learning how to fall is one of the first skills a skater should master. Even professional skaters fall sometimes. To fall safely, try to stay relaxed, which helps reduce the impact when you hit the ice. To get up, use your hands to kneel, then stand up. Once you feel confident moving on the ice, you can practice different styles, such as figure skating, freestyle, distance skating, speed skating, and pair skating. The best way to start is by learning figure skating and then basic freestyle.

With proper instruction available at most ice rinks, you can quickly learn the basic moves, and soon you will be able to do turns, jumps, and spins in freestyle. If you watch skilled skaters, you will notice how relaxed they are and how smoothly they move. To achieve this, it is important to follow a regular exercise program. Skating with a stiff body can be dangerous, so warm-up exercises should focus on your legs, back, shoulders, and especially your ankles and knees. After skating, do the same exercises to prevent stiffness.

Skating helps improve balance, coordination, relaxation, and movement. It also benefits your heart and lungs and strengthens your body. When combined with swimming or jogging, it creates an excellent program for overall health and fitness."

If there's one thing that can make you cry with joy, it's seeing a talented child receive a medal. Julia Gregson spoke to three young stars and their mothers about the joys and challenges of their lives.

A. Annika Reeder, 15, won a gold medal in gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games. She hopes to become a physiotherapist and compete in the next Olympics. ""The training is very hard right now. I don’t have time to watch TV, go out with friends, or do much besides gymnastics and school. I try to take it one day at a time, and when I feel really tired, my coach sometimes gives me a day off. But usually, I just keep going – you can’t take too many days off, or you get stiff.""

B. Annika's mother said, ""From a young age, Annika showed great talent. I’ve seen some parents try to push their kids, but it doesn’t work. To perform at Annika's level takes a lot of time and energy, and you have to want to do it yourself. People often tell me that we, as parents, have sacrificed a lot, but they don’t see what the sport has given us. We love it and what it has done for Annika. Before gymnastics, she was a very shy girl who hid behind me, but now she has met people from all over the world and gained confidence from her success.""

C. Sarah Stokes started show-jumping at age ten and has since won the British National Championship. ""It’s great that my parents love show-jumping because they train me and take me everywhere in the horse box. The shows can last from one to five days. I never get tired of it – I love show-jumping; it’s exciting and fun. Even if my parents weren’t involved, I would still do it because I am determined. I’m happy when they are proud of my wins, but I’m not doing it for them. This year, I want to qualify for the British young riders (under-18) team. My big dream is to win a gold medal at the Olympics.""

D. Sarah's mother said, ""From the moment Sarah sat on a horse at age one, I knew she had found her passion. When she was five, she would wake up early to exercise her pony. To qualify for major shows, we have to travel all over England. To save money, we sleep in the living quarters of our horse box. Sarah is very organized. She is completely happy on a horse and knows what she is doing. Watching your child succeed at something they love is an amazing feeling.""

E. Jane McShane, 10, is Britain’s Under-14 Chess Champion. ""Tournaments are really friendly. I know everyone, and it’s fun. When I play, I don’t focus as much as I should; I just look around and don’t think too much. I’m not worried about getting a big head; I don’t talk about my success at school because I don’t like to feel embarrassed.""

F. Jane's mother said, ""Jane played her first game when she was five. My father suggested we see if she liked it. He had tried to teach me when I was young, but I found it boring. Jane loved it from the start. By the end of that day, she had memorized all the moves, and by age six, she was beating adults. Of course, I’m happy when she wins, but if she wanted to stop playing tomorrow, I wouldn’t stop her. I also don’t want to hold her back because she is exceptional. If she has this talent, I want her to reach her full potential."""
FCE_29,"Text: 

It's true - we are all getting taller. Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy. The teacher jokingly asked, ""What do you want to be? The flagpole on a ship?"" This was funny because Chris was already almost two metres tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is the tallest man in Britain. 

Every decade, the average height of people in Europe increases by about one centimetre. More tall people are being born, but this does not mean we are becoming a super race. Instead, we are returning to how we were as cavemen. We are starting to lose the effects of many years of poor diet, which is having a big impact. Professor Chris Stringer, a palaeontologist, says, ""We are beginning to reach our true potential. We are becoming like Cro-Magnons, the people who lived on Earth 40,000 years ago.""

For most of human history, our ancestors had a varied diet. Women gathered herbs, fruits, and berries, while men hunted animals. One study found they ate from 85 different wild plants. However, about 9,000 years ago, agriculture began, which changed everything. Farmers took over many green areas, and now just three plants - wheat, rice, and maize - provide more than half of the calories we eat today. This limited diet has harmed our health. 

Over the years, we have mostly eaten soups, porridges, and breads, which have left us underfed. In a study in Ohio, scientists found that when they started growing corn, healthy hunter-gatherers became sickly farmers. Tooth decay and diseases increased. Corn, which was thought to be a blessing, turned out to be a health problem, according to some experts. 

Despite this, agriculture spread because one piece of farmed land could support many more people than hunting could. The issue of poor nutrition has only recently been addressed, even in wealthier countries. In Europe, the US, and Japan, diets are starting to reflect the variety of our ancestors' diets again. As a result, the average height of men is now 179 cm in the US, 180 cm in Holland, and 177 cm in Japan. This is a positive trend, but it comes with challenges. 

Although people are getting taller, the standard bed length has stayed at 190 cm since 1860. Legroom in planes and trains seems to have decreased, and clothing companies are constantly adjusting their sizes. The question is: how tall can we get? We cannot keep growing forever. Some scientists, like Robert Fogel, believe we could reach a height of 193 cm this century. 

However, there is a twist. While individuals may be growing taller due to better nutrition, as a species, we are actually getting smaller. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, humans were slightly rounder and taller to keep warm. As the climate warmed, we have become thinner and shorter, even when well-fed. If global warming continues, we may shrink even more. In other words, our growth could be affected by climate change."
FCE_57,"**Text: Studio Audiences**

What is it like to be in the audience when a television show is being made? Cosmo Landesman explored this question. Like technical problems, studio audiences are a common part of television, but many of us find them mysterious. When we see people getting excited on game shows, we often wonder: who are these people?

Studio audiences are often seen as the least important type of audience. Some people in television even look down on them, comparing them to cattle. I used to think that studio audiences were made up of silly people wanting a moment of fame. However, there is no typical studio audience. They come from different backgrounds, jobs, and income levels. Television shows try to attract various types of people for different programs.

Many of us who watch television at home don’t understand why anyone would want to be in a studio audience. Why would someone apply for tickets, travel far, and sit through hours of boredom just to watch something they can see at home? One idea is that people hope to be on television for a moment. I didn’t believe this until I spoke to Angela, who said she came for a chance to appear on TV. Another reason people attend is to see behind the scenes. However, the most common reason I heard was simply, ""A friend gave me a ticket.""

Few of us have been in a studio audience, yet we think we know what it is like. You sit close to strangers while someone holds up signs that say APPLAUD or LAUGH, and you respond accordingly. This may be true for some shows, but not all. As one studio manager said, ""We believe a show should be good enough not to need these signs.""

Is there a real difference between being in a studio and watching at home? For Claire, being in a studio is ""more exciting,"" while Charlotte enjoyed feeling involved with live television. ""Last year I saw my favorite comedian. When you watch him at home, you miss a lot."" What I missed was seeing live actors; from my seat, I could only see the back of someone’s head. The opening scenes were filmed far from where I sat, so I ended up watching the show on a studio monitor.

Going to a studio may not be the best way to watch television, but that’s not what matters. For most audience members, it was simply fun and a free night of entertainment."

**Bruce**  
I do not like completely wild landscapes. The human touch is important to me. This is also true when I travel abroad. I am drawn to charming villages with old temples, not empty deserts. When I was eight, I went to school in England, and on Saturdays, I would ride my bike to the village of Lastingham in its beautiful valley. Cycling was a break from school. I enjoyed exploring the bare hilltops, the sheltered valleys, and old villages. Coming from Scotland, I found the landscape both familiar and different, and I still visit there today. I used to write about my adventures in my private diary. In a way, that was my first attempt at travel writing, which later became my career.

**Sophia**  
There is a small railway that runs from Hythe to Dungeness, operated by volunteers. I always travel first class because it does not cost much more than the regular ticket. The scenery is not amazing. The train travels across Romney Marsh with its sheep and next to a canal. However, there is one part of the journey I always look forward to - when our small train goes through back gardens. For a few moments, we passengers peek into people's lives, seeing them make tea, wash dishes, or set up a deckchair. I see myself in their eyes, a woman in a tiny train carriage, looking into other people's homes. It is the everyday nature of the landscape that attracts me. Just fields, sheep, and a distant grey sea. This makes me look more closely, searching for something that opens my eyes.

**Matthew**  
The Hartland Peninsula is a quiet and beautiful coast. The beaches are hard to reach and filled with rocks, so there are not many people here. A few brave surfers come, but most visitors prefer to admire the power of the sea. The coast, facing the Atlantic, is known for shipwrecks. There are coastal walks that you can combine with trips into lovely damp valleys, full of oak trees, ferns, and wildflowers. We stay in simple self-catering accommodation with a family who owns some property in the village of Southole.

**Annette**  
My favorite place in England is the Trough of Bowland, a wide-open moorland perfect for hiking. There are not many people living there and not many visitors either. It is a hidden, empty, and remote area, and I enjoy the feeling of space. I found this place by chance when I was a student, and since then, I have visited every year, either alone, with my boyfriend, or now with my son. It has changed little since my first visit. Having a child makes these visits more special. It makes me sad that he is growing up in a city.

**James**  
I bought Glenthorne, my favorite house in Britain. It was about finding peace and reconnecting with my English roots. I grew up in what is now Sri Lanka, but at twelve, I went to school in Devon, in the west of England. I used to ride my bike around the moors and village streets. There was a story about a place we would never cycle past: if you went down the driveway, you would never return. That place was Glenthorne. It is the place of my dreams. It is a magical, secluded, romantic house. You can only hear the sea, wind, and birds."
FCE_42,"**HAPPY HUNTING GROUND**

We are 'animal people' who love all kinds of creatures. One afternoon, my daughter called me at work to say she had found a beautiful pine snake. ""Can we keep him?"" she asked excitedly. I replied, ""Yes, but only for one night."" We had prepared a special tank for such visitors, just long enough to admire them and look them up in our natural history book.

I got home late and quickly put a pot on to boil when I heard my sons screaming, ""Oh, Mother! Help! Do something!"" I rushed to their bedroom. The crisis involved Domino the cat and Bianca, the white mouse I had received as a Mother's Day gift. Domino was running around the room with the mouse in his mouth, trying to escape while avoiding the chaos of waving arms and furniture.

I jumped into the mess and tripped over something, landing on the floor. As I thought about how to stop Domino, I noticed the snake. It had escaped and was slithering off the table and onto the floor. I crouched down as the snake moved closer, while the kids and the cat were jumping around in a loud, chaotic scene. The dog was barking, and the pot in the kitchen boiled over.

I quickly turned off the gas and returned to the chaos with renewed energy. I managed to grab Domino by the tail and rescued the small, wet, and surprisingly unharmed mouse from his jaws. Interestingly, that same mouse was caught by Domino three more times during its life but eventually died of old age.

Feeling encouraged by my success with the cat, I examined the snake for any weak spots, but it had none. In the end, I sat on the floor like a snake-charmer, rocking back and forth, but without a flute. Gradually, the snake relaxed and rested its head on its body, though its eyes still looked suspicious. I slowly slid my hands under the snake and carefully stood up, walking to the end of the garden. There, I pointed the snake towards a tree, giving it the chance to live happily in the garden.

When I finally let go of the snake's head, expecting it to strike, it instead slid over my shoulders like a colorful shawl, seeming to settle in for the winter. We stood together in the fading light: four young children, their mother, and the snake. My eldest son, DJ, broke the silence with a scientific observation: ""You know what it is, Mum? You're nice and warm, and the shed isn't.""

I had the children gather at the snake's tail and gently encourage it to move on. Slowly, it did, climbing up the wall and disappearing over the roof. As the last bit of its tail vanished from our sight, three-year-old Clay sighed and said what we were all thinking: ""Boy, that was one big snake!"""
FCE_59,"Text: 'Send me a message! In our fast world of phones, faxes, and computers, the traditional art of letter writing is at risk of disappearing. However, I believe that receiving a letter is a unique experience that no other form of communication can replace. There is the thrill of its arrival, the joy of seeing who it is from, and the pleasure of reading its contents. Letter writing has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. It probably started with the little notes I wrote to my mother. She always made sure I wrote my own thank-you letters for Christmas and birthday gifts. It didn’t matter how short or messy they were, as long as they were letters. When I left home at 18 to study medicine in London, I wrote to my parents every week, and they wrote back. Sometimes my father would write, and I always enjoyed his long, funny letters. Most letters from home shared everyday events about my parents and their friends. We also made phone calls, but I remember the letters the most. I also received letters from my boyfriends. In my youth, I often met people who had to work or study far away, and we kept in touch through letters. Instead of hurting our relationships, letter writing seemed to strengthen them. I found it easier to express my feelings in writing than in conversation. I love the letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. Short notes are nice, but it’s even better to receive a whole year’s worth of news! It’s even more exciting when it comes in an airmail envelope with beautiful stamps. I get letters from Mangala in Sri Lanka, from a friend I trained with over 20 years ago, and I have penfriends in Australia and Vancouver. There’s also a lady who writes to me from France. If we hadn’t started talking in a restaurant on the way home from vacation, if my husband hadn’t taken her photo, and if I hadn’t asked for her address, I would never have been able to write to her. More importantly, if she hadn’t replied, we would have missed out on a wonderful friendship. Now, we write to each other regularly. I can practice my French (she doesn’t speak English); we have visited her home twice, and she has stayed with us. My biggest success in letter writing happened this summer when my family and I visited my American penfriend in Texas. We had been writing to each other for 29 years but had never met. Everyone was surprised that a friendship could last so long. The local newspaper even thought it was newsworthy enough to feature on the front page. I am happy that my children are continuing this tradition. Like my mother, I make sure they write their own thank-you letters. My daughter writes me little letters, just as I did to my mother. She and my son have their own penfriends in Texas, organized by my penfriend. I strongly encourage everyone not to let letter writing become a lost art.'"

**Careless Tourists Damage Ancient Rock Art**

Many ancient pictures carved into the rocks at one of France's most important tourist sites are being slowly destroyed. Scientists worry that the 36,000 drawings on rocks in Mont Bego in the French Alps are being damaged so quickly that they may not last for future generations. The mountain, which was once a place for prayer, has drawings that are 4,000 years old. These include images of cows, fields, and various gods and goddesses. However, as more people visit the site, the pictures are being harmed by careless graffiti.

Jean Clottes, the chairman of the International Committee on Rock Art, says, ""People think that because the pictures have been there for so long, they will always be there. But if the damage continues at this rate, there will be nothing left in 50 years."" He has seen tourists stepping on the drawings, which wears away the rock and damages the artwork. Some visitors even take pieces of the rock home as souvenirs. ""When people can't take a good photograph, they rub the drawings to make them clearer,"" he explains. ""The drawings are naturally polished by the weather, and if the sun is shining and visitors can't see them well, they rub and scrape them to make them look newer.""

Other researchers have noticed that some people come with long sticks to scratch their own drawings or names into the rocks. Experts disagree on the best way to protect the drawings. Henry de Lumley, director of the Museum of Natural History in Paris, believes the only way to save the site is to make the whole mountain a ""no-go"" area, allowing the public to visit only on guided tours. He warns that if this is not done, the site will be completely destroyed, and important research will be lost.

Clottes disagrees with this idea. He says, ""Henry de Lumley's plan is very strict, and while it may be effective, it will likely upset local residents."" He adds that the site was declared a historic monument by the Ministry of Culture, and we must do everything we can to protect it.

David Lavergne, a regional architect, also wants to keep the site open. He says, ""Henry de Lumley's idea isn't perfect. Our department believes the best solution is to let people visit the site, but it is hard to stop visitors from causing damage because the area is so large. I would prefer that everyone could see it, but the main issue is money. We do not have enough funds to hire enough guards. We may need to think about charging a fee, as there seems to be no chance of government funding.""

In Nice, Annie Echassoux, who has also studied the site, is worried that as the mountain becomes easier to reach—tourists can now avoid a long walk by hiring vehicles—the damage will increase quickly. She believes the only solution is to block off the area and provide guides. ""You can't say the plan can't happen because there is no money,"" she says. ""That is not acceptable. Money must be provided because the Ministry of Culture has classified this area as a historic site. If we do not take action, we will be responsible for losing the drawings for future generations."""
FCE_32,"**Text: Young Shoppers**

Shopping in supermarkets with children can be very challenging for parents. One mother explains, ""They want everything they see. If it’s not the newest sugary cereal, it’s a Disney video or a comic book. Usually, they want all three. I can’t afford all this, and when I give in, I feel guilty for buying unhealthy things. I hate saying no all the time, and I get anxious before we even leave the house. I try to avoid taking them shopping, but then I worry they are missing out on learning to make their own choices. I feel stuck.""

Research shows that children ask for something to buy every two minutes when they are in a supermarket. Over £150 million is spent each year on advertising aimed directly at children, mostly on television. This amount is expected to grow, and supermarkets are where this advertising is most effective. Children often do not understand why their parents say no to certain things, and arguments about the dangers of sugar are not convincing when compared to attractive ads.

Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, ""Most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, but these ideas are not always correct. It’s good for parents and children to talk about food, because if children only hear about products from TV ads, they get a very one-sided view. Parents feel frustrated because they are competing with the advertising industry and often have to disappoint their children.""

The Independent Television Commission, which oversees TV advertising, does not allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy products. However, Dibb notes, ""The goal of advertising is to persuade viewers to buy something. So even if they can’t say, 'Tell your mom to buy this,' that is still the effect.""

Shopping with children can be stressful for parents because they have to decide which requests to agree to and which to refuse. One mother says she is patient when discussing food with her children, but she feels uneasy about how she handles their shopping requests: ""My son notices ads but is critical of them. We talk a lot about different products and look at labels together. I’ve talked about it so much that he thinks all ads are bad. Now, we have very little conflict in the supermarket because the children don’t ask for things I don’t want to buy.""

Parents also admit they can be inconsistent in their responses to their children’s requests. Mike, a father of a seven-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter, says, ""We refuse to buy him sweets because we say they are bad for him, while we buy double cream and chocolate for ourselves. It’s nice to buy good things, and it’s normal for children to want to share that. But I still get annoyed by their requests. It depends on my mood. If I’m feeling good, I’m more likely to say yes. It’s hard to be consistent.""

Supermarkets could help reduce conflicts between parents and children by removing sweets from checkout areas or providing supervised play areas. Although parents might spend less if their children are not with them, the idea of shopping without their children’s demands could attract more customers, making up for any loss in sales."
FCE_65,"**Text: Climbing Walls**

In the past, climbers went to mountains to climb. Now, you can find challenging climbing experiences both indoors and outdoors. The audience watches in excitement as the French climber Francois Lombard hangs upside down by just two fingers on a climbing wall. He is competing in the World Cup Climbing Championships at the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham. This arena is better known for hosting the TV show Gladiators, but both events share one important feature: The Wall. The ability to have these events is due to new and rapidly advancing technology.

Before the mid-1960s, climbers practiced on cliffs with good climbing angles. In winter, they either braved the cold, went for walks, or climbed on snow and ice in Scotland. As the sport grew, it became essential for top climbers to stay fit. Since cliffs were often unusable, they began using brick edges or stone buildings to train. This helped them strengthen their fingers and avoid boredom from not climbing.

Soon, many sports centers started building climbing walls specifically for training, using bricks with special edges. One of the first climbing walls was created by Don Robinson, a physical education teacher, in a corridor at Leeds University in the mid-1960s. He came up with the idea of embedding natural rock in concrete blocks to create climbing walls. Throughout the 1970s, many similar walls were built in sports halls, but they had clear design issues. These walls could only be vertical, while outdoor cliffs have features like overhangs and slanted rocks. Additionally, once built, the walls could not be changed, and climbers would eventually get bored with the same routes.

In 1985, a Frenchman named Francois Savigny invented a material that could be shaped like the holds found on cliffs. These holds could be attached to any wall and removed when climbers wanted a change. French manufacturers also started to create panels on steel frames. Concrete was too heavy for making overhanging walls without significant construction, but steel frames could be built anywhere as free-standing structures. This system of interchangeable holds provided climbers with endless new challenges."
FCE_61,"Text: 'So you want to be an actor? If you tell someone that you want to be an actor, they will likely mention that it is a risky career. Acting is indeed risky because there are many actors but not enough jobs for them. When you decide to become an actor, some people you thought were friends may think you are making a mistake, while others may support you. Everyone will give you different advice. Ultimately, it is a personal choice, and you are responsible for your own path and dreams. There are no easy ways to succeed in acting—there are no exams to pass, and completing training does not guarantee a job. Success depends on both luck and talent. However, there is always a need for new actors, and acting can bring excitement, glamour, and sometimes wealth.

Many people ask what talent is. I believe talent is a mix of natural skill and imagination, with imagination being the hardest to measure. It also involves courage and belief in what you are doing. The desire to act can be hard to explain. In theater, the important moment is the connection between the actor and the audience. This connection is what motivates actors to perform.

When you ask successful actors how they achieved their success, they often do not have a clear answer. They understand some things about their skills and techniques, but they do not take their success for granted. They know they are only as good as their last job, and fame can be fleeting. Disappointment is a major challenge for actors. One month you might be unemployed, doing other jobs, and the next month you could be auditioning for a role. Even if you really want the job, you might not get it. Because of this, actors often avoid discussing their chances of success. They find ways to cope with the stress of competition and the fear of rejection. No one likes to be rejected, and this possibility exists from the moment you start auditioning. You are saying you are available, willing, and hopefully talented enough for the role. In many ways, your success depends on your own commitment; if you do not care enough, others may not care about you either.'"

Each recipe is illustrated with step-by-step images and beautiful photos of the finished dishes. Expert chefs from Cordon Bleu schools worldwide have chosen a recipe they are known for and shared their secrets with readers.

D. Fast food? No way! Many believe that good food requires a long time in the kitchen. However, Nigel Slater, food editor of *The Observer*, disagrees. His new book, *The 30-Minute Cook*, shows that fast food can be delicious. Nigel believes that quick meals are what people want when they come home tired and hungry. He has always thought it is possible to make something tasty in the time it takes to get a pizza delivered, and he has written two successful books to prove it. In this new book, you will find many tempting recipes, each ready in just 30 minutes. Nigel shares over 200 recipes from around the world in his cheerful and enjoyable style. Just because he likes fast food doesn’t mean he doesn’t appreciate good food. If you doubt that fast food can be great, try his recipes—they are simply delicious."

It's true - we are all getting taller. Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy. The teacher jokingly asked, ""What do you want to be? The flagpole on a ship?"" This was funny because Chris was already almost two metres tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is the tallest man in Britain. 

Every decade, the average height of people in Europe increases by about one centimetre. More tall people are being born, but this does not mean we are becoming a new super race. Instead, we are returning to how our ancestors looked. According to palaeontologist Professor Chris Stringer, ""We are becoming like Cro-Magnons again - the people who lived on Earth 40,000 years ago.""

For most of human history, our ancestors had a varied diet. Women gathered herbs, fruits, and berries, while men hunted animals. One study found they ate from 85 different wild plants. However, about 9,000 years ago, agriculture began, which changed everything. Farmers took over many green areas, and now just three plants - wheat, rice, and maize - provide more than half of the calories we eat. This limited diet has harmed our health. 

In Ohio, scientists found that when they started farming corn, healthy hunter-gatherers became sickly farmers. Tooth decay and diseases increased. Although corn was thought to be a blessing, some anthropologists see it as a health disaster. Still, agriculture spread because one piece of land could support many more people than hunting could. 

Today, many people are poorly nourished, but this issue is being addressed in wealthier countries. In Europe, the US, and Japan, diets are starting to reflect the variety of our ancestors' diets again. As a result, the average height of men is now 179 cm in the US, 180 cm in Holland, and 177 cm in Japan. This is a positive trend, but it comes with challenges. 

Even though people are getting taller, standard bed lengths have not changed since 1860, remaining at 190 cm. Legroom in planes and trains seems to have decreased, and clothing manufacturers are constantly adjusting their sizes. The question is: how tall can we get? 

According to Robert Fogel from the University, we might reach a height of 193 cm this century. However, scientists warn that while individuals may be growing taller due to better nutrition, as a species, we are actually getting smaller. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, humans were slightly rounder and taller to keep warm. As the climate warmed, we became thinner and shorter, even when well-fed. If global warming continues, we may shrink even more. In other words, our growth could be affected by climate change."

**The Farmer**  
Matt Froggatt used to work as an insurance agent in London, but now he runs a sheep farm. ""After 14 years in the business, I found that working in the City was no longer exciting; it became a grind. I had planned to stay for another five or ten years, but then I was unexpectedly made redundant. I didn’t receive a great pay-off, but it was enough to start the farm. My big break came when I met the head chef of a local hotel with one of the best restaurants in the country. By supplying them, my reputation grew, and now I also sell meat through mail order. I’m happy to be out of the office, but it’s surprising how little has changed: I still work 80 to 90 hours a week and sell a product.""

**The Painter**  
Ron Able White was a manager in advertising, but now he makes a living as an artist. ""I started painting as a hobby, but I found it much more exciting than my job. It made sense to take redundancy and become an artist. The career counselor I spoke to was very supportive. I think I was the first person to tell him, 'I don’t want to go back to my old job.' He was surprised because most people in their mid-forties need to find work quickly for financial reasons. My wife and I married young, and our children no longer need our support. It was a leap into the unknown. We moved to northern England, where we didn’t know anyone. We left our friends behind, but we’ve been lucky; many of them visit us now.""

**The Hat Maker**  
After five years as a company lawyer, Katherine Goodison started her own hat-making business in her London flat. ""Being a lawyer was enjoyable and well-paid, but the hours were terrible. I realized I didn’t want to become a senior partner, working even longer hours, so I left. Many people said I would get bored, but that has never happened. The key is to set deadlines. Since it’s a fashion business, there are always collections and new designs to work on, so I have to keep a strict schedule. I feel happier now and much less stressed. However, I miss the social interaction with colleagues. What I love about this job is that I am fully responsible for the product. If I do a poor job, I am the one who faces the consequences. Of course, I cared when I worked for a company, but when my name is on the promotional material, I care even more.""

**The Masseur**  
Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16 years before becoming a masseur at the Life Centre in London. ""I had been in financial markets since I was 22, making deals. I enjoyed the excitement, but I never found the work fulfilling. I almost lost my job in 1989, but I left voluntarily and traveled for a year. During that time, I tried to figure out what I wanted to do. I was interested in health, so I visited some of the best gyms in the world and spoke to the owners about how they started. I knew I needed qualifications to change careers, so I took various massage courses. Then I got a part-time job at the Life Centre. I have no regrets. I used to feel out of control, but now I have peace of mind and control over my future. That is the best part."""
FCE_5,"**Text: A Winning Game**

Two brothers have discovered that their childhood game is great for business. Dave and Norm Lagasse, two bearded brothers in their forties, are at their simple home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA, enjoying their childhood memories. In front of them is a wooden board with round plastic pieces. They are playing the old game of pichenotte, which they believe is unique. Their grandfather, Lucien Rajotte, a grocer from Quebec, Canada, brought the game to the USA and taught it to his family. Soon, every weekend and holiday, the family played the game and, as Dave says, ""had the best time ever."" Eventually, they moved to New Mexico, but they kept playing with Grandpa's pichenotte board, made from old wooden crates. Visitors were often intrigued because the game was unknown in the southern USA.

Three years ago, Dave noticed how worn the pichenotte board had become and decided to make a new one. It turned out beautifully. A relative saw it and wanted one, then a friend wanted another. Curious about the interest, the brothers took one of Dave's new boards to a sports bar in Santa Fe. ""People started to watch,"" says Dave, ""and said, 'No way I'm playing that silly game.' But soon they sat down, and before long, they couldn't get up from the table!"" When people asked about the game's origins, Dave researched it. He found that the roots were likely in India, where a similar game called 'carroms' exists. This game evolved into 'squails,' played in British pubs, and British immigrants brought it to Canada. Pichenotte is the French-Canadian version that developed in Quebec.

Pichenotte can be played by two to four people and is a game of skill. Each player has 12 pieces or 'pucks.' They flick the pucks across a wheel-like board using their middle or index finger. Getting a puck into a small hole is worth 20 points, while three rings around the hole are worth 15, 10, and 5 points, respectively. Eight small posts act as obstacles. The game usually lasts about two minutes.

Seeing the game's popularity at the Santa Fe bar, the Lagasses made more boards and took them to markets and craft fairs. Crowds gathered, money was exchanged, and the game's popularity increased. Championships began, and a trophy called the 'Lord Pichenotte Cup' was created. As word spread, the boards sold quickly, and the brothers decided to start a pichenotte business full-time. They set up a workshop in their garage and began making boards. They have produced over 450 boards so far. Made of birchwood and mahogany, each board weighs 12 kg and is 1 cm thick. Norm explains, ""They're very durable, as they need to withstand a lot of use."" They are available for $595 each on the brothers' website.

Currently, there are no professional pichenotte players or TV coverage to create pichenotte stars. However, the day may come when the brothers' garage will hold a luxury Mercedes instead of tools and wood. Until then, they are happy to spend their free time playing the game they hope will bring them success."
FCE_41,"**WELCOME TO THE MODEL VILLAGE**

When you first enter the Model Village, it is hard to believe that just a few years ago, this was an empty, overgrown piece of land. For a long time, it was seen as useless. However, through careful planning and hard work by one man, with the support of his wife, this area has been transformed into the beautiful place you see today. 

During the construction of the village, many tons of soil and clay were moved to change the flat land into the shaped landscape you see now. Although machines like bulldozers helped, a lot of manual labor was also involved. Once the land was shaped, about 1,000 tons of topsoil were added to create lawns, flower beds, and rockeries. 

In building the Model Village, hundreds of trees and shrubs were planted. These plants were carefully chosen to survive in the salty air near the sea and to withstand strong winter winds. Most plants came from local garden centers, but some were imported from as far away as Canada and New Zealand. 

The entire village was designed by Colin Sims, who made over 100 models by hand over nine years, starting in 1972. The models are made from various materials—stone, concrete, specially treated wood, and plastics—to endure all types of weather. At first, Colin needed help from experts to learn how different materials would last over time, but he quickly became skilled himself. 

You will notice that a consistent scale has been used, and great attention has been given to even the smallest details of the models. This was achieved through patience and the development of unique building techniques. The Model Village has become a popular attraction, known for its high-quality craftsmanship and upkeep. The methods used to create these realistic models have been adopted in other model villages across England and have even been included in some college courses on modeling. 

All the buildings in the village represent traditional British architectural styles and are not based on any specific place. One of the most impressive buildings is the Manor House, a typical 13th-century stone structure with a brick tower and stone walls, inspired by manor houses found in the West Country. As you walk around the village, you will also see the Castle, St Mary's Church, a zoo, and a mini golf course, which is the newest addition.

We ask you to stay on the paths during your visit and not to touch any of the models; even a small mistake can lead to hours of repair work for us. You may take photos from the pathways only. Dogs are welcome on a short lead.

To enhance your experience, you will find buttons in front of some working models. Pressing these will make the models move. At the end of your visit, we welcome any feedback you may have. We are always planning new models, and your ideas can help us create a more varied and interesting display. We also want to know if any models did not meet your expectations. We are constantly updating the models and need to know which ones need attention.

We hope you enjoy your visit and look forward to seeing you again. Please tell your friends about us!"
FCE_69,"Text: 'Every week, British tabloid newspapers publish pictures that invade people's privacy and violate the editors' code of practice. While pop stars sometimes pose for paparazzi, this is not common. More often, serious harm is done to public figures when their private moments are shown on the front page. However, very few people contact the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), which was created to address these issues. Rarely are these pictures in the public interest. Do private photos of pop stars help solve crimes? How did a picture of a famous actress on a hotel balcony protect public health and safety? The actress has complained about long-lens photos before, and since she was in a hotel—a place where, according to the code of practice, 'there is a reasonable expectation of privacy'—she had a valid reason to complain, but she did not take action. It is a scandal that the PCC did not start an investigation. It should also look into the shocking story recently published about a pop star's love life. Like the actress, the pop star has not made a formal complaint. Shouldn't the PCC take the lead on this and other disgraceful attacks? This seems like a good idea. It would likely result in many decisions against newspapers. These would be reported by their competitors and shown on TV and radio. The public would not be sympathetic, and editors would have to stop publishing such material. Even photographers would be affected, as they would no longer be able to afford to hide behind trees waiting to take pictures of unsuspecting celebrities. If the PCC decided to act as a 'police officer', which it could technically do, there would be several challenges. How would it decide whether to start an inquiry? Should it contact the victim and encourage them to complain? And if the person still refused to act, should it proceed anyway? Additionally, celebrities and royals might expect that any story about them would be investigated, and then be upset if it wasn't. Most importantly, the role is too large. How could the PCC realistically monitor all of the British press: national, regional, and magazines? There is also the issue of embarrassment to consider. No matter how much someone's privacy has been violated, would they really want the added embarrassment of an investigation? I believe most people just want to move on with their lives. Of course, some may have other reasons for staying quiet. A worse story might exist that they have kept from the press, and they know that this could also become public if they complain. In other words, even the PCC might become an enemy. One British comedian faced problems with the press when he and his wife were secretly photographed on their honeymoon in the Caribbean. He did not complain then, nor did he when he and his family were photographed without permission during a family holiday. His reason was fear that the newspaper, News of the World, would publish the pictures again with a new story about his 'anger', claiming they thought it was just a joke, and that, as a film star who makes comedies, he would have a sense of humor. This fear is understandable. People believe they will become targets again if they challenge the tabloids. It is difficult to find an easy solution to this serious problem.'"

Many college graduates receive advice when starting their first job. This article focuses on moving to a second job. We are not discussing those who are looking for a temporary job while searching for a permanent one, nor those who leave a job they dislike within a few weeks. Instead, we will talk about those of you who are ready to take a significant step in your career. You have gained some experience and skills and have a clearer idea of your career goals. 

What kind of job should you seek? It largely depends on your long-term goals. You need to consider whether you want to specialize in a certain area, aim for higher responsibilities, or explore a broader field. Whatever you choose, it is important to select your second job carefully. You should plan to stay in this job for two to three years, as it will be closely examined when you apply for your next position. This job should demonstrate that you are serious about your career. Most importantly, it should help you grow, develop your skills, and increase your responsibilities. 

If you feel the urge to travel, now might be a good time to do so. You can take temporary work when you return and then find your second job. Future employers will appreciate that you have satisfied your desire to travel and are less likely to leave again soon. 

Juliette Davidson spent her first year after graduating from St. Aldate's College working for three solicitors. It was a great first job because they were very supportive. She learned about office work and improved her word processing skills. However, there was no opportunity for advancement. One day, she decided to leave, bought a plane ticket, and traveled for a year. 

Now, Juliette works as a Personal Assistant to Brenda Cleverdon, the Chief Executive of Business in the Community. ""In two and a half years, I have become more capable, and my job has really evolved,"" she says. ""From the start, my boss was eager to help me grow. My job title is the same as when I began, but my responsibilities have changed. I have moved from mainly typing and answering calls to handling most of the correspondence and budgets. I also manage various inquiries, from company chairmen to people wanting to start their own businesses.

FCE_17,"**Text: 'What is the Secret of Confident People?'**

Confident people may seem like they were born that way, but many will say it is a skill they learned. Nina Hathway asks five people how they became confident.

**A. Jenny**  
When I left school, I was very shy and thought I would always be that way. At about twenty-five, I was asked to help at my daughter's school. I was nervous but surprised myself by doing well. Someone suggested I take a university course. On my first day, I felt very anxious, but my confidence grew over time, and I became more outgoing. Looking back, working at the school changed my life and helped me in many ways.

**B. Michaela**  
My journey began four years ago when my father got sick, and I had to take over the family business. I was scared and became a bit too aggressive. I thought that was how confident people acted, but I learned that true confidence comes from believing in yourself. If work gets too hard, I don’t feel guilty about leaving some tasks for the next day. When I face something difficult, I remind myself that I have nothing to lose. Fear can make you feel unconfident, so I often talk to myself to calm those fears.

**C. Lisa**  
People see me as confident, but I often feel scared inside. I had to learn to appear confident because it is very important in my job in TV. Interviewing people has shown me that many of us feel nervous in important situations, but we feel better when we talk to friendly people. My mother once told me, “Who’s looking at you? Everyone is too busy worrying about themselves.” I remember this advice often. I also believe that facing your fears helps you gain confidence. I was very nervous during my driving test, but I passed, and that made me feel braver.

**D. Barbara**  
I feel confident because I enjoy my work, but I have built this confidence over time. If you keep working and learn from your mistakes, you will feel more confident next time. I work hard and am liked at the restaurant, but not everyone will like you. You must accept yourself and not try to be what others want. My company offers many training courses, which have helped my self-esteem. They also encourage us to set realistic goals. It is helpful to see that you are achieving something instead of trying to do everything at once and ending up with nothing.

**E. Kim**  
After college, I worked as a secretary and often sat in meetings, afraid to speak up. Eventually, I found the confidence to share my thoughts. When I first worked in politics, I had never spoken in public and would shake with fear. I told myself, “Don’t be silly. People do this every day, so you can too.” I also found it helpful to write down a few notes to refer to, like a comfort blanket! I believe everyone feels a bit nervous when speaking in public. The real secret to confidence is reminding yourself, “Nothing is impossible.”"
FCE_47,"**Text: Visit to Malaysia**

Paul Forster attends a kite-flying festival and spends a nervous night in the forest. Adnan Ali smiled widely when I gave him his torn kite. ""You should keep it,"" he said, ""it's traditional - if the line breaks, the finder keeps it... and I have many more."" He pointed to a pile of beautifully decorated kites at his feet. All were exactly 120 cm wide and long, made of tissue paper and split bamboo. We sat in the shade of the whispering conifer trees behind the Beach of the Seven Lagoons in Kelantan, looking out at Malaysia's largest kite festival. 

In the center of the beach, there were 10 platforms where helpers held up the kites, and a line of tense competitors waited for the countdown. When the whistle blew, the crowd cheered, and the kites shot into the sky like rockets. More than 500 men and boys had signed up for the competition, which lasts five days each year. Each participant entered four different designs, judged on decoration, stability in the air, and flying efficiency. 

""Flying kites isn't too hard,"" said Adnan, ""but making them requires real skill. Come visit me at home, and I'll show you how."" This was one of five invitations I received that day, and I decided to accept. At his house, I drank cold milky tea and ate fish crackers in a large, polished room. As night fell, he asked me to return the next day to start rebuilding his kite, but I couldn't. Instead, I explored the southern part of the state, driving towards Kuala Lumpur, through granite mountains covered in lush rainforest. 

I took a wrong turn, and the smooth road ended at a river. A small boat was waiting to take people across. Nearby, a sign caught my attention. It pointed up a footpath into the forest and read: ""Jelawang Jungle 3 km."" Before starting, it would have been helpful to know that most of this distance was steep and slippery. When I reached the track, I found a man waiting with a flask of tea. This was Baba, who managed a tented kitchen and several bamboo huts. I decided to stay there, trying not to think about insects crawling under my thin foam mattress. 

The night was completely dark, filled with various sounds. A nearby waterfall roared, and many creatures moved and squeaked. In the morning, there was a stunning view over five ranges of green mountains. In the afternoon, it rained. First, the wind blew, then lightning struck the treetops. Moments later, I was soaked. Sliding downhill, I wondered how the giant butterflies avoided the heavy rain. I also worried about my car being washed away (it sometimes happens) and the risk of drowning if I opened my mouth. Luckily, the car was still there, covered in mud, at the bottom of the track. 

No one stays a stranger for long here. Back in Kota Bahru, the capital of Kelantan, everyone asked me questions: ""Where are you from?"" ""How old are you?"" But their curiosity was friendly. While Kelantan is famous for its kites, I remember it more for the kindness of its people."

**New Picture**  
The Gallery now features a beautiful still life by the Dutch 18th-century painter Jan van Os. This large painting (89.1 cm x 71 cm) of flowers and fruit is created in bright colors on wood. It is one of the first paintings of this kind in the Gallery. The painting is signed and dated 1777 and 1778. It is common for a painting like this to have two dates because the artist waited for specific flowers to bloom in their seasons. This artwork was generously donated to the Gallery by Miss Violet Churchman in memory of her sister, Ida Nancy. It is now displayed in Room 25.

**Special Exhibition**  
The exhibition ""Painting in Spain during the Late 18th Century"" opened in the Sunley Room on March 15. Recently, the Gallery has acquired works by three Spanish painters from this period: Paret, Melendez, and Francisco Bayeu, who are the focus of the exhibition. They are joined by Francisco's brother Ramon, Antonio Gonzalez, and two Italians who worked in Spain during this time: Corrado Giaquinto and Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. The exhibition runs until May 31.

**Lecture News**  
The series of lectures related to the special exhibition continues every Wednesday. On April 5, Lizzie Barker will discuss Melendez's work, while on April 12, Sarah Symmons will lecture on Luis Paret. On April 19 and 26, Juliet Wilson will talk about Francisco Bayeu.

PET_21,"**MONEY**

What is money? The pound, the dollar, and the franc are similar to a gram or a kilometer. The key difference is that you can trade money for goods or services. For example, a five-pound note can buy a book, a large bag of sweets, or a few cinema tickets. However, the note itself is just a piece of paper that costs very little to produce. 

Thousands of years ago, people did not have money as we understand it today. There were no banks or shops. Back then, Mr. Green, a farmer, traded the corn he grew for Mr. Hive's honey. This was a direct exchange between two people, each having something the other wanted. Over time, most societies created their own forms of currency to facilitate trade. Eventually, different currencies began to connect, which is why today everyone uses a national currency."

We are looking for people who can write good stories. The judges, including novelist Mary Littlejohn, television reporter Michael Brown, and Keep Writing's editor Susan Hitchins, want interesting and original stories. Last year, detective fiction was very popular, but the winner wrote a love story. You can write about anything, but here are some tips to help you: 

1. Write about what you know. This is important advice for every writer. Last year, most stories were about love, family, and friendship problems. However, you should make ordinary situations interesting so that people want to read them. 

2. Get your facts right. It is important to describe places or explain things accurately. Only write about topics you are sure about. 

3. Hold the reader's attention. Start with an interesting beginning and end with a surprise. A weak ending can ruin a story. Develop your story carefully and think of something unusual for the ending. 

4. Think about the characters. Use descriptive words to make the people in your story feel real to the reader. 

Your story must be your own work, between 2,000 and 2,500 words, typed, double-spaced, and printed on one side of each page. We cannot accept stories by fax or email, even if you are close to the deadline. You must include the application form with your story. Unfortunately, we cannot return your story or discuss our decisions. You should not have had any fiction published in any magazine or book in this country, as per a recent rule change. The story must not have been published in any form, such as on radio or TV, anywhere in the world. Your fee of £5 will go to the Writers' Association. Make your cheque payable to Keep Writing and send it with the application form and your story to us. The closing date is 30 July, and we will inform the winner within one month. If you win, you must agree to have your story published in our magazine.'"

Hypatia's father was the director of Alexandria University, and he ensured that his daughter received the best education possible. This was rare, as most women at that time had limited chances to study. After studying in Athens and Rome, Hypatia returned to Alexandria and began teaching mathematics. She quickly became well-known for her understanding of new ideas. Although we do not have her books, we know she wrote several important mathematical works. Hypatia was also interested in technology and created several scientific tools to assist her work. During this time, many rulers feared science, and those involved in it were at risk.

PET_27,"**Text: Grass**

Grass is one of the most successful plants in the world. There are over 9,000 types of grasses, and they can be found in every part of the earth. They are the only flowering plants that can survive in the cold environments of the Arctic and Antarctic. Grasslands are home to many animals, from small insects and birds to large animals like cows and lions. All these animals rely on grass in some way. 

Grass grows back quickly after being cut or damaged. Unlike other plants, new leaves grow from below the soil, not from the top. This is why many animals can live together in one area. Once they have eaten all the grass, new grass starts to grow again, providing fresh food."

Since she was a child, she has drawn clothes and created designs. She never told her parents, who run a supermarket, that she wanted to make fashion her career. She thought they wanted her to choose a more traditional job, so she studied management at university. After finishing university, she moved to London and worked at an advertising agency. She had to go to industry events but couldn't buy the designer clothes she liked. So, she started making skirts and tops for herself. When her friends saw her creations, they asked her to make clothes for them too. She then found a small shop in London that agreed to sell her designs on a sale-or-return basis. The clothes were very popular, and nothing was returned. This motivated her to leave her advertising job, take out a £20,000 loan, and start her own womenswear brand. Kal's parents were supportive of her career change, which made her very happy. Now, her clothes are sold in over 70 stores, and her business earns more than £500,000. Her designs are featured in fashion magazines, she creates outfits for pop stars, and she gained public recognition by winning this award.

The Sunningdale Hotel was built in 1913 and opened by Princess Louise. It has provided excellent service to guests from all over the world, welcoming people of all ages and nationalities. Over the past 80 years, more than 50,000 guests from 174 different countries have visited Sunningdale. The hotel is located on a main road that leads to the town center. It is about a 20-minute bus ride from the center, and buses to many other parts of the town stop outside the hotel. Guests should avoid buses with a blue ""Express"" sign, as they do not stop near the hotel. An underground station is less than 100 meters away.

The main building has 200 well-furnished, centrally-heated single rooms, each with hot and cold water basins. Showers, baths, and toilets are located at the end of the corridors. The hotel features a shop, sitting rooms, four television rooms, a table tennis room, a library, and a laundry. There are also eight pianos available for guests to use. Parking spaces are available in the hotel driveway. Daily newspapers are provided for free, and stamps can be purchased at the office.

Guests who stay for long periods must pay for their accommodation weekly in advance, and they need to give one week's notice before leaving. Both short-term and long-term guests are welcome, but long-term guests are given priority for rooms.

PET_49,"**Text: The Ghan Train**

Mark Ottaway traveled by train from Darwin, in northern Australia, to Adelaide, in the south. The Ghan train crosses the Australian continent, from the warm northern coast through vast desert to the cooler Southern Ocean. It is often called the ""famous Ghan,"" which is somewhat unfortunate because it is known for being late. The idea of a train link between Darwin and Adelaide began in the 1920s with a line from Adelaide to Alice Springs, but serious flooding often made it hard for trains to run. A new line was finished a few months before my journey. The railway was built for speeds of up to 115 kph, but the Ghan is not a high-speed train—there are few stops, and most passengers are on holiday. The Ghan does not offer luxury like the Orient Express, but the food on board is excellent. The railway was originally built to transport goods, not passengers. It was believed that sending goods from Europe to Australia's populated south via Darwin and the train would save time and money compared to shipping around the continent. It is rare for a transcontinental railway to be completed, and the Ghan claims to be the world's first north-south one. 

As I waited to board the Ghan, I noticed that everyone was excited about the journey. The Australian pensioners, who made up most of my fellow travelers, were especially eager to get on. Our first stop was at Katherine, where the Ghan stayed for four hours. Some passengers got off to take a boat trip up the gorge. I stayed on the train until Alice Springs, where I joined a two-day trip to Uluru (Ayers Rock) with a small group and a guide. Climbing the rock is not encouraged now, and few people do it. Our group walked around the rock and watched the beautiful sunset. From Alice Springs, there are two trains a week heading south, so many passengers stop their journey here. The view from the train after Alice Springs is not very interesting; there is a lot of flat land with only cattle to see. But at dawn on the third day, we reached the foothills near the Southern Ocean. My journey was over, and although the train did not meet all the promises of the advertisements, it had taken me to some of the most amazing sights in Australia."
PET_31,"**Text: Climbing to the Top of Britain**

Every year, thousands of people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland. Because it is located in the north, the weather can be very cold. Climber Keith Hewitt shares his experience of climbing Ben Nevis for the first time.

It was February, and it was my first big winter climb. We chose a route up the north face of the mountain to Tower Ridge. This climb is six hundred meters high, making it one of the longest climbs in Britain. We planned to camp for three days in the 'Carries', which are large bowls cut into the mountain halfway up. We carried tents, sleeping bags, and metal spikes for our boots. These spikes are necessary because the snow can be so hard that it feels like walking on ice. Even though some members of our group were very experienced, we packed a lot of safety equipment, including lights to signal for help, hard hats, and extra clothing. 

Although the weather forecast was good, with no strong winds, we still felt nervous when we started our climb. Climbing Ben Nevis in winter is always difficult. The path quickly became steep, and my legs felt heavy. As the weakest member of the group, I needed to take more breaks. The others sometimes stopped to let me catch up, but as soon as I reached them, they would start again. I promised myself that I would train better before my next climb.

After climbing 200 meters, we reached the start of Tower Ridge, the path that would take us to the top of Ben Nevis. It is only a meter and a half wide, and the mountain drops hundreds of meters on both sides. We knew we had to stay calm and focus on every step as we moved slowly along it. After seven hours of climbing, we finally reached the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and the island of Skye, which is 48 kilometers away. Unfortunately, we were not lucky that day, as mist had come down.

Getting back down to camp can be just as challenging as going up. You need to read a map carefully because a wrong turn could lead to dangerous slopes in winter. I was glad we decided to take turns reading the map. That first time, I could only say I truly enjoyed the experience once I was safe in the tent. But at least I made it to the top."
PET_58,"**Text: Anna's New School**

This week has been very exciting because we have moved into our new school building! It is a wonderful place. The builders used wood for the entire structure, similar to our old school, but this one is also designed to be environmentally friendly. The school took many months to build, and we watched the process. It was thrilling to see the builders clear the land, even though it meant some beautiful open space was lost. The noise from the construction machines was very loud, and the builders often had to stop because of heavy rain. At times, we thought the building would never be finished.

Now, we have five large classrooms, much bigger than those in our old school next door, which was very old. We share one room with people from the town for meetings. There is also a nursery, a lovely dining room, and spacious changing rooms that we are excited to use once our new sports field is ready.

When you enter the school, you will notice that there are no heaters! Instead, the warmth comes from everyone inside—the children, teachers, and computers. The building is designed to keep the heat inside, and it also keeps the sound in, so when we sing in our classrooms, it feels like we are in a concert hall!

Another interesting feature is that the school roof has a tree on top! The builders placed it there after finishing the roof because it is a tradition in Austria, where the roof was made. The electricity for the lights and computers comes from a wind turbine on a hill behind the school. We visited it with our teacher yesterday, and it spins very fast. It is so large that it can be seen from far away! We took some pictures that we plan to put on our website.

Even though we are already using the school, some parts are still being completed. For example, we are currently preparing a play for our parents, but we have to go back to our old school hall to perform it. The new hall will be ready by next year. We are very happy with our new school, and our teachers say we will learn much faster now that we are here!"

Now, as I looked down at the river far below, I understood why people love rock-climbing. My friend Matt and I arrived at the Activity Centre on Friday evening. The place was not luxurious, but we had everything we needed: beds, blankets, and food. We were happy to be out of the city and in the fresh air. On Saturday morning, we met the other ten members of our group. Cameron came with his friends, Kevin and Simon, while sisters Carole and Lynn were with Amanda. We all came from different places and did not know the area. We knew we would spend the weekend outdoors, but we were not sure how. Half of us went caving in the morning while the others went rock-climbing, and then we switched activities at lunchtime. Matt and I went to the caves first.

On Saturday afternoon, I left my handbag on the bus. Inside it were my cheque book, address book, and my purse, which had about £50 in cash and some credit cards. When I realized what I had done, it was too late. I didn't know what to do; I am 72 years old, far from home, and quite worried. I stood by the side of the road and cried. A young man asked me what was wrong, and I explained my situation. He gave me some money for my bus fare home. When I told the bus driver what had happened, he said I could keep the fare. I got home safely, and soon after, the phone rang. It was the manager of CityBus, the company that owned the bus where I left my handbag. He said they had found it and offered to bring it back to me. I got my handbag back, and amazingly, everything inside was untouched. I want to thank everyone who helped me that day and express my appreciation for their kindness and honesty.

PET_60,"**Text: Sharks**

Sharks are some of the most frightening animals in our oceans. They are well adapted for hunting underwater because they can see very well and can feel movement through special lines on the sides of their bodies. This makes sharks very dangerous for smaller sea animals that they eat. 

Although sharks are similar to other fish in some ways, their bodies are different. For example, most sharks must swim all the time to breathe and stay alive, so they hardly ever sleep. Also, if sharks are turned upside down, they can stop moving completely. This is a useful technique for researchers who need to handle sharks. It helps them learn more about these interesting creatures."

My name is Nathalie. Last year, I became one of the youngest foreign students to join the Kirov ballet school in St Petersburg, Russia. On my first day of ballet class, I felt nervous because I didn’t know anyone. Everyone came over to ask me questions in Russian. I tried to respond in Russian, and then they switched to English, so we could communicate. Now, six months later, everyone is very friendly, my Russian has improved a lot, and I understand my teachers well.

For the first two weeks after I arrived, my mum stayed with me. When she left, I felt a bit sad. I even called home late one night to talk to her because I was feeling lonely. The classes in Russia are much harder than those at my ballet school in England, and I eat a lot to keep my energy up. This gives me confidence to meet the school’s high standards.

In the evenings, I like to watch my favorite films on my computer, but sometimes I fall asleep before the movie ends. Now that I have settled in, I feel at home here. I enjoy walking around the city and visiting different shops, even in December when it was very cold. I decided to buy a fur hat because it was minus 10°C, but the locals said it was mild for that time of year! At least my room is warm and cozy.

PET_55,"**THE ICEHOTEL**

For many years, the Arctic was a popular summer destination to see the land of the midnight sun, but in winter, the few people living there enjoyed the snow and ice alone. By the late 1980s, it was decided that the dark and cold winter could be seen as a positive thing. In the winter of 1990, French artist Jannot Derit was invited to open an exhibition in a specially built igloo (a building made of snow) in the small town of Jukkasjarvi on the frozen Torne River. This building, called Arctic Hall, attracted many visitors to the area. One night, a group of foreign guests thought it would be fun to sleep in Arctic Hall. The next morning, they were very happy with their experience, and the idea of an ice hotel was created. Today, it is famous worldwide.

As soon as winter starts, a team of snow builders, architects, and artists from around the world come to Jukkasjarvi to build the hotel for that year. As one part is finished, it opens to visitors and overnight guests, while other parts are still being built. The first part is completed in December, and each week after that, a new part opens until January 7th, when the hotel is fully completed. Since the ICEHOTEL is built outdoors using natural winter materials, the finishing date depends on the weather, so sometimes plans change.

In spring, as the weather warms up, the hotel melts. Inside the hotel, the temperature is never colder than -5°C to -8°C, no matter how cold it is outside. Guests receive winter clothing such as warm overalls, hats, and gloves as part of their stay. It is also a good idea for guests to bring sweaters, scarves, and plenty of woollen socks, and to choose shoes that are larger than usual to fit thick socks. If you plan to visit the hotel, you can buy warm sweaters, woollen socks, and more on the ICEHOTEL website. You can order these items and any equipment you need when you book your visit, and they will be delivered to your room when you check in.

The hotel is located in the village of Jukkasjarvi, 200 km above the Arctic Circle, but only 15 km from Kiruna airport and 17 km from Kiruna train station. Bus transport can be arranged from the airport or train station to the ICEHOTEL."
PET_50,"**Text: Shopping for Furniture**

A report by Dave Worthington

Homestyle, a new furniture shop, had to close shortly after it opened at midnight last Thursday. Up to 6,000 people rushed to the shop. There were many special offers, including a leather sofa for £45 (only until 3 am) and a bed for £30 (only between 3 am and 8 am). The shop's regular hours will be from 9 am to 9 pm every day, but Homestyle had announced it would stay open for the first 24 hours. However, it had to close within half an hour of opening.

A police officer who was called to the shop said: ""The police knew a large crowd was expected, but people were not patient. The shop quickly became full, and the managers wisely decided to close the doors. The people outside got angry because they thought everything would be sold before they could enter, and they refused to wait quietly until there was space for them inside. Another problem was that there was a long line of cars trying to get to the parking lot. I couldn't believe that many people decided to leave their cars in the middle of the road and walk the last few meters to the shop. This blocked the road completely.""

One customer, Jenny Smith, who got into the shop, said: ""I waited in line for three hours, and I didn't have time to buy what I wanted. But the staff were very calm and explained what was happening. They had no choice, as it wasn't safe. So I'll come back when they reopen, but I'm not willing to wait in line again."""

PET_34,"**Text: Free-diving in the Caribbean**

Tanya Streeter holds four world records in free-diving, a sport where competitors dive to great depths on just one breath of air. In 2003, she made history by becoming the first person to dive 120 meters into the ocean and return to the surface without assistance. Although she had dived deeper a year earlier using a balloon to help her return, this time she held her breath for over three and a half minutes, making her the first woman to break a world record previously held by a man. A team of fourteen safety divers monitored her dive at various depths. 

Some people argue that free-diving is too dangerous, especially after reports of serious accidents involving other divers. However, Tanya believes that safety is the most important factor, followed by proper training. Most free-divers focus on one or two types of events, but Tanya maintains a consistent training schedule. Two-thirds of her training is done on land at the gym, while the rest is split between the pool and the ocean. She uses an exercise bike to improve her heart fitness but avoids running to prevent knee injuries. Instead, she prefers fast walking to build her fitness.

When preparing for practice dives, Tanya usually travels away from home. She aims to complete fourteen dives over four weeks, ensuring she has a rest day between each diving day to avoid fatigue, which could affect her performance. When not training for an event, she often makes public appearances to promote sports products and supports environmental organizations through research projects and films.

Having spent her childhood on the Caribbean island of Grand Cayman, Tanya enjoyed swimming and exploring rock pools to observe sea life. She feels that her life now reflects her childhood dreams. Being well-known in some countries, she believes people listen to her when she discusses environmental issues. Looking ahead, Tanya, now in her thirties, plans to continue breaking her own world records. Since she only started free-diving at twenty-five, she is eager to emphasize that she does not plan to retire from the sport for many years."
PET_12,"**CARTOON FILMS**

Cartoon films have very few restrictions. If you can draw something, you can animate it for the cinema. The introduction of new ideas and advanced computer technology has made cartoons exciting again for audiences of all ages. By the late 1970s, the film industry believed that cartoons were only for children. However, shortly after, a few directors came up with original ideas. They showed that it was possible to create films that both adults and children could enjoy together. Nevertheless, not every cartoon film was a success. For instance, The Black Cauldron did not do well, mainly because it was too scary for children and too silly for adults. Directors learned from this experience, and film companies started to earn significant profits again."

I had only acted in school plays, but I loved the book since I was eleven. My grandmother used to say I was just like Polly Finnegan, and I always dreamed of playing her. I took a year off to travel before starting university. While I was in Chile, my mother emailed me about plans to adapt the book into a TV drama. I knew I had to audition for the role. She was surprised at first but sent my photo to the director and convinced him to meet me. I flew back and got the role. The outdoor filming began a week into the term, so I got permission from the university to be away for three weeks. Once I returned, I woke up at 6:00 am to catch up on the essays I had missed. I didn’t tell my university friends, but they found out and thought it was exciting. It was an incredible experience, and I feel so lucky. After university, I definitely want to pursue acting as a career. I’m not from an acting family, although my grandfather was an opera singer. I have auditioned for other TV roles but haven’t received any offers yet. I’m not sure how I managed everything because I also had a busy social life. When filming ended, I didn’t know what to do next. Since then, I have acted in two college plays. Unfortunately, I haven’t been home much, and now that my first year at university is over, I’m going to Greece for the summer with friends."""

When I opened the first 'Body Shop' in 1976, my main goal was to earn enough money to feed my children. Today, 'The Body Shop' is a growing international company. Over the years, I have learned a lot, and much of this knowledge is shared in this book. I believe our company has valuable insights on how to run a successful business while staying true to our beliefs. 

This is not a typical business book, nor is it just about my life. The main message is that to succeed in business, you need to be different. Business can be enjoyable, it can be run with love, and it can make a positive impact. In both business and life, I want to feel happy, have a sense of family, and be excited by new experiences. I have always wanted the people who work for 'The Body Shop' to feel the same way. 

Now, this book shares my ideas with the world. I believe there are no limits to our 'family' or to what we can achieve. I find this thought exciting, and I hope you do too."
PET_4,"**A Journey Along the Beautiful Douro River**

**Day 8:** You will arrive in Oporto with plenty of time for sightseeing and last-minute shopping before your flight back to London Heathrow."
PET_30,"**HONEY**

Honey is a sweet liquid made by bees. It is made up of water and sugars. Bees can travel up to seventy-five thousand kilometers and visit over two million flowers to make just half a kilo of honey. The color and taste of honey depend on the type of flower the bees visit. There are more than three hundred types of honey. Lighter-colored honey usually has a milder taste than darker honey. In ancient times, honey was the main sweetener because sugar was very rare. The ancient Egyptians valued honey highly and even used it as payment. Today, honey is produced and consumed all over the world. Research indicates that honey can help reduce tiredness and enhance athletic performance. Additionally, honey is not only food; it can soothe sore throats and is found in many skin and hair-care products."
PET_7,"**Text: Norwich**

Norwich is the capital of East Anglia, a region in Britain, and has been inhabited for over two thousand years. It started as a small village by the River Wensum. By the time of the Norman invasion in 1066, it had become one of the largest towns in England. Norwich has two cathedrals and a mosque, making it a significant center for different religions. The first cathedral was built in 1095 and recently celebrated its 900th anniversary. In 1994, Norwich celebrated the 800th anniversary of receiving a Royal Charter, which allowed it to be called a city and govern itself.

Today, Norwich is smaller than cities like London or Manchester, with a population of about 150,000. However, in the 16th century, it was the second city of England. It continued to grow for 300 years, becoming wealthy and famous for having as many churches as there are weeks in a year and as many pubs as there are days. Nowadays, there are fewer churches and pubs, but in 1964, the University of East Anglia was established in Norwich. With a growing student population and its role as a modern commercial center (it is the largest center for insurance services outside London), Norwich offers a variety of entertainment options, including theatres, cinemas, nightclubs, busy cafes, excellent restaurants, and arts and leisure centers. The city also has a football team known as 'The Canaries', whose colors are green and yellow, though the reason for the name is unclear.

One of the city's recent developments is a modern shopping center called 'The Castle Mall'. For over two years, the people of Norwich dealt with a large hole in the city as builders worked on the main car park. They moved nearly a million tons of earth to create a city center park on the roof of the Mall, complete with water features and many trees. The local community is happy that the old open market remains in the city center, next to the new development. Both areas continue to thrive, showing that Norwich has successfully combined the old and the new."
PET_43,"**The Albuquerque Balloon Festival**

Every autumn, the sky above Albuquerque, a city in the southwestern United States, fills with bright colors. This is the Albuquerque Balloon Festival, a nine-day event that happens every year. The first festival took place in 1972 to celebrate the 50th birthday of a local radio station. It started with about twelve hot-air balloons taking off from a parking lot in the center of Albuquerque. Since then, the festival has grown a lot. This year, at least a thousand balloons from over a third of the countries in the world are expected to participate at its current location outside the city.

**What to See**

The pilots communicate with each other using radios, and they all light up the burners of their balloons at the same time. This event is called a ""balloon glow,"" and it is a great chance to take amazing photographs. To see these ""glows,"" you should arrive just after nightfall or before 5:30 AM, as the balloons rise into the dark sky. During the day, you can walk among the balloons and talk to the pilots as they get ready for take-off. The balloons come in many sizes and colors, with some shaped like animals or cartoon characters, as well as popular products like soft drinks and fast food. Children will enjoy it.

In the afternoon, you can also take a balloon flight over the desert with one of the many companies that offer rides. Another option is to ride the cable car from the desert floor to the top of the nearby mountains, which is the longest ride of its kind, and enjoy a view of the festival from above. There are many other attractions for visitors of all ages, including balloon races and fireworks on the opening night and the last three nights of the festival.

**The Albuquerque Box**

This is a local wind pattern that creates ideal conditions for balloonists. The Sandia Mountains protect the balloons from strong winds and create gentler winds at different heights. This allows skilled pilots to control the direction of their balloons by rising or descending.

**Practical Advice**

Buy your tickets in advance online to avoid long waits at the festival site. Wear several layers of thin clothing, as it can be cool at night and in the early morning, but during the day, sunglasses and sunscreen are important. Bring a flashlight for nighttime events and, of course, your camera. If you use film instead of digital photography, make sure to bring high-speed film for evening and nighttime photos."
PET_51,"**The Eden Project**

Since it opened, the Eden Project in the south-west of England has become one of the UK's most popular tourist attractions. The large 'biospheres' on this former industrial site look like something from a science-fiction movie. Each biosphere has a different climate zone, showing visitors how important the relationship between people and plants is. It is surprising to see how many products we use every day come from plants, such as wood, rubber, fruit, rice, sugar, coffee, and chocolate. Over 135,000 different types of plants are grown here. No matter how cold it is outside, computer-controlled heaters keep the plants at the right temperature. In the Rainforest Zone, the air is always damp because of a large waterfall. Another zone mimics the environment of the Mediterranean, California, and South Africa, and there are plans to create a desert zone in the near future."
PET_11,"Text: 'No Title Some people have expressed dissatisfaction with this year's collection, New Writing 3, but I do not understand why. After all, 500 pages of original writing of this quality for £6.99 is quite impressive. Most of the book consists of fiction, including parts of novels and complete short stories. There are enjoyable works by well-known authors like Candia McWilliam and Rose Tremain. Interestingly, lesser-known writers often focus on food in their pieces. I recommend caution with Jane Harris's Those Nails; it should not be read right after meals due to some very unpleasant scenes! The collection features excellent work from nineteen poets, including R. S. Thomas and John Burnside. It also includes excerpts from novels-in-progress by Jim Crace and Jane Rogers. Additionally, there is a small amount of non-fiction, including a humorous article by Alan Rusbridger about certain newspapers and a remarkable piece by Ursula Owen about her own life. This is an outstanding collection, and I am eager to see what next year's selection will bring.'"
PET_14,"**Text:**

""The best age to start learning the violin is between three and six,"" says Margaret Porter, a violinist and music teacher. ""It's when you are discovering the world."" Margaret, who lives in London, usually teaches children who are three or four years old, but she has made exceptions for eager five-year-olds. When she began teaching the violin in 1972, her first class was made up of her children's five-year-old friends.

Margaret's students have group lessons. Each group has about twelve students, and each lesson lasts one hour, every two weeks. Additionally, each student has one individual lesson with her each week. Parents must also attend the classes because it is important for them to be involved in the lessons.

From the beginning, students learn to play by ear. They do not try to read music until they have been playing for several years, and for a long time, there is a big difference between their playing and their ability to read music. Margaret says her method is not meant to create great violinists, and she often suggests that students who do very well should leave and study the violin using more traditional methods."
PET_56,"**Moonshine**

The band Moonshine released their third CD last week. ""Here Again"" is a follow-up to ""The Waves."" There have been some changes since the last CD: Tom Wilcott is now playing bass guitar, replacing Simon McVee, who left the band last year, and Tom Simpson has joined as the drummer. 

From the first song, which is a dance tune, it is clear that the band is shifting away from slow songs. The second song is also a dance track and is even louder and heavier. Most of the later songs are in the band's usual slow style. These two dance tracks will likely surprise many fans. Either could easily become a hit single because they are excellent. 

Singer Rob Letchford has a chance to showcase his talent, hitting each note perfectly. Fans should be thankful he recorded these songs before experiencing throat issues, which led to the band having to cancel their upcoming tour. (Anyone who has bought tickets need not worry, as all concerts will be rescheduled once Rob has recovered.)

On this CD, Moonshine demonstrates their ability to create great music in various styles, from the familiar slow songs to upbeat tracks that will keep you dancing. However, I felt that they placed their best songs at the beginning, and the last few tracks were not quite as strong. Despite this, ""Here Again"" is sure to be a big hit and bring more success to the band."

San Francisco is located on the northern California coast. The first Europeans to find this area were led by a Spanish explorer named Gaspar de Portola, who saw it for the first time in 1769. Interestingly, San Francisco Bay, a beautiful natural harbor, was discovered by land instead of by sea. In 1849, many people came to San Francisco hoping to find gold. However, it was not the gold seekers who became wealthy. The richest individuals were those who owned banks and law firms, and they built large houses on a hill known as Nob Hill. Today, tourists visit San Francisco to see famous sites like Chinatown and the Golden Gate Bridge. Many also take a short boat trip to Alcatraz Island to visit the former prison."

Pepys discusses significant events of the time, such as diseases, an enemy navy sailing up the River Thames, and the Great Fire of London. He also shares personal stories, including his own flaws—like often falling asleep in church or admiring pretty girls. He describes his home life, including arguments with his wife and how they reconciled, as well as his concerns about her health. In addition to reading, he enjoyed music, theatre, card games, and lively parties with good food. Pepys was a busy man with many important roles; he served as a Member of Parliament and was President of the Royal Society. He is also remembered for his contributions to the British Navy."
PET_33,"**The History of Shoes**

In the past, people did not focus on shoes being comfortable or stylish. Early shoes were likely made from animal skins, which people tied around their ankles to keep warm. Today, we still use leather, but other materials like silk, plastic, and cotton are also common, depending on current trends. It was only about one hundred and fifty years ago that people started wearing different shoes for each foot. Before that, shoes were straight and could be worn on either foot. All shoes used to be handmade, but now, while some shoemakers still use traditional methods, most shoes are made by machines in large factories. The invention of sewing machines allowed the shoe industry to produce many more affordable shoes for a larger number of customers."

When I hurt my back, I had to stop running for a while. I wanted to help more women get involved in running, to show them how enjoyable it can be and to help them feel confident enough to start. I decided to create a running club for women in my area because I was frustrated with how some race organizers think. They often say there are not enough women in the sport, but they also use this as a reason not to provide separate changing rooms.

I put up posters, and 40 women of different ages and fitness levels joined. Most of them were interested in losing weight, but I don't think they had considered running before. If they did, they imagined it as painful training. They didn't think about having fun, chatting, and enjoying beautiful places while running, like by a river. At first, they could only run for one minute, but now they can run for thirty minutes. They have also learned about diet and staying fit from other runners. I wanted to support women's running, and it has been a joy to see their progress—almost as much as they have enjoyed it themselves."
PET_40,"**THE HISTORY OF THE IDITAROD - THE LAST GREAT RACE ON EARTH**

In the 1880s, gold was found in Alaska, the northernmost state in the USA. Many people moved there hoping to become rich. New towns were quickly built, including one called Iditarod, which means 'far, distant place'. In 1909, Iditarod grew so fast that it briefly became the largest city in Alaska. 

During the summer, supplies could be brought to these towns by boat. However, in winter, the rivers and ocean froze, making it impossible to reach them. To solve this, a winter trail was created in 1910 for dog teams pulling sleds. They delivered mail, food, and clothes to the gold miners. This trail became known as the Iditarod Trail. It took about three weeks for a team of dogs to travel across Alaska, stopping at 'roadhouses' where drivers could find a warm bed and food for themselves and their dogs. 

The trail was used every winter until the 1920s when airplanes replaced boats and dog teams as the main transport. However, in 1925, the dogs had one last important mission when a disease called diphtheria struck the city of Nome. The disease could be treated, but the nearest medicine was in Anchorage, on the other side of Alaska. Airplanes were still new, and it was uncertain if they could fly in the cold. The only skilled pilot, Carl Eielson, was away at that time. So, it was decided to use dog teams to transport the medicine instead. 

The journey was over 1,000 kilometers, mostly along the Iditarod Trail. Twenty teams completed the trip in just six days. Leonhard Seppala, a Norwegian who had come to Alaska for gold, traveled the first 400 kilometers. He relied on his dog Togo to guide him through the heavy snow, and Togo proved to be a great help. The last part of the journey was completed by Gunnar Kaasen, who had driven dog teams in Alaska for 21 years. His lead dog was Saito. At one point, Balto, another dog, refused to go further, preventing the team from falling into icy water. The diphtheria outbreak was stopped, and Balto became a hero.

Today, a dog sled race is held every year from Anchorage to Nome, following the route of that famous journey in 1925. It is called the Iditarod and is known as 'The Last Great Race on Earth'."

Despite this, around 6,000 tourists visit each year to experience one of Europe’s most unique hotels. In this hotel, guests eat, drink, and sleep in rooms made entirely of ice. You can even have a wedding there. The bar is also made of ice, so it is not advisable to place hot drinks on it! The bedrooms are kept at about -4°C, but guests receive special sleeping bags to keep warm in the cold. If needed, suitable outdoor clothing can also be provided. The hotel lasts for only six months because it melts in the summer, and it is rebuilt each winter. Constructing the hotel requires 10,000 tonnes of ice and 30,000 tonnes of snow."

In 1988, Maria Mutola was the only girl playing football on an all-boys team in a local competition in Mozambique. ""We won,"" she said. ""At first, no one thought it was a problem that I was a girl. But then the team we beat complained."" This story was published in a local newspaper, and Jose Craveirinha, who supported other African athletes, learned about Maria. He went to meet her and saw her kicking a ball outside the football club. He quickly realized she was very fast. 

""He talked to me about athletics. I didn’t understand what he meant. The only sport I knew was football. Then he bought me running shoes and took me to train. It was very hard work, and my legs hurt a lot."" Jose spoke to her parents and convinced them that she could be successful, which would help their family. They agreed to let him take her away to train. 

In 1991, she finally accepted an invitation to train in the United States. She had said no before because she knew she would miss her family. Her background was different from the girls she met in the US. She said, ""They were good athletes, but while I worried about my parents having enough to eat, they worried about dresses and make-up. They knew very little about me and even less about my problems. But I knew I was lucky to be there. The trainers were excellent, and I learned a lot.""

It is a platform with glass walls and a glass floor, allowing visitors to see the beautiful rocks below. Up to 120 people can stand on it at the same time. It opened in 2007, and since then, thousands of visitors have experienced it. To protect the glass, you must wear special shoe covers.

Although the Rockies are not as tall as the Alps, they are still incredibly beautiful. There are many roads that cross the Rockies, but the best way to experience them is by train. 

You can start your journey from Vancouver, which is one of Canada's most beautiful cities. This city is unique because it is close to both the ocean and the mountains, allowing people to ski just 15 minutes by car from downtown. 

In the past, thirty passenger trains left Vancouver each day for the cross-country railway. Now, there are only three trains a week, but the journey is still an exciting adventure. You can sleep on the train, which is enjoyable, but you will see some of the most stunning views at night."

Most cities today have a zoo or wildlife park. However, opinions about zoos vary. Supporters believe that zoos help us learn about nature and allow us to see wild animals up close, which would not be possible without them. On the other hand, some people oppose zoos because they think it is wrong to confine animals in cages. They argue that poorly managed zoos can have dirty conditions and provide unsuitable food for the animals.'"

By Katie Atkins, aged 14  

I play the trumpet in my school jazz band. Last month, we held a jazz competition with bands from local high schools, and our band won! Each band had their own costumes, from black school uniforms like my band wore to brightly-colored T-shirts. We didn’t look much like professional adult bands, but we were all used to performing in competitions, so the quality of our playing was impressive, especially considering how young we are. Players from each band even created new tunes right on stage. It was exciting to watch, but even better when my band performed!  

We have a great jazz band at my school, but not everyone who wants to join gets accepted—only about half, in fact. However, anyone who is eager to play attends jazz practice before school, and we often spend time together after school, listening to jazz and learning about it. There are also trips to jazz summer camps across the country—I’ve been to a couple and learned a lot.  

Adults are often surprised that young people are interested in jazz. My music teacher believes it’s because pop music isn’t challenging enough for serious musicians like me. I find jazz exciting because it feels both new and old at the same time—you can create your own music while also feeling connected to its history, as you perform on stage like great jazz artists before you. My school is very fortunate to have excellent teachers and supportive parents. Without them, we wouldn’t make progress in our music!"
PET_54,"**Text: Watering the Desert**

In Marrakesh, Morocco, it can rain anytime from November to March. However, rain is rare, and when it does fall, the city's water pipes often cannot handle the sudden floods, causing the streets to become like rivers. Many winters have been dry recently, so when it rains, the local people are very happy. 

The parks and gardens in Marrakesh do not rely on rain; instead, they are fed by a system of underground channels built in the 11th century that bring water from the mountains all year. Places that are mostly dry but receive water this way are called oases. 

Further south of Marrakesh is Skoura, where every piece of land is divided into small squares by water channels to grow food. The snow-covered Atlas Mountains in winter create a beautiful backdrop."

Three years ago, Alan, Kath, and Gareth joined a circus. ""People laugh when we tell them,"" says Kath. ""But it's true. Gareth has wanted to be a clown since we took him to the circus when he was three."" When Alan lost his job, he and Kath decided to look for full-time jobs in the circus. They both found jobs with a well-known circus, and Gareth started training to become a clown. He calls himself Bippo. They travel with the circus in the summer and return home in the winter. Gareth's brothers are old enough to take care of the house while they are away. 

""I can't say it was easy,"" says Kath. ""There was a lot to think about and organize. We only had a car and a very small caravan to sleep in, and we were leaving behind our nice house. The only thing Gareth missed was his long, hot baths."" 

""People ask about my education,"" says Gareth, ""but from the start, wherever we go, someone has always come to teach me. I use the same books as everyone back at school, and I have a computer. I've never fallen behind my classmates.""

Eight-eighteen News is a news agency for young people aged 8 to 18. We gather news and write reports, stories, and articles. These are sent to major national and local newspapers, magazines, television, radio, and websites for publication. You can read or listen to the news stories and articles by our members on the Eight-eighteen website.

We have three centers across the country where young people can meet others and participate in projects, and we plan to open more centers soon. Since our agency began in 1994, originally called 'Young News', over 2,500 young people have joined. Sophie is one of them. She says: ""I first learned about Eight-eighteen when they interviewed me for an article about young people's views on hip hop music. I was in a room with young journalists and was impressed by the opportunities they had. Age didn’t matter; they were trusted to handle stories independently. I started attending the Eight-eighteen center in my city, received training, and was a member until I turned 18. Eight-eighteen helped me achieve more than I thought I could. With the skills I gained, I got a job at 19 and am now the youngest employee at a major news website, checking articles before they are published.""

**Get Involved at Every Level**

When you join Eight-eighteen, you will receive training and participate in monthly meetings to decide who will write each news story. Eight-eighteen promotes skill-sharing among members. 'Peer trainers' are experienced members aged 12 and older who train new members and teach them basic journalism skills. As they gain more experience, some members present sessions to young people and adults outside of Eight-eighteen, often in youth clubs and summer camps. These young trainers are always supported by older staff who accompany them on these trips.

These flights take you over Antarctica and back. The exact dates for next year are not confirmed yet, but if you book now, your deposit can be moved to a different date if needed.

**Questions**

Here are answers to common questions about our flights.

**How long is the flight?**  
The average flight lasts 12 hours. About four hours into the flight, we usually see the first sea ice and icebergs. We spend four hours flying over Antarctica and the rest of the time returning home. During the flight, experts who have worked in Antarctica give talks about the environment and history, and they answer your questions. There is a camera next to the pilot that shows a view from the cockpit throughout the flight.

**Will I get a seat next to a window?**  
All passengers receive two boarding passes. At the halfway point of the flight, you will be asked to move to the seat indicated on your second boarding pass. Business and first-class passengers will have a window seat for half of the flight and a seat next to a window for the other half. Economy passengers will have either a window seat or a seat next to a window for half of the flight and an aisle seat for the other half. While flying over Antarctica, we encourage passengers to move around the plane to enjoy the views. The pilot flies in long 'figure 8s' over interesting sights so that everyone can see well from both sides of the plane.

**What happens if the weather is bad?**  
We have 17 different approved flight plans. On the morning of the flight, our captain checks the satellite images of the clouds and chooses the direction with the best views.

**Will I see penguins and other wildlife?**  
Most Antarctic wildlife lives at sea level, which is over 3,000 meters below the plane, so we cannot see them clearly. We do not land in Antarctica for environmental reasons. To see Antarctic wildlife, you would need to join a boat tour.

**Can I take photographs?**  
Yes! All cameras are welcome. We even offer some fun photo opportunities on board where you can try on Antarctic cold weather clothes."
PET_35,"**Text: Little Chefs**

A group of children aged ten to fifteen spends their Saturdays learning how to cook. Their small classes are very popular, and there is a waiting list of 30 children who want to join. Parents pay £280 for the course, where children can have fun and learn to make good food. 

Bill, who is ten years old, says, ""I love my mum's cooking, and now I can do it better than her. The teachers make us laugh, especially when we sit down to share the food we've made."" 

Flora, who is twelve, has some trouble with onions. She says, ""I love cooking. I made a meal for ten friends, and they really enjoyed it. My mum suggested I find a hobby instead of doing nothing on weekends. I was happy at home, so I wasn't very interested at first. But I'm really glad I decided to come."" 

Their teacher, Philippe, says, ""It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, even if the kitchen isn't always tidy when they cook! As adults, we keep learning more about food. If parents get their children interested in cooking when they are young, they will have the skills to cook for themselves when they leave home."""
PET_5,"**Winter Driving**

Winter can be dangerous because it is hard to predict what will happen, and accidents can happen easily. Fog may appear suddenly over a hill. Ice can be hidden under melting snow, ready to cause you to lose control. A car coming towards you might slide unexpectedly across the road.

**Rule Number One** for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly. Sudden movements can make it hard to control your car. When you turn the wheel, brake, or speed up, do it gently and slowly. Imagine you have a full cup of hot coffee next to you. Drive carefully so you don’t spill it.

**Rule Number Two** is to be aware of your surroundings. The more ice there is, the further ahead you should look. Test how long it takes to stop by braking gently. Remember, you might be driving faster than you think. Generally, allow double your normal stopping distance on wet roads, three times this distance on snow, and even more on ice. Try to keep control of your car at all times to avoid problems."
PET_41,"**Craigie Aitchison**

The painter Craigie Aitchison was born in Scotland. He moved to London to study law but chose to attend art school instead. He found the traditional drawing classes challenging, but he continued to paint. In his late twenties, the Italian government funded his art studies, and he became interested in early Italian artists, which is reflected in some of his work. He loved the greens and browns of the Italian countryside and the bright light there, and he wanted to capture this light in his paintings. This inspired him to layer colors from light to dark, although he admits he is never certain of the outcome. He says, ""It's a secret - because I don't know myself. I don't start by painting yellow, knowing I'm going to put anything on top.""

Like many talented artists, Aitchison makes it seem easy. ""Anyone can do the colors - you can buy them. I just pay attention to what colors are next to each other."" Unlike some artists, he does not create sketches before starting a painting, as he believes that doing so might make him lose interest in the final piece. Instead, Aitchison often changes his paintings multiple times before they are complete. This is why he prefers to work with models who do not ask to see their portraits while he is painting. ""If I feel they're worried and want to look at the painting, I can't do it.""

Since moving to London, he has not felt connected to the Scottish art scene. He claims he is not interested in following any tradition and simply paints in his own way. Nevertheless, his work continues to inspire young British painters."
PET_38,"**Text: 'Rock Band'**

Two years ago, our 14-year-old son, Ben, asked us for a drum set for his birthday. At first, we were against it because of the noise. Ben argued, ""It's better than watching TV or playing video games in my free time, and it will keep me out of trouble."" In the end, we agreed. We said, ""Okay, but you must think about the rest of the family and the neighbors when you play.""

That was just the start. Since drums are hard to move, Ben's band members began coming to our house with their guitars and other equipment. Now, for several hours each week, our house shakes with their music and singing. At least Ben's hobby has been good for our health: whenever the band practices, my husband and I go for a long walk. 

I must admit that, even though their music can sound a bit strange, they are a friendly and polite group of young men. I cannot judge their musical talent; after all, I didn't expect my parents to like the same music I did when I was a teenager. They do play regularly in local clubs for young people. 

Our main concern is that they might not spend enough time on their schoolwork because of their music, but this hasn't happened yet. I always remind Ben how important his studies are. One thing is clear: Ben was right; playing music has kept him out of trouble and he is never bored."
PET_17,"**Text: Atlantic College**

Last week, I visited Atlantic College, a great private college in Wales. It offers students valuable experiences outside the classroom, along with the chance to study for their exams. The students, aged 16 to 18 and from all over the world, study in the morning. In the afternoon, they participate in useful activities, such as helping on a farm, caring for people with learning difficulties, or checking rivers for pollution.

One of the best things about Atlantic College is its diverse student body, coming from various social backgrounds and countries. Since many students cannot afford the fees of £20,000 for two years, financial aid is available. About a quarter of the students are British, and many can only attend because they receive government support.

""I really admire the college for promoting international understanding among young people,"" said Barbara Molenkamp, a student from the Netherlands. ""You learn to live with and respect others, even those you may not like. During the summer holidays, my mother noticed I argued much less with my sister.""

In summary, Atlantic College provides an excellent education through effective methods."
PET_47,"Text: 'Being an Older Student

At 32, I have just completed my first year at university. I attend lectures regularly and have learned to read books quickly and write long essays. I decided to go to university after being away from school for fourteen years. As a secretary, I earned a decent salary, but I felt bored because my job did not challenge me. I became increasingly unhappy with the thought of being stuck in that job. I envied the students at the local university, who seemed happy, carefree, and full of hope, and I wanted to be part of that experience.

Now that I am a student, I find it difficult to connect with younger classmates. They often mistake me for a lecturer and ask me questions I cannot answer. I also feel distant from the lecturers because, even though we are the same age, I know much less than they do. However, I am grateful for this chance to study because I understand that a qualification is necessary for a rewarding job, which is very important to me. Unlike most eighteen-year-olds, I prefer spending my weekends with my books rather than going out to parties. I also enjoy the typical student benefits, like long holidays and discounts for theatre and cinema.

I often worry about what I will do after university, but I hope that continuing my education at this stage in my life has been a wise decision.'"
PET_48,"**Henry Ford**

Henry Ford was born on a farm in Michigan in 1863, but he did not enjoy farming. At the age of fifteen, he started working as a mechanic, and in 1893, he built his first car. After driving it for 1,500 kilometers, he sold it and created two larger cars. In 1903, he founded the Ford Motor Company. By using strong yet light steel, he made affordable cars for regular people. In 1908, he produced the first Ford Model 'T', which cost $825. Soon, he was selling 100 cars every day. By 1927, the Ford Motor Company was valued at $700 million. Early Ford cars were simple and inexpensive, but this simplicity sometimes meant fewer options. Henry Ford famously said about the Model T, ""You can have any color you like, as long as it's black."""

Rebecca Stevens was the first woman to climb Mount Everest. Before climbing the highest mountain in the world, she worked as a journalist and lived in a small flat in south London. In 1993, Rebecca left her job and family to travel to Asia with other climbers. She discovered that life on Everest is very difficult. ""You must carry everything on your back,"" she said, ""so you can only take what you really need. You can't wash on the mountain, and in the end, I didn't even take a toothbrush. I usually like to be clean, but there is no water, only snow. Water is very heavy, so you only take enough to drink!""

When Rebecca reached the top of Mount Everest on May 17, 1993, it was the best moment of her life. Suddenly, she became famous. Now, she has written a book about her journey, and people often ask her to speak about it. She also has a new job on a science program on television. Rebecca is well-known today and has more money, but she still lives in her small flat in south London, surrounded by her pictures and books about mountains!"

KET_13,"**Text: CANADA GEESE**

Canada Geese are large birds with blue and white feathers. When autumn comes, they must fly south to find warmer weather. The winters in Canada are very cold, and the birds cannot survive if they stay there. Last spring, Bill Lishman discovered sixteen young Canada Geese on his farm. They had lost their parents. Bill thought, ""These young birds will not know how to migrate in the autumn."" 

Bill owned a small plane and decided to teach the birds to follow him. Throughout the summer, he took short flights in his plane, and the young geese followed him. When autumn arrived and the weather turned cold, Bill flew to Virginia in the United States, which is 600 miles south of his home in Canada. The geese followed him all the way.

After reaching Virginia, Bill left the geese there and returned home. This spring, he waited for the birds to come back, but they did not arrive. So, Bill flew back to Virginia to find them. He searched for two weeks but could not locate them. When he returned home, he was surprised to find the geese waiting for him. They had managed to find their way home without his help!"
KET_16,"**ESTHER'S STORY**

When Esther finished school at sixteen, her aunt Flory gave her £500 for her birthday. While most of Esther's friends chose to go to college, Esther decided to use her aunt's money to start her own business. She bought fruit, sugar, and glass jars to make jam. She sold the jam for £1 a jar to her friends and quickly earned back her aunt's £500.

At first, Esther's parents were not supportive of her jam-making. They wanted her to study and hoped she would become a teacher or a doctor. However, Esther ignored their advice and continued making jam. After a few months, she began selling it at the local market. She also started making orange juice, which she sold to a school where a friend worked.

After two years, her business grew significantly, and her parents were proud of her. She made various types of food to sell to shops and supermarkets. She became so busy that she needed to hire some employees to help her."

KET_46,"**Corryvale Farm**

Corryvale Farm is located in the west of England. Stephen and Jenny Blackler raise cows and chickens and sell milk and eggs. However, most of their income comes from Jenny's sheep. She has 50 sheep, and each sheep produces enough wool for six sweaters. Every six months, Stephen shears the wool from the sheep to keep them cool. 

Five years ago, Jenny made some sweaters from the wool and tried to sell them at local markets. Unfortunately, it was summer and too hot for people to buy sweaters. Instead, she made socks, which everyone loved because they were affordable, durable, and easy to clean. This is how Jenny's business began. 

At first, she made the socks at home, but soon she had thousands of customers, so she had to send the wool to a factory where machines now produce all the socks. There are six colors, five sizes for all ages, and different types of socks for walkers, athletes, and skiers. Jenny is busiest during Christmas because Corryvale socks are a popular gift. On the walls of her office, there are many letters from satisfied customers from around the world."

KET_10,"**Text: 'BURGLARS PREFER THE AFTERNOON'**

Most house burglaries occur between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m., according to the police. Inspector Ian Saunders informed our newspaper that the number of house burglaries has increased by over 30% compared to last year. He also mentioned that 67% of burglaries happen when people leave their homes and forget to lock a door or a window. He noted that burglaries at night are rare because families are usually at home then. However, winter afternoons are the best time for burglars since it is dark and they can hide easily. Many houses are often empty during this time because people are still at work.

Inspector Saunders suggested that it is wise to leave lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when going on holiday. This can help deter burglars. He also encouraged neighbors to keep an eye on each other's houses when someone is away. They should call the police if they notice anything suspicious. ""We will also provide advice on how to make your house safe,"" Inspector Saunders said. ""This kind of help is free."""

KET_44,"**The History of Farming**

Before farming began, people searched forests for plants and fruits to eat. This meant they had to move constantly to find food. However, around 12,000 years ago in the Middle East, people started to grow their own food. These individuals were the first farmers. Farming allowed people to settle in one place, leading to the growth of larger villages. Some villagers could then focus on other jobs, like making clothes, because farmers provided food for everyone. Unfortunately, farming could be challenging during bad weather, which sometimes left people without enough food. Today, farmers can produce more food, which can travel thousands of kilometers to reach our homes."

My working hours are usually from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., but sometimes I work from 1 p.m. to 9 p.m. At work, the first thing I do is check flight schedules on my computer, and then I talk with some of the flight attendants. Occasionally, I go on long flights to see how the flight attendants are performing. That is my favorite part of the job, but I enjoy office work as well. Traveling can be tiring.

This is not because they have a lot of homework. They have created a new computer word game. The idea for the game came from Frazer's younger brother, Kevin, who has difficulties with reading. Kevin learns words better by seeing pictures and hearing sounds than by reading. His brother wanted to help him. Frazer and Peter worked together for over 200 hours to develop the game, and now it is ready to use. It is a speaking and picture game. For example, when you see the word 'hat', there is a drawing of a hat next to it, and you can hear Peter saying 'Hat! Hat!' at the same time.

Since its first film in 1913, Bollywood has created over 29,000 films, which is more than the USA, making it the largest film industry in the world. Most Indians prefer watching films to any other leisure activity, with ten million people visiting cinemas every day. Bollywood films often tell romantic love stories, and singing and dancing are key elements in every film. These films are also popular outside India. Last year, Bollywood earned over $500 million by selling its films to other countries. Indian actors make more films each year than American actors in Hollywood, but they earn less money. This is why most Bollywood films cost around $2 million to produce, while Hollywood films usually cost at least $5 million. Most Bollywood actors are young and work hard, but only for a few years. Amitabh Bachchan, often considered India's greatest actor, is an exception. He has starred in more than 140 films over a career that has lasted almost 40 years."

KET_26,"**Text: Line Dancing**

Many people in Britain have taken up a new hobby: line dancing. In nearly every town, there are clubs and classes for this activity. 

""Line dancing is easy to learn. If you can walk, you can do it!"" says Fiona Lever, a teacher. ""You don’t need a partner because you dance in groups. It’s a great way to meet new friends. In my classes, there are people of all ages. The boys enjoy it because they can make a lot of noise with their feet while dancing!""

When did line dancing start? Most people believe it began about fifteen years ago when American country music became popular in Britain."
KET_8,"**The Rhino**

There are five types of rhinos in the world today. The Black and White Rhinos live in the open fields of Africa, while the other types live in forests in Asia. All rhinos have large, heavy bodies. Their skin is very tough, and they have very little hair. A rhino stands on four short legs, and each foot has three toes. They usually walk slowly, but they can run at speeds of up to 50 kilometers per hour. Rhinos are generally quiet and calm animals, and they eat grass and other plants. A baby rhino weighs about 40 kilos when it is born and stays inside its mother for around fifteen months. An adult rhino weighs over 200 kilos and can live for up to 50 years."
KET_4,"**THE HISTORY OF THE LONDON POLICE**

Today, there are police officers everywhere, but in 1700, London had no police force. A few elderly men tried to protect the streets at night, but they were not paid much. About 300 years ago, London was growing larger. The city was very dirty, and many people lived in poverty. There were many thieves who stole money in the streets, causing people to stay at home as much as possible. 

In 1750, Henry Fielding began to pay a group of individuals to stop the thieves. They were similar to police officers and were called 'Bow Street Runners' because they worked near Bow Street. Fifty years later, there were 120 Bow Street Runners, but London had grown so large that it needed more police. So, in 1829, the first Metropolitan Police Force was established with 3,000 officers. Most of the men patrolled on foot, while a few rode horses. Until 1920, all police officers in London were men. Today, London police officers are well paid, and those who still ride horses earn even more than the others."
KET_30,"Text: 'TO ALL STUDENTS: Would you like to join a camping trip this weekend? We will travel to the forest by school bus and stay at a campsite from Friday to Sunday. The campsite has hot showers and a small shop, and you can rent bicycles there. The cost of the trip is £25. It gets very cold at night, so please bring warm clothes and wear sturdy shoes. If you want to come, let me know today. Ahmed, Student Secretary'"
KET_7,"Text: 'Visit the Edinburgh Festival! Every year, many people travel to Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland, to enjoy the Edinburgh Festival. For three weeks in August and September, the city is filled with actors and artists from around the world. They come to Edinburgh for the largest arts festival in Britain. During this time, the streets are full of music and dance from morning until night. You can even see artists painting in the streets. One of the highlights of the Festival is the 'Fringe', where students perform comedy shows in small venues and cafes. Many tourists visit the Festival to watch new films and plays and listen to music from famous musicians. This year, there are over five hundred performances featuring actors from more than forty countries. Tickets for these shows are quite affordable, and it is often easier to see your favorite star in Edinburgh than in London. So, plan to visit Edinburgh next summer, but remember that finding a room can be challenging, so consider booking your hotel now!'"
KET_43,"**ICE-FISHING**

If you drive north from Toronto for three hours, you will reach Lake Nipissing. In winter, the lake freezes, and many Canadian fishermen go there every weekend. They build small wooden houses on the ice and paint them in bright colors. Inside these houses, they try to catch fish that swim beneath the ice. Bob Marvisch has been coming here for twenty-five years during this season. 

""You need clothes that are light but warm: two pairs of socks and gloves, several thin sweaters, and a snow suit on top,"" he says. ""Catching fish is easy. First, you break the ice and make a small round hole. Then, you take a fishing line and put some bread on it. You put the line through the hole and into the water. You pull the line up when the fish eat the bread. The fish are between ten and twenty centimeters long. Some people like to eat them, but when I catch three or four fish, I prefer to have some chocolate or another snack! Today, I have caught twenty-five! It's a great sport, and you can meet nice people here!"""

From: Greg  
To: Anna  

Hi Anna,  

I'm having a tough week! Yesterday, my team played a volleyball match, but we lost. The other team was much better than us! Then, my friend Jeff, who lives in Australia, called with bad news. He can't visit us during the holidays because he got a summer job. We can't go camping together now. This morning, my sister woke up late and took my bike to school without telling me. I'm really upset with her. I hope you have some good news! Please write back today if you can.

KET_11,"Text: 'Madame Tussaud's Museum is a well-known attraction for tourists in London. Visitors can see wax figures of famous individuals. Madame Tussaud was born in France in 1761. Her uncle, a doctor, created wax figures and opened a museum in Paris. Marie assisted him in this work. In 1789, during the French Revolution, Marie was imprisoned. While in prison, she had to create wax heads of famous people who had died, including Queen Marie Antoinette. In 1795, Marie married Francois Tussaud, and in 1802, she moved to London with her wax figures. She opened a museum there, and her figures can still be seen today.'"
KET_14,"**BICYCLES**

Bicycles are an affordable and environmentally friendly way to travel. The first bicycle was created about 150 years ago. Initially, bicycles were costly, and only wealthy individuals could afford them. These early bicycles looked very different from modern ones. Over time, as bicycles became less expensive, more people started to buy them. Many began using bicycles to commute to work and for leisure activities. 

Today, cars are used more than bicycles because they are faster and keep you dry in the rain. However, some people still choose to ride bicycles to work. They argue that there are too many cars in city centers, making it hard to find parking."
KET_63,"Text: 'The Elephant Show by Daniel Allsop, age 14

Last summer, I went to Thailand for a beach holiday with my family. One day, we visited a park near our hotel. It had beautiful flower gardens, but we were mainly interested in the elephant show. We went directly to a large area with seats on three sides. Three elephants entered with their keepers and stood in front of a big piece of white card. Each elephant was given a paintbrush and began to paint on its own card. Occasionally, the keepers gave a new brush full of paint to each elephant and took the old one away. Slowly, following their keepers' instructions, the elephants created pictures on the cards. I couldn't believe my eyes! One picture showed a river, another a tree, and the third a bunch of flowers. When the keepers displayed the paintings, everyone wanted to buy one. We fed the elephants the bananas we had brought for our lunch. Twenty years ago, elephants worked in the forest. Now, they no longer work there, but the smartest of these animals live in special centers where visitors can watch them.'"
KET_56,"**Text: Big Cats**

There are many types of cats, and they vary in size, appearance, and behavior. Tigers are the largest cats, measuring up to 3.7 meters from head to tail. While most cats dislike water, tigers often enjoy lying in pools when it is hot. Lions are unique because they live in large family groups. These lions often work together to hunt for food. They typically inhabit flat, open areas where they can see far and track other animals easily. All cats require good eyesight to catch smaller animals for food. They also need to be fast and strong."
KET_36,"Text: 'Dear Mrs. Brian, I am sorry, but I cannot attend your class anymore because I must return to my country. My sister is getting married next month, and I want to go shopping with her to choose a dress. My parents will prepare a big meal for the guests, and there will be much work in the kitchen. I regret leaving the English class. You are a wonderful teacher. Please say goodbye to the other students for me. Thank you again. Best wishes, Soraya.'"

Dear Joan,  

Thank you for your letter. I received it this morning. Yes, I would love to see you. How about meeting outside my office at one o'clock? There is a nice Italian restaurant nearby. Do you like Italian food? I need to be back at work by two o'clock, so please try to be on time!

KET_33,"Text: 'Dear Lorna, How are you? I am happy because last month I started a new job in the city center. I work at a Tourist Information Office, and it is very interesting. I begin work every morning at 7:30, so I have to wake up very early! I enjoy this job because I meet people from many different countries. I like sharing information about our city with them. Here is a photo of me in my new uniform. Do you like it? Love, Gloria'"
KET_20,"Text: 'THE OSTRICH The ostrich is the largest bird in the world, weighing over 90 kilos. Most wild ostriches are found in southern Africa, but their numbers are low. Like all birds, ostriches have wings, but they cannot fly. They use their wings to help them turn while running. Ostriches can run very fast, reaching speeds of 65 to 90 kilometres an hour, making it hard for predators to catch them. Baby ostriches are the size of chickens and take about 3 years to grow into adults. They eat plants and can survive for many days without water.'"
KET_40,"Text: 'Victoria Jamieson, a 23-year-old snowboarder from Britain, began snowboarding at the age of 20. She has won many competitions in this sport. We spoke to her last week at a snowboarding competition in Switzerland and asked her why she chose to start snowboarding. She said, ""I have always enjoyed sports, especially skiing, so it felt natural to try snowboarding. It’s easy to learn, and you can become quite skilled in just a few months."" 

When we asked her about practice, she replied, ""In winter, I snowboard in the mountains every day from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. I also run and bike. I love all of it! I enjoy the competitions and being in the mountains; it’s so beautiful. But free-riding, which is when you do what you want outside of competitions, is the best part for me."" 

We also asked her what is important for beginners. She explained, ""You can learn quickly, but you need lessons. It’s also essential to have the right clothing to stay dry because, at first, you will fall a lot!""'"

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I would like to book a room at your hotel for three nights, from September 15th to 17th. I prefer a single room with a shower and a telephone. Could I please have a quiet room on the ground floor? I will be driving to the hotel. Is there a parking area available? I expect to arrive around 10:30 p.m. What time does the restaurant close in the evening? If possible, I would appreciate a meal upon my arrival. Thank you for your assistance.  

Yours faithfully,

KET_64,"**Text: Mount Kilimanjaro**

Mount Kilimanjaro is the tallest mountain in Africa. Many people have climbed it, including a seven-year-old boy and an 87-year-old man. There are several routes to the summit. The Marangu route, which is five kilometers long, is considered the easiest. It usually takes about five days to complete and is very popular with tourists. However, only half of the climbers who attempt to reach the summit succeed. This is often due to sudden changes in the weather. At the start, it can be hot and rainy, but at the top, climbers encounter ice and snow, and temperatures can drop below 20 degrees Celsius. Climbers should bring both sunglasses and warm clothing!"
KET_29,"**Text: Otters**

Not many people have seen an otter. These animals live near rivers and build their homes from small pieces of wood. They usually come out at night. Otters are excellent swimmers and can swim faster than 10 kilometers per hour. They have thick brown fur that keeps them warm in the water. An otter can close its ears and nose, allowing it to stay underwater for several minutes. 

Twenty years ago, there were few otters in Great Britain because the rivers were very polluted, which caused many fish and insects to die, leaving otters without food. However, today there is plenty of food for them because the rivers are clean again."
KET_57,"Text: 'Dear Deshini, 

I am happy that you are my new penfriend. My name is Tom, and I am fifteen years old. I was born in Canada, but I now live in England. Please write to me and tell me about your life in India.

Dear Carlos, 

Hotels in the center are costly, but I have good news. I talked to my aunt Gloria, and she said you can all stay at her house. It has more bedrooms than my house! That will be fine with you, right?

KET_59,"**Text: Buildings**

People have always created buildings. We need houses to keep us warm and dry, and we build stadiums to watch football matches and concerts. We also use buildings like museums to display beautiful items. Many people work together on a building project. The architect decides how the building will look and creates drawings to share their ideas. Engineers ensure the building is strong and safe. Then, workers carefully construct it. 

The Sydney Opera House is a famous modern building with a beautiful roof. However, the building is attractive from all sides, not just the top. Another well-known roof is on the Olympic Stadium in Munich. This unique building resembles a tent made of glass."
KET_54,"Text: 'Indre, I need your help. Can you go shopping with me tomorrow? My grandmother will turn 80 next month, and she is having a party on Saturday. The issue is that I don't have anything to wear. I have grown so much that all my trousers are too short! I want to buy some new ones and maybe a pair of boots. I don't have a lot of money, but I think it will be enough. Would you like to meet in the morning or the afternoon? Let me know. Sarika'"
KET_32,"Text: 'The Cerne Giant

Sherborne and Dorchester are two towns in southern England that are close to each other. Between them, there are many green hills and fields. On one of these hills is a large figure of a man. This figure is called the Cerne Giant because the nearby village is named Cerne. It is not clear when the Cerne Giant was created, but many believe it was a long time ago. You can walk from Cerne to get closer to the figure. If you visit on the first of May at sunrise, you will see the villagers dancing around the giant on the hill.'"
KET_61,"**Text: Gail Rollins**

Gail Rollins is one of the best runners in Edinburgh. This summer, she wants to compete in the 10,000 metres and possibly the 5,000 metres at the European Championships. In the past, Gail was known for finishing second in major competitions. However, she always smiled and laughed, which made people in her city love her. Everything changed in 2004 when she ran her first half-marathon, a long road race. She won with a very good time, the fastest of any British woman that year.

Gail's manager and husband, Mike Rollins, used to race when he was younger, but he had to stop because he hurt his right leg. He can still run a little and sometimes trains with Gail. However, it is not fun for Mike when Gail runs faster than him and he cannot keep up. 

Gail trains hard. She does a long run in the morning and fast runs in the afternoon, but she always takes a break from running on Sundays. Mike says, ""I am with her all the time. Sometimes I ask, 'Are you sure you should be eating that?' It's usually cakes, but she can eat almost anything."""
KET_52,"**Text: Piano Players - Their Early Years**

**Ivan Petrov**  
Ivan was born on a farm in Russia. From the age of twelve to eighteen, he studied in Poland. His first music teacher could not play the piano but taught him and his sister songs from operas. His mother started teaching him the piano when he was six. At ten, he decided he wanted to write music and soon began his first song.

**Oleg Gagarin**  
Oleg was the youngest of five children. When he was four, his father, who enjoyed playing the piano, taught him some traditional Russian music. At six, he began lessons with a piano teacher in his city. Oleg quickly started winning prizes for his piano playing. At fourteen, he attended a music college in Austria for two years before returning to Russia.

**Josef Heptmann**  
Josef's father was German and taught music in Poland, where Josef was born. The family moved to Germany when Josef was two, and a year later, he began playing the piano. He gave his first concert at six years old. At ten, he performed fifty-two concerts in two months during a trip to England! Josef loved music but was also interested in physics and languages. He is very busy now, but one day he hopes to write his own music."
KET_28,"**Text: Bill Prince-Smith**

Bill Prince-Smith was a farmer, teacher, and dentist before he became a writer of children's books at the age of 60. Now, thirteen years later, he has written over 80 books. Every day, he goes to his office to write. In the evening, he gives his work to his wife to read. ""She tells me when she doesn't like something,"" says Bill. ""My ten grandchildren don’t live nearby, but they also read my stories and tell me if they are good or bad."" This way, Bill has learned what young children enjoy reading. 

Bill writes about life in his village and the farms around it. His favorite book is his fifth one: *The Sheepdog*, which is about a farmer and the dog that helps him. ""I have always liked animals,"" says Bill, ""and dogs are very clever; they learn quickly."" Last year, the book was made into a film with real animals and actors. The filmmakers used the latest technology to make it seem like the animals are speaking. Bill was very happy with the film. ""Sometimes filmmakers change books, but they didn’t change mine, and I love the film."""
KET_35,"**POSTCARDS**

Today, many people enjoy sending postcards to friends and family. These postcards usually feature images of beaches, mountains, or castles, and you can write a message on the back. Many individuals send postcards while on holiday because they are inexpensive, and the images are often nicer than personal photos. The first postcard was sent at the end of the nineteenth century, and it showed a picture of a seaside town. Later, postcards included images related to current events, such as accidents or visits from important people. People appreciated these postcards because newspapers at that time did not include pictures."
KET_5,"Text: 'Dinosaurs

No one has ever seen a dinosaur. The last dinosaurs died about 60 million years ago, long before humans existed. The exact reason for their extinction is still unknown. Birds are the closest living relatives of dinosaurs. Dinosaurs varied greatly in appearance, with over 5,000 different species. Some were very small, while others were enormous. The largest dinosaurs were bigger than any other land animals that have ever existed. For instance, the Brontosaurus was twenty meters long and primarily ate plants. The Tyrannosaurus Rex was smaller but much stronger, equipped with sharp teeth for eating meat and long back legs that allowed it to run quickly.'"
KET_41,"Text: 'BEARS Bears can be dangerous animals. An adult bear is very strong and can kill a person. Bears are skilled at climbing trees and can run very fast. However, they do not see well and, like most animals, they use their noses to find food. There are seven types of bears: The largest is the white polar bear, which can be nearly three meters tall. There are two types of black bears: one lives in the forests of North America, and the other in Southeast Asia. Not all black bears are black; they can be dark brown or reddish-brown. The black and white panda bear, which comes from China, is loved by many. Today, not many pandas live in the forest because it is hard for them to find food.'"
KET_38,"**CROCODILES**

Crocodiles are found in tropical regions of the world, such as Africa, South America, and Northern Australia. They usually live in slow-moving water but can swim quickly and move fast on land. You often see crocodiles in large groups. They eat a variety of things, including fish, birds, and small animals. Sometimes, they also eat larger animals or even people. There are more than ten species of crocodile, and they all have very sharp teeth. Although they often lose teeth, they quickly grow new ones. Crocodiles are typically about 3.5 meters long, but some can be much larger. They have long lifespans; the oldest crocodile in a zoo lived to be 66 years old."
KET_17,"Text: 'A HISTORY OF AIR TRAVEL In 1783, two French brothers created the first balloon that could carry people into the sky. One hundred and twenty years later, in 1903, the Wright brothers built the first powered airplane and flew it in the United States. In 1918, the US Post Office started the first airmail service. Airplanes changed significantly over the next thirty years. Then, in the 1950s, airplanes became much faster because they were equipped with jet engines. In 1976, Concorde was developed in the UK and France. It is the fastest passenger airplane in the world, capable of flying at 2500 kilometers per hour, making the trip from London to New York just four hours long. Today, millions of people fly on airplanes, and it is hard to imagine a world without them.'"
KET_47,"**The Globe Theatre**

Visiting the theatre in London 400 years ago was very different from today. The building was round, had no roof, and people got cold and wet if the weather was bad. The queen enjoyed going to the Globe Theatre, by the River Thames, to see the plays of William Shakespeare. At that time, all the actors were men. Visitors ate, talked to friends, walked around during the show, and some even threw things at the actors! Today, you can still visit the Globe Theatre. A new theatre is in the same place by the river. You can enjoy a Shakespeare play there or learn about life in the seventeenth century."
