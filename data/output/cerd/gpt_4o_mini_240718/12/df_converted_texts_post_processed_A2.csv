**Garbage in, garbage out**
Charging families for each bag of rubbish they throw away seems like a good idea for the environment and money. But it might not be. In many developed countries, people have regular rubbish collection. Rubbish bags or bins are taken away by a special truck to a dump. This service is usually free. Families pay for it through local taxes, but a family that throws away a lot of rubbish pays the same as a couple that throws away very little. However, collecting rubbish is not free. The more rubbish people throw away, the more trucks and workers are needed, and the more money local governments spend on dumping it.
If rubbish disposal is free, people will throw away too much rubbish. A solution is to make families pay for the rubbish they throw away. This could encourage them to throw away less and recycle more, if local governments provide places to recycle.
Two American economists, Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman, studied towns in the U.S. that started charging families for rubbish. The most common way was to sell stickers that families put on their rubbish bags. Only bags with these stickers were picked up each week. In a study about a town called Charlottesville, Virginia, residents paid 80 cents for each tagged bag of rubbish. 
At first, this seemed like a good idea. The number of bags thrown away dropped by 37%. But many people just packed more rubbish into each bag instead of buying more stickers. This is not as good as using machines to compact rubbish at dumps. The total weight of rubbish collected only fell by 14%. In other towns without a pricing system, the weight of rubbish also fell, but by only 3.5%.
Some people even dumped their rubbish illegally instead of paying for collection. This illegal dumping might be responsible for 30-40% of the reduction in collected rubbish. However, there was a 15% increase in recycling, which means people chose to recycle instead of paying to throw away their rubbish. But many people were already recycling before the new fees.
In another study, Fullerton and Kinnaman looked at rubbish in more detail. They found that charging for rubbish does reduce the amount thrown away, but not by much. A 10% increase in sticker prices only cuts rubbish by 0.3%. This is less than in other studies. To throw away much less rubbish, people would need to buy less of everything. A small tax on rubbish is unlikely to change much.
In richer towns, people throw away more rubbish than in poorer towns, and they have less time to recycle. Should we say that charging families for rubbish is a bad idea? Not really, because free disposal is too cheap. But simple ideas can have complicated effects. We often need complex economic models to understand them, and sometimes the results are not good. 
**Questions:**
1. What do families pay for rubbish collection?
2. What happens if rubbish disposal is free?
3. What did the sticker system in Charlottesville charge?
4. How much did the number of rubbish bags fall?
5. What did some people do instead of paying for rubbish collection?
6. Did recycling increase or decrease after the new fees?"

Theodore Zeldin talks about how our work life could change. Do you feel respected and appreciated at your job? Success in a career is not enough anymore. Many people feel that their work is not valued or understood. Even famous people can feel unhappy despite their success. 
Loving your job used to be enough, but now you should think about how your job affects you as a person. This is an important question. If your skills make you boring and you cannot talk to others outside your job, then no amount of money or status will make you happy. 
I want to find out how work can help us feel fulfilled and happy, instead of just making us work for money. Work should be a way to live a good life, discover new talents, and meet different people. However, just getting rid of unemployment is not enough. As more people get educated, they want jobs that are interesting and meaningful.
Even jobs that used to be respected, like doctors and architects, can be stressful and unfulfilling. Many workers feel lost in their jobs and do not feel connected to their companies. In Britain, only 8% of workers feel that their values match those of their organizations.
I am studying different jobs to see how they affect people. I want to understand happiness, love, friendship, and respect. I am now looking for better ways to earn a living. Many experts focus on making companies richer, but we also need to think about ourselves as people and who we want to work with.
How many of us feel truly alive at work? Many people feel like they are stuck in their jobs, working just to survive. For example, 10% of workers are in hotels. Many smart and lively people work in hotels but are not happy with low pay and long hours. Hotels could be more than just places to sleep; they could be places where people from different cultures meet and connect.
Hotel workers often do not have deep relationships with guests. Hotels could be cultural centers, helping guests learn about the city and each other. If hotel owners listened to their workers' dreams, they could offer more services. But they often focus only on making money.
It is time to think about work in a new way. Work is about relationships. Many people want to feel independent at work and should be able to design their own jobs and choose their colleagues. This means they need to learn to communicate well with others, even if they seem very different.
Good communication is important, but it is not the same as real conversation. Real conversation creates a bond of respect and helps us understand each other better. Every time we have a meaningful conversation, we can change the world a little bit. 
**Questions:**
1. What does Theodore Zeldin think about success in a career?
2. Why is it important to think about how your job affects you as a person?
3. What percentage of workers in Britain feel their values match their organizations?
4. How can hotels be more than just places to sleep?
5. What does Zeldin say about communication and conversation?"
CPE_24,C2,"Broadcasting: The Social Shaping of a Technology**
The word 'broadcasting' comes from farming. It means to spread seeds widely by hand. This idea is about growth and getting a good harvest. It suggests that there are resources to help spread information. 
We need to think about why a new technology that sends words and pictures was organized in a way that fits this farming idea. Television is connected to other ways of communication, like the telegraph and the telephone. However, from the beginning, television was seen as a way to send information to many people at once. This was because of the social and economic structures of modern life. 
There were some attempts to create different ways of using television. In the early 1930s, radio fans in Britain tried to make two-way television, which could replace the telephone. Many science magazines wrote about how to build television equipment. But in 1938, big companies made rules for television that pushed out these amateur inventors. This was a missed chance for a different kind of television that was more equal and community-based.
In the early 1930s, television was mostly used in public places in the USA and other countries. For example, in Britain, many people watched television together in public. The idea of amateur two-way television did not succeed, and most television systems were made for public viewing. Companies wanted to sell television sets for homes, and as people had more money, they wanted to have entertainment at home. 
This change is happening all over the world. There is a link between social changes and how broadcasting works. As societies modernized, they became more centralized, and traditional communities broke apart. People became more mobile and often felt isolated compared to earlier communities. Centralized broadcasting helped governments share important information with everyone and created a sense of community in the nation.
Broadcasting became the main way to share information through radio and television. However, there is also a positive view of broadcasting as a way to support democracy. Between the World Wars, many countries saw broadcasting as a way to give everyone equal access to information for political and social participation.
Television is changing now, and the term broadcasting may not fit anymore. It may only refer to a specific way of sharing information during a certain time in history."
CPE_13,C2,"Clutter**
Sometimes, it feels like no matter how many things you own, you still do not feel safe. It is normal to want a home that meets your needs, but sometimes we want too many things. Advertisements make us feel insecure. They often tell us that if we do not have certain things, we are not good enough. 
To see how much advertising affects you, try not to look at any ads when you walk down the street. We see many ads on TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, t-shirts, and the internet. All of these ads tell us to buy more things.
**Caves**
Many researchers and universities study caves. They look at where caves come from, how water moves in them, and the plants and animals that live there. Caves are interesting and mysterious parts of nature. They make us curious and want to learn more. Because caves are important, many people study them, especially in places where caves affect our lives.
However, visiting caves can be difficult, so many cave studies are done by people who visit caves for fun, not just by scientists.
**Weather Watch**
A long time ago, many people started studying the weather just by watching it. Since the 17th century, weather study has become a science with many tools. Now, satellites and machines give us a lot of weather information very quickly. Computers can solve complex math problems much faster than people can.
Sometimes, weather science uses complicated words that are hard to understand. But human experience is still very important for making weather forecasts. What people observe can help scientists understand the weather better."
CPE_16,C2,"**MUSIC AND THEATRE**
Not long ago, I thought that opera was mainly theatre. Now, I think differently. After working at a national opera house, I learned that music is the most important part of opera. This is how it should be. I come from the world of theatre, where the words and the actors are very important. In theatre, there is no one directing the action once it starts, and the performers and the audience usually speak the same language.
At a music performance, like in a concert hall or an opera house, many people do not understand music very well. Some may feel embarrassed about what they do not know. Most people admire the skill of the musicians. A great singer or a good musician shows us the results of many years of hard work. Watching top-class music is like watching a sports match. We know that athletes do something similar to what we do when we run for a bus, but we see how much better they are.
Theatre audiences have different expectations. They often do not understand how hard acting is and may not be impressed when an actor says a long speech. They often ask, ""How do you learn all those lines?"" This does not mean that theatre audiences are less demanding than music audiences; many people enjoy both. In theatre, audiences and performers meet on more equal terms, no matter how difficult the play is.
Does music need to learn from theatre? I think yes. I have seen how a different approach can make the experience of concert-goers better. Live music is very theatrical, full of feelings, and can be surprising. However, the way music is often presented, with strict dress codes and a lot of respect for conductors and soloists, can make it feel like there is a big difference between the performers and the audience.
Sometimes, music audiences clap between songs or after a great performance. This is a way to show appreciation, but it can also interrupt the flow of the music. Is there a solution? Yes, many people are working to bring new audiences to concerts and opera houses. They want to make people feel that ""serious"" music is for everyone.
I remember a special event called ""In Search of Angels,"" where the performance moved from a cathedral to the town. It was a wonderful musical experience, and many audience members were not just there to watch but also to take part. I wish music could have more of the excitement and boldness that the best theatre can show. Sometimes, this can happen in unusual places, where normal expectations are changed. This can create surprising effects for both performers and audiences.
I know that most plays are done in a traditional way, similar to concerts. However, I believe that we can change how people experience music. I love theatre and music, and I want more people to enjoy them like I do."

**Sand**  
I think sand is interesting because it can be made into useful things like glass and concrete. But I do not like it when it is on the beach. To me, sand is a problem. It gets in my face, my food, and can even hide important things like car keys and coins. When I am wet, sand sticks to me and is hard to wash off. But when I step on a towel or walk on a clean floor, the sand falls off easily. For days, I find sand everywhere when I take off my shoes and socks. I do not want sand around me.
**Lock and Key**  
People have always wanted a safe home. A long time ago, they used simple locks. Now, we have electronic locks that use cards. But many people still prefer to use a real key. They feel safer with a key in their hand. One company made a new electronic lock but also included a real metal key because people like it better.
**Modern Art**  
I was nervous to visit the new Tate Modern gallery because I do not understand modern art very well. I like some pieces, especially the furry ones and bright light sculptures. I think if I learned more about art, I would have more opinions. The important thing is to enjoy the art, not just to study it. This gallery helps visitors understand the art better. I noticed that they have good labels that explain what the art means. This made it easier for me to enjoy the art instead of just looking at it without understanding."
CPE_46,C2,"Every Picture Tells a Story**
**Making Movies from Books**
When a book is made into a movie, many things are changed or taken out. This can be hard for the writer, but it can also help them see things in a new way. While writing a script, I noticed that I could remove a lot of the dialogue and descriptions from the book and still tell the same story. This does not mean that the original words were not important. It is about how people pay attention to stories in books and movies. 
In a book, some things are repeated to help readers remember characters and their traits. For example, we often see phrases like ""he said"" to show who is talking. This makes it easier to read. In plays, the dialogue often sounds like real conversations, but sometimes it can be too much and not clear.
**Watching Movies**
When we watch movies, we can feel like we are part of the story. It takes us away from our everyday lives, at least for the time of the film. But when the movie ends, we go back to reality. Some people think that watching movies is just for fun and not real art. Many older people, like our parents and teachers, enjoyed movies but did not see them as art.
**The Film Studios**
The Leiper Film Company studios were made up of many different buildings. It was hard to find your way around because there were many small rooms that looked the same. There were three main entrances, but none of them helped people find their way easily. Most people who worked there knew how to get around, but it was confusing for visitors. The workers created stories of romance and adventure that took people away from their everyday problems.
**Becoming a Filmmaker**
Many people want to make movies. Bookstores have many books about how to write scripts and make films. Universities offer classes, and there are contests to win cameras. Robert Rodriguez made a famous film called El Mariachi for only $7,000. He became a well-known director quickly. He wrote in his book that he wanted to make a great film before he turned 26, like famous directors did.
In the past, filmmakers had to work for a long time before making their first film. They learned by working as editors or writers. For example, John Huston was 35 when he made his first film, and Fred Zinnemann was in his forties. Now, many new filmmakers have to work alone without the help of big studios or television."

In the past, there were many council houses on the western side of the city. These houses were small and not very nice, made of orange brick or white plaster. In summer, there was a bad smell from a factory nearby. In the mornings, a paperboy often looked disgusted as he walked to deliver papers. I don’t remember much from my early life, but I have a memory of sitting by an upstairs window and looking at the houses far away. 
I also remember my mother. She was small, very precise, and often angry. I didn’t understand why she was angry, so I couldn’t make her feel better. Even as a child, I noticed that she was very lonely, even in a room full of people. She cared a lot about behaving properly, which was not common in our neighborhood. Sometimes, she would clean the house a lot or tell me to ""behave properly."" I didn’t really understand her rules. For example, I was not allowed to go into our neighbors' gardens or disturb their flowers. I had to sit quietly at the dining table, listening to the radio shows my mother liked. There were many rules I had to follow.
My mother had a few friends. There was Mrs. Buddery, who loved the Royal Family, Mrs. Winall, who didn’t say much, and Mrs. Laband, who was more lively. Looking back, I see that they often talked about their problems, like bad legs and cold weather. I often felt like I was part of their complaints.
Growing up in West Earlham was not easy. Until I was five, I stayed at home and bothered my parents. I remember long days playing on the floor while my mother sat in a chair. After I turned five, I went to Avenue Road infants school, which was half a mile away. Some lucky kids had mothers with bikes to take them. My mother usually let me walk with other children.
I remember summer holidays when I saw a little of the world outside West Earlham. There was an old man next door who told stories about his time at sea. Once, there was a charity event where a kind woman gave out lemonade and talked about helping others. My mother didn’t like this idea and said the people just wanted money. She often talked about how people were greedy, especially politicians. 
My mother did care about my education. Sometimes, she took me to the Norwich Castle Museum on the bus. We looked at paintings together. At first, she was unsure, but later she started to have her own opinions. I remember one time she saw a painting of a Roman soldier and joked, ""I wouldn’t want to meet him at night!"" This was a rare moment of humor from her. 
**Questions:**
1. What did the council houses look like?
2. What smell was common in the summer?
3. How did the paperboy feel in the mornings?
4. Describe the mother in the text.
5. What were some of the rules the mother had?
6. Who were the mother's friends?
7. What did the narrator remember about summer holidays?
8. How did the mother feel about charity events?
9. What did the mother and child do at the museum?
10. Can you remember a time when the mother made a joke? What was it about?"
CPE_10,C2,"Philadelphia Avenue**
I walked down Philadelphia Avenue on the odd-numbered side. It was getting dark, and the air was humid with a light drizzle that made my walk feel secretive. I knew this side of the street very well. Our neighbors were the Matzes and the Pritchards, and there was Han Kieffer's grocery store. The Krings and the Pottses lived nearby, and they were my first friends, all girls. 
The houses on this street were special to me, even if I didn’t know everyone’s name. I remembered the little troughs in the cement that carried rain from the roofs to the street. As the street went down, the houses changed too: the porches got lower, and the front yards became smaller. Over the years, things changed. Wooden porch railings were replaced with iron ones. In Shillington, some houses I remembered as homes became stores, and some stores became homes again. 
Rick Gilbert is a furniture designer who lives in a flat that used to be a curtain warehouse. His flat has big doors and exposed brick walls. He didn’t want an empty space, so he used a big piece of plastic to create a hallway and hide his office. He wanted his kitchen to be a place where he could cook for friends or make coffee for clients. He chose light wood for the floors and mixed modern furniture with some old pieces from his parents.
**Bruce Chatwin**
Bruce Chatwin was a writer who loved to travel. His life was full of secrets and stories. He wrote a famous book called *In Patagonia* in 1977. This book changed travel writing. It was exciting and imaginative, like a thriller. Chatwin sometimes changed facts to make his stories better. He believed that traveling could help people discover amazing histories.
**Swimming**
One summer day, it rained heavily, and I ran to the pool behind my house. I swam back and forth, watching the raindrops make bubbles in the water. The best moments were when the rain got stronger, and the sound of birds disappeared. During this time, I thought about swimming across Britain. I wanted to follow the rain to the sea and escape the routine of swimming back and forth in the pool. 
Many places today have signs and labels, which can make things feel less real. Walking, cycling, and swimming are special because they let us explore the world in a different way. A swimming journey would help me discover parts of the world that are still mysterious, like dark woods or high mountains."
CPE_67,C2,"CRYING**
Charles Darwin thought that crying did not have a clear purpose for humans. He was probably wrong. Recently, scientists have shown that crying is important for social reasons. Psychiatrist John Bowlby said that crying helps create a bond between a mother and her child. Many people believe that children cry because they feel helpless. 
However, it is harder to understand why adults cry. The sound of crying is not as important as what we see when someone cries. In early human groups, crying may have helped people trust each other and feel close. 
People cry for different reasons. We might cry to show sympathy for someone who is suffering. Sometimes, we cry without meaning to when we hear beautiful music or moving speeches. We may also cry when we watch a sad movie, and this happens more often when we are with other people than when we are alone. The social reasons for crying are clear, but research is still ongoing."
CPE_27,C2,"The Heat is On**
We all know about global warming, but how much warmer will the Earth get? How will it change our lives? Most people have some idea of global warming, but many do not know what will happen because of it. A warmer climate will change the weather in many places around the world. Since the atmosphere affects everything on Earth, changes in the climate will also affect plants, animals, water, and soil.
Humans use natural resources to help us live. We use them to grow food, build cities, and support billions of people. If these resources change, it is a serious problem. We do not know exactly how the world will change or what is causing these changes. Over the last 100 years, human actions have increased the amount of certain gases in the atmosphere, which are connected to global temperature. These gases are likely affecting the climate, but we do not fully understand how.
Scientists have found that the Earth's surface has warmed by about 6°C in the last century. Most scientists believe this warming is not just natural and is partly caused by human pollution. Many scientists are trying to predict what will happen because of higher global temperatures. They use special computer programs called general circulation models (GCMs) to help them. These programs look at how temperature, pressure, sunlight, and other factors work together to predict the climate. However, these models are not perfect and can be slow and expensive to use.
Despite these challenges, most people agree that climate change will happen faster than before. The predictions from GCMs suggest that by the year 2100, the average global temperature will rise by 1°C to 3.5°C. Sea levels are expected to rise by 15 to 95 cm, and there will be changes in rainfall patterns. Scientists also think that extreme weather, like heatwaves, floods, and droughts, will happen more often in some areas.
These changes will affect the environment and people. Climate change can change where forests and grasslands are located, the types of plants and animals in these areas, and the resources we need, like food and water. Some effects may be harmful, but not all changes will be bad. For example, in Australia, wheat production has increased because of warmer temperatures, which have caused fewer frosts.
However, small changes in climate can also lead to water shortages, especially in dry areas. The Mediterranean region is one place where this is happening. In southern Portugal, for example, there has been less rain in spring, and more rain in autumn and winter. 
Another problem is that glaciers are melting, which affects ice and water levels. This can harm plants, animals, and human structures. The Arctic ice is melting, which makes it easier for ships to travel but also increases the risk of icebergs.
One of the biggest effects of global warming will be rising sea levels. Warmer water takes up more space, and melting ice adds more water to the oceans. Many people live in coastal areas, so rising sea levels can cause flooding. Cities like London, New York, and Tokyo could be greatly affected. Many people could lose their homes and jobs, creating millions of environmental refugees.
Small island countries are at the greatest risk. If sea levels rise too much, these islands could disappear. This would be a disaster for the people living there and for the countries that would have to help them."
CPE_66,C2,"Mission to Mars**
Wanted: a married couple for a 501-day trip to Mars. The couple must be healthy and strong. This will be the first group of astronauts to go to Mars if Dennis Tito's plans work. He wants to send a spacecraft on 5 January 2018.
The spacecraft will go to about 160 km above Mars. It will use Mars' gravity to come back to Earth without using much fuel. Saving fuel is very important. The trip must happen in 2018 because the next time Mars and Earth are close is in 2031.
This is a big project, and there is a race to create new technology for it. If everything is ready in time, the spacecraft might go to Mars. Even if it does not leave Earth, the work on this project will help future space missions."
CPE_44,C2,"AESTHETICS**
Art is important, but sometimes it is hard to understand. Many people think of art as just a building, a book, a painting, or a statue. However, art is more than just these things. It is about how we feel and experience them. When we only look at the art itself, we can miss its true meaning.
Some artworks are very famous and admired. Because of this, people often forget the real reasons why these artworks were made and how they affect our lives. When art is seen as separate from our daily lives, it becomes harder to understand its importance. 
To study art, we need to connect it back to our everyday experiences. Just like mountains are part of the earth, art is part of our lives. People who study art should show how art relates to our daily experiences and feelings.
To really understand art, we might need to look away from it for a moment. We should think about the simple things in life that we enjoy. For example, we can enjoy flowers without knowing much about how they grow. But if we want to understand how flowers grow, we need to learn about soil, air, water, and sunlight.
Many people enjoy things like movies, music, and comics, but they do not always think of these as art. When people think of art, they often think of museums and galleries. However, the things we enjoy in our daily lives can also be considered art. 
When art is connected to our everyday experiences, we can appreciate it more. The best times to enjoy art are when it is linked to the things we do every day."
CPE_22,C2,"Observing Lions**
Lions are often seen as amazing hunters. In the evening, a group of lions quietly moves to catch their food. They work together to hunt, take care of their young, and scare away other animals. Many years ago, in 1978, we wanted to understand why lions work together. We thought that helping each other would help them have more baby lions. But we learned that sometimes, being too generous can be bad for them. 
We thought we would find answers in a few years, but lions are very good at resting. They do not always act quickly. It took us a long time to learn about their behavior. Lions can live for up to 18 years, so we are only now starting to understand them better.
**Pop Music Review**
The third album of the band Bedrock was very important for their career. The album, called New Life, changed rock music in our country for many years. It brought new sounds and styles. The music was lighter and mixed different influences. The band used humor and showed their true feelings in their songs. 
The album had many good songs, including some that were fun and others that were sad. One song, 'So Low', was about the weather, and another, 'To the Brink', was a serious ballad. New Life had 16 great songs with no bad ones, which is very rare for albums.
**Extract from an Autobiography**
When I was a child, I loved stories about 'The Sibyl', wise women from ancient times. I first heard about one from my mother. She told me about an old woman who tried to sell books to a king. When he refused to buy them, she burned some and offered fewer books for the same price. In the end, he bought the last three books for a lot of money. I learned a lesson about selling and life from this story.
As a child, I often felt lonely. I wanted to play with other kids, but they sometimes said no. My mother told me to do something interesting so they would want to join me. It worked, and I never forgot that lesson.
When I had the chance to write a travel book, I looked for a topic that mattered to me. I don’t like to travel much, so I gave my editor a long list of places I did not want to go. I prefer to learn about old ruins because I enjoy thinking about the past.
**What Happens to Your Manuscript?**
When you send your manuscript to a publisher, it will likely go into a pile of other manuscripts waiting to be read. This pile is called the slush pile. Usually, a young person or an experienced worker will read it. They want to find something new and interesting. 
If they like your story, they will show it to a senior editor. This editor will decide if your book is good and if it can sell well. They will also think about how you can promote your book. Publishers often want to meet authors before making an offer."
CPE_39,C2,"Advertising Challenges**
If you work in advertising, the early 1990s were very hard years. There was a big recession, which means that many businesses were not doing well. This recession lasted a long time and was worse than people expected. In Britain, in 1991, the economy shrank, interest rates were very high, and many people stopped buying things that were not necessary. More than half a million people lost their jobs, and many homes were taken back by banks because people could not pay their mortgages.
All businesses were affected, especially the car and building industries, which lost a lot of money. Many people and companies in different countries suffered. People in advertising also lost jobs, but those who kept their jobs felt a lot of pressure. They were expected to help their companies make money, but they had to do this with smaller budgets. They were told to do more with less money.
At the same time, marketing became more important. Companies started to understand that they needed to make products that customers wanted, not just what was easy for them to make. In the last ten to fifteen years, many companies began to focus on marketing. This made marketing people more important, but it also made their jobs harder.
About half of the money spent on marketing goes to advertising. In the 1980s, advertising was very successful, but in the early 1990s, it faced many problems. The bad economy made companies think carefully about their advertising budgets. They wanted to know if advertising was worth the money they spent. Many companies were not sure what they were getting for their money.
Because of this, companies wanted better advertising strategies, better targeting, better creativity, and better media placement. They wanted the best people from advertising agencies to work for them and to be motivated to create great ads.
Even though advertising is a tough business, many advertising workers still face the same problems as their clients: how to do more with less money. The recession made it hard to spend money on advertising, and people were afraid to take risks, which are often needed for good advertising.
There are also other changes happening, like changes in the population, the power of retailers, and the needs of consumers. Some companies are also trying to advertise in other countries. All these factors make it harder for advertising people to know what works. They remember the saying, ""Only half of my advertising works. The trouble is I don't know which half.""
Now, there is a lot of pressure to make advertising more effective. However, help for advertising workers is not easy to find. Companies and advertising agencies are too busy dealing with these problems to talk about them. Those who are doing well often keep their success secrets to themselves. This means that while some events may provide useful information, many books about advertising do not help much. They often make it seem like all advertising work is perfect, which is not true."
CPE_18,C2,"**The Lure of the Kitchen**
When I was in university, I wanted to be a chef. This was not a common choice among my friends. Most people wanted different jobs. Cooking seemed hard and not very nice. Chefs work long hours, feel a lot of pressure, and do not earn much money. But I did not care about that. I was not happy at university. The work was difficult, and the social life was not good. Being a chef seemed like a good escape from my student life. It felt serious and honest, which I missed in college.
My wish to cook was not just because I was unhappy. I also loved the beauty of food. I first felt this when I ate at a famous restaurant in London. The meal was amazing. I remember my first dish very well. After that meal, I wanted to learn how to cook. I changed my student life to prepare for becoming a chef. My history degree felt useless, and I learned to cook by reading cookbooks, visiting markets, and making special meals.
**The Swimming Instructor**
The swimming teacher was a small man with strong muscles and tattoos. When I asked him to teach me how to dive, he told me to sit on the edge of the pool, put my hands above my head, and roll forward. I practiced this until my lesson was over. The next time, he made me stand up and dive off the edge. He was strict, and every time I came up from the water, he told me what to do: ""Don't look down, look up!"" ""Keep your legs straight."" ""Point your toes!""
The next week, I went to the high diving board. It was very high, and I was scared. I felt quiet and alone. I moved my arms like he taught me, looked up, and jumped. For a moment, I felt like I was flying. But when I hit the water, I fell awkwardly, and my legs were everywhere. The instructor looked at me with disappointment. But I was still very happy. I thought, ""This is what they mean by 'free as a bird.'""
**The Traveller**
For people who like comfort, like a nice bed and clean water, the traveller seems strange. These people choose to take risks. They climb dangerous mountains, sail alone on the ocean, and eat insects if they have to. They can live for months in unknown places. Some people think these travellers are odd, and they do not understand their world. They feel happy to return to their own lives with microwaves and phones, where the risks are small.
**Sailing**
Jonathan Raban is afraid of the sea, which is why he spends a lot of time on it. He does not say he is a great sailor, but he can sail well. He likes to write about his sailing experiences. His small boat has a device that tells him exactly where he is on the earth. He likes this device, but he also believes that using a compass was a mistake. He thinks it changed how people connect with the sea. Now, sailors do not look at the waves or feel the ocean as much. They just follow the compass. Because of this, a machine can sometimes steer the boat instead of the sailor. This is why Raban has time to watch the waves carefully."
CPE_62,C2,"**Holiday Reading**
Summer gives us two great joys: leaving home and reading books. These joys are connected. Books can help us feel at home in the world. We can see our own experiences in the stories of others. In books, we find our thoughts and feelings. Authors can express what we feel but in a clearer way. They can say what we are shy or confused about. We feel thankful to these authors for helping us understand ourselves.
When we read or travel, we can escape our daily routines. Our eyes are open wide when we are in a new place. This is also true when we read a great book. A good book can show us things we did not notice before. We start to see the colors of the sky, the changes in a person’s face, or feelings we did not know we had.
**Author's Note**
These thoughts about travel were published in the Observer newspaper over seven years. I made some small changes to fit the articles, but I did not change much. I corrected a few mistakes, but I did not want to change the main story. For example, in my article about China, I thought the Hong Kong dollar would stay strong. A year later, it fell. If I changed my article to say this, it would not be the same story. Like many travelers, I was there at that time, not knowing what would happen next.
**Ecotourism**
If there were awards for tourism phrases that have been misused, ""ecotourism"" would win. This term started in the early 1980s when people became more aware of the environment. Tour operators realized that many travelers wanted to travel without harming the places they visited. Now, ""ecotourism"" can mean anything from living with remote tribes to a short boat trip in Australia. Any tour that includes culture, nature, or adventure can be called ecotourism. The original idea was good, but without clear rules, many travelers are confused about what ecotourism really means.
**Transylvanian Journey**
I lost my notebook about my trip to Transylvania for 50 years. I found it again a few years ago, and it helped me remember that time. In Transylvania, I had a better time than I expected. I stayed in friendly country houses for weeks. When I stopped moving, I also stopped writing. I thought there was nothing to write about. I was slow to start writing again when I moved to a new place. I worried that some details were out of order when I began writing this book. But then I realized that this was not a guidebook, so I let the story flow naturally."
CPE_49,C2,"Fashion and Writing**
**Fashion**  
Fashion is often thought of as something new, but it has a long history. Many experts say that fashion started to grow in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries when trade became more important. As societies grew and changed, more types of clothing were made, and the meanings of what we wear became more complex. For example, a man's suit can mean different things to different people and in different situations.
**Writing**  
Many people think that all writers are very successful, but this is not true for most. Some writers have other jobs to help them earn money. They write in the evenings after work. Others, like me, do different small jobs, such as teaching and writing articles. I have heard of a job for a writer at a chocolate factory, but I have never found a job like that. Still, I manage to write my novel by balancing part-time jobs and using credit cards, and sometimes with help from friends.
**Sudden Fame**  
When we started performing in small places, many fans came to see us. We had to use secret doors to avoid being crowded by fans. On our days off, it was hard to go outside without being followed by people who loved us. In just a few days, we became famous. Our fans watched everything we did, and our managers took care of us. Even though I was still shy, I also felt a strange confidence that comes to people who are shy but suddenly famous. I felt very different and unsure about my feelings."
CPE_31,C2,"Music - The Future of Music**
Technology is changing our lives at work, home, and in our free time. Susan Hallam talks about how this affects music in Britain. In the late 20th century, there were many new ways to listen to music, like radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, and videos. However, fewer people are performing live music, and there are fewer full-time jobs for musicians.
More people can now access music, and this is likely to continue because music meets many human needs. Music is important for national events and for personal activities. A world without music is hard to imagine. The question is not if there will be music in the 21st century, but what kind of music it will be and if people will still want to learn to play instruments.
I believe that people will still want to learn instruments. The music industry is a big part of the economy in Britain, and musical skills are important for many jobs, especially in media. Playing an instrument can also help develop skills in children. Research in the USA shows that making music can improve thinking skills. Studies in Europe suggest that group music lessons can help children with social skills and focus.
Current research is looking at how playing an instrument can help people learn other skills. For example, practicing regularly can help with good study habits, and playing in concerts can teach punctuality and organization. Because of this, there will likely be a continued need for music lessons.
What about the future? I think two things will happen. First, people will listen to more types of music, and new styles will mix together. Second, technology will be used more to create and perform music. This will make it easier for people to compose music, but it may also mean fewer live performances.
More people of all ages will want to make music together in their communities. If this happens, music education will need to change. We need to help more people learn different instruments throughout their lives. Music lessons will need to adapt to be relevant for more people and include a wider range of musical skills.
Musicians will need to learn how to teach and inspire students of all ages. They will also need skills to work with different groups and manage community projects. This is a big change from how music education has been in the past. It is important to show the quality of music education available.
Finally, we need to make music more important in our lives. Music is essential, but we often take it for granted. Everyone in the music profession should work together to change this."
CPE_58,C2,"The Actor's Craft**
Sometimes, people do not like actors. This is often because actors talk about their work in interviews. They should remember what the dancer Pavlova said when someone asked her about her dancing: ""If I could tell you, I wouldn't dance it."" Instead, actors often use boring phrases or talk about gossip.
Paul Scofield wrote to a friend: ""An actor's work is interesting only when they perform. Talking about it makes it less real. There are no strict rules for acting. Every time an actor performs, they start fresh and learn about the characters and the story. After a play ends, the actor feels empty until the next performance. This emptiness shows when people talk about acting.""
**A Review of Hamlet**
Adrian Lester plays Hamlet, a character between being a boy and a man. His performance is simple but strong. He shows control over his body and mind, moving from a promising actor to a top player. Lester plays a young man with hidden anger, who is smart and funny. His performance is very skilled.
When you watch Lester, notice how his body moves. His arms hang stiffly, showing he is waiting to act. Another actor, Handy, plays Horatio in a similar way, showing a character moved by something inside.
**What is Acting?**
What is acting? Is it copying real behavior or creating something new? What makes actors move and act? This is an important question in theatre.
**One Director's Rehearsal Process**
This director has a special way to start rehearsals called ""dropping in."" The stage manager shows the script on a screen. The actors listen quietly while someone else speaks. When it is their turn, they look at the screen, think about the words, and find the reason to speak. For example, if the line is, ""Queuing all night, the rain, do you remember?"" they take a breath and let the thought come to them. They might remember a time they waited in line, like at a bus stop or a concert. They find the reason to say the line by looking at the other actor and thinking about their character's feelings. The director wants actors to be open and trust that something will happen.
**The Perfect Theatre**
The perfect theatre should make you feel important. Going to the theatre is special, and the staff should feel this too. It is not nice if the workers seem bored. The theatre should connect the performers and the audience. People in the audience should feel close enough to hear and see everything happening on stage.
The size of the theatre is important. It should fit the human voice and body. If the theatre is too big, it feels wrong because drama is about people. Many theatres built in the late 1800s were good because they made the stage feel close to the audience. I like theatres that feel old and have a history, like worn steps in a church.
When you go to the theatre, you want to see something surprising. If it is not surprising, you might as well stay home."
CPE_37,C2,"
**Paul Simon**  
Rock and roll in the 1950s was mainly for young people, but it was also very important for older people. It changed music and helped new rock stars to grow. Paul Simon, like many young people in the US, listened to a popular radio show called Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party by Alan Freed. This show was very important for many young musicians. Paul Simon was excited by the music he heard on this show. He wanted to go from just listening to music to making his own music.
**Snow**  
I could not see a path, but I thought I would be okay if I was careful. The wind was very strong, and it pushed me over as I walked on the slippery ice. Suddenly, the snow under me broke, and I fell into a hole that was about four feet deep. The snow had covered a space between two rocks, and I fell through the thin snow. I climbed out, feeling scared and shaken. I wondered what would have happened if the hole was much deeper. I sat against a pine tree that was sticking out of the snow to think about what to do next. In one hour, I had walked about half a mile. I realized I had to change my plan.
**Qualitative Research**  
There are many books that help researchers with qualitative research. These books talk a lot about how to collect data, but they often do not explain how to analyze the data. Many people find it hard to understand how researchers analyze their data. To help with this, we asked different social scientists who have done qualitative research to talk about their methods. The goal was to share their experiences and understanding of analyzing qualitative data, not to create a guidebook. This task is not easy, so we let our contributors share their work in different styles, including personal stories and more formal writing."
CPE_2,C2,"Screen Learning**
A few days ago, I saw my six-year-old son eating noodles in a funny way. He was pulling them up with his teeth and pretending to be a dinosaur. ""I'm a little dinosaur,"" he said. He was acting out a scene from a TV show. I asked him what he remembered about dinosaurs, but he didn’t remember much.
Many people think that learning on a screen is good. One writer talked about using an interactive program with his son. The father read the words while the son played with the pictures. The father thought that if his son had spent ten minutes reading a book, he might have learned something. Research shows that children learn better when they talk with teachers or parents. Using new technology to teach is good, but traditional education is still very important.
**Hollywood**
By 1918, most of the world’s movie-making was in Hollywood. People who lived there did not like this change. They thought Hollywood was becoming a place for rude people. But in the end, they accepted it because success is important. Hollywood knows a good movie when it sees one. In less than a hundred years, Hollywood has changed from a small village to a famous town, like New York or Paris. 
Today, Hollywood is still a small place where everyone talks about movies: how much money they make, who is dating whom, and who is working on what project. Many successful people want to live somewhere else but still work in Hollywood. It is the place where many people in show business want to be.
**Photography**
Photography was created by artists in the 1800s. They wanted to make a lasting record of what they saw. The new tools they used made pictures that were better and more detailed than paintings. Some artists were worried that photography was not real art. They thought that because photography used machines, it could not show a person’s imagination. But photographers believed they had found a new way to express themselves. They used photography to show the world and nature, just like other artists used paint and pencils.
**Book Illustration**
In the past, every children’s book had pictures. This was also true for many novels for older children. During this time, children’s publishing was mostly low-budget, which meant that some work was not very good. However, the best artists always did their best work. The collection of black-and-white illustrations is a mix of good and not-so-good work. It is a great place for research and finding interesting things.
Some of the best illustrations will be shown to the public again. This can happen through new book releases or exhibitions of original books and drawings. There are signs that after being ignored for a while, these illustrations are starting to be appreciated again. Soon, a smart publisher will likely create a series of classic children’s book illustrations from this time."
CPE_68,C2,"Blogging: Sharing Online**
A while ago, a website talked about the dangers of telling everyone where you are online. The website said that when you say, ""I am here,"" you are also showing your location to many people, not all of whom you may want to meet. This shows that sharing everything online can have bad sides.
The internet gives us many chances to share our lives with a lot of people. We can share our stories, photos, and feelings. But sometimes, we can feel lost in all this sharing. It can be sad, but we should not give up. There are lessons from people who used the internet before us.
In January 1994, a 19-year-old student named Justin Hall started sharing his life online. At that time, the internet was mostly for students and scientists. Hall wanted to share his personal stories. He created a blog where he wrote about everything in his life. Many people started to read his blog because he was very open about his life.
One day, people visited his blog and found a sad video instead of his usual posts. Hall had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it, his partner said, ""You must choose: the blog or me."" Hall chose to stop the blog because he felt it made people not trust him. 
In 2002, a woman named Heather Armstrong had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job. One day, a coworker sent her blog link to the bosses at her company, and she lost her job because of it. This shows that what we say online can have real-life consequences. 
Armstrong was sad and stopped blogging for a while, but later she got married and started a new blog about her family. Now, she is very popular as a ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing helps her family. 
The important lesson is that while we can say anything online, we should think carefully before we share."
CPE_23,C2,"Enough Sleep?**
Many people today feel tired. In rich and busy countries, not getting enough sleep and feeling anxious are common problems. In the USA, research shows that 40 million people have trouble sleeping. Some popular books in Britain have characters who cannot sleep or are about sleep research. 
A sleep expert says, ""People need more sleep."" When people are busy, they sleep less. They wake up early to avoid traffic. One researcher did an experiment. He let people sleep for up to 14 hours a night for a month. After three weeks, they slept about eight hours a night. This shows they needed more sleep.
In Europe, a sleep research lab at a university studies sleep. They look at how tiredness affects sailors, how noise at airports disturbs sleep, and how tired drivers can be dangerous. They find people to help with their research by advertising in student newspapers. Participants are picked up by taxi, paid £5 an hour, and asked to change their sleep patterns.
Dr. Louise Reyner helps the participants feel comfortable. Some worry because they wear electrodes on their heads, thinking the researchers can see their dreams. But the researchers are more interested in how the body works. 
In a dark room, there is a driving simulator. Participants come at 2 PM, a time when people often feel sleepy, especially after little or no sleep. They drive while answering questions. The road ahead looks endless, and the sun is bright. The young men say they will not fall asleep. Dr. Reyner has a video of one man trying hard to stay awake. At first, he sits up straight, but then he starts to blink more and more. Eventually, he falls asleep for a few seconds, and the car goes off the road. 
Dr. Reyner says that drinking coffee can help. Two cups can make someone a safe driver for a while. She suggests using energy drinks and caffeinated gum, especially for people who work at night.
Scientists know that humans sleep in a daily cycle, like other animals. When we sleep, we go through four stages, from light sleep to deep sleep. We usually dream during light sleep. Our brains stop our bodies from moving, except for our hands and eyelids, to keep us safe. 
Scientists are sure that women sleep about half an hour longer than men, and older people need less sleep, but they do not know why. Some researchers say sleep helps us travel through time safely. 
In the past, people had different sleep patterns. A history professor studied British life from 1500 to 1850. He found that people went to bed early, woke up after midnight, stayed awake for a while, and then went back to sleep. This time was good for thinking, remembering dreams, or even stealing. Poor people enjoyed this quiet time away from their busy lives. 
By the 17th century, with more artificial light, rich people changed their sleep habits to sleep more efficiently. Later, during the industrial revolution, most people worked longer hours in lighted buildings. 
In some non-western cultures, people still do not have strict bedtimes. They sleep for a few hours, then wake up again. The idea of sleeping all night is not the same for everyone. In some tribal societies, noises from animals and the need to watch fires make it hard to sleep continuously. It seems that people everywhere need more sleep."
CPE_60,C2,"
I am talking about big cowboy boots. I stood in my very expensive cowboy boots in the Arizona desert. I wore a full cowboy outfit, but I was not a cowboy. I looked at the mountains and felt out of place. I flew in from Denver early in the morning. I thought I looked like a cowboy, but then I saw a real cowboy at the airport. He was dirty and looked at my new boots with surprise. 
I used to be a racing driver. I loved it and it was all I knew how to do. But now I don’t race anymore. I wondered what I should do next. A racing driver should have other jobs ready for when he stops racing. I thought I had some ideas, but they didn’t work out. 
I thought about being a commentator for races, but many other drivers wanted that job too. I also tried to sell classic cars, but that didn’t work because nobody was buying them. 
Being an ""ex"" racing driver is hard. Nobody wants to hear about how I almost became a champion. Even if I had won, people would only listen for a short time. Last year’s champion is not important anymore. I don’t want sympathy, but I miss racing. I miss the speed and the excitement of driving fast cars. 
I also miss being famous. People used to want my autograph. Now, I have a lot of free time. I looked at the blue sky and saw some small birds. I didn’t know there were songbirds in the desert. I realized that I, a fake cowboy in fancy boots, had a lot to learn."
CPE_1,C2,"Vancouver**
In the last ten years, many people from all over the world have moved to Vancouver, in western Canada. In the evening, residents walk around the city, and if you join them, you will hear different languages. People come to Vancouver for its nice weather, beautiful views of the ocean and mountains, clean and safe places, and good schools and jobs. Some people complain about how fast new buildings are being built, but many agree that new people and tourism have helped the city grow. 
Vancouver was once called 'Terminal City' because it was a place where many journeys started. Now, it is still a gateway to many other places.
**Putting Pen to Paper**
Journalists like me are not good at writing letters. Some say this is because we do not like to write for free, but I think it is more about how we want our writing to be perfect. A true artist, who writes without thinking too much about the effect, does not have this problem. I believe that understanding the power of words is what makes a real artist. When Shakespeare wrote his famous lines, he did not think about how the words would sound together.
**Supermarket Opening**
Opening a new supermarket used to be a big event in Britain. A famous person, like a soap star or a member of the royal family, would come to cut the ribbon. Now, new supermarkets open every day, and famous people are not needed anymore. Last week, people waiting to enter the new Superbuy store did not care who opened it, as long as they were first in line. 
A customer said that the first five men to enter would get a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women would get flowers. This news spread quickly, making those at the front feel proud and those who arrived later feel jealous."
CPE_53,C2,"Citizen Kane**
The film *Citizen Kane* came out in 1941. There was a lot of excitement about it, but it did not make much money at first. People started to watch it again on television. Many filmmakers say this film inspired them. This is surprising because it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles said that he did not know what he could or could not do, so he just made the film his way. He had a great team with him, including cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and special-effects expert Linwood Dunn. When Welles and Mankiewicz decided to tell the story of a newspaper owner who was like Hearst, Welles knew he had a great chance to show his skills as a director and actor.
**Dermot and Carmel**
Dermot thought Carmel was acting a bit strange that morning. He had told her twice that he might be late and that he might stop at the golf club on the way home. He wanted to talk to someone, and that was a good place to do it. Carmel nodded her head but seemed like she did not really hear him. 
""Will you be okay? What are you going to do today?"" he asked. She smiled and said, ""Funny you should ask. I was just thinking that I have nothing to do today, so I will walk downtown and look at the shops. I feel like it is almost wrong to waste the day."" 
Dermot smiled back. ""You should enjoy yourself. And if I am late, I won’t need anything to eat. So don’t worry about it."" 
""That’s fine,"" she replied.
**Job Titles**
A recent study showed that job titles can cause problems at work. A survey found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees think job titles create divisions among workers. Most surprisingly, 70% of office workers said they would give up a pay raise for a better job title. This shows that people care a lot about how they are called at work. In the early 21st century, no one wants to be called ""subordinate."" The job titles people want sound better (like ""specialist"" or ""coordinator""), but they often mean the same thing as before."

**Kinetic Art**
Good news! The Hayward Gallery in London has changed into a wonderful place. This change is not because of a big, expensive show, but because of a special exhibition about kinetic art. Kinetic art is art that moves or shows movement. This exhibition looks at the history of kinetic art over the last 60 years. It shows that making art that moves or talks about movement has been an important part of art in the twentieth century. 
The exhibition has many paintings, drawings, documents, and films about kinetic art. The curator, Guy Brett, has studied this art for a long time. There are not many texts explaining the art, so visitors can enjoy looking and discovering things on their own.
**David Hockney**
David Hockney is an artist whose work many people like. Some people enjoy his art because it shows real things and is easy to understand. Others like it because it talks about fun and escape from daily life. Some people may even like Hockney because he is funny and interesting in interviews. 
However, some critics think Hockney is not a great artist. They say he is popular for the wrong reasons. But others believe that just because he is popular does not mean his art is not good. Hockney knows his own strengths and weaknesses. He does not say he is a great artist and believes that only time will tell how good his art really is.
**Window-shopping - An Art Exhibition**
In the last few years, I have seen many art exhibitions. Some are great, and some are not so good. I often feel frustrated when exhibitions seem to have a hidden message or idea. Sometimes this works, and we see new trends in art. But often, it feels forced or not genuine.
Because of this, I wanted to create a different kind of exhibition. I worked with seven artists to take over a space in an empty warehouse. We called it ""Window-shopping."" This exhibition showed different artworks that were connected only because they were all art. 
For example, Sam Cole made knitted cats that chased each other on a toy train track. In another piece, Matthew Crawley filmed a video camera, opened it, and poked around until it broke. These artworks do not fit into a specific theme, but they can still be shown together. They do not get in each other’s way and can even help each other look better.
**Art History**
Some people love paintings but are afraid to think too much about them. They worry that thinking will ruin their enjoyment. Some art historians focus on theory and forget the joy of looking at art and the creativity of making it. 
This is like saying that knowing how to cook a dish takes away from its taste. But knowing more about art can actually make it more enjoyable. Enjoyment is not simple. What we like about art can change over time and is influenced by the society we live in. 
While it is important to enjoy art, it is also important to think about it. The idea that thinking about art takes away from enjoyment is an old belief. Art can be both enjoyable and thoughtful."
CPE_25,C2,"Metals and St Ives**
**Metals**  
A long time ago, people in the Stone Age became interested in metals. One day, while sitting by a river and waiting for fish, an early human found a shiny yellow stone. This stone was not like other stones; it was beautiful. This is how gold may have come into the lives of these early people. Gold is soft and easy to shape, so it became very popular. People may have also found copper by chance. When they saw how useful copper tools were, they started to look for copper and ways to get it from the ground. This is how metalworking began.
**St Ives**  
We walked slowly with our heavy bags down a narrow, cobbled street to the town center. The strong wind made it hard to walk, and we tried to avoid the cold waves that hit the walkway. The streets were empty, and all the windows in the houses by the water were closed. We had seen the weather get worse as we arrived in St Ives on a small train. The dark clouds made me think that visiting Cornwall without a car was not a good idea. I had convinced my friend to come with me by promising nice walks along the beautiful coast and warm evenings by the fire.
**Computer Modelling**  
Studying the past is hard because it is gone. The people who lived in peaceful times or who faced problems are no longer here. We cannot know exactly why they lived where they did or how they formed families and communities. Archaeology gives us some clues, but we cannot test our ideas with real experiments on people from the past. However, we can use computer modelling. This means we can create pictures of old landscapes and fill them with virtual people. These digital people can have some of the needs and abilities of real humans. We can set rules for them and change things like the weather or the number of people to see how they would react."

**Vervet Monkeys**  
Cheney and Seyfarth studied vervet monkeys. One day, the dominant male monkey saw a strange male monkey nearby. The strange monkey wanted to join their group. If he joined, the dominant male might lose his place. To keep the stranger away, the dominant male made an alarm call that means a leopard is near. The strange monkey ran back to the trees. This happened many times. But then, the dominant male made a mistake. He called out the alarm while walking across the open ground. 
**What Cats Catch**  
In a village in England called Felmersham, people counted what their cats caught. In one year, seventy cats caught over 1,000 animals. A professor in America thought that all the cats in Britain might kill 100 million birds and small animals each year! But this number is not realistic. Most cats live in towns and catch fewer animals than the cats in this village. The important question is: can the bird population survive? The answer is yes. In winter, many people feed birds, and there are places for birds to nest. The survey showed that cats do catch many animals, but they are not destroying the bird population in Britain.
**Buffalo's Day**  
Buffaloes are very important to the marshmen, and they take care of them. Every morning, the buffaloes leave their sleeping place slowly. They make sad sounds as they walk to the reed beds. They stand for a long time, tired, until the leader moves forward and goes into the water. Once in the water, they seem to forget what they were doing and relax. They move slowly away from the house and swim, looking tired. They spend the day in the reeds, eating green plants.
**Picasso, Pablo**  
In 1940, Picasso painted pictures of fish while he was in a fishing town called Royan. One painting shows a fishmonger’s table with a crab and some soles. The fish look alive. The painting is hard to read because Picasso used a flat pattern with see-through shapes. The colors are calm, making it look like an underwater scene. But there is a feeling of danger because the fish seem to be fighting the crab. The sharp shapes in the painting add to this feeling of tension."
CPE_12,C2,"Photography**
Photography is a way to take pictures of people, places, and events. It has been used for about 150 years to show many parts of human life. Photography helps us see moments in time and understand both big and small things. It gives us images from faraway places, the universe, and the problems in our modern lives. 
Before photography, people made pictures a long time ago. The first pictures were cave paintings made about 35,000 years ago. We do not know exactly why these paintings were made. They might have shown hunting events, been used for magic, or just been for decoration. Pictures have always been important in human culture.
When photography was invented in the mid-1800s, it changed how we see the world. People thought photographs could show the truth, like how our eyes see things. The camera works like our eyes and can capture images. This made photography a big achievement in art.
Some people believed that everyone could understand photographs, no matter where they were from. For example, a photographer named August Sander said that even a person living far away could understand a picture of the sky. But as communication grew in the late 20th century, we started to wonder if everyone really understands photographs the same way.
Photography is often seen as a clear way to show reality. For example, when someone shows a picture and says, ""This is my grandson,"" it feels very natural. Since photography was invented in 1839, how people use and think about it has changed a lot. 
At first, photographs were used to keep memories. Now, they are also important historical documents. They can tell us about the people and society that made them. Photography can also inspire social and political change. For example, during the Italian Renaissance, new ways of seeing things changed art. Today, photography plays a big role in our media culture and shows us the difficult realities of the world."
CPE_26,C2,"**How to Write Poetry**
Writing poetry is like walking in a dangerous place. You want to be free and creative, but one wrong move can cause problems. I cannot tell you everything about writing poetry, but I can say that reading a lot, writing often, and using your imagination are very important. Some people need to feel safe before they can write a poem, while others write to feel better when they are sad. Some people write at certain times, and others wait for a special moment. All of these ways are good, as long as you are not just copying someone else.
Finding your own voice is important. You need to listen to yourself and let your ideas grow. One day, your ideas will be strong enough to stand on their own.
**The Short Story**
In a short story, you should not have too many characters or long descriptions. Flashbacks should be quick and only used when necessary. A memory can help move the story forward, but it should not slow down the action. Dialogue, or conversation between characters, is very helpful. It can show different sides of a story quickly and keep the reader interested. 
Using too many words can ruin a short story, but being too short is not good either. A short story needs conflict and action, just like a longer story, but every word must count.
**Screenplays**
Writing a screenplay for a film is like playing chess. Chess players often make mistakes, but they learn as they play. At first, they only see a few moves ahead. But as they practice, they start to see the whole game and understand the patterns. 
In both chess and screenplay writing, the more you practice, the better you understand how to play.
**Looking at Writing**
People naturally learn to speak, like young children do. But writing is different. Charles Darwin said that language is a natural human skill, but writing is not. All children learn to speak without lessons, but writing systems were created only a few times in history. 
Most children did not learn to read or write in the past, and even today, some children find it hard. Children are good at listening and speaking, but learning to write takes time and effort. We need to understand how writing works and how to help children learn it."
CPE_8,C2,"""I have never started a book with so much worry. If I call it a book, it is only because I do not know what else to call it. I do not have a big story to tell, and I do not end with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave my reader wondering. This book is about my memories of a man I met only a few times, and I do not know much about what happened to him in between. I could make up stories to fill in the gaps, but I do not want to do that. I just want to write what I know. To protect the people who are still alive, I have given the characters in this story names that I made up, and I have tried to make sure that no one can recognize them. The man I am writing about is not famous. He may never be famous. When he dies, he might leave no sign that he was ever here, like a stone thrown into a river. If my book is read, it will be read for its own interest. But maybe the way he lives and his special character will influence others, and after he is gone, people will see that he was a remarkable person. Then it will be clear who I am writing about, and those who want to know a little about his early life may find something useful in my book. I think my book will help my friend's future biographers. I do not say that the conversations I wrote down are exact. I did not take notes, but I remember well what concerns me. Even though I have put these conversations in my own words, I believe they show what was said. I mentioned before that I have not made anything up, but I have taken the same freedom that historians take. I have put words in the mouths of the characters that I did not hear. I did this to make the scenes more lively and interesting. I want people to read my book, and I think I am right to do what I can to make it enjoyable. A smart reader will see where I have done this, and they can choose to ignore it. Another reason I feel worried about this work is that the people I write about are from a different culture. It is hard to know people, and I think you can only really know your own countrymen. People are shaped by where they were born, the places they grew up, the games they played, the food they ate, the schools they went to, the sports they liked, and the poems they read. All these things make them who they are, and you cannot know them just by hearing about them; you must live them. You can only know them if you are one of them. Because you cannot know people from another country except by watching them, it is hard to make them believable in a book. I have never tried to write about anyone but my own countrymen, and if I have done so in short stories, it is because you can write about characters more simply there. You give the reader some ideas and let them fill in the details. In this book, I do not say that my characters see themselves the same way; they are seen through my own eyes."""
CPE_4,C2,"**POETRY RECITALS**
At different times in history, people may find poetry confusing. However, later on, it can seem clearer. Right now, there are many types of poetry and different ways to write and share it. Some poets write for books and readers, while others perform their poems for an audience. 
This difference is not always clear. In the last twenty years, public poetry readings have become more popular. Small groups in towns hold readings in community centers or homes. Schools invite poets to read to students, and arts festivals often have well-known poets read their work.
For poets who write to perform, public readings are good for them. Their poems are usually simple and easy to understand. However, for poets who write complex and deep poems, it can be hard for new audiences to appreciate their work. These poets might choose to read only their easier poems, which may not show their true talent.
Listening to poetry readings is not the same as reading poetry in books, but it can be enjoyable and helpful. Hearing poets read their work can help the audience understand the poems better. It is good for the audience to have the text in front of them or to know the poems before the reading.
One reason for popular poetry readings, sometimes with music, is to help people enjoy poetry. This way, they can see poetry as something for everyone, not just for a few special people."
CPE_30,C2,"**Oral History**  
Historians often use oral evidence, which means they listen to people's stories about the past. However, this can be tricky. It is not always true that what someone says is a clear picture of what happened. When a historian interviews someone, both the historian and the person sharing their story can influence each other. The historian chooses who to talk to and what to ask about. Even if the historian just listens, their presence can change how the person remembers and talks about their past. The final story is affected by the historian's background and how they understand history. Historians must understand that they help create new evidence. But there are more challenges. The person sharing their story may not remember everything correctly. Their memories can be mixed with information from other places, like the news. They might also feel nostalgic, thinking that the past was better than it really was, or they might feel upset about things that happened in their childhood. These feelings can make their stories seem more convincing, but they might not reflect the true past.
**Animal Science**  
There are two main ways to study animal science: the physiological approach and the whole animal approach. Physiologists focus on how the body works, like how nerves and muscles work together to create behavior. Those who study the whole animal look at how animals behave in their natural environment and what affects their behavior. Within this approach, there are psychologists and ethologists. Psychologists usually work in labs and study a few types of animals, like rats and pigeons. Ethologists study animals in the wild and how they behave naturally. Although these two groups are different, they are starting to work together more. Physiologists often think their methods are the most important. However, even if we understand how every nerve cell works, we still need to study behavior as a whole. Behavior has its own way of being organized, and we need to look at it that way. Trying to explain how a bird builds a nest by only looking at nerve cells would be like trying to read a book with a very strong microscope.
**The Social Sciences**  
When students start studying social sciences, they have two tasks. First, they need to learn the content of their new subject. Second, they must understand how to study this subject. This means they need to know not only the facts and research in their textbooks but also how this knowledge is gathered and organized. These two parts are connected. We all know about social life from our daily experiences, so it may seem like social sciences are just common sense. But when you look at textbooks, you see that each social science goes beyond common sense. Each field studies a specific part of social life, uses different methods, and has its own important ideas. These ideas help social scientists understand more than just everyday experiences and help to separate one field from another.
**Classical Architecture**  
In Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building structures. The Roman architect Vitruvius said that architecture includes order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, propriety, and distribution. He also gave Greek words for some of these ideas. His definitions likely came from earlier Greek writers whose works we no longer have. Vitruvius did not include utility and function in his definition, but he later explained how to design buildings for different purposes. At first, he focused on the beauty of architecture as an art. The beginnings of classical architecture are complicated. There was a long history of simple buildings, like huts, in Greece and Italy that did not meet Vitruvius' artistic standards. Even though these early structures were not artistic, they still contributed important elements that influenced later architectural designs. In essence, a classical temple, no matter how grand it looks, is based on the simple idea of a single-roomed hut."
CPE_7,C2,"
Lily and her sister Mui kept a secret from Chen. Lily was learning to drive. She drove around the gardens and the railway, even going over a small bridge. Chen found out and was happy. He said, ""So you can really drive, Lily? Well done!"" Mui thought it was strange that Chen was not upset. He was excited and made plans with Lily to go for a drive on a Monday next month. They wanted to leave early and come back by noon so they would not lose any customers. Lily would practice driving before then.
Mui bought a road map, which made Chen happy because she got a discount. But Lily felt a bit insulted because she thought she could find the way herself. Soon, they were at the English Channel. Lily drove very well. Even Mui, who was in the back seat, agreed. Lily passed some slow cars, and Chen clapped for her. 
They drove through the town and parked in a quiet street near the sea. Lily was not sure about the parking signs, so she decided to pay to avoid problems. She locked the van doors carefully. Chen joked, ""No one will want that old van."" The sisters were not happy with his joke. 
Chen took their son, Man Kee, to see the sea. Man Kee was a warm and happy baby. Chen thought about how he would raise Man Kee. He wanted him to learn about business and own restaurants one day. The sea made Chen feel thoughtful. 
He saw a ship far away and used a telescope to look at it. At first, he could not find it, but then he did. It was a small, old ship. Chen lifted Man Kee to see it. ""Do you see the ship, Son?"" he asked. ""It is a special ship for us. It will take us back home one day."" Chen kissed Man Kee's head. 
Lily and Mui were behind them. Lily put her arm around Chen. Chen said, ""Let your mother see, Son."" Man Kee did not want to give up the telescope. When he finally did, the view was not clear anymore. By the time Chen found another coin, the ship was gone, and Lily could only see seagulls flying."
CPE_43,C2,"**THE WELL**
I read somewhere that if you dig a deep hole, you can see the stars when it is clear. I asked you to help me with my idea. You watched with wide eyes as I pulled up the well bucket, steadied it on the wall, and then climbed in. I told you to let me down. I didn’t think about how heavy the bucket was or that you might not be strong enough to hold it. You held the handle while I pushed the bucket off the wall. I fell into the well. I hit my head. At first, I saw strange lights. Later, I remembered how cartoon characters see stars when they get hit on the head. 
At that moment, I felt confused, then scared, then relieved, and finally angry at you for letting me fall. I was also worried about what my mother would say. You called down to me, asking if I was okay. I opened my mouth to shout, but then I heard panic in your voice, and I stopped. I lay still and watched you through my eyelashes. You ran away to get help. I waited a moment, then climbed back up and pulled myself over the edge. I landed on the courtyard stones. I heard loud voices from the castle door. I ran away to hide in the shadows. 
My mother and father came with you and old Arthur. My mother was screaming. My father told Arthur to pull on the winch handle. You looked pale and shocked. I was hiding in the shadows, feeling excited. Then I saw the drops of dirty water I had left from the well to where I stood. I looked in horror at the dark spots on the dry stones. I looked back at my father, who was shining a flashlight into the well. The drops sparkled in the sunlight. I couldn’t believe no one had seen them. My mother was screaming loudly now, a sound I had never heard before. It scared me. 
What should I do? I had played a trick on you, but now it was serious. It went from a fun idea to something that could get me in big trouble. I was angry with myself for not thinking this through. I thought of a plan. I gathered my courage and came out of hiding. I cried out softly, then yelled louder when no one heard me. I stumbled a little and then fell on the stones. I sat up, feeling comforted in my mother’s arms. I said I had found a secret tunnel from the bottom of the well to the moat and crawled through it until I got out. 
I thought I was almost getting away with it until my father came to me. He asked me to repeat my story. I did, but I hesitated. His eyes narrowed. I said the secret passage had fallen in after me, and it was dangerous to go down. I looked into my father’s eyes, and it felt like looking into a dark tunnel. He said, “Don’t be ridiculous, boy,” with a tone that made me feel very small. He walked away. Arthur looked at me with a sad expression, shaking his head. He could see through my lie and worried about me. This made me feel even worse."
CPE_51,C2,"**Removal Day**
Susan is a widow. Her children are now grown up, and she has to leave her family home. A van with the words ""Removers of Distinction"" is outside. Fred, the removal man, is packing her things carefully. He is big and strong, and he is careful with the fragile items. Susan's house is beautiful. It has four floors and looks over a small harbour. She remembers the years she spent there with her children. 
When they bought the house, her son Robert, who was five years old, asked, ""Mum, how do you get a house home?"" Now, Robert is helping her move, and he is making sure she does not talk about the piano. Francesca, her daughter, is also helping. She is very bossy and wants to take care of the piano because it is special.
Fred notices that Susan is not crying. He tells her that some people cry when they move. They are happy while packing, but when they see the empty house, they start to cry. Susan understands this feeling. She thinks she should have told the movers about the piano before they started.
The piano is in the best room of the house. They will move it last. Sitting on the stairs, Susan remembers the day they moved in. The piano was the first thing they brought into the house, but it got stuck on the stairs. The movers worked hard for two hours to get it inside. Robert watched with excitement, and Francesca cried because she wanted the piano in the house.
Peter, Susan's late husband, helped solve the problem. They had to take out a window to get the piano inside. A crane was used to lift it through the window, and the children were very happy to see it. It took a long time to save money to tune the piano after that.
Now, Susan feels sad. Her children are busy and do not come home often. She is also having trouble moving around the house. She worries about the piano and thinks she should have told the movers about it. 
Fred asks if she is okay. He tells her that the piano is the last thing to move. Susan's heart is racing. Robert and Francesca come to watch. Fred talks to her, and she feels like crying. Moving things makes her think about how important they are. 
Just then, the piano comes down the stairs. Fred is careful with it. They take it outside and put it down by the van. Robert laughs first, and soon they are all laughing together. They are happy that the move is over. As they walk down the path for the last time, Susan only sheds tears of laughter."
CPE_11,C2,"Online Literary Criticism for Everyone**
**Do-it-yourself literary criticism: Is it just fun?**
The Internet was made to be open for everyone. This means anyone can share their ideas or create a music channel online. At first, you needed some technical skills to do this, but there was one area that became open to many people: book reviews. 
Amazon.com was the first popular online bookstore. Here, anyone could write a review about a book and give it up to five stars. This was a great idea because it allowed readers to see what others thought about a book, not just what the publisher said or what professional critics wrote. 
Other online bookstores also allowed reviews, but Amazon was the biggest. It had more than 80% of the online market and received many reviews. However, this also led to some problems. Thousands of reviews were sent every day, and Amazon could not check them all. They had a team of editors who looked for reviews that broke the rules, like one-word reviews or personal attacks on authors. But many reviews were still anonymous, so it was easy for some people to write fake reviews.
For example, a writer named Lev Grossman was upset by bad reviews of his first book. He wrote some good reviews under a fake name to make his book look better. This worked until he wrote an article about it, and then Amazon removed his fake reviews. 
Authors could also comment on their own books by clicking a link. Most authors wrote friendly messages asking people to buy and enjoy their books. Some even shared their email addresses for readers to contact them. However, Amazon did not always check if the comments were really from the authors, except for famous writers.
One time, a little-known writer pretended to be famous author John Updike in a comment. Amazon quickly removed it because it was fake. 
The real drama happened with reader reviews. When James McElroy's book about a cheerleading team came out, it got good reviews from the press. But some people mentioned in the book were angry and wrote many bad reviews on Amazon. These reviews disappeared after a few days. 
Despite this, Amazon liked that many people were writing and reading reviews. They wanted reviews to be a place to talk about books, not just a chat room. They paid special attention to popular books to make sure the reviews followed the rules. 
For less popular books, people could post funny reviews. For example, ""The Story about Ping,"" a children's book about a duck, inspired some silly reviews. One review compared the book to how the Internet works. 
Most reviews on Amazon were serious, and they helped people decide if a book was worth buying. The writer George Orwell once said that writing too many reviews was hard because you had to pretend to feel something about books you didn’t care about. This is why letting everyone write reviews is a good thing."
CPE_14,C2,"
**Art in Modern Times**
In the last two hundred years, people often say that artists must go against the art of their time. We like to think that art is special, new, and sometimes shocking. We feel good when we admire artists whose work was not liked a hundred years ago. But when we look at art today, we often say that an artist has gone too far or that their work is not really art. The media often say this for us, and we agree because we expect art to be very different. We forget that today’s art has old ideas and methods too. 
In the past, people asked artists to create art for specific reasons, and art was part of everyday life. Now, we let artists work alone and sometimes get upset if they do not connect with us.
**Picture This**
I will describe a situation and then ask an important question. An artist picks a piece of text from an art book. The text talks about different kinds of pictures and asks, ""What are they all about?"" It then says, ""There are many different kinds of pictures."" This is simple language, but stay with me. 
After choosing the text, the artist asks someone to make a canvas for him. He tells a sign painter to write the text on the canvas in simple black letters without making it fancy. The sign painter does this. My important question is: Is this finished work a painting?
**Underground Encounters**
At the Mercury Gallery in London until June 26, there is a rule that successful painters should stick to one style. Collectors want artists to keep making the same kind of art, and if they try something new, people often feel disappointed. 
Some artists, like Picasso and Hockney, can change their style and still be successful. Eric Rimmington is another artist who is trying something new. He is moving from painting still lifes to painting the London Underground. He finds the underground interesting. His new show, called Underground Encounters, has 40 paintings and drawings that show the magic of this hidden world where people travel.
**Extract from a Novel**
I have come to this island with a few books. I say ""escape"" because the villagers joke that only a sick person would choose such a quiet place to live. I am here to heal myself. I am alone except for an old woman who comes from the village to clean my house. I feel neither happy nor sad; I feel like I am floating in my memories. 
I talked about the uselessness of art but did not say how it can comfort us. The comfort of art is that it helps us see reality in a new way. Our everyday actions often hide the true meaning of life. For artists, art helps us deal with the pain of daily life and fulfill our imagination. Otherwise, why should we hurt each other?"
CPE_63,C2,"**Family Business**
""Look here, it's no good!"" said my Dad. We were in the car going back to London. My father, with my brother Maurice, had just picked me up from the girls' school I attended. He had also just been to Parent's Day, where I got a prize for Latin and another prize for doing well in my exams. He had talked a lot with my headteacher, and now we were going home for the holidays.
""What isn't?"" I asked, but I already knew what he was thinking because he was quiet. My father usually talked a lot. ""You can't fool me. You'll do what you want now,"" he said. ""With all those certificates, I heard you will get a scholarship to Oxford.""
""So?"" I replied, trying to act brave. ""Mightn't that be useful?""
""I also heard,"" he continued, ""that you want to be a barrister. A barrister!"" My father knew a lot about lawyers and the law. ""I just said that,"" I said. ""I couldn't think of anything else to say!""
""And apparently,"" he went on, ""you have the right personality. You can understand a lot of information quickly, you are good at talking, and you like performing.""
""I don't know about that,"" I said. ""I only know what I see on TV.""
""Anyway,"" he said, ""I feel like you won't want to join the family business. You will go to Oxford University, and after that, I can't see you wanting to do it.""
The problem was that I felt trapped by what my family expected. I could see many jobs I could do, and I wanted to explore them. But I didn't want to upset my father. I wasn't as scared of him as Maurice was - I was his favorite - but I still found him strong.
""It's too soon to know,"" I said weakly.
""I tell you, you won't want to join us,"" said my father, who often turned out to be right. ""It's a pity because you have the skills - the brains, the courage, the vision.""
""There's still Maurice,"" I said, feeling unhappy. My father laughed. We both knew Maurice didn't like the business.
""Anyway,"" I said, ""you could always use me as a consultant."" My mother had died when I was young, and my father raised me and Maurice. Maurice was two years younger than me, and I took care of him because he didn't have a mother. I loved Maurice. 
Because the business was successful, we lived well - in a big house in London, nice schools, good clothes, parties, and shows. My father knew many people - politicians, actors, and businesspeople - and our house was always busy with interesting conversations.
""I tell you what,"" my father said. ""You can help us during the holidays until you leave Oxford. Then if you want to leave, you can. It will give you some money and help me.""
""OK,"" I said, happy to avoid making choices right now, especially because my father would be sad if I disagreed. This was how he controlled us.
So, I helped out during my last term at school and during university vacations, never more than twice a year and always with easier tasks. I became one of the smarter students, with a small house, a nice car, and good clothes.
In my last term, my father came to see me and took me to a village for a meal. There were only a few weeks left. My teacher said I would get a First Class degree in Law, and I wanted to focus on studying.
My father told me that he needed me to do one last important job for the family business. ""But Dad,"" I said, ""I have my final exams soon, and I need to focus on that. It's really important.""
I could see that my father didn't understand how important my exams were. He would think that if I said no, I was being unkind. As he explained the job, I saw how focused and strong he was. He was very good at his work, and I admired that. It made my own plans seem less important.
""All right,"" I said. ""I'll do it."""
CPE_56,C2,"
Simon Costello realized that buying the house in Pembroke Square was a mistake within a year after he and Lois moved in. It was a big expense that they could only afford by being very careful with their money. At first, it seemed like a good idea. Simon had many successful cases at work, and Lois returned to her job at the advertising agency two months after their twins were born. She got a raise, and her salary was thirty-five thousand.
Lois wanted to move because their flat was too small for their family. They needed more space, a garden, and a separate room for an au pair. They could have found a bigger place in a less expensive area, but Lois wanted to live in a nice part of London. She thought that living in a less fashionable place would not look good for Simon, who was a young barrister, and for her as a successful businesswoman.
Lois decided that one of them should take public transport to save money. Since her office was far away, Simon had to take the tube. The crowded journey made him feel unhappy and angry. He thought about his grandfather's house in Hampstead, where he stayed as a boy. He remembered the smell of dinner and how his grandmother took care of his grandfather when he came home tired from work. She was always at legal events and seemed happy with her life.
Lois made it clear before they got married that her job was just as important as Simon's. They both needed their salaries to pay for the house and their lifestyle. Now, they were worried that a woman named Venetia could ruin everything. Venetia had come to their office in a bad mood. She was very angry about something.
Simon wished he had left his room earlier to avoid talking to her. He remembered her angry words. She accused him of knowing that a man named Brian Cartwright had bribed jurors four years ago when Simon was his lawyer. Simon denied it, but he felt guilty. He remembered feeling scared when he was a boy and got in trouble at school.
When he looked into Venetia's eyes, he saw that she did not believe him. He wished he had said something different to defend himself. He thought about how Venetia was judging him and if she had the right to do that. He was worried that if people heard the rumors, it could ruin his career."

I chose this place to live because I thought I would be alone. I wanted to be among people who did not care about broken houses or messy gardens. But I was wrong. People in the shops soon start to recognize you, even if you don’t know them. The beautiful roses from next door remind me that gardens can be loved. Usually, I stay inside and try to forget about summer, but tonight I am watching the birds flying between the trees and roofs. I have cut back some plants to make space for a chair, and my arms are a bit sore from working in the garden. It is a small garden in London, where plants have to grow tall to survive.
“Looks like you are cleaning up,” says my upstairs neighbor, Jaz. She is a writer and I sometimes help her with her work. I have her latest story with me. “How is your writing going, Jaz?” I ask. “Oh, it’s hard. People always ask me about my work,” she replies. “I have something to drink in the fridge. I’ll bring it down.” I don’t want Jaz in the garden, and I see that it looks messy. She knocks on my door. “So, you are on holiday now,” she says, sitting in my chair while I put a cushion on the ground. “I should have become a teacher. Writers don’t have holidays. But you know what they say, those who can, do, and those who can’t, teach.” 
“What are your plans for the holiday?” she asks. I feel worried about the empty days ahead. “I am going to Stonebridge tomorrow. Can you feed my cats?” I ask. “Of course,” Jaz says, knowing she will be around. “Where will you stay? A nice bed and breakfast?” “No, I will stay with my friend Ruby at the Rising Sun. We have been friends since we were kids.” This is not true, but I often deal with stories.
“Going back to your roots. What do you think of my story?” Jaz asks about her manuscript, The Cruelty of Red Vans, which I have not read much. I like the title. I can see how red vans can be cruel, bringing gifts to other houses. I decide to be honest. “Try writing about nice people for a change,” I say. “A little less about yourself and more about others.” “Teachers!” Jaz replies, upset. “I keep a journal where I write something good about each day.” My advice sounds old-fashioned. “Keep a journal! Nice people! Get a life, Ann.” I have a life. I work, go out sometimes, and read on the tube. 
When we go inside, my calm kitchen makes me feel better. Then I remember my old geography teacher, Miss Tarrantine, who was about my age now. She once winked at us and said, “I’ve had my moments.” We all laughed.

CPE_6,C2,"**Heritage**
Heritage means the connection people have with their past. We often feel connected to our personal heritage because we know about our grandparents and have heard stories about their lives. It is important to learn about our past to understand our future. Heritage helps us feel a part of something bigger. It teaches us about our culture and traditions. In the past, people shared stories to keep their heritage alive, but now many of these stories are lost. Instead, we can learn from old buildings and places. It is important to protect these places to remember our ancestors.
**The Fens**
I wrote a novel called *Waterland*, and the Fens, a flat area in England, are important in the story. Some people ask why I wrote about a place I do not know well. I chose the Fens because they seemed simple and quiet, but I learned they are actually very interesting and unique. Many people in England find the Fens strange, even though they are part of England. The Fens are both empty and full of life, wild and cultivated, open and mysterious. I have not visited some towns in the Fens, but I like to imagine what they are like. The Fens are not just a place; they are also a way of thinking.
**Museums**
Museums should make their collections easy to see and understand. In the past, they just put items in display cases with long labels. Now, museums should be more interesting and use creative ways to attract visitors. They should also help many different people enjoy their collections. For example, some museums lend boxes of objects to teachers and even help elderly people who are losing their memory. Museums show real items from history, not copies. This is their strength. Museums that create exciting displays and programs will attract more visitors who want to see real history.
**Architecture and Environment**
The desire to keep things safe is not new, but changes in our towns happen quickly. This can make some people want to protect old buildings and encourage others to think about how towns change. People who have lived through big events, like wars, may want to preserve things more than others. If we need to keep things safe, planners should consider this. Change is not bad if we learn how to manage it. Changes in our towns reflect changes in our society, like our population and needs."
CPE_33,C2,"Einstein**
If you ask people on the street to name a scientist, many will say Albert Einstein. His picture is used to sell many products, like computers and books. Most people do not know much about what Einstein did, except that he created some famous theories called 'relativity'. These theories are known for being hard to understand and for making strange predictions that do not match everyday life.
Einstein was part of a big change in science. Scientists wanted to understand the universe better by studying how matter and natural forces work together. Einstein made important contributions by looking closely at basic ideas: time, space, matter, and energy. Before him, scientists like Isaac Newton thought that stars and planets moved in a fixed space and time. Einstein changed this idea, saying that time and space are not fixed but can change.
**Young Readers**
When we were children, Lydia and I did not like prize-winning books because we thought they were boring. Our mother did not like this and often showed her disapproval. But our father would give us small coins for each chapter we read to encourage us. He also gave us some special books for Christmas and birthdays, marked with 'This Book is NOT Literature'. We thought many of his books were for boys, but he did help us read some good stories and even a famous book of poems.
**Language**
Jacob Grimm wrote in 1851 that the beginning of human language is a secret and wonderful thing. This secret has led to many strange ideas. For example, Charles Caller said in 1928 that early humans made sounds like ""meuh"" when they were scared. This sound is sad. Early humans who faced dangerous animals made desperate noises, and some words today still remind us of this, like ""malaria"" meaning ""fever"" and the Latin word ""mors"" meaning ""death"".
Many people thought these ideas were silly, but now, the study of how language began and changed is very important. Language likely started in East Africa about 100,000 years ago. At first, people used speech for friendly talks and to gain power. Sharing information was probably not the main reason for language, which is different from what philosopher John Locke said about language being a way to share knowledge."
CPE_20,C2,"Writing Reviews**
Frank Kermode talks about writing reviews. Most reviews are written quickly and do not last long. They have deadlines and must be short. When they are published, they are only in the newspaper for a day, a week, or maybe a month. Because of this, many people think that writing reviews is not very important. Some believe that people only write reviews because they need money. Others think it is because they cannot spend all their time on a book.
However, writing reviews is a skilled job. It is different to write a short review of 600 or 800 words than to write a longer review of 6,000 or 8,000 words. A good reviewer must think about who will read the review. Some readers just want a quick summary, while others want a detailed analysis.
A reviewer needs to know a lot about different topics and must write in a way that is easy for smart people to understand. Most reviewers also write other things besides reviews. For example, the American writer John Updike does some reviewing while he writes his novels. He collects all his reviews into books with simple titles.
Some people think that less famous writers should accept that their reviews will not last long. But if they believe their best writing is in reviews, they should be allowed to keep them. I feel this way about my own work. I mostly write academic books, which are serious and for professors. In English-speaking countries, it is common for the same people to write both reviews and academic studies.
In the past, some academics did not like professors who wrote reviews. They thought it was a waste of time. But now, there are many reviews, and many people can write them. This is good for readers because they can trust that the reviewer knows what they are talking about. It is also good for professors because it helps them remember to write clearly for everyone, not just for other professors.
In conclusion, writing reviews is important, but it is usually a secondary job. You can only write good reviews if you are also doing something else well."
CPE_40,C2,"
Ralph opened the door to his flat. When he entered the dark hall, he felt a quick feeling of ownership. Even after three years, this feeling sometimes came back to him when he returned home alone at the end of the day. When he first bought the flat, he was always excited to come home. He wondered what the flat had been doing while he was away. It felt like a welcome place for him, a space where he could relax. 
He thought he should worry about things like break-ins or leaks, but his flat always seemed to be waiting for him. It looked either independent or a bit messy, depending on how he had left it. Over time, he started to see it as part of himself, a place where his thoughts and feelings spilled out. He became frustrated that it could not change. 
There were always some letters by the door and the answering machine sometimes blinked when he got home. He was thankful that his windows were not broken and that nothing bad had happened to his flat. From his small office on the third floor, Ralph often looked forward to his quiet evenings at home. After leaving the busy office, he felt a little more like himself on the bus ride home. 
But when he got home, he didn’t want to be alone anymore. At his desk, he wanted to be by himself, but when he escaped from work, he felt empty. He wondered if working in a job he didn’t like had changed him. He often read or listened to music at night, but he started to ask himself why he did these things. 
His thoughts became unclear, and he felt lost. He remembered a time when he felt stronger and thought he could change his life. But he had wanted something so much that he just followed the first opportunity that came his way. After university, he tried to make a plan for his life, but he only wanted to survive. 
He applied for jobs he heard about from his friends and followed them as they moved ahead. He went to one job interview and was happy to talk with Neil, his future boss. Neil offered him a job right away, saying he was the only graduate who had applied. Ralph took this as a compliment at the time."
CPE_45,C2,"**Goat Racing**
I was going to see goat racing. It was Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. I was moving through ice-cream vans, many people, food stalls, and loud music. Everyone was going to the racecourse, but I pushed through the crowds to find a good spot. They had made a special area for the race. It was not like big racecourses, but people were standing on both sides of the ground where the goats would run. They were trying to keep a few goats in order. This is not easy because goats can eat almost anything!
**Canoe Trip**
As the day ended, I started to worry about the night. The canoe was too wet to sleep in, and we could not find a place to stop. We had not seen any villages or huts since morning. In the dim moonlight, we could see the cliffs, but our flashlight was not working well. We changed the batteries, but they did not work either. We could not find a place to camp. A little later, Lesley said she saw a light far away, and we felt hopeful. But the light was just the moon shining on the waves. Soon, we heard the loud sound of rushing water, but we could not see what was happening. We kept moving on.
**How to Be Presentation Perfect**
I am not good at making presentations, but as a managing director, I have to present to my colleagues and important shareholders. How can I get better at this and feel more confident? You are not alone. Making a presentation is different from running a company, but many leaders need to be good at it. If you want to convince your audience, you must believe in what you are saying. Show your belief with passion and enthusiasm. This means you need to prepare well. Test your ideas before the presentation. Ask your colleagues what tough questions the audience might ask. You should also create a positive atmosphere from the start. Begin with something everyone can relate to and then move towards your main point."
CPE_64,C2,"
Some activities take time and cannot be rushed. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you are impatient with making mayonnaise and add the oil too fast, it will not work. If you pull hard on a tangled fishing line, it will get tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some things happen very quickly, while others take a long time, like seconds, minutes, hours, days, or even years. 
We can get better at some things, like solving puzzles or doing math quickly. But some things cannot be rushed. If we try to hurry them, they can break, like the mayonnaise, or get tangled, like the fishing line. Sometimes, saying ""Think fast; we need results"" is not helpful. We learn and think in different ways, and these ways work at different speeds.
There are three main speeds of thinking. The first is very fast. Some situations need a quick reaction. For example, if my motorbike slipped on a wet road, my body moved quickly to keep me safe. I did not think about it; I just reacted. This fast reaction is called our ""wits.""
The second speed is thinking. This is when we figure things out, weigh options, and solve problems. For example, a mechanic fixing a car or a student working on homework is using this kind of thinking. We often call this ""intellect."" People who are good at solving problems are called ""bright"" or ""clever.""
The third speed is slower. This way of thinking is more relaxed and dreamy. When we sit quietly by the sea or are just about to sleep, we are in this slower thinking mode. This slow thinking is also important. It helps us understand complex situations. 
Recent studies show that taking time to think slowly can help us solve difficult problems. When we are not sure what to do, it is better to sit and think rather than rush for answers. This slow thinking is connected to creativity and wisdom. Poets and philosophers have known for a long time that slow thinking can be very valuable. Scientists are now studying these slower ways of thinking and finding that they can help us understand many things better. 
**Questions:**
1. What happens if you add oil too quickly when making mayonnaise?
2. What are the three speeds of thinking mentioned in the text?
3. Why is slow thinking important?
4. How can slow thinking help us with difficult problems?
5. Who has known about the value of slow thinking for a long time?"
CPE_29,C2,"Surviving in a Foreign Land**
I have been welcomed warmly. It is a friendly place in a very isolated area. There are about forty people here - scientists, students, weather experts, and satellite trackers. We all work together as a community. My school French is enough to communicate, but not enough to have fun conversations. I miss the small details in conversations, and my phrasebook does not help me at breakfast. This is not a big problem, but at first, I felt unsure of myself. I was a little scared of mealtimes. I would wait and worry about which table to sit at. I felt anxious, like I did in the first weeks of school. I still smile awkwardly or feel nervous when people talk to me. I think this feeling is not about missing people or communication, but about losing my confidence in social situations.
**Elliot**
When I first met Elliot, I was just a young writer, and he did not notice me. He remembered faces, and when I saw him, he would shake my hand but did not want to be friends. If I saw him at the opera with important people, he would not see me. But then I became successful as a playwright, and I noticed that Elliot started to be friendlier. One day, he sent me a note to have lunch, and I thought he wanted to get to know me better. After that, I met him more often because my success brought me new friends.
**Alfred Hitchcock**
The film director Alfred Hitchcock said he did not care about the story of his films or the acting. He cared about the pictures and the sound. For Hitchcock, it was not the message or the acting that moved the audience. He believed that people react to the film itself, no matter where they come from. So, if a film is made well, people in Japan and India should react at the same time. Hitchcock was very clear and logical about his work. He was a genius who liked to see the audience react. He did not think about deep ideas or complex meanings. He focused on the film and how it could affect the audience."
CPE_57,C2,"Amateur Astronomy**
Many things have changed in astronomy in the last 50 years. About 30 years ago, there were not many charts and books about astronomy. Telescopes were not very good, and there were few practical guides. Today, we have many types of telescopes and equipment available. Electronic calculators and computers help us make charts and analyze observations. This is a great time for amateur astronomy. 
However, some things are worse now. People may need to travel 80 km to find a dark sky, which was easier to find 50 years ago. During the day, we see many airplane trails in the sky. These trails can last for hours and make it hard to see the sun and stars.
**Too Much Choice**
Today, we have too many choices. There are many things to do and many products to buy. People want the newest things, and technology makes this faster. New products come out all the time, and it can be overwhelming. More choices can cause stress and take up our time. 
Because of this, many people want to simplify their lives. They look for simple things that make them happy in a complicated world. But it is not easy to simplify life when there are so many products and options available.
**McAndrews Hotel**
Every summer, my family stays for two weeks at McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. This is a family tradition started by my grandmother. It is very important to us. We do not want anything to change this tradition. 
The guests at McAndrews Hotel are often old-fashioned. I do not like the bad manners of some shop assistants today. I prefer to be polite and keep my distance from others. I know many of the other guests because we have been coming here since we were children. When I see them, we usually just say hello and do not talk much. This respect for privacy is hard to find in hotels today."
CPE_9,C2,"Othello and Lake Vostok**
**Othello**  
A great show of Shakespeare's play Othello is now in London. I want to say sorry for a bad review I wrote when the show started last spring. I said that Ray Fearon was too young for the main role, and I did not like his acting. I still think it is not right to change the age difference between Othello and Desdemona, but I take back my words about Mr. Fearon's great performance. The whole cast is wonderful. Some memorable scenes are when Cassio plays games with other young officers, and things go too far. Another important moment is when Iago starts to lose control. The scene where Emilia helps Desdemona get ready for bed is very emotional. The speed and tension in the play are amazing. Do not miss this show!
**Lake Vostok**  
In Antarctica, there is very little life. On the edges, you can see penguins, seals, and birds. But in the middle, there is a huge area of ice with no life. However, there is a big hidden lake called Lake Vostok under almost 4 kilometers of ice. This lake has been cut off from air and sunlight for up to 25 million years. Scientists are excited to explore this lake and find out what strange life might be there. For two years, researchers from around the world have been trying to learn the secrets of the lake. If they succeed, we will see many discoveries about Lake Vostok in the next few years.
**Scientists**  
Last week, I heard something interesting on the radio. Some scientists are thinking about why they want to be scientists. We know they want to learn about everything, from tiny atoms to big black holes. But these scientists want to understand why we want to know these things. They wonder why science cannot explain this desire. I think it is more important to know if what scientists do is right, rather than argue about why we want to know. Science is a tool, and we should decide how and when to use it."
CPE_42,C2,"Food and People**
**Food**  
Food is very important in our lives. Many people who like cooking buy cookbooks. Sometimes, we think cooking is only for special occasions or fancy dishes. But that is not true! You can make a tasty soup by putting chopped carrots, a leek, celery, and some herbs in water. This is better than buying soup in a packet or a can. Instead of buying a sweet chocolate dessert full of chemicals, you can make a delicious treat in just five minutes. Cooking is also a way to show care and love. Sharing food is special, and we often celebrate important events like birthdays and anniversaries with meals. No one would want to eat takeout at a wedding!
**In the Elevator**  
This morning, Alistair tried to clean his office, but it was still messy. Papers were everywhere, and he had many tax forms to organize. He also had a lot of books and journals. As he took the elevator to his floor, he knew Mallory would arrive on time for their meeting. She was very punctual and liked things to be neat. He wondered how she would react to the mess. She might think someone had made a mess in his office. Alistair saw his cleaning lady, Mrs. Wilson, and smiled at her. But she looked unhappy and did not want to go into his messy office.
**Karen**  
Karen wanted to be different from her mother. She created her own story about strength. One important moment in her life was when she was twelve years old. Her brother accidentally hit her in the eye with a golf club. At first, she thought she would go blind. But the doctor said she was okay and only needed a few stitches. When she saw her mother in the doctor's office, her mother talked about miracles. Karen felt she was saved for a reason.
**Miss Fogerty**  
Miss Fogerty was walking quickly across the village green. She felt both excited and sad about something she had just seen. It is nice to be the first to know important news in a small town, but she was also worried about Dr. Bailey's health. He had been her doctor for many years and always cared for her when she was sick. She appreciated how he took the time to listen to her problems. This made him very loved in the village. He always gave his time, knowledge, and humor to his patients, and they respected him for it."
CPE_59,C2,"**Joanna's Lessons**
Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist. She plays music for many people. But she also writes books for young children who want to learn the piano. Joanna plays the piano very well. She can play many types of music, like classical, jazz, and blues. One time, at a concert for kids, a small boy asked her, ""Can you play Match of the Day?"" This surprised her, but she thought it was funny. She played it for him, and he was happy.
Joanna cares a lot about how children learn to play the piano. She has written a book called *Joanna MacGregor's Piano World* to help kids learn. Even though she is very busy with concerts and other projects, she wanted to make this book. She believes that the first lessons in music are very important. Many people think only about the best musicians, but Joanna thinks everyone should be able to enjoy music.
When she was younger, Joanna taught many children how to play the piano. She remembers how much fun it was to play music with them. She wants all kids to have the chance to learn the piano, just like they can learn to swim or speak a little French. Some kids learn quickly, but others take more time and sometimes give up. Joanna worries that some children stop playing because they feel too much pressure from their parents to be perfect.
Joanna does not want to criticize other piano books or teachers. She knows her books are not the only ones that can help kids learn. Her books have stories and music to make learning fun. She believes that children should enjoy playing the piano. They should be able to play freely and try new things.
As children learn, they need to practice reading music. Joanna understands that this can be hard. She thinks practice is very important. She did not practice a lot until she went to music school, but now she loves it. She practices for many hours every day. Joanna wants to help children who find practicing difficult. She suggests that they set goals for their practice and mix easy pieces with harder ones. 
Learning music should be fun, and Joanna wants to make sure all children can enjoy it."
CPE_54,C2,"Writing by Hand and on Screen**
Dr. Johnson said that ""what is written without effort is usually read without pleasure."" This means that good writing is hard to do. When I look at my old school essays, I see that I did not cross out many words. Today, I would change my writing many times. I think this is because writing by hand is hard. Writing slowly helps me think better. When I write on a computer, I can change things easily, but this can make my writing careless. 
Many writers spend a lot of time fixing their work on a computer, just like they would if they wrote by hand. Also, emails are different from handwritten letters. Emails can be quick and not very emotional. But many people now write love letters in emails. This is good because at least they are writing in English and using some grammar. However, words on a screen can feel boring. People often do not think carefully about what they write, and their messages can become confusing. 
One day, I looked at a CD. The case was not very nice, but the shiny disc inside looked interesting. Mr. Warriston came into the room and said, ""Wonderful little things, aren't they?"" I agreed and gave him the disc. He said, ""It is amazing that they can fit seventy minutes of music on them."" He turned on the music player, and lights came on. He put the disc inside and pressed a button. 
I asked, ""Do you have to turn them over, like records?"" He said, ""No, you only play one side."" I wondered why. He thought for a moment and said, ""I don't know. You could make both sides playable."" He smiled and said, ""Good point."" Then he told me to sit in the best place to hear the music.
**Books vs. Electronic Text**
Malcolm Bradbury said that if matches were invented after cigarette lighters, we would think matches were old and not good. Some people say that electronic text is as important as the invention of printing. They think it will change everything. But it takes a long time for people to change how they think. 
In 1979, a book said that books would slowly disappear in the 1980s. This was wrong. Reading long texts on a screen is not enjoyable, so many people do not do it. Computers make it easy to read only parts of a text. Some people say this is good because it creates new ways to tell stories. But many books have always been read in parts, like religious texts and dictionaries. The problem is that computers do not help people read everything from start to finish.
**The Office**
Charles walked into the office and saw everything was neat. The carpet was clean, and the desk was dark wood, just like he remembered. Files were in their right places, and twelve years of trade journals filled the shelves. Kathleen was trying to close a filing cabinet and then looked at him. 
""You have to use computers, Charles. This is too much,"" she said. 
""Hello, Kathleen. This is amazing,"" he replied, looking at the room and its old furniture. He did not think about computers at all. They had talked about this many times before. She did not understand why he did not want to use technology, even though he was good with computers and had written an important paper about them. She could use software to create new things easily."
CPE_32,C2,"""You don’t take sugar, do you?"" shouted his secretary. She was not really asking; she was stating a fact because she had been making coffee for Lancelot for many months. She forgot sometimes because he was not usually there. But now, he was there all the time. He realized that if he stayed away, things would go wrong. 
He thought about how he had changed from a valued helper, meeting authors and playwrights for lunch, to someone who was always busy and had trouble finding a place to park at work. 
""This came,"" she yelled, waving a folder before putting it in front of him. ""From that guy in Los Angeles. You wanted to see it."" The label said: ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert."" Under that, it said ""An Expanded Synopsis."" Lancelot did not want to see the word ""synopsis."" He wanted to see ""A First Draft."" He had already seen a synopsis of this book and did not want to see another one. 
Ian Cuthbert had received a lot of money for this book when Lancelot bought the company. Ian was one of Lancelot's old friends, and he had made a mistake by asking him to write books. Ian was known for being unpredictable. Lancelot quickly read the synopsis. He recognized almost every phrase. He closed the folder and pushed it aside. It seemed that Ian's manuscript would never come. The synopsis was not as brilliant as it should have been, and it felt like it lacked real ideas. 
Lancelot remembered a famous author who had published an incomplete book after his death. That author had been paid little by little for each chapter. But Ian had received a lot of money upfront, which was not how things should work. Lancelot remembered when Ian was a promising talent in Cambridge. Ian's friends wanted to take over British theatre, and they did. But Ian seemed lazy compared to them. He wore his coat like a cape and talked about famous writers as if he had met them. 
For some reason, Ian's creative ideas stayed hidden. While others succeeded, Ian did not. Even when he was influential, he was hard to work with. He was supposed to edit a magazine about the arts, but it never got published. His contract with a fashion magazine was renewed three times, but he still did not produce anything. At meetings, he was critical of other people's ideas. Ten years later, he was not reliable at all. Lancelot was starting to think that ""A World History of the Short"" was a mistake from the beginning."
CPE_65,C2,"England's Breakfast Revolution**
A good breakfast is very important, according to health experts. But in history, breakfast is a new idea in England. In medieval times, people did not often write about breakfast. Some travelers ate a meal at dawn before long journeys, and sick people had breakfast for health reasons. But most people did not eat breakfast unless they were kings or nobles.
In the sixteenth century, breakfast became normal for more people. Some writers say this happened because there was more food available. However, there were also big changes in society. For example, more people had jobs with set hours. Many of these jobs started very early in the morning. So, eating breakfast became necessary for everyone, not just for rich people."

**Photography**  
When a photographer takes a picture, they choose what to show based on their skills, personal views, and experiences. This choice is also influenced by social and cultural ideas. In this book, we will see how these factors change the style and meaning of a photograph. We will also look at how people see and react to these images. For example, when someone reads a newspaper, they understand the photos in a special way. But instead of just believing what they see, we can ask if the photo shows the scene as it really was. Or, does it show what the photographer thinks? Is the exact moment in the photo important, or does it represent something bigger in the world?
**More than a Game**  
For me, sport is more than just a game. The best athletes believe in themselves completely. To be the best, you need to focus only on your goal. Sport is tough, and no one will do the work for you. You either succeed or fail. Sport has taught me discipline and determination, but it also shows the importance of teamwork. My sport lets me shine as an individual, but it is also a team game, and I must balance both. It is like life – you can do well alone, but you must remember others around you. Sport has given me a lot, not just money. It has opened doors for me and shown me things in the world that many people will never see. But you also have to give up a lot to get these rewards.
**Tuning In**  
Some experiences stay in our memory very clearly. For me, one special moment happened one night in California a long time ago. I was awake, listening to a mockingbird singing from a tree in my neighborhood. I don’t have trouble sleeping, but the beautiful singing kept me awake. As I listened to the bird's songs, I felt like I was in a special musical world. To understand the bird's music, I thought about jazz and Indian classical music. The bird made me feel like I was hearing an amazing live performance. I cheered and groaned as the bird sang different tunes through my open window, until I finally fell asleep."
CPE_52,C2,"
People have always talked a lot about birds. But what does this say about us? Paul Evans writes about it.
In a greenhouse, a little brown bird called a wren is bumping against the glass. Is it trying to tell us something, or is it just stuck? Depending on how you see it, both could be true. Wrens have been part of British culture for a long time. In medieval times, people believed that the way wrens flew could tell them about their luck. Today, we still see images of wrens in many British homes. Even if old beliefs are not as strong now, people still care about wrens. A place without wrens feels sad.
This connection with birds comes from a time when people depended on nature for survival. They created stories and meanings about birds. These meanings can change over time. For example, the red kite bird was once seen as a helpful bird in London, taking food from children. But later, people thought of them as pests, and they disappeared from many places. Now, red kites are protected again and are important for conservation in Britain.
Our connection with birds is deep and goes back to when humans first started to notice them. Early humans watched birds to know about danger, weather, and food. Birds also connected them to their dreams. When we think about why birds matter to us, we also think about who we are. Birds can fly, sing, and represent freedom. Our interest in birds shows something about our own nature.
Some people think our feelings for birds are not important now. But these feelings are still part of us, and losing them would be hard. That is why birds are important for understanding changes in the environment. In Britain, 30 bird species are in danger. This is sad because it means we are losing not just birds but also part of our culture. 
Certain birds, like the skylark and turtle dove, represent love and magic. Many poems and stories mention these birds, and losing them makes us feel sad. However, we often ignore the loss of other birds that are not in stories or poems.
Folklore, which includes stories and legends about birds, is very important. These stories connect us to birds in a way that scientific facts do not. They help us feel and understand our world better. Whether we watch birds on TV or in our gardens, the joy we feel cannot be explained by science alone. Birds are fascinating, and the stories we tell about them help us understand their meaning in our lives. The wren in the greenhouse connects our present with a long history, and its song makes us think about the future."
CPE_28,C2,"Maps**
A map shows how places and features on the earth are related to each other. This is done by showing distance and direction. In the past, people often talked about distance in terms of time, like ""a few hours' walk"" or ""a day's journey by river."" This way of measuring distance helped people understand how easy it was to travel in different areas, but it did not give exact distances.
Direction is also important, but for most travelers, the main questions were ""Where do I go from here?"" and ""How far is it?"" So, exact directions were not always very important. Because of this, written directions were often used instead of maps. Even today, some maps, like those for train systems, do not show true directions.
In the past, important landmarks along a route were marked by signs that could be realistic or simple. The way maps were made changed depending on their purpose and location. To understand old maps, it is important to know the specific way they were made.
The history of map-making, or cartography, is about how we have become better at showing distance and direction on maps. Over time, cartographers used other sciences to help them. For example, instead of using shadows or stars to find direction, they started using compasses and tools to measure angles accurately.
As people explored the world more, they wanted better maps. Astronomers found out that the earth is not a perfect sphere, which helped improve maps of large areas. The needs of map users also changed. Soldiers, especially after the invention of cannons, needed accurate maps to understand the land better. This led to the creation of contour maps.
Other people, like archaeologists and historians, also needed maps for their work. Today, cartographers make maps for many different uses, such as showing land use or climate. This shows how important maps are in many fields of study.
It is important to remember that the development of maps has not always been smooth. There have been times when map-making did not progress, and old ideas sometimes stayed alongside new ones. Cartographers have often had good ideas but had to wait for better tools to use them. Since it is easy to copy old maps, many map publishers have been slow to accept new ideas.
Therefore, we should not always trust maps as the best evidence of what we know today. The many maps we have now are the result of a lot of hard work and thought. They are valuable records for studying human history. This is what makes learning about historical cartography interesting and important."
CPE_35,C2,"
I met a young man named Andrew Lloyd Webber in his nice room. His room was very different from the messy other rooms in his house. He had many records, a stereo record player, and even nice wine glasses. Andrew was a student at Magdalen College, Oxford, studying history. He had nine months before starting school, and he wanted to be a famous composer like Richard Rodgers.
I also had big dreams. I wanted to be a pop star for reasons like money and fame. But my dreams were not as important as Andrew's. When Andrew asked me to try to be a famous lyricist like Oscar Hammerstein, I agreed. He played me some of his music, and I thought it was very good.
We decided to work together. I was still more interested in pop music than in musicals, but I knew Andrew was talented. I thought it would be exciting to help him. The next day, I was back at my job training to be a lawyer. I felt less sure about my dreams of show business with Andrew. I thought I would probably become a lawyer by the time I was twenty-five, as my father expected.
But I wanted to see Andrew again. It would be fun to write lyrics for musicals. Andrew was interesting; he talked about good food and football. He had an idea for a musical about Dr. Thomas Barnardo, who started orphanages. I thought the story was good, but not very exciting. However, Andrew believed in his music, and I wanted to help him.
I started to write funny songs for the musical. Andrew told me the story and played the music. I even skipped a day at my lawyer job to write lyrics. That day, I didn’t know it, but I was starting a new career. 
**Questions:**
1. What was Andrew Lloyd Webber studying at college?
2. Why did Tim Rice want to be a pop star?
3. What did Andrew ask Tim to do?
4. What was the idea for the musical that Andrew was working on?
5. How did Tim feel about his job as a lawyer?"

**Language**  
You and I are part of a special group of living things. We can share thoughts and feelings with each other using language. Language is very important in our lives. If you see two or more people together, they will probably be talking. When people are alone, they might talk to themselves, their pets, or even their plants. I think of language as a natural skill. This means that people know how to talk, just like spiders know how to make webs. Spiders do not need to learn how to spin webs; they just do it.
**Climate and Weather**  
Climate and weather are made by the air around us. They have a big effect on animals and plants. Climate can change how a place looks. For example, warm and wet weather all year helps tropical jungles grow. These jungles have many different kinds of plants and animals. In cold and windy places, there are not many living things. The weather changes every day because of big air movements. The air moves because the Earth spins. The sun also helps to move the air.
**Coffee**  
As a bar-person, my job was to serve drinks, but I also had to make coffee. In Lygon Street, Melbourne, a restaurant's success can depend on its coffee. I had several days of training to learn how to make coffee and clean the espresso machine. I learned how to make a good cappuccino. After the first week, I realized that making coffee was harder than it seemed. I thought I might have to do easier tasks again. Luckily, my boss was patient. He said, ""Making coffee is both an art and a science, and you need time to learn it."""
CPE_41,C2,"Art on TV**
Why does television often have problems with shows about art? Painting and sculpture are good subjects for TV because the camera can show the whole artwork and then zoom in to see the details. However, there are not many TV series that show the joy and complexity of looking at art. 
A good example is Robert Hughes's series called *American Visions*. Hughes is a trusted critic with a strong personality. He had almost eight hours to introduce British viewers to American art, which British galleries often ignore. I thought the series would show great artworks, but it focused more on how American history and culture are shown in its art and buildings.
**Dealing in Metals**
For 20 years, I worked as a dealer in metals and became known as a speculator. The metals market has fewer rules than other markets. With some luck, a willingness to take risks, and a good understanding of the market, it is possible to make a lot of money. Taking risks is part of this business. This adventurous culture fits well with a free-market economy. 
However, the free-trade economists who said the market would keep the prices of rare metals high have found that the opposite is true. More minerals are being taken from the ground, and the prices of raw materials are going down. If we consider inflation, the prices of most metals are about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to look into claims against a big company that benefits from these cheap raw materials.
**Extract from a Holiday Brochure**
Abaco and its small islands are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas, which stretch from Florida to Cuba. Each island has its own character and something special to offer. To get around the islands of Abaco, you need a boat. If a boat is not included with your room, don’t worry. There are many ferries and water taxis. You can also rent a boat if you want to explore on your own. 
Sailing is the most popular way to travel here. Abaco is called 'The Sailing Capital of the World' for a good reason. The calm waters are perfect for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The islands and their beaches stretch for 200 miles like a string of pearls. At night, the lights of the restaurants and cafes in Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay shine brightly."
CPE_69,C2,"Build Your Own Bamboo Bike at the Bamboo Bike Club**
You can build your own bamboo bike at the Bamboo Bike Club in the UK. This workshop is run by two engineers, James Marr and Ian McMillan. When you join a course, you get a custom bike frame designed by a computer and a fun weekend of bike-building.
It is Saturday morning in Hackney Wick, east London. The Bamboo Bike Club is the only place in Britain where you can learn to build bamboo bikes. I went to see what was happening. There is a lot of energy and fun in the workshop. Bamboo is becoming popular for making bikes. Some companies, like Calfee Design from California and Bamboo Bikes from Yorkshire, have been making bamboo bikes since 1894. But many cyclists find these bikes too expensive. A ready-made bamboo frame can cost about $2,995 or £1,868.
James and Ian wanted to make bamboo bikes that everyone could afford. They spent years working in a shed in Brecon, Wales, to create a business. They wanted to share the joy of making something special and sustainable. Now, the Bamboo Bike Club is more about community than just a business. James works on wind turbines, and Ian is a civil engineer. They run monthly courses where you can build your own bike frame at a good price.
On the first day of the course, James and Ian teach how to choose strong bamboo and how to make strong joints. They help you glue the bamboo tubes together to make the bike frame. They also use metal tubes for parts that need to be strong, like the handlebars and wheel forks. This can be hard for someone who is not good at DIY. But James and Ian are there to help. They check every cut and joint to make sure everything is right. If you make a mistake, it’s okay. You can just try again with a new piece of bamboo.
On Sunday, you spend time building the lugs, which are the parts that connect the frame. You wrap the joints with hemp and glue them to make them strong. After adding a waterproof coating, your bike is ready for wheels, brakes, and other parts. James and Ian say their bamboo bikes are as strong as metal bikes. Ian has used his bike for over a year, and James has tested his bike off-road for three months.
The bamboo bikes may not look as perfect as metal bikes, but they are unique. James and Ian believe that these bikes are meant for a relaxed ride, not for racing. I chose a 'Classic English' frame for a comfortable ride. When I tried James's bike, it felt light and smooth, even on bumpy roads.
James says, ""Some people love building the bike, but I think the best part is riding it."" The bamboo bikes are fun to ride and cost less than £500."

**Self-help Books**  
Diane Reverend was an editor at Random House in New York when she first saw a book by a new pop psychologist, Dr. John Gray. She thought the title was great and knew it would be a bestseller. She was right! Now, Dr. Gray is very rich, and Diane has her own company. Dr. Gray's book helps people understand each other better, especially men and women. This book is very popular and is part of a big self-help industry in America. This industry helps many people who want to improve their lives. It also makes a lot of money for publishers in New York. In Britain, people are seeing that many self-help books are not very good, but many are published anyway. For every self-help book that is published, many others are not accepted because they are too similar or too specific. Editors are always looking for the next big book. They care more about how well a book can sell than how well it is written. Diane says that if someone has a catchy title, it is a big part of the success.
**Autobiographies**  
When someone writes an autobiography, there is an agreement between the writer and the reader that the truth will be told. But this agreement is often not kept. Writers may leave out things they feel are too embarrassing or not important. Sometimes, writers may change the truth to make their story better. They might call their book an autobiography to make readers believe it is true, even if it is not. This can happen without the writer being dishonest.
**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**  
People who study detective stories say that these stories show the problems of society in the late 1800s and early 1900s. In a detective story, a crime represents a human desire, like greed. Solving the crime helps bring order back to society. In Hammett's stories, society is shown to be corrupt. The detective and the criminal are similar in some ways. The detective understands the criminal, and they have a strange connection. The detective is part of both the law and the crime world. Sometimes, he feels guilty about this.
**Science Writing**  
Stephen Jay Gould is a famous science writer. I met him at the Grand Hotel while he was promoting his new book. He said that writing in a fancy place like this is hard. He believes that only scientists can write well about science because they understand it. He also says that writers should not talk down to their readers. They can use simpler words, but they should not make the ideas too simple. If readers feel that the writer is treating them like they are not smart, they will not enjoy the writing."
CPE_17,C2,"Air-conditioning**
At Cannons Gym, many workers from the City of London come for lunch. This summer, it is very hot, so the gym uses a lot of air-conditioning. Sometimes, when it is quiet, the gym feels very cold, like the Arctic. This shows how we often use air-conditioning too much. Air-conditioning is now common in many places, but there are other ways to keep buildings cool. For example, buildings can use sunlight and fresh air. They can also have thicker walls that keep heat out during the day and let it go at night. These ideas can help reduce the need for air-conditioning.
**Sundials**
Now, many people are interested in sundials again. Sundials are tools that tell time by the sun's position. A hundred years ago, they were very important for keeping time. But as clocks became better, sundials were mostly used as garden decorations. Now, people are looking at them again. David Harber, who makes sundials, thinks they are special because they connect us to the planets. He says there is a magical moment when a sundial starts to work. They are calm and beautiful objects that remind us of our place in the universe.
**Paint Your Own China**
I remember seeing china-painting at an art show a long time ago. Older women painted flowers on teacups very carefully. It was amazing to watch them. Their hands were steady, and the paint was perfect. I thought it would be hard to learn china-painting. I wondered if beginners would be good at it. But when I went to a class, it was not scary at all. Everyone was there to have fun, and even the teacher did not want to paint like the women I had seen before."
CPE_47,C2,"The Wrong Country**
Uncle chose a holiday for Keith and Dawne. It was a good price: a flight from Gatwick Airport, twelve nights in Venice, in a hotel called Pensione Concordia. When they went to the travel agency to book the holiday, the clerk told them that other people in the group were students from a school. They were learning Italian.
But something went wrong. Dawne and Keith ended up in a hotel called the Edelweiss, in Switzerland, not Venice. At Gatwick, they gave their tickets to a girl in a yellow-and-red uniform. She checked their tickets and said everything was fine. On the plane, they heard older people speaking with accents from the North of England. Keith thought there was a mistake, maybe a cancellation.
When they arrived, a woman with glasses told them to stay together. They did not expect to stop overnight, but when they got off the coach, it was almost midnight. They were tired and did not ask about their hotel. The next morning, they learned they would stay in the Edelweiss for their holiday. They were worried.
Keith told the receptionist, ""We were supposed to be in Venice."" The receptionist said he did not know that hotel. Dawne said the name of the travel agency and described the man who booked their trip. 
A woman named Mrs. Franks, who was with the older people, came to help. She said there are many different holidays with the same yellow-and-red labels. She laughed and said they could have ended up anywhere. Keith insisted they were not supposed to be in Switzerland.
Mrs. Franks went away to check. Dawne said she seemed nice, but Keith was thinking about everything that happened. An old man and his wife talked to them. They were happy to be there, but Keith and Dawne felt they were in the wrong place. They wanted a holiday for young people, not a trip with older people. Uncle had said this was a holiday for them."
CPE_48,C2,"'HE WAS A PEOPLE PERSON'**
American business leaders are looking at Ernest Shackleton as a good example of management. Eluned Price reports. 
Most people in Britain know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and what he did. In America, people are just starting to learn about him. The Wall Street Journal called Shackleton ""an Antarctic explorer"" whose work was not noticed for most of the 20th century. Now, Americans are very interested in him. Many books and stories about his journey on the Endurance are being made. The American Museum of Natural History is planning a big exhibition, and a film about Shackleton's life is being prepared.
Some American managers see Shackleton as a role model. They tell stories about his actions and find lessons in his leadership. They even say they are ""speaking Shackleton."" Shackleton, who used a reindeer sleeping bag and a blubber stove, is now a model for modern management.
Jim MacGregor, a manager in New York, has looked up to Shackleton for many years. His company helps with communication during business changes and crises. He says that even if a company handles a crisis well, it can still hurt itself by communicating poorly. MacGregor believes Shackleton is a good model for management because he was a strong leader and communicator. Shackleton knew what was important, especially when lives were at risk.
One important decision Shackleton made was to turn back when he was only 97 miles from the South Pole. This choice showed that he cared about his men’s lives. In a crisis, people want to know who is in charge. While many managers today avoid responsibility, Shackleton was ready to take charge.
In 1914, Shackleton's ship, the Endurance, got stuck in ice for nine months and was finally crushed. When the ship sank, Shackleton told his men, ""We should all reach safety if you do your best and trust me."" His diaries show that he was always in control. 
MacGregor says Shackleton planned carefully, kept his men informed, and listened to their ideas. He was flexible and ready to change plans if needed. Shackleton believed that an explorer needs to be optimistic, strong, and patient. 
MacGregor explains that in difficult times, it is hard to wait for things to get better, especially in America. If you make a bad investment, it is better to wait than to sell and lose money. Shackleton led by example. On the way back from the Endurance, he saw Hurley, the photographer, without gloves. He gave Hurley his gloves and said he would throw them overboard if Hurley did not wear them. 
As Caroline Alexander, who wrote about Shackleton's expedition, says: ""People want to hear stories of heroism. Shackleton shows that true heroism is rare today."""
CAE_15,C1,"'Finding Food in Madagascar'**
In the forests of Madagascar, there is a special animal called the aye-aye. The aye-aye is a type of primate, and it has a way of finding food that is similar to a woodpecker. Both the aye-aye and the woodpecker look for insects in wood. The woodpecker uses its beak to make holes in the wood and its long tongue to get the insects. The aye-aye uses its sharp teeth to make holes and its long finger to reach inside and get the insects.
Scientists have studied how aye-ayes find insects. Dr. Carl Erickson from Duke University studied two male aye-ayes named Nosferatu and Poe, and a female named Samantha with her baby, Annabelle. He wanted to see if they could find insects by looking for signs, like holes in the wood where insects might be.
Dr. Erickson gave the aye-ayes logs with holes. Some holes had food inside, and some were empty. The aye-ayes went straight to the holes with food. They did not need to see the holes to find the mealworms. They might have found the food by smell or sound, but tests showed they did not use these senses either. They could find food even when the smell was blocked or when the mealworms were quiet.
So, how did the aye-ayes find the food? Dr. Erickson found that they could feel the empty spaces in the wood. When looking for food, an aye-aye taps the wood with its long finger and listens carefully. It seems to be using a method called echo-location, which means it listens for sounds that bounce back to it. This helps the aye-aye know where the hollow spaces are.
Some people think that the aye-aye acts like a woodpecker in Madagascar, but there are also birds that look for insects in wood. The aye-aye is not just like a woodpecker; it also has some behaviors like a squirrel. Its teeth keep growing, just like a squirrel's, and it has been seen in the wild opening nuts and eating the inside with its long finger."
CAE_19,C1,"Ordinary People, Ordinary Lives**
Many of us have pictures of our grandparents, but how many of us know what their lives were like? We often have only small pieces of information from old diaries or family stories. And what will our grandchildren know about us? We want to write things down, but we often forget. We might leave videos instead of photos, but videos are not the same as real life.
Hannah Renier has a solution. She writes life stories for other people. She makes a book with at least 20,000 words and pictures if needed. She focuses on ordinary people, not famous ones. Hannah got this idea when she talked to her family and saw how much of the past was being lost.
""When I started, I didn’t take it very seriously,"" she says. ""But then I met people who have interesting stories. They want to share their stories for their children or for the future, but they also enjoy it.""
People feel safe to share their stories with Hannah. A 62-year-old man said, ""I was honest. I talked about my divorce and the pain I felt."" He wrote his story for his family but hasn’t let his children read it yet. He thinks some details might hurt them.
Hannah has noticed that many people repeat the same mistakes in their lives. ""Many people are affected by their parents,"" she says. ""What parents say to their children can stay with them for a long time. Some people marry people their parents like, while others choose the opposite to rebel.""
Many people still feel sad about things that happened when they were young. They try to impress parents who are hard to please. Sometimes, they want to say, ""I can’t stand my mother.""
Hannah listens to people without judging them. ""I’m not here to be nosy,"" she says. People sometimes share things and then worry if they should have said them. Hannah tells them they can change things later if they want.
Hannah’s books are not for everyone to read. They are personal stories. She believes we are losing touch with our past. Writing these stories helps people connect with their family history. 
Each book takes about 30 hours of interviews. Hannah uses these talks to write the life story, organizing it in a clear way. The final book looks nice and costs about £3,000, with extra copies costing £25 each. She gets about 10 requests each week, but the price stops many people from buying.
""I thought more people would want this,"" she says. ""But the people I work with are often wealthy and like to read certain magazines."""

**A. The University Museum of Classical Archaeology**  
The Museum of Classical Archaeology has many copies of Greek and Roman sculptures. There are over six hundred pieces. Remember, none of these sculptures are real. They are all copies made from the originals, mostly made in the late 1800s and early 1900s. The Museum has a special gallery with good natural light. The plaster copies are useful because you can see many sculptures that were once together but are now in different museums. You can see many famous Greek and Roman sculptures in one afternoon.
**B. Cambridge Darkroom**  
Cambridge Darkroom is a place for photography. It has community darkrooms and a gallery with different photography exhibitions. We offer courses and workshops for people of all ages and skills. Our popular courses include a Beginner's Course, a shorter Induction Course, and Master Classes with special photographers. Members can use our darkrooms. We also help young photographers (ages 12 to 16) improve their skills with our Young Members scheme, led by our photographer. We sell photography books and magazines and have many photography materials.
**C. Sedgwick Museum of Geology**  
The Sedgwick Museum has a great collection of fossil animals and plants, rocks, and minerals from all over the world. It also has Britain's oldest geological collection from Dr. John Woodward (1665-1728). There are nearly 10,000 rare specimens in their original cabinets from the early 1700s. Adam Sedgwick was a Professor of Geology and helped to grow the collection. The collection is organized by geological age, showing how life on Earth has changed over time. The new Whewell Gallery has beautiful minerals and gems. There are labels to explain what they are and how they are used today.
**D. The Cambridge University Collection of Air Photographs**  
There are over 400,000 air photographs in the collection. These were taken by university staff over the last 45 years. The university has its own aircraft at Cambridge Airport and takes photographs all over Great Britain. The photographs show the landscape and how it has changed from prehistoric times to now. There is a small display in the entrance hall, and the library staff can help with questions. You cannot borrow the photographs, but you can buy copies. These are made to order and usually take about a month.
**E. Cambridge Medieval Brass Rubbing Centre**  
The Cambridge Brass Rubbing Centre is one of the oldest and most interesting tourist attractions in the area. You can have fun making wall hangings by rubbing over one of more than a hundred different brass plates from the tombs of medieval knights and ladies. The centre makes resin copies to protect the originals and make brass rubbing easy for everyone. The brass plates were used as memorials and came from Germany to medieval Europe and Scandinavia. Many beautiful brasses were destroyed in revolutions, but most of the remaining ones are in Britain. You can see the largest variety at the Cambridge Centre."
CAE_13,C1,"From Here to Being a Parent**
**A. The Theatre Director**  
I have had a strange personal life, but I have enjoyed 35 years with small children. I loved feeding my baby this morning. For me, being a father is about love. I am very lucky with my children. We all enjoy the same things: opera, theatre, books, and music. This brings us close, especially now that they are older and I feel more like a friend than a father. I do not believe in hitting children. I have done it when I was angry, but I do not think it is right. I may not have been the best father, but I always tried to be there for them. I wait for them to call me. If I chase them to ask why they have not called, it makes them feel guilty. My parents did that to me, and I will not do it to my children.
**B. The Advertising Executive**  
I was young when my children were born, about 25 years old. I found the responsibilities hard at first, but they also kept me young. As they became teenagers, they showed me new things like music and fashion. This helped me in my job. I missed some important events when they were young, like their first concerts and sports days, and I feel sad about that. But now, I can take them on holidays to nice places, and they enjoy being with my friends at parties and events.
**C. The Politician**  
My first child was born just before I started my job in politics. I promised my wife that we would spend time with our children, but my job takes a lot of time. I only go to meetings on weekends if my kids can come with me. This way, they can see what I do when I am not with them, and they do not feel like I am always away. I have noticed that more politicians are bringing their kids to work. Maybe we all want to include our children in our lives more.
**D. The Writer**  
My first marriage ended when my daughters, Kate and Bonnie, were young. I had to think a lot about being a father. I tried hard to stay close to my children. My ex-wife and I even lived next to each other for a while so they could visit easily, but I think it confused them. Kate has said I was always there for her, but I am not sure I was a good father. I was around a lot, but I treated my kids like adults too soon. Kate said we were too relaxed as parents. I wish I had set more rules. I still worry about my older daughters just like I do about my youngest. In that way, you never stop being a parent.
**E. The TV Presenter**  
I was ready for kids when I turned 30. I met my wife, and we had a nice home, so we thought, ""Why not have a child instead of just buying new things?"" Having my daughter, Betty, made me think about who I am. It feels special to have a child, but it also makes you just one of many parents. Sometimes I feel frustrated, but when I see her smile, all my irritation goes away. A baby's smile is very powerful."

**Flying Without Gravity**
Journalist Tom Mumford joins students who are testing their ideas in weightlessness. The plane looked normal from the outside. The pilot told the students that it was built in 1964 and was a Boeing KC-135, which is based on the Boeing 707. But inside, it was very different. The inside was a long white tunnel with few windows and bright lights on the walls. Most of the seats were taken out, except for a few at the back where the 13 students from Europe and America sat. They were excited but also nervous.
For 12 months, these students had worked hard to be part of this flight. The European Space Agency gave them a challenge to create interesting experiments to do in weightlessness. The students with the best ideas got to go on this special flight, which felt like a big roller-coaster ride. 
For the next two hours, the plane would go up and down like a bird. The pilot would turn off the engines at 3,000 meters, and the plane would go higher for a moment before falling back down. During this time, everything inside the plane would be weightless. The students would feel like they were closer to the moon than to the Earth.
The plane took off smoothly, but soon the pilot made the plane climb steeply. The engines roared, and the students felt heavy. Then, the engines stopped, and they felt weightless. For 20 seconds, they floated in the air. It was like jumping on a trampoline. They could not tell which way was up or down. 
After 10 seconds of falling, the pilot pulled the plane up again. Gravity came back, and some students landed hard. They had 30 curves to go through, which gave them 10 minutes of weightlessness for their experiments. The Dutch students studied their robotic cat, Leonardo, to see how cats land on their feet. They released a device to help with this, but another student accidentally landed on it during a curve.
A German team studied how metal joins are affected by weightlessness, which could help build future space stations. Another group from Utah State University worked on making solar sails from thin films. They hoped to use these sails in satellites to catch sunlight like a boat catches wind.
After two hours of flying, the students felt excited, not sick. One student said, ""It was an unforgettable experience. I wanted to be an astronaut before, but now I want it even more."""

**With the Trees, I Planted My Stake in New Zealand**
Jonathon Porritt is the author of *Seeing Green - The Politics of Ecology*.
I had a strange time in my life when I didn’t have any summers. I went to New Zealand every summer, which is winter in New Zealand. So, I had nine winters in a row, which was great because I like winter. My parents had an idea to buy a small piece of land for my brother, sister, and me to take care of. My mother said, “If you plant trees on it, you can have it.” The idea was that we would always have a connection to New Zealand, which is nice because my father grew up there. They found a piece of land about 20 miles north of Auckland in a place called Rangitoupuni. The land is not very good, but it is good for planting trees.
I have always liked land. I spent a year in Australia working on farms, so the idea of planting trees sounded nice, and I was excited. My family also became excited as we went along. I started planting in 1968, and by the end of 1972, we had planted the whole 70 acres together.
In New Zealand in 1968, it rained a lot. It was strange to think of that time as happy because it rained almost every day we were planting. I don’t think I have ever been so wet or cold for so long. Every morning was a challenge: getting ready to plant again. I would come out of the Land Rover warm and dry, but the rain was falling, and my clothes were still wet from the day before. My hands were slippery with the laces of my boots.
In that first year, I had a helper who was good at planting trees, which was helpful because I had never planted trees seriously before. You wear a planting bag around your neck and fill it with trees. When the bag is full, it is heavy, but when it gets lighter, it is easier to work. The hardest part was getting the lines straight. You decide how far apart to plant the trees, then you line up three poles to help you. Once you are in line, you plant all the way down the line, then turn around and come back.
I enjoy hard work, and it made me fit. After a while, you can plant trees almost automatically. You get used to a rhythm and use the least number of movements to dig a hole. This rhythm is important in many farming jobs. You learn to take the tree out of the bag, dig a hole, put it in the ground, stamp it down, and move on. 
It is also interesting for the mind. I started to think about many things, like nature and our place in it. These thoughts became important in my life. I have been back to New Zealand four times since then and watched the trees grow. It feels good to see the trees I planted. I worry when I read news about strong winds or droughts in New Zealand. But everything worked out well, and the trees are now 20 years old and healthy.
I should add that I took a break from teaching and went back in 1984 for three months. I was alone and wrote my first book, *Seeing Green*. There is a small cabin on the tree farm with just a bed, a table, and a chair. In the mornings, I wrote; in the afternoons, I pruned the trees; and in the evenings, I did research. I still feel a strong connection to that place. It is where I feel closest to the bond between people and the earth."
CAE_10,C1,"'CARING FOR BADGER CUBS'**
""What now?"" I thought, as one of my helpers brought a cardboard box to me. My husband Derek and I have an open farm in Somerset. We take care of orphaned animals. But the noise from the box was strange, so I looked inside. I saw three small grey badger cubs, each about eight inches long. They had soft coats and milky eyes looking up at me from their black-and-white striped heads. I had never seen badger cubs before. Most badger cubs are born between January and March and stay underground. If they lose their mother, they often die from hunger. 
These three cubs were found by builders. While they were working, they accidentally dug into the badger's home. The mother was found dead, and her babies were still trying to drink from her. I could see the cubs were healthy but cold and crying. After cleaning them, I took them to the kitchen to keep them warm. There were two girls, Primrose and Bluebell, and one boy, Willow. At first, I used a syringe to feed them. I had to wipe them with a warm cloth to make them feel like their mother was licking them. This helped them go to the bathroom. For the first few days, I fed them every four hours. After a week, they learned to drink from a bottle and started to move around.
Three weeks later, I noticed Willow was not as active, but he was still eating. This was a warning sign. I should have acted quickly, but I didn’t. The next morning, I found him dead. The vet said he died from a lung infection. When feeding animals with a bottle, it is important not to let them drink too fast. In Willow's case, this caused an infection that was hard to treat.
I was sad about Willow, but I continued to care for the other cubs. Six days later, a local farmer came to see me. He found another male cub, alone and cold. He knew the mother would not come back. This new cub, Willow II, joined us. He was younger than the girls. I had a hard time feeding him. I had to move the bottle around and squeeze it to get him to drink. After ten minutes, he would finally drink.
By the end of April, the girls were eating rice and other food. Willow II was happy to stop using the bottle, but he made a mess when eating. I gave him a sausage, and he slowly learned to eat it. After a week, he was ready for more food. At five months old, they were all eating cereals for breakfast, meat and vegetables for lunch, and fruit, nuts, cheese, and eggs for dinner. Badgers usually eat a lot of earthworms, bugs, and small animals. My badgers were doing well, especially since it was a hot summer and finding food was hard.
By August, the badgers started to be active at night. We took walks in the orchard, and they would chase each other and play. I learned to avoid their playful bites, but Derek sometimes got caught and had funny reactions. During these walks, I saw other badgers in our field. They were looking for food because their homes were disturbed. We were warned that they might come into our badger pen and hurt the cubs, so we made the gate hard to open.
The local newspaper took pictures of me walking the badgers. Many people wanted to help build a home for the badgers on our farm. With help, we designed a new home for them. Our son Daniel made the plans, and we built a sett with tunnels and a special gate. It had three rooms, one bigger than the others, with a glass side so people could see inside. As we built it, the badgers explored the new home. They became excited and forgot about their walks.
The building cost more than we thought, but a local bus company helped pay for it, and other businesses gave materials. Everyone wanted the badgers to have a home. One evening, they finally moved in. After watching them for a while, we left them alone. Half an hour later, I checked on them and saw three badgers sleeping in their rooms.
Now, I don’t walk with them as often because they wake up late. We see Primrose sometimes because she has joined another sett, but Bluebell and Willow II still come to say hello before running off into the night. This is their home now, and they are happy here."
CAE_67,C1,"In Search of True North - The Man Behind Halley's Comet**
Dr. Toby Clark is a researcher at the British Geological Survey. He wants to follow the journey of Sir Edmund Halley, who studied compass variations. Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is famous for the comet named after him. However, he also did important work to understand how compasses work. He used his sea trips on a warship called Paramore to study the 'variations of the compass'. These variations are now called 'declination', which is the angle between magnetic north and true north. Sailors needed this information to correct their compasses and navigate the oceans.
Halley planned to travel to the Cape Verde Islands to study declination in the North and South Atlantic. His first trip ended early because of problems with the crew, but he tried again. This time, he traveled to Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, Newfoundland, and back to England. In 1701, he published a chart showing the compass variations in the Western and Southern Oceans. His work helped sailors for many years until changes in the Earth's magnetic field made the charts less accurate.
Dr. Clark wants to celebrate the 300th anniversary of Halley's trip by retracing the route of the Paramore. He needs to raise £70,000 before he can start. Sir Vivian Fuchs, who led the first expedition across Antarctica, is helping him. Dr. Clark became interested in Halley while he was at Halley Station in Antarctica, where he read about Halley's life. He says, ""Halley led a remarkable life. He was a respected scientist and led many expeditions. He was not just an astronomer; he also studied geophysics.""
Halley created a diving bell and helped Sir Isaac Newton with his famous book, Principia Mathematica. Dr. Clark believes that retracing Halley's journey will give him the recognition he deserves. His expedition, called 'In the Wake of the Paramore', will also have scientific value. Dr. Clark will take measurements like Halley did, but with better tools. These measurements are important because the Earth's magnetic field is always changing.
Dr. Clark explains, ""It is common to measure the size of the magnetic field, but not the direction. You need to know true north to measure the direction."" On this trip, they will use satellites to find true north. The British Geological Survey and the United States Navy will provide instruments for the measurements. A Danish satellite will also be taking similar measurements, and Dr. Clark hopes his work will help fill in any gaps in the data.
Halley's journey was very important. It was the first scientific expedition at sea, and Halley was the first civilian to be a naval captain for this kind of work. Dr. Clark has experience for this journey. He spent two years in Antarctica and has sailed from Rio de Janeiro to England. He plans to complete the expedition in four stages with different crews. 
When asked if he is obsessed like Halley, Dr. Clark said, ""I am ready to give up my life for eight months to do this. Some people might think I'm obsessed, but I want to have a good reason to sail across the Atlantic again. Halley and his life have given me a real sense of purpose."""

**PEACOCKS IN WHIPSNADE PARK**
Every summer, peacocks walk freely in Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire. They show their beautiful tail feathers to the hens. This behavior makes people wonder why peacocks have such big and colorful tails. Charles Darwin, a famous scientist, thought about this question for a long time. He believed that animals change over time through a process called evolution. In nature, the strongest and best animals usually survive and have babies. 
However, Darwin thought that peacocks' tails were not useful for survival. He suggested another idea called ""sexual selection."" This means that female peacocks (called peahens) choose males based on their beauty. Darwin's friend, Alfred Russel Wallace, had a different idea. He thought that if peahens liked the most beautiful peacocks, it was because those peacocks had some special quality that helped them survive.
Now, 100 years later, scientists are still studying this question. At Whipsnade, there are 200 peacocks that live like wild birds but are used to people. Marion Petrie and her team want to find out two things: Do peahens really choose the peacocks with the most beautiful tails? And do these peacocks have other good qualities, or is it just about looks?
The scientists watch the peacocks and take pictures. They see that peahens do prefer the peacocks with the most eye spots on their tails. The peacocks with the most eye spots attract more mates. But the scientists still need to find out if these peacocks are better in other ways.
William Hamilton, another scientist, thinks that beautiful male birds are often healthier and have fewer parasites. This means their beautiful feathers show that they are healthy. However, the team has not yet been able to check the health of the peacocks at Whipsnade.
This year, Dr. Petrie is studying the babies of attractive peacocks and those of less attractive ones. She wants to see if the babies of the attractive peacocks grow faster and are healthier. If they are, it would mean that the peahens' choice is smart, just like Wallace said.
There is also an interesting idea from a scientist named R A Fisher. He suggested that if a female peahen chooses a male with a slightly better tail, their babies will have long tails too. Over time, this could lead to peacocks having very long tails. This idea also supports Darwin's thought that females might choose beauty for its own sake.
**Questions:**
1. Where do the peacocks live?
2. What do peacocks show to attract peahens?
3. What is the name of the scientist who thought about evolution?
4. What do scientists want to find out about peahens' choices?
5. What do the scientists think about the health of beautiful male birds?"
CAE_66,C1,"**THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS**
Tom Cunliffe believes that the best boat design should mix old and new ideas. He made this idea real with his own boat, called 'The Westerman'. This week, the Summer Boat Show in London is full of beautiful yachts with new technology. Most of these boats come from a big change in boat design that happened 25 years ago. 
In contrast, my boat is quiet and sits in a tidal creek on the south coast. It was designed last year, but it looks like it is 100 years old. Some people might think I am a romantic for owning it. Maybe I am, but I don’t think so. My boat uses the best parts of old boat design, but modern technology has helped a lot. 
However, new technology can sometimes keep sailors away from the real life at sea. Many sailors want to feel the sea and the wind, not just use machines. I don’t think sailors should go back to having a hard life, but I like my boats to have a coal stove for warmth and comfortable places to sleep. But why go sailing if everything is done by machines? Sometimes, dealing with sails that flap in the wind is part of being a sailor. 
A boat should feel like a boat, not a big house on the water. When I bought my first boat, Hirta, to sail around Britain for a TV show, the last owner said it had comfort but no luxury. He was right. Hirta had heavy sails and no running water, no electricity, no fridge, no central heating, and no electronics, but she was the easiest boat I ever sailed. 
On land, classic boats need a lot of care. When I hurt my back, I knew I had to stop sailing Hirta. I looked for a younger boat but found nothing good, so I decided to build a new boat from scratch. 'The Westerman' has never let me down. 
The designer, Nigel Irens, and his assistant, Ed Burnett, are good with computer design, but Irens first drew this boat on a paper napkin. Later, he used a computer to make the design better. We worked together to improve the boat. The final design was perfect. 
Now, 'The Westerman' has crossed the North Atlantic and won four out of her first six races. She looks timeless, moves beautifully in the sea, and feels peaceful inside. This is because she was designed only as a sailing boat, not as a house. 
Made from special wood, she does not take in water. So, she has the good points of a fiberglass boat but looks, feels, and sails like a real boat."
CAE_44,C1,"'RETREAT, RELAX, RECHARGE'**
Health farms and country hotels with spa services are very popular now. Five journalists visited some of these places.
**A. HENLOW GRANGE**  
I was happy to go to Henlow Grange for six days because I was tired and needed to relax. My room in the big 18th-century house was very comfortable. On the first day, I did nothing and slept a lot. From the second day, I started to join classes like yoga and body conditioning. The teachers were very good. I felt more flexible as the week went on. They have many treatments, like aromatherapy, seaweed baths, manicures, and pedicures. The facial treatment lasts an hour and makes you feel great. The staff were very friendly and professional. Henlow is planning to make some changes this year, including a swimming pool. You can also ride bicycles around the grounds. If you want to relax, you can read a magazine or take a walk in the garden. I felt happy and full of energy when I left. I want to visit again. This is a great place for busy women. 
**B. SHRUBLAND HALL**  
Shrubland Hall is a calm and relaxing place. When I arrived, I saw a big staircase and a nice library. Everyone gets a health check when they arrive. They check your weight and blood pressure. I felt a bit strange being called a patient because I am healthy. They found a shoulder problem, and I worked on it in group classes and private sessions. Each person gets a special diet. I lost weight but felt hungry on the second day. My meals included grapefruit, salads, and fruit. If you are not on a diet, you can eat tasty food in the dining hall. You can also have massages or water therapy every other day. 
**C. CAREYS MANOR**  
Careys Manor is not a health farm, but it is a nice old manor with a cozy lounge. If you want to lose weight, you might not enjoy the rich food. The chef makes delicious meals. The hotel has a gym and a pool to help you stay fit. There is also a spa, sauna, and treatment rooms. I got help for an old shoulder injury from a physiotherapist. Careys is comfortable and relaxing, and there is beautiful countryside to explore.
**D. CLIVEDEN**  
Cliveden is a beautiful country home and a five-star hotel. It offers health and beauty treatments, a gym, saunas, a swimming pool, and horse riding. There are lovely walks and gardens around the estate. The restaurant, Waldo's, has amazing food. I enjoyed my meal, especially the sticky-toffee pudding. The next morning, I spent time in the gym before my next meal. I had a facial and an aromatherapy massage. Cliveden has many fitness and beauty options if you want to use them.
**E. SPRINGS HYDRO**  
The best and worst thing about Springs Hydro is the carrot cake. It is very delicious but has a lot of calories. The second best thing is the aromatherapy massage. I felt so relaxed during the massage that I fell asleep. The place is modern and well-organized, with many therapists and beauty rooms. There are many treatments available, like manicures and facials. The guests are a mix of people, including families and friends. I would love to visit Springs Hydro every month.

CAE_22,C1,"**NATURAL TALENTS**
In the last seven million years, humans and chimpanzees have changed very little. We are still more than 98% similar to chimps. This means that the differences between humans and animals are very new. Our ability to make art and do other things that are special to humans comes from just a small part of our genes. 
Studies of animal behavior show that many things we thought were only human are also found in animals. For example, chimpanzees use sticks to eat and as tools, and sea otters use rocks to open clams. Monkeys also have a simple form of language with different sounds for 'leopard', 'eagle', and 'snake'. This means that there are not many clear differences between humans and animals, except for art.
If human art comes from special genes, it is strange that our ancestors did not make art for almost seven million years. The first art might have been wood carvings or body painting, but we do not have proof of this because these materials do not last. The first clear evidence of human art is from the Cro-Magnons, about 35,000 years ago. They made cave paintings, statues, necklaces, and musical instruments.
Some people say that human art is different from animal art in three ways: human art is not useful, it is made for beauty, and it is learned, not instinctive. 
First, Oscar Wilde said, ""All art is quite useless."" This means that human art does not help us survive or pass on our genes, unlike many animal behaviors. Some human art does communicate ideas, but this is not the same as passing on genes. For example, birds sing to defend their territory or attract a mate, which helps them pass on their genes. 
Second, human art is thought to be made for beauty. We cannot ask birds if they enjoy their songs, but they mostly sing during the breeding season, so they may not sing just for beauty. 
Third, human art is learned. Different human groups have their own art styles. For example, songs in Tokyo are different from songs in Paris. People can learn each other's songs. In contrast, some birds are born knowing how to sing their species' song, even if they have never heard it before.
Human art changes quickly. For example, people can tell when a painting was made just by looking at it. In 1957, two chimpanzees named Congo and Betsy had an art show in London. Congo made many paintings and seemed to enjoy it. Their paintings were sold, which is something many human artists cannot do.
These chimpanzee paintings show that the line between human art and animal behavior is not so clear. Like human art, the chimpanzee paintings were not made for a specific purpose; they were made for the enjoyment of the painter. Some might say that human art is different because it is meant to communicate, while the chimpanzees did not care about sharing their art. However, some famous human art was also made just for the artist's own pleasure."
CAE_39,C1,"A Big Adventure**
The Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last unknown places on Earth. It is also very dangerous. Charles Blackmore crossed it and lived to tell his story. There are not many big adventures left and not many heroes. Children's stories used to have brave explorers with sunburnt skin and eyes looking far away on their journeys. Today, we do not see such people in stories or in real life. But then I met Charles Blackmore.
Blackmore's big adventure was leading a group across the Taklamakan Desert. Its name means ""once entered, you never come out,"" but local people call it the Desert of Death. He remembered the dangers and excitement of that amazing trip while at home with his family. The team he led had four British people (one was a doctor), an American photographer, four Chinese experts, 30 camels, and six camel handlers. Later, they found out that the camel handlers had never worked with camels before; they were truck drivers. This mistake could have been very dangerous for everyone.
This group set out to cross 1,200 kilometers of the desert. Charles Blackmore wrote a fascinating story about their journey. At that time, he was leaving the Army after 14 happy years. He started the trip for fun and to find out more about himself. ""I thought I would spend my whole life in the Army. I was offered a promotion, but I wanted to see who I really was outside of that. It was a big risk. My wife, Tina, was very worried that I would not come back because nobody had ever done that route before; we went into it without knowing what would happen. In the end, it took 59 days to cross from west to east, and the desert was very good to us.""
Anyone reading his amazing story will wonder why he said the desert was ""good."" The team faced many problems: sickness, extreme heat and cold, thirst, and losing some of their water. ""But,"" Blackmore said, ""when we were very tired and the camels had not had water for seven days, we found some. We did not have the famous sandstorms of the Taklamakan. And we did not feel the freezing cold that could have stopped us. But we were always fighting against problems. The fine sand got into everything, especially our blisters and wounds. The high sand dunes were hard to climb for us and for the heavy camels, which sometimes fell over.""
""What pushed me on was the need to survive. We had no backup plan. Our budget and time did not allow for one. No planes flew over us. Once we got into the sandhills, we were completely alone. I knew I could handle the trip mentally, but I was scared about my physical strength. I remember the first day -- we sat at the edge of the desert, and it was so hot that it was hard to breathe. I thought, 'We have to do it now!' At that moment, I was very scared.""
If it was hard at the beginning, how did they feel at the end? ""After walking for 1,000 kilometers, you are not going to give up. You have gone through so much; you have come so far. We were very thin but strong despite being tired. My body was fit, and my legs were strong. I could walk over anything.""
In the middle of the book, Blackmore described lying in the desert, looking at the full moon, and thinking of his family. How did he feel about what they went through? ""Inside me, I am trying to find peace. When I have doubts about myself now, I think back to the desert and remember that we did it together. I feel prouder of that trip than anything else I have done. But when I think of my life, I think of my family and the happiness we share. Compared to that, the desert does not measure up.""
Has Charles Blackmore found peace? ""I long for the challenge and the open spaces. We felt good because we had a purpose. Now, it is hard for me to be part of the same routine of modern life."""

Charles Hurst is a cabinet-maker who makes beautiful furniture. Joanna Watt meets him. When I arrive at his workshop in East London, he shakes my hand quickly and says, ""Well, fire away then!"" He seems busy, and his workshop is full of furniture pieces and wood in many colors. Hurst has been a cabinet-maker for ten years and has a good reputation. He always has many orders, even though he does not advertise himself. People say that if you want a good cupboard, table, or bookcase, you should go to Hurst.
It is not hard to find a furniture-maker, but it is harder to find one who makes high-quality furniture. Hurst says, ""There are few real cabinet-makers now. Many people call themselves furniture-makers."" He is often disappointed by the quality of some modern furniture. He does not like cheap, mass-produced furniture and wants to make perfect pieces. This desire for perfection helps him succeed.
Hurst is confident in his skills. He says, ""I have a huge natural ability. I have always been good at making things."" He learned by asking questions and practicing. Most of his work comes from private clients. Some clients come back to him many times. He enjoys doing work for them, but he finds it frustrating when clients do not know what they want.
Hurst is also kind and praises others when they deserve it. He says, ""There are people far better than me."" He does not like craftsmen who take a long time to make one piece of furniture or students who try to make their work look fashionable. He believes furniture should be useful, not just a statement.
Hurst is confident but not pretentious. As I leave, he says, ""After all, I am only making furniture."""
CAE_49,C1,"Three Theories About Sleep**
People spend about one-third of their lives sleeping. Sleep is very important, but scientists do not fully agree on why we need it. There are three main ideas about sleep.
The first idea says that sleep is good for our bodies. When we sleep, our bodies work to fix any damage from the day and help us feel better.
The second idea is about learning. This idea says that sleep helps us understand and remember things we learned during the day. Without sleep, it is hard to learn new things.
The third idea is about energy. This idea says we need sleep to recharge our energy. When we sleep, we get ready for the next day.
These three ideas help us understand why sleep is important."
CAE_31,C1,"**ECCENTRICS**
An eccentric is someone who acts differently from most people. They do not follow the usual rules of society. This makes us think, ""What is normal?"" Many of us have our own strange habits. For example, someone might love entering contests in newspapers, collect beer mats, or write letters to the newspaper about many topics. Being eccentric shows our individuality.
Inside us, there is often a struggle between wanting to be ourselves and wanting to fit in. It is like having two trains on the same track, pushing against each other. One train is called individualism (being yourself) and the other is conformity (fitting in). Most of the time, we want to fit in more than we want to stand out. We want to be accepted and liked by others.
People with unusual hobbies or strong opinions often find each other. They create clubs and hold meetings to talk about their interests. They want to share what others might think is strange. Being in a group, even a small one, can make us feel better.
We all feel this push and pull between being ourselves and fitting in. Even when we follow the crowd, we might not like it if someone points it out. For example, a man at a bar might say, ""I say what I think,"" to show he is different. 
Anyone can choose to be more individual. Many people succeed in their jobs by being themselves. Bob Dylan, a famous American singer, said, ""When you feel what you are doing and go for it, you will surprise many people."" But being different does not always mean being eccentric. 
For example, if a pop singer wears strange clothes just to get attention, that is not eccentricity. But if they keep doing it until it feels normal for them, then they might be eccentric. The key to eccentricity is that it is natural. Eccentrics do not try to be odd; they just are.
True eccentrics do not care much about what others think. They act based on who they are. This makes them different from people who want to impress others or escape from society. Eccentrics live their lives happily, without worrying about what others think."

It was easy for me to choose the author. I am an environmental journalist, and I have met many important people in this field. One of the most important is Barbara Ward. She is a small, frail woman, but she has done a lot for environmental issues in Europe after the war. She combined her experiences into her own ideas about the environment. When I was a young journalist, she helped me understand everything better. Choosing the book was harder. It could have been ""Only One Earth"" or ""Progress for a Small Planet."" But I think Barbara's most important book is ""The Home of Man."" It talks about the fast growth of cities and important themes she cared about. It is a strong call for what we now call ""sustainable human development."" I have read many books since, but none are as good as this one.
**B. Linda Bennett**  
When I read ""Signals for Survival"" by Niko Tinbergen, I can hear the calls of herring gulls and remember the smell of the guano in the sun. This book explains the amazing world of animal communication with words and pictures. If you read ""Signals for Survival"" and then watch a gull colony, you will see how their chaos turns into a smart social structure. You can see which birds are partners and where their boundaries are. Niko Tinbergen was a great behaviorist who wanted to explain his work to everyone. He worked with talented wildlife artist Eric Ennion to create this book. Ennion's paintings show how one gull is aggressive and how another is calm. This is the art of a true naturalist.
**C. Lee Durrell**  
The book that has influenced me the most is ""My Family and Other Animals"" by Gerald Durrell. This book helped me find a wonderful husband and a great career in conservation. It also made me love the natural world. I was doing research on animal sounds in Madagascar when I first read this book. I had been there for two years and was feeling sad because of many problems. But when I opened ""My Family and Other Animals,"" I felt happy again. The book shows animals and people together, creating a beautiful world worth saving. Some people say humans are bad because of what we have done to nature. But I remember Gerald as a boy in the book, seeing all living things as a family. This is an idea we all need to understand.
**D. Bruce Pearson**  
I found ""The Shell Bird Book"" by James Fisher in my school library after it was published in 1966. I loved it right away, especially the 48 colorful bird pictures by Eric Ennion. These pictures caught my attention. I already had other bird books and spent holidays learning to identify birds. They inspired me to start sketching what I saw. But ""The Shell Bird Book"" had even more. It had beautiful paintings, chapters about bird migration, the history of birds in Britain, and a chapter about birds in music, literature, and art. This book helped me appreciate birds and nature more. It showed me that my feelings and creativity about nature are just as important as scientific facts. Since art was my stronger subject, I began to see new opportunities for myself."
CAE_37,C1,"DO REVIEWS SELL BOOKS?**
We asked five British publishers if book reviews help sell books. Here is what they said.
**Publisher A**  
Reviews are very important for publishers. They look at reviews first in the newspaper. A study showed that many people buy a book because of reviews, more than because of ads or word of mouth. Authors feel differently about reviews. Both authors and publishers feel bad when there are no reviews. But publishers think that even bad reviews can help sell books because people want to read the book themselves. Publishers like reviews that match their own thoughts about a book.
**Publisher B**  
Publishers and newspapers both want good book reviews, but they want different things. Newspapers want to entertain their readers, while publishers want their books to be reviewed well. Book reviews today are better than 40 years ago, but many paperback books still do not get enough attention. Publishers need reviews to help readers find out about books. A good review from a trusted person can help sell more books.
**Publisher C**  
Reviews are very important for publishing. Many of the books we publish are not by famous authors, so we need reviews to help sell them. Good reviews are better than ads because they show that the review is honest. Publishers say they want big reviews, but the real effect of reviews on sales is hard to understand. Good reviews can help a book and an author become popular, but they need help from other things like recommendations and good marketing.
**Publisher D**  
I am not sure about the relationship between publishing and reviewing in Britain. In the United States, a review in the New York Times can make or break a book. In Britain, bookshops do not always pay attention to reviews. Sometimes it takes many years for people to notice a good writer. Some books that get bad reviews can still sell very well. It is hard to predict what will happen. Non-fiction books allow reviewers to talk more about the subject than the book itself.
**Publisher E**  
All publishers and writers want great reviews. But do they help sell books? I published a biography that got great reviews, but it did not sell well. People thought they could just read the reviews instead of buying the book. Does the name of the reviewer matter? Thirty years ago, if certain reviewers liked a book, people listened to them. Now, sometimes an unexpected reviewer or a clever review can make people want to buy the book."
CAE_2,C1,"WEATHERVANE MAKER**
Making weathervanes is an old skill that started in ancient Egypt. Today, Graham Smith continues this craft in his workshop. He is one of the few people in the country who makes weathervanes by hand. Graham creates unique designs for his customers. He says, ""This way, I can make a special item just for them."" Many of his customers are women who want to buy gifts for their husbands. They look for something special that shows the man's job or hobbies.
Graham's first weathervane was not a cockerel, which is a common design. Instead, it was a witch on a broomstick. His friends liked it and asked him to make weathervanes for them. He realized he could make many different designs. Graham decided to start a weathervane business. Before this, he worked as a precision engineer for 15 years. Then, he and his wife, Liz, changed their roles. Liz went to work, and Graham stayed home to take care of their children and grow the business. This was five years ago, and he is happy with his choice. He says, ""My old job was not creative, but this work is exciting and artistic. I love designing.""
Graham has made over 100 original designs. He pays attention to detail and always asks the customer to approve the design before he starts cutting it by hand. He also keeps many traditional designs because people like them. Graham says, ""People enjoy handmade items. They want something different.""
Graham does not want to grow his business too much because he wants to keep it a local craft. He feels he has found his place in the market. People appreciate the unique designs, and he enjoys seeing a simple shape become something beautiful. For many years, weathervanes have helped people understand the weather by showing changes in the wind. Now, more people are moving to the countryside and want to add special touches to their homes. This has helped crafts like his.
Graham is now very busy, sending weathervanes to customers all over the world. He has many buyers from America and Denmark. He explains that the price depends on how detailed the design is. His latest request was for a weathervane shaped like a curly-coated dog. No matter the occasion, Graham can create a special gift."
CAE_68,C1,"'The Horse Whisperer'**
Before it was published, *The Horse Whisperer* was a very popular book. It is the first novel by British writer Nicholas Evans, and it made him a lot of money. He talks about his inspiration and success.
At the start of the year, Nicholas Evans was not doing well. A film he was working on, called *Life and Limb*, did not happen. He was worried because he had not earned money for two years, and he needed to pay his bank. A smart person would have found a job, but instead, Evans made a surprising choice. He bought a ticket to America to research his first novel for three months.
He had an idea for the story from a farrier he met in Dartmoor. The farrier told him about a calm horse that suddenly became very wild. The owners were sad until they heard about a gypsy who could talk to the horse and change its behavior quickly. These people are called ""horse whisperers."" This story inspired Evans.
He started to learn more about horses and the people who work with them. He drove around the US, visiting ranches. He felt alone and worried about his life and money. He had tried for ten years to be a filmmaker, but now he was in debt and worried about his family.
By the end of August, he returned home and had written half of the book. He was still worried about money and showed his work to a friend who was a literary agent. The friend said it was ""fine"" and thought Evans could get $30,000 for the book. Evans needed more money to pay his debts. He had spent seven months on *The Horse Whisperer* and needed more time to finish it.
In October, he sent the first two hundred pages of the book to seven publishers in the UK. Soon, his agent called to say that they had turned down an offer of $75,000. Evans was surprised. His agent felt something good was going to happen.
A week later, the book was sold for $550,000 in the UK and $3.15 million in the US. This was a record for a first novel. Evans and his team were shocked. They had not sent the book to New York, but it got there anyway. Many film studios wanted to make a movie from the book. 
One night, four famous filmmakers called Evans to ask for the rights to the book. He decided not to write the screenplay for *The Horse Whisperer*. He felt it was a great story and did not want to spoil it. He wanted to write another novel instead."

Bobby Fischer is trying to come back to chess. He is not as young as he used to be. Chess is now a game for younger players. After being away from chess for 20 years, Bobby Fischer is playing against Boris Spassky, his old rival. Bobby won the first game, but he is now 49 years old and not in good shape. Boris Spassky is also older. 
Chess has changed a lot in the last 20 years. It is now more professional. Players want to win more than anything else. In chess, a player needs to be calm and strong, not just smart. The game is very intense. Players have a time limit to make their moves, and if they do not finish in time, they lose. Games can be long, and players often do not take breaks. 
Today, many of the best players are under 30 years old. Most of the top ten players in the world are young. Chess is also played differently now. Players prepare a lot before matches. They use computers to study many chess games. In some recent matches, players had teams of helpers to find weaknesses in their opponent's games. 
A chess game can last up to eight hours. Players must stay focused because losing concentration can lead to losing the game. The chess clock makes the game even more stressful. At the end of the game, players often have very little time to make their moves. They must think and move quickly. 
Winning a game feels great, but one win is not enough to win a tournament. Chess tournaments can last 9 to 11 days, with games every day. The world championship matches are even harder. In 1984, a match between Anatoli Karpov and Gary Kasparov had to stop after many months because both players were too tired. 
Bobby Fischer once said, ""All I want to do is play chess."" He left the chess world in 1972, which was surprising. If he is back for the money, he will earn a lot. But if he wants to prove he is still the best, it could be very hard for him. 
**Questions:**
1. How old is Bobby Fischer now?
2. Who is Bobby Fischer playing against?
3. What do players use to prepare for chess matches today?
4. How long can a chess game last?
5. What did Bobby Fischer say about playing chess?"
CAE_60,C1,"Fame and Fortune**
Imogen Edwards-Jones talks to some new British talents, from poets to pop stars, who are becoming famous.
**A** Nick Grosso is a man in his early 30s. He has written three plays that many people like. Now, he is changing his first play, Peaches, into a movie script. He says, ""It is low budget, but I don’t know how low. It will not be over £30 million, but it could be £30."" Nick is very talented, but the surprising thing is that before he wrote Peaches, he had never been to a play or read one. He says, ""When I wrote the play, I never thought it would be performed. It is set in a car. I probably wouldn’t do that now because I know it is hard to do."" He left school at 16 but went back a year later. After finishing A-levels, he joined the Young People’s Theatre. He realized he wanted to write for actors. He wanted people to hear his writing. He says, ""Suddenly, I was with people like me. It was the first time I enjoyed school.""
**B** Simon Pegg is 28 years old and has worked hard in his career since studying drama at Bristol University. He is writing a TV comedy series and just finished a tough tour with comedian Steve Coogan. Simon remembers, ""At university, it was very theoretical. I realized I didn’t want to be a regular actor. I was always more interested in comedy. People think comedy is the hardest job, but it isn’t. If you have courage and good material, it is great to make people laugh."" He has performed with the comedy group Funny Business, but his best work has been with Steve Coogan. Simon says, ""He saw my show, and I was a big fan of his.""
**C** Ciaran McMenamin is 24 years old. He became known when he danced in the show The Young Person's Guide To Becoming A Rock Star. People liked his performance, and now he can choose what he wants to do. He says, ""It is great to be in this position."" Ciaran started acting in school and then joined the Ulster Youth Theatre for four years. He laughs and says, ""I used acting to avoid homework. But then I decided I wanted to do it seriously because I loved it."" Now, he waits for good things to happen, but he thinks about fame. He says, ""When you are 18, you think you will love the photos and interviews, but you realize it is not why you act. It is about getting respect for good work.""
**D** Neil Taylor is 25 years old and the lead singer of the pop band Matrix. They have just signed a deal to make three albums. Neil and his bandmate, Rick Brown, are expected to be very popular when their single, Chimera, comes out. Neil says, ""The record company thinks good sales are very different from what I think. If two people buy it, I will be happy."" Neil has worked hard for his success. He left school at 16 and tried to get into music for eight years. He says, ""I was about to give up when I met Rick Brown, who had contacts at Domino Records. It was a good time for me.""
**E** Stephen Richards is 27 years old. He is a poet and author who has won many awards. He is well known in the poetry world and has been giving readings for six years. His first novel, Hidden, will be published in March. He says, ""It is a story about obsessive love. I could not write it as a poem."" Stephen loved creative writing in school but later did not like school. He decided not to go to university but later got bored with a job at a theatre. He published his first book, a children's book, in 1992. He says, ""My parents thought I would be a reader, not a writer."" Now, he is brave to write novels. He explains, ""Poetry has rules, but a novel can be any length. I want to make sure my writing is good."""

A. Isabel is a 31-year-old art student. She thinks she looks good in jeans, but she does not wear them often. She is looking for the right man but worries that her knees are not nice enough. Isabel has hope, which helps her and others in the story. The author writes in a fun and lively way, with chapter titles like ""Our Hero Feels Inspired.""
B. This story is about a local radio station in America. It is told from the view of a smart child named Francis. Francis works for WLT Radio, which was started by two men to promote their sandwich shop. The station plays music and has different people talking. The author uses humor to show life in a small town and takes readers back to the 1940s and 1950s, a time of old cars and radios.
C. In this story, a second husband talks to his wife's first husband. Richard, a professor, falls in love with a Russian poet. The poet writes bad poetry, which makes Richard feel guilty. She also wants help for her brother, who is in prison. The author tells this story in a funny and clever way, making it enjoyable to read.
D. In London during the 1960s, two sets of best friends meet. One of them, James, is starting a newspaper with his friend Richard. This is important because a woman they both loved was killed years ago. The story has murder, love, and jealousy. The writing is good, and you can really get to know the characters.
E. This story is by a great American writer. It is about Ian Bedloe, who feels guilty about something he did. To make up for it, he takes care of his brother's three orphaned children. At 40, he is becoming a strange bachelor. The story shows Ian's loving relationship with the youngest child, Daphne. It is a warm book that mixes sadness and laughter."
CAE_53,C1,"Volunteer Tourism**
Four writers talk about international volunteer work.
A. It is hard to say that volunteer work helps a lot. Volunteer tourists can help build homes or schools, but they usually pay a lot of money to do this work. If they gave this money to the local community, it could pay for more help than one volunteer can give. This is especially true for young people who take a gap year. They often do not have special skills or experience. Many studies ask if young people volunteer to help others or if they want to improve their own careers. However, these projects can help people learn to care for those who have less.
B. Volunteering can help people understand each other better. It can also help solve problems and create connections between people from different countries. In this way, everyone can benefit, and it can help the world. But if only rich people can volunteer, it may help them more than the communities that need help. Those who volunteer may gain experience and connections, but it does not help those who cannot volunteer.
C. Sometimes, international volunteering can be seen as a way for rich people to help themselves while pretending to help others. It can also be a way to give real help to communities. At its best, volunteering can help both the volunteers and the communities. It can also make people more aware of problems like poverty and injustice.
D. Volunteer tourism fits with the idea of helping others. This idea can seem good, especially when people do not trust big governments or businesses. However, it can also ignore the need for real change in poor communities. Some people think that volunteering is just simple charity. But when volunteer tourism is sold as a way to help develop communities, it can show a misunderstanding of real development needs. The way we think about volunteer tourism can ignore the serious problems of inequality and poverty in the world."
CAE_55,C1,"Sound the Alarm**
Many people listen to the radio in the morning. Most of us need an alarm to help us get out of bed. This is why we have clock radios. But how do you choose a good one?
A group of us tested five clock radios. We included Tom Granger, an inventor, and Paul Bridges, a broadcaster. One clock radio has a 'dual alarm function'. This means you can set two different wake-up times, one for work days and one for weekends. But who really needs that? This clock radio costs about the same as another model, but it has a cassette player. You can listen to your favorite tapes to fall asleep and wake up to music instead of news. We all liked the radio quality, but it was very big, like a rugby ball. Paul said he needs space on his bedside table for his keys, wallet, glasses, and phone. He also likes to book a wake-up call just in case the alarm does not work.
This clock radio was voted the best. Paul said he loved it, but the clock sometimes got stuck at 4:00 PM. I liked the digital display with nice grey numbers on a green background. The snooze button is wide, so you can press it easily when you are still half asleep. However, the buttons felt nice to touch, and I accidentally pressed them too much. The clock has a backup battery, so it still works if the power goes out. We all liked this feature. But setting it up was hard, even though it made us feel cool when we finally did it.
Tom thought this model, which has a lamp, looked cheap. He had to read the instructions twice to make it work. The light was hard to adjust, and you could not read by it. Paul thought the lamp was funny but agreed that tuning the radio was difficult. The buzzer sounded like a submarine alarm, and I wanted to throw it across the room. Still, this model is popular with young people because it looks bright and fun. Tom liked it because it stands out. It was the only one we could set up without reading the instructions. But the alarm could go off 10 minutes early or late, which Paul thought was silly. He said this model was hard to use and not very good.
The simplest and cheapest model was liked by Tom because it was small and easy to use. It has old-fashioned dial tuning, which is easier to set up. With modern buttons, you are not sure if you pressed them right. Tom agreed that radio quality has improved with new technology. I thought the tuning was not very good, but the radio worked well. The buzzer on this model got me out of bed in just two beeps!"
CAE_50,C1,"**Hedgehogs**
A hedgehog is a small animal with sharp spines on its body. Hedgehogs live in many parts of the world, but they are not found in America or Australia. When a hedgehog is in danger, it can roll into a tight ball. This way, its spines point outwards to protect it. The number of spines helps with this defense. Some hedgehogs that live in the desert have fewer spines. They may try to run away from danger instead of rolling up.
Hedgehogs are mostly active at night and sleep during the day. They often sleep under bushes or in holes in the ground. All hedgehogs can hibernate, but not all of them do. Some hedgehogs stay awake all year if the conditions are good."
CAE_25,C1,"Great Sportswomen**
It is hard to be good at any sport, even for men, but women have to work even harder. Training and competitions take a lot of time, so they must make sacrifices. Despite this, they are overcoming challenges and breaking records. Here, we talk to some amazing British sportswomen who are reaching their goals.
A. **Jill, 27, Skier**  
""I love to ski and feel great when I jump and land well, but it can be scary. Sometimes I don’t feel good or the weather is bad, but I keep going. I train for ten months each year, so I miss a lot of time with friends. There are six men and three women on the British team, and we all compete together.""
B. **Caroline, 22, Cyclist**  
""Two years ago, I borrowed a bike for a charity race and won! I was surprised because I had never cycled before. Now, I earn good money as a professional cyclist. I train for at least four hours every day, plus I do some stretching, swimming, and running. My boyfriend is also a cyclist, so he understands how much time it takes.""
C. **Annabel, 26, Rower**  
""Rowing is hard for girls because not many schools have rowing teams. Most girls start when they are 19 or 20, which makes it harder to compete internationally. Coaches often change, so it can be difficult. But I enjoy it and like being fit, and I have a good social life.""
D. **Ffyona, 24, Long Distance Walker**  
""When I was 13, I wanted to walk around the world. I didn’t know how big it was! Walking across Australia was very painful. I walked 50 miles a day with little sleep and many blisters. But I set a record! Some people think women are more likely to fail, so they are less likely to sponsor us.""
E. **Lisa, 26, Saloon Car Racer**  
""Some men think they are better drivers. When I do well, they ignore me. Being a woman in racing can be hard. Men often want to beat me, and I have had many accidents. It is tough to earn money, and what I make goes back into racing. More women are racing now, which is great!""
F. **Alison, 28, Triathlete**  
""I wake up at 5:30 three mornings a week to swim. I need to sleep more on other mornings. In the evenings, I cycle or run. Sometimes I feel tired at work! Racing is hard, but I feel happy when I stay fit. Men and women usually compete together, but the media often focuses more on men. The prize money for women is not as good, but we are working to change that."""
CAE_34,C1,"
One day, Richard Cork, who was 78 years old, remembers meeting the famous artist Picasso. Even from far away, he could see Picasso eating lunch at a restaurant in Cannes. Richard was 18 years old and was traveling around Europe and Morocco in an old van. He had run out of money and found a job painting boats. But he spent a lot of time drawing and had a sketchbook with him when he saw Picasso.
Picasso usually stayed at home, so Richard was surprised to see him at a table with his wife, Jacqueline, and some friends. Richard was nervous but asked Picasso for his signature. To his surprise, Picasso agreed and wrote his name on Richard's paper. Then, he drew some lines on the page. These lines might have looked like a cloud, the sea, or the shape of the harbour.
Richard thanked Picasso and started a conversation. Picasso did not speak much English, and an American woman at the table helped translate. She called Picasso ""the Maestro,"" which made it hard for Richard to talk. But he told Picasso that he loved art and admired his work.
After a while, Richard went back to his boat and showed his friend the signature. His friend asked, ""Is that all?"" and told Richard to go back and talk to Picasso again. So, Richard took his sketchbook and returned to Picasso's table. He did not ask if he could draw Picasso's portrait because he was afraid Picasso would say no. Instead, he just started to draw.
When Picasso saw Richard drawing, he made funny faces to distract him. He rolled his eyes and stuck out his tongue, acting like a clown. Richard wanted to stop, but he felt challenged to keep drawing. Finally, Picasso sat still for a few minutes, allowing Richard to study him. Richard noticed that Picasso looked strong and young for his age.
When the American woman said Picasso wanted to see Richard's drawing, Richard felt shy and thought it was not good enough. But Picasso insisted, and when Richard showed it to him, Picasso nodded in approval. Then, to Richard's surprise, Picasso wanted to draw too. Richard quickly gave him a crayon, and Picasso made a few quick strokes on the paper. In seconds, he drew a face that looked very different from Richard's drawing.
Richard thanked Picasso and asked him to sign the new drawing. The American woman said that Picasso said he already gave Richard his signature. Richard felt lucky to meet Picasso and to have his attention. It meant a lot to him. 
**Questions:**
1. How old was Richard Cork when he met Picasso?
2. Where did Richard see Picasso?
3. What did Richard ask Picasso for?
4. Who helped Richard talk to Picasso?
5. What did Picasso do when Richard started to draw him?"
CAE_12,C1,"Shopping Tricks**
Have you ever gone into a store and bought more than you planned? Here are some tricks that shops use to make you spend more money.
A. **Fresh and Nice**  
Supermarkets know that people like fresh food. They often put fruits and vegetables at the entrance of the store. They might also have a bakery that makes the smell of fresh bread fill the store. The color green is often used because it makes people think of fresh food. But most of what supermarkets sell, like frozen food and cleaning products, is not fresh.
B. **Where Things Are**  
The place where products are in the store is very important. Supermarkets use computers to find out where people like to shop. They put popular products in these places. Items at eye level are more likely to be bought. Special offers in big bins can also attract shoppers. Sometimes, they put items that go well together near each other, like ice cream and dessert toppings.
C. **Moving Basic Items**  
Supermarkets often place basic items like bread and sugar far from the entrance. This way, shoppers pass by other tempting products. Stores may also put popular items far away, hoping that customers will look for them and see other products on the way.
D. **Less is More**  
Some stores, like Next, show their clothes in a way that makes them look special. They do not put many items on the shelves, which makes shoppers think the clothes are exclusive. This good design helps the store sell more.
E. **Total Price Matters**  
Shoppers often care more about the total price of their shopping than the price of each item. Supermarkets mix cheap and expensive items to attract customers. They sometimes sell basic items at a loss to bring people in, which is called ""loss leaders."" They can get lower prices by buying in large amounts.
F. **Price Tags**  
In chain stores, shoppers usually buy fewer items and pay more attention to prices. For example, a blouse priced at £14.99 seems cheaper than one at £15. This pricing trick can also help reduce theft.
G. **Lighting**  
Stores think carefully about lighting. Chain stores try to use natural light so customers can see the true colors of clothes. Supermarkets use special lights to make fresh fruits and vegetables look better.
H. **Store Layout**  
Many stores use different carpets to guide shoppers. One pattern shows the way through the store, and another shows sales areas. This helps to lead customers to different sections. Some stores use nice carpets in sales areas to make them more inviting.
I. **Promotions**  
When you enter a supermarket, you often see big pictures of delicious food. In some places, shopping carts have screens that show ads for products while you shop. These ads are meant to catch the attention of shoppers and can increase sales a lot."
CAE_26,C1,"Sea, Ice & Rock**
Chris Bonnington (58) is famous for climbing Mount Everest in 1985. He has also made new climbing paths in Britain and the Alps and has written many books, like *Quest for Adventure* and *Everest the Hard Way*. 
Robin Knox-Johnston (53) started his career at sea in the Merchant Navy. In 1968-9, he was the first person to sail around the world alone in his boat, Sunhaili. He also set a record for sailing from New York to the Lizard in just 10 days. Chris and Robin worked together to sail and climb in Greenland, and they wrote a book about their trip called *Sea, Ice and Rock*.
In 1979, Chris was working on *Quest for Adventure*. He called Robin for an interview, and Robin invited him to go sailing. Chris could teach Robin some climbing skills, and Robin could teach Chris about sailing. It was Chris's first time on a yacht. They sailed for a while and then stopped. Robin's wife and daughter stayed on the boat while Chris and Robin paddled to the shore to practice climbing. The climb was hard, but Chris was impressed with how steady Robin was.
When they reached a big drop, Chris asked Robin if he had ever climbed before. Robin had not, so Chris showed him how to climb down. Robin wanted to use his arms like he did on his boat, but Chris wanted him to use his legs. Chris was not happy about it, but Robin got down safely.
During this trip, Chris and Robin became good friends. Robin suggested they go on a big trip to Greenland together. Chris thought Robin was a great leader. Normally, the captain makes all the decisions, but Robin asked everyone for their opinions. Most of the time, people did not give advice, but it felt good to be part of the decisions.
Chris found sailing boring. He liked the exciting moments, but he did not like being in the middle of the sea for many days. Chris preferred land, while Robin loved sailing and fixing things on the boat. Chris sometimes felt useless because Robin did not need his help. The boat was also very small for six people.
When they reached Greenland, Chris had to lead the climbing expedition. He felt nervous about keeping Robin safe. Climbing the Cathedral, the highest mountain in Greenland, was harder than Chris thought. Robin was not a natural climber, but he tried very hard. The first time they tried to reach the top, they climbed for 24 hours. On the way down, they were so tired that they almost fell asleep on steep slopes. Robin trusted Chris completely and followed him. When it became too hard, they decided to turn back. Robin was also worried about their boat and if it would be okay.
The only time they had a problem was on the way home. They took turns watching the boat. Chris was supposed to wake up at 4 am, but Robin did not wake him. Robin thought he could do it alone. Chris felt that Robin did not trust him, and he told Robin how he felt. Robin quickly reassured Chris that he was wrong to think that. 
They enjoyed their trip to Skye, but they really got to know each other during the Greenland expedition. Chris discovered that Robin was a kind and sensitive person."
CAE_8,C1,"**A Simple History of the Apple**
Apples have been around for a very long time. They come in many colors, shapes, and sizes. But today, we might lose some of the different kinds of apples we have.
**Early Apples (8,000 BC)**  
People have eaten apples since ancient times. In Britain, they threw away apple seeds. About 10,000 years ago, people left apple parts near lakes in Switzerland and Italy. In Switzerland and near the Caucasus mountains, ancient people stored apple halves for winter. These apples were small and wild, called crab apples. They were very different from the apples we eat today.
**Norman Apples (1000 AD)**  
The French learned how to grow fruit from the Romans. They brought this knowledge to Britain. The Romans introduced some apple types, but many did not grow well in Britain. British monks started to create new apple types, and many of today’s apples come from these.
**Popular Apples in the Middle Ages (1200)**  
In the thirteenth century, several apple types became popular in Britain. The Old English Pearmain was a common dessert apple. The Costard was a cooking apple sold in markets. But many problems, like droughts and the Black Death, made it hard to grow apples. So, more apples were brought in from other places. In the sixteenth century, King Henry VIII sent a man to France to learn about growing apples. He brought back many new types, including the famous Pippins.
**Apples and Settlers (1750)**  
By the seventeenth century, apples were very popular in Britain. When people moved to Canada, Australia, the US, South Africa, and New Zealand, they took apples with them. Captain Bligh took apples to Australia, and the Pilgrim Fathers took them to America. A famous apple planter in North America was Johnny Appleseed. He planted many apple trees and was known for his kindness to animals.
**Delicious Apples (1850)**  
In Iowa, a farmer named Jesse Hiatt found a new apple tree. He named the apple 'Hawkey'. When a judge tasted it, he said it was 'Delicious'. This apple became very popular around the world.
**Granny Smith Apples (1850)**  
In Australia, Maria Anne Smith found a small apple tree in 1868. She took care of it and grew green apples that became famous. People called her 'Granny Smith' because she worked hard on her family’s farm. She believed that good things can come from what we think is useless.
**Modern Apples (1950)**  
Today, apples are grown all over the world. Most apples come from a few types that are chosen for their looks and how well they travel, not for their taste. Many old apple types are disappearing. In the UK, some gardeners keep old apple types alive, but in the US, many have been lost. People want more types of apples. We should all help to keep different kinds of apples and other foods safe for the future."

Richard Nerurkar is a long-distance runner from Britain. He is one of the best 10,000-metre runners in his country. He visits a training camp in Kenya, which is ten miles south of the equator. There is a mountain path that starts from a quiet road in Nairobi. This path leads to Mount Kenya, the highest mountain in Kenya. This beautiful but lonely place is called Nanyuk. For three years, it has been my home for winter training in Kenya's Central Highlands. But I had never trained with Kenyan runners before.
On my fourth trip to Kenya, I did something new. I ran in my first race in Kenya and stayed at the national team training camp. This is where the best runners in Kenya prepare for big competitions. I was invited by the national team coach after I finished fifth in the World Championship 10,000 metres race. I was behind three Kenyan runners and one Moroccan runner. It was a great chance for me.
Training at high altitude helps runners because it makes more red blood cells. This helps them carry more oxygen. Many Kenyan runners have been successful because of this. My first race in Africa was also special. It was the first international cross-country race in Africa, held in Nairobi. I finished behind 41 runners, and almost all of them were Kenyan. I felt I did okay!
I think Kenyan runners are successful for more reasons than just the high altitude. They have a simple and relaxed way of running. They enjoy competing and have a simple diet. I wanted to learn how they train. At the training camp, I found out more. The camp is at St Mark's College, 6,200 feet up Mount Kenya. It is a basic place with few comforts. The runners live with regular students and share rooms.
Every day, the runners have three training sessions: a morning run, interval training in the middle of the day, and a steady run in the afternoon. The day starts at six in the morning. We wake up and meet the coaches for the morning run. The coach told us to run easy because we had a hard day ahead. We run about 40 kilometres each day, which is close to a marathon. On Sundays, we only run 20 kilometres, which is a nice break.
Life at the camp is simple. We wash our faces and brush our teeth before breakfast. Breakfast is tea, bread, and boiled eggs in a small dining area. Lunch and dinner are similar: ugali (a maize dish), stew, cabbage or spinach, and tea. After running, we drive to a stream to wash off in the evening.
By the end of my time at the camp, I understood more about why Kenyan runners are successful. Their success is not just because of their genes or where they come from. I think it is also about their simple life in the mountains, their hard training, and their love for running. These are the real reasons why Kenya is so good at long-distance running."

**The Problems of Advertising**
Many people know that advertising is not doing well. This is not just because of the economy. Advertising started to go down in 1989, before the economy got bad. The problems with advertising are serious and happen all over the world. 
Advertising has not changed with the economy. Advertisers think about big groups of people, but now there are many different groups. Even ads for big brands should focus on smaller groups, but they usually do not. This is a big problem for advertising.
Think about your shopping. When you go to a supermarket, you might buy 30, 40, or even 50 items. Most of these items are not from advertised brands. You might buy a few advertised brands, but not many. In a year, you probably buy only a few hundred different brands. For things like cars, you might only buy one every three years. You do not buy many clothes either, and most of them are not from advertised brands. 
In total, you likely do not buy more than 400 different brands in a year. But there are about 32,500 brands that are advertised. Most people only buy a small number of these brands. This means that a lot of advertising is not effective. 
When you watch TV, count how many ads are for brands you buy. Most people find that only about 1 in 16 ads are for brands they might buy. This means that 94% of the ads are not useful for them. 
Many people think they are not affected by advertising, but that is not true. Most people do not buy most of the brands they see in ads. There is always some waste in advertising. Not everyone who sees an ad will buy the product. 
Even though advertising can waste money, it can still be effective. Advertisers need to reach many people to find the few who will buy their products. They cannot know in advance who will buy. 
Good advertising can reach the right people better, but it can never be perfect. Even the best ads do not get a response from everyone. This is different from selling in person, where a salesperson can sell to every person they talk to. 
If an advertiser knows who will buy, they would not need to use ads. They could talk to those people directly. If an ad can get 1 million new customers, that is very good. For popular products, getting 2% of the population to buy is a big success. 
To make advertising work better, it needs to focus more on specific groups of people."

Charles Clover visits a very eco-friendly home in Southwell, Nottinghamshire. This town has some interesting places. One is Southwell Minster, a little-known old cathedral. It has special carvings of 'green' men made by craftsmen in the 1200s. The second surprise is the 'autonomous house,' built by Robert and Brenda Vale. This house is very green. The Vales use rainwater for washing and drinking, recycle waste into compost, and heat their home with waste heat from their appliances and their own body heat, along with that of their three teenage children and two cats, Edison and Faraday.
The house looks traditional, with a clay tile roof, and is located 300 yards from the Minster. It was designed to match the old buildings in the town and was approved by planners, even though it is in a special area. When you ring the solar-powered doorbell, it is very quiet inside. The house is well-insulated, with special windows that keep out noise. Inside, it is calm and peaceful. On a sunny summer day, the windows are closed, and the conservatory warms the air before it goes into the house. Robert opens windows and ventilation shafts to let fresh air in. 
The Vales, who teach architecture at Nottingham University, have cared about the environment for a long time. They wrote a book about green architecture in the 1970s called The Autonomous House. They wanted to build a house that did not produce carbon dioxide. They also decided to not use mains water. They created special toilets, put rainwater tanks in the cellar, and used copper gutters to keep drinking water clean. They filter the water before using it. Water from washing goes into the garden, and they do not use a dishwasher because they think strong detergents are not good for the environment.
Robert says, ""We wanted to show that it is possible to design a house that is better for the environment, without living in the dark."" The only old-fashioned part of the house is the hall, which has a fireplace and a staircase that goes up to the top of the building. The Vales do not pay water bills. Last winter, the house used only nine units of electricity a day, which cost about 70p. This is much less than what other four-bedroom houses use. Soon, they will add solar panels to generate more electricity. The house will still use mains electricity for cooking and appliances, but it will make extra electricity. One day, they hope to charge an electric car with it.
The only heating in the house is a small wood-burning stove in the hall, which they only use when it is very cold. When I visited in February, Robert said it was too warm to light the fire. The temperature on the first floor was 18C, which is lower than usual, but he said it felt comfortable because there were no draughts and everything was at the same temperature. He explained that people in the past were comfortable at lower temperatures because of their warm clothing. 
The secret of the house is that it is simple and easy to maintain. Most materials were bought from local shops and installed by local workers. This made the house cheap to build, costing the same as low-cost rental housing. Many building companies do not like this idea. 
**Questions:**
1. What is the name of the eco-friendly house built by Robert and Brenda Vale?
2. What do the Vales use for washing and drinking?
3. How do the Vales keep their house warm?
4. What did Robert say about the temperature in the house during winter?
5. Why is the house considered cheap to build?"
CAE_51,C1,"The Camera and Fairies**
Arthur Conan Doyle created the Sherlock Holmes stories. He thought he was a rational man and a scientist. In 1920, he saw photographs of fairies in a garden. He believed these photos were proof that fairies really existed. He published the photos with an article, saying fairies are wonderful creatures.
In 1939, the two women who took the photos said they were fake. They cut out pictures of fairies from a book and placed them among flowers. The photos looked beautiful, but the trick was simple. This shows that photography can be misleading. 
Today, we can change our digital photos with computer software. It is a myth that photography was always honest. From the beginning, when cameras started taking pictures, the reality was changed."
CAE_11,C1,"Blacksmiths**
For a long time, iron has been very important to people. The men who work with iron, called blacksmiths, have been seen as more than just skilled workers. Before the Industrial Revolution, blacksmiths were as respected as doctors and astrologers because they made weapons, armor, and farming tools. They were also seen as artists. In the 1700s, blacksmiths created beautiful ironwork for places like St Paul's Cathedral. 
However, by the late 1960s, there were not many blacksmiths left in Britain. Heavy industry did not need them anymore, and new buildings did not use their beautiful ironwork. In the last 10 years, there has been a small revival of blacksmithing. More people are interested in decorative architecture and new styles of interior design. But much of the work still looks old-fashioned. Companies that make gates and balconies often call their products ""classical"" or ""Victorian-style."" 
You can find many trendy design stores selling rusty candlesticks and other items. Luckily, there are events happening soon to promote blacksmithing. The first event is an exhibition of ironwork by members of the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA). It opened last week at the Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey. Alan Dawson, the secretary of BABA, says, ""We could be starting a new Iron Age because both the public and blacksmiths are seeing things differently now."" 
Power tools have made it easier for blacksmiths to work with metal. They can now bend, twist, and weld metal more easily. Dawson says, ""These artists can now express themselves with this material."" About 250 pieces of work are in the show, including bookends and a spiral staircase. Prices start at £90 and can go much higher. Most of the money will go to the artists, but some will help the Association promote good ironwork. 
Dawson has made an eight-foot gate and a lamp with a glass shade. He says, ""My style comes from letting steel bend and flow when it is hot. It’s like drawing with metal."" Many artists love working with iron. Susan May, a jeweler, says, ""It’s magical because it is soft when hot, but when it cools, it becomes hard and strong."" 
Ann Catrin Evans makes door knockers and handles that look like they come from scary castles. One design looks like a ball and chain, and another looks like a Celtic cross. She says, ""I love that steel is cold and hard, and it feels like it will last forever."" Iron gives people a lot of pleasure and a sense of security. It is likely that iron will be used for decoration for many years to come, as long as we do not have to see any more rusty candlesticks!"
CAE_14,C1,"THE DAY I GAVE UP SMOKING**
I thought my friends would be happy when I stopped smoking, but one of my coworkers was very angry. She said, ""What do you mean? If it was easy, why didn’t you stop before?"" I could not explain how I went from smoking a lot every day to not smoking at all in just a few hours. It was strange for me too. 
I went to a stop-smoking session two months and three weeks ago. I did not plan to stop smoking, and I did not really want to. I felt pressure from people who do not like smoking, and I still feel that way. My family is healthy, and I did not feel sick. I thought I was healthier than some of my friends who tried to live better.
On that Thursday afternoon, I went to a session called The Easy Way to Stop Smoking to write an article about it. I said, ""I will not try to stop. I am here to write, not to stop."" I thought this was fair because I enjoyed smoking. It made me happy. The counselor looked at me like she understood. 
We could smoke as much as we wanted, and the room was full of smoke. I noticed that when I was told to smoke, I did not want to. The messages about stopping smoking started to make sense to me. I began to think that stopping smoking could be a good thing. I felt strong thinking about not being a smoker. 
It was not hard to stop. The desire for nicotine went away after a few days. I thought working without cigarettes would be hard, but it was not a problem. I was surprised that doing things at home on weekends was the hardest part. I realized that smoking helped me not feel bored. 
I do miss smoking a little, but not too much. Every new experience as a non-smoker is different. Eating out, waiting for a plane, checking into a hotel, and waiting during a theater break are all moments when I used to smoke."

Dorothy Hodgkin is the only British woman scientist to win a Nobel Prize, but many people in Britain do not know her name. For four years, I have asked my friends about her. When I tell them I am writing a biography of Dorothy Hodgkin, some say, ""Isn't there one already?"" If they do, I know they know her.
Dorothy Hodgkin won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1964. She studied important things like penicillin and vitamin B12. She was a great scientist, but she also had a family. She had three children and a husband who was often away because of his job.
Many people think that scientists do not have interesting lives. Some scientists believe that their lives are boring to read about. But this is not true. Scientists can have exciting stories, just like artists or writers. 
Today, more scientists are sharing their lives with the public. For example, some scientists appear on TV shows or in advertisements. This helps people see that scientists are normal people too.
In the past, books about scientists were often dull. They did not talk much about the personal lives of scientists. But now, books are changing. They show scientists as real people with families and feelings. 
Dorothy Hodgkin loved her work. She was very dedicated to science. She worked hard to solve complex problems. But she also balanced her work with her family life. 
It is important for people to know about scientists like Dorothy Hodgkin. Understanding science can be as interesting as reading a good book or learning a new language. It is sad that many educated people do not know about the important work of scientists. 
**Questions:**
1. Who is Dorothy Hodgkin?
2. What did Dorothy Hodgkin win a Nobel Prize for?
3. How many children did Dorothy Hodgkin have?
4. Why do some people think scientists have boring lives?
5. How are scientists changing the way they share their lives with the public?"
CAE_56,C1,"Margaret and Her Water Finding Skills**
Margaret Wilkins has a special ability. She can use a forked hazel stick to find water underground. Many farmers need her help because their wells are dry. Margaret and her husband have a well-drilling business. They use machines to drill wells, but Margaret only needs her hazel stick to find water. They are very successful, with more than 90% of their searches finding water.
This ability to find water is called dowsing. Some people think it is a special skill. There are different ideas about how it works. One idea is that everything vibrates, and water vibrates more than other things. Some dowsers say they can feel or smell water. 
In recent years, many farmers have needed Margaret's help because of dry weather. Most of her customers are farmers who have lost their water supply. Some customers have holiday homes where it is too expensive to bring water from far away. Others are building golf courses.
Margaret looks for water between 50 and 70 meters deep. She must be careful to avoid any waste getting into the water. The water she finds is usually clean, but she has to be careful because some areas have minerals like iron.
To start finding water, Margaret looks at a map and uses a pendulum. She holds the pendulum over the map, and it swings when she is over a place with water. After that, she walks in the fields with her hazel stick. When she is above water, she feels something strange. She uses the stick to find the exact spot to drill.
Margaret holds the two ends of the stick and pulls them slightly apart. If the stick rises, it means there is water below. It is very important to drill in the right place. If they do not agree on where to drill, they will keep looking until they both agree.
Margaret is not alone in her work. Many people are interested in how she finds water. She calls it an ""intuitive perception of the environment."" This means she has a special understanding of her surroundings. This skill helps her and her family continue their well-drilling business year after year."

**We changed lives for a day!** 
Have you ever thought about living someone else's life for a day? It could be fun to try something new! We helped four people do this. Here is what happened.
**A. Amanda's story**  
I am Amanda, 23 years old, and I have two daughters. I swapped lives with my friend Cindy, who is 30 and works as a waitress in a busy restaurant in London. I had never been in a place like that before. It was dark and loud, and there were many people. It was very different from my hometown, and I was nervous! 
Being a mother is a busy job, but waitressing was harder! I had only fifteen minutes to learn how to carry drinks on a tray. The other waitresses made it look easy, but when I tried, the drinks fell and spilled everywhere. I felt embarrassed, but the other waitresses laughed. Everyone makes mistakes at first!
When the restaurant opened at 11:30 am, there was already a line of customers. I was worried about remembering their orders, but it was easy because everything was on a computer. After a few hours, my feet hurt, and the loud music was hard to handle. I had to ask customers to repeat themselves, which was embarrassing! By the end of my shift at 5 pm, I was very tired and wanted to soak my feet in hot water. One waitress told me it was a 'quiet' day! I never knew waitressing could be so tiring. I thought it was an easy job, but you need to be friendly and calm, especially when many customers come in. I am shy, and I don’t think I could work on a busy Saturday night. I was not happy with the pay either. I must have been a bad waitress because even the rich customers didn’t tip me! I was very glad to go back to my children. Taking care of them seems easy after waitressing!
**B. Cindy's story**  
I am Cindy, and I was nervous about being a mother for a day, but I was also excited. Amanda warned me that her daughters were naughty, but I thought I could handle it. 
When Amanda left for the restaurant, I had to get the two girls dressed and fed. After dropping off Sophie at school and Katie at nursery, I thought I would have three hours of quiet time. I was wrong! Amanda reminded me that I still had to make the beds, clean the house, and do the laundry.
At 1 pm, I picked up Katie, went to the supermarket, and then took her home for lunch. But when I brought Sophie home from school, the real trouble started! They jumped on the couch and screamed loudly! I thought they would get tired, but I was wrong again. I thought I could keep up with them, but they were too much for me! 
After a lot of talking, I got them to bed by 8 pm, but then the fun began! How many glasses of water can a child drink? I knew they just wanted to come downstairs to watch TV, but it was tiring to talk to them all evening. I never knew taking care of two small children could be so hard. You don’t have time to think about yourself, and it feels like a big responsibility. Still, I really enjoyed the day.
**C. Rosemary's story**  
I am Rosemary, and I run a dairy farm. I usually wake up at 5:30 am, so sleeping in until 7 am was nice! I was nervous about how to dress for school. I didn’t want to look like a farmer in front of the students. 
At school, I saw about 400 students at assembly. I hoped I would not stand out. Then I helped in a math class. The children worked in small groups, which was different from my school days. I also helped with a nature project about snails. By lunchtime, I was tired and wanted a break, but teachers only have about five minutes to eat. There is a lot to do before classes start again. 
I went to a staff meeting and helped with sports trials. After lunch, we had a silent reading lesson, which was nice, and then a French lesson. The children wanted to practice their French with me, which showed me I need to improve mine! Finally, we had Physical Education. I was very tired, but the children had so much energy. The hardest part was speaking in front of the class, even for just two minutes. Teachers have more holidays, but I think I will stay with farming!
**D. Hilary's story**  
I am Hilary, and I arrived at White House Farm at 8:30 am, but Rosemary had already been up for three hours! Rosemary has a big farm with many cows and sheep. She makes ice cream, yogurt, and cream to sell.
I spent most of the morning in the ice cream shop, filling milk containers and making ice cream. It was hard not to eat some! At lunchtime, I checked the sheep. I had to help a sheep that had fallen over. If they are not helped, they can die. 
After feeding the calves, I started milking the cows. It took two and a half hours, and Rosemary does this twice a day, every day! I felt lonely because I missed the children. Animals don’t talk back! The hardest part of the job is that you cannot take time off. The cows need to be milked twice a day, so it is hard to plan a break. Rosemary only gets about three days off this year. Farming seems nice, but it is very hard work. The money is not steady, and I would not like to depend on the weather."

A trumpet is not just for Christmas. It is interesting that many musicians, even famous ones, come from families without music. Hakan Hardenberger is a special trumpet player from southern Sweden. He is 30 years old and is known around the world. He plays old music and new music. When you see him, he looks young and happy, just like the sound of the trumpet.
Recently, he played the Hummel Trumpet Concerto in a big concert hall in London. He also had a TV show about his work, filmed in London and Sweden. Hakan was born near Malmo. When he was eight years old, his father, who did not play music, gave him a trumpet for Christmas. His father liked Louis Armstrong's music and wanted to give Hakan a real trumpet, not a toy. Hakan loved the trumpet and played it all the time.
His mother found a trumpet player from the Malmo Symphony Orchestra to give Hakan lessons. This teacher, Bo Nilsson, saw that Hakan had talent. Hakan is thankful for having such a good teacher. Bo loved the trumpet and always looked for new ways to play it. Hakan learned that every trumpet has small problems, and he learned to work with them.
From the beginning, Hakan had a special sound when he played. He always wanted to be a solo artist, not just play in an orchestra. He admired a French trumpet player named Maurice Andre and bought all his records. Hakan's parents supported his dream to be a trumpet player.
When Hakan was 15, he needed to choose where to study. His teacher wanted him to go to America, but it was too far. Instead, he went to Paris at 16 to study with Pierre Thibaud. Thibaud told him that playing in an orchestra was not as exciting as being a soloist. Hakan knew he played better than many other young players. 
At 17, he entered a competition in Paris. He only prepared for the first round but made it to the second round. He knew most of the pieces for that round too. In the final round, he had to play a piece that was very difficult for him. He did not win first prize, but he enjoyed playing and realized that people listened to him.
Hakan is honest about his music. He does not want to explain how he connects with people through music because he believes it might ruin the magic of it. He thinks music has the power to move people. 
**Questions:**
1. Where is Hakan Hardenberger from?
2. How old is Hakan?

**ANNE'S DAY**  
""I wake up at 6:30 am, go to the gym at 7 am, and get to work by 8 am. I start surgery at 8:30 am. I do surgery all day on Monday and Wednesday, and sometimes on Friday afternoons. Most brain surgeries take about three hours, but some can take all day. Sometimes, I work for ten hours without eating or going to the bathroom. Deciding when to do surgery can be stressful. I don’t feel stressed when I am operating, but I worry about what I will do the next day. Brain surgery is usually a last option for patients, but when it works, it is amazing. From 10 am to 1 pm, I see patients and explain the surgeries. I like this part of my job. I try to comfort patients if they are upset, but I have to be quick. I leave work between 6 pm and 8 pm. Some nights and weekends, I am on call, and I always carry my beeper. When I am on holiday, I worry about my patients for the first three days.""

**MARITA'S DAY**  
""I wake up at 7:45 am, leave home by 8:20 am, and take the train to work. I arrive at 9:15 am. On Monday at 10:30 am, we meet to talk about our work and any problems. I work with a team of three senior designers, one partner, and one junior designer. My job is mostly about production, not just design. I get a brief from the client about what they want. I spend three to four weeks designing and developing the project. After that, I show my ideas to the client. If they like them, we make plans and budgets. I also work with photographers and illustrators. I spend a lot of time managing people. I have to talk to many different people. When their work is done, I put everything together and send it to the printers. I often have many projects at once, which can be very stressful. I have lunch at 1 pm for an hour, and we try to go to the pub. I usually get home by 7:30 pm or later. It is hard for me to relax when I am busy.""

""I wake up at about 7 am most days, but sometimes I wake up at 4:30 am or 5 am for long flights. At 10:30 or 11 am, I might go for a bike ride or swim. Because driving is a sitting job, I have to eat well and exercise. I usually have a big breakfast and snacks during the day. People often ask me for restaurant or shop recommendations, so I need to know the area. Many jobs are booked in advance, so I can check the routes. Not all passengers are polite; some can be rude. But most are nice, and I have good relationships with my regular clients. I work seven days a week, up to fifteen hours a day. I try to go to bed by 11 pm.""

We spend about an hour and a half at each house. At about 11 am, we go to a cafe for a big breakfast. In summer, I may work until 10 pm; in winter, until 4:30 pm. I have my office at home, so when I get back, I check messages and calls. If someone wants a new garden, I usually meet them in the evening. We use old materials to make gardens look old. Sometimes, clients have strange ideas, but it is satisfying to see a garden we created. I find it hard to relax in the evenings because I can hear the phone ring. I sleep well because my job is very physical, and I am always tired at the end of the day.""

The workers start at 6 am, so my first job is to find out what happened since I left the night before. I usually have paperwork to look at or questions to answer. I have lunch for about half an hour between 2 pm and 2:30 pm, but I often eat while I work. I need to keep a good relationship with the workers because we check their work.

Night shifts are quieter, and I can read about new rules. This job is stressful, and I want to be a watch manager one day.
**E. Shop Manager**  
If I have an early shift, I leave home by 8:00 am. I start the electronic sales system and make sure someone is watching the cash register. I help customers find and order books.

**Get the Edge - Motivate Yourself at Work**
A. **What Makes a Good Leader?**  
A leader is someone who inspires others. They help people change and grow. Being a leader is not about being tall or very smart. Pat Dixon, who wrote a book about men and women at work, says that leadership is about making things happen with people who are excited and interested. A good leader should be able to speak clearly and confidently. They should say ""I believe"" instead of ""I think.""
B. John van Maurik, who teaches a course on leadership, says that most people can be better leaders than they think. To become a leader, you need to find your hidden talents, develop them, and use them. In a way, we are all born to be leaders; we just need the right situation to grow. It is easy to see great leaders like Emmeline Pankhurst or Mahatma Gandhi, but it can be harder to see leadership in our own jobs. However, being a good leader is very important for good management.
C. Think about the best and worst boss you have had. They might have been good at setting goals and meeting deadlines. But how did they achieve these goals? The best leader motivated you and supported you. The worst leader made you feel unimportant and kept information from you. When things went wrong, they blamed you. The first leader was very good; the second leader was very bad.
D. Leaders and managers are different. Managers like to work within set rules. Leaders create new ideas. Micheal Shea, who wrote about leadership, says that a good manager can keep a company running, but a good leader can change a sad organization, whether it is a company, a sports team, or a country.
E. Whether you are the boss or a middle manager, you can improve your leadership skills. Here are some lessons:  
- Leadership works best when you choose to do it. Find what you care about. When you feel inspired to lead, use that energy and take action.  
- Start thinking of yourself as a leader. Your ability to lead is important. Recognize it.  
- Working together is good, but sometimes you need to lead firmly. Try different styles. If you usually ask others for their opinions, try taking the lead yourself. See how this changes the results.  
- Set goals and try to achieve them. Look at your job and see where being a leader can help you do better and grow in your career.
F.  
- Leadership does not just happen. It grows when you take the lead, take risks, and learn from mistakes. Learn to delegate tasks, motivate others, organize, and give praise.  
- Don’t think that everyone will like your way of leading right away. Keep improving your communication skills. You don’t have to be liked, but your ideas should be respected.  
- Be visible and available to important people. Remember, you don’t have to lead all the time. Know when your help is needed and how you can help others become leaders too."

**Film critic Nick James reviews some recent movies.**
**A. Abyss**  
Before Titanic, director James Cameron made a tense movie about oil workers and navy experts trying to save a nuclear submarine deep underwater. The funny and brave foreman Bud and his team remind us of heroes in old movies by Howard Hawks. The special effects are very good, but the dialogue and characters are not strong. The story feels like a simple B-movie.
**B. The Thin Red Line**  
This movie is based on the book by James Jones about the battle for Guadalcanal. It is directed by Andrew Marton. Marton’s film is more traditional than Terrence Malick's new version, which is more poetic. Marton focuses on one soldier and his tough sergeant. Malick's film is richer, but Marton’s version has some good moments, like a flashback where the soldier dreams of his wife.
**C. On Guard**  
This movie is based on a novel from 1875. It is a fun swashbuckler with a clever villain played by Fabrice Luchini. Vincent Perez is a lively hero, and Daniel Auteuil plays a moody character who is also a swordsman. The film uses many classic costume drama ideas, but it is entertaining.
**D. Character**  
This film is set in Rotterdam at the turn of the century. The detailed costumes and sets make it look like a museum. Jan Decleir plays a harsh bailiff named Dreverhaven, who is cruel to his tenants. His bad relationship with his son is the main story, but the film focuses too much on the details and not enough on the dark story.
**E. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly**  
This re-released movie shows the skill of director Leone. The sound is very clear, and every noise is easy to hear. The story is harsh, and when it slows down, Morricone's great music makes it exciting again. The characters, the good (Clint Eastwood), the bad (Lee van Cleef), and the ugly (Ell Wallach), all seem equally bad as they travel across the West after the Civil War.
**F. The Longest Day**  
This three-hour war movie has many famous stars. It has four directors and 23,000 extras, which is impressive. The early scenes, where soldiers wait for news about an invasion, are slow for both the audience and the soldiers. While it is a big project, it is better to watch on a big screen. Watching it on video is not as good."

**BOOK A** Steve Martin's *Compelling Evidence* is very interesting. The main character is a lawyer who is trying to start a new job after leaving a big law firm. He has to defend his boss's wife when she is accused of killing her husband. The trial scenes are exciting, and the ending is surprising. This is a great first book in a popular genre.
**BOOK B** *Curtains for the Cardinal* starts with a lot of action. The main character, Sigismondo, helps rich people in Italy during the Renaissance. He gets involved in politics and a murder case, but we believe he will find out who is guilty. The story is complicated and a bit long, but it is still very good.
**BOOK C** *File Under: Deceased* introduces a new detective, Leah Hunter, who is a tax inspector. She starts to investigate when a strange man dies near her. Even though she faces problems and the local detective does not approve of her, Leah is strong and smart. She is a great character.
**BOOK D** *Double Deuce* by Robert B. Parker features Spenser, a private investigator. He helps his friend Hawk to remove drug dealers from a poor area in Boston. The dialogue is quick and clever, and there is more thinking than usual. It is always good entertainment from Parker.
**BOOK E** *False Prophet* by Faye Kellermann has detectives Pete Decker and Marge Dunn. They investigate a robbery at the home of a famous actress's daughter. The author's easy writing style and focus on strange human behavior make this a fun mystery.
**BOOK F** *Blood Red, Snow White* is written by husband and wife team Diane Henry and Nicholas Horrock. It features another lawyer and a female client, but most of the action happens outside the courtroom. The lawyer becomes a victim as the story unfolds. It has romance, money, and violence, making it a gripping suspense novel.
**BOOK G** *Dead for a Ducat* by Simon Shaw shows actor Philip Fletcher as a target. A funny group of characters comes together to film a story about Robin Hood, but Philip feels this is not the right direction for his career. Simon Shaw usually entertains, but this time the story is not as good as his other works.
**BOOK H** *Fall Down Easy* is Lawrence Gough's best book in a while. Canadian police are looking for a clever bank robber who targets female bank tellers. The story builds tension slowly and shows the smart but troubled robber, making it better than an average detective novel."

Tim Pozzi is 34 years old. He has a good job, but he decided to leave it and go backpacking. This summer, he quit his job and rented out his flat. He wants to travel in South East Asia for a year. Tim feels nervous about this decision. He has traveled before. After university, he spent two years backpacking in North and South America. When he came back, he fell in love, started a career, and bought a flat. He realized he was not happy just working for money. When he quit his job, he felt free again.
Many of Tim's friends are married and have children. They do not want to change places with him, but they envy his freedom. Tim is not in a relationship and does not have big career goals. He feels he should enjoy his freedom for his friends. But he is nervous about making plans. He worries about renting his home and where to go. He is also behind on his plans because he keeps putting things off.
Tim learned that many people in their late twenties and thirties want to travel and change their lives. Jennifer Cox from Lonely Planet says more people are realizing they can have adventures if they are brave and organized. Danny, a 30-year-old accountant, and his girlfriend Tammy, a 28-year-old teacher, bought a round-the-world ticket for a year. Danny is ready to give up job security for this trip. He knows he might return to the same job, but he thinks it is worth the risk.
Matt, who just left the Army, traveled for a year to change his life. He wanted to learn to live differently. There are many reasons why people travel at this age. Angela Baron from the Institute of Personnel Development says more people work on short-term contracts. If a contract ends, they have nothing to lose. Some companies even allow career breaks.
Dan Hiscocks, from Travellerseye, says many people in their thirties are thinking about their lives. If they are not happy, they know they can change things. Travel helps them think about what they want. Jennifer Cox believes this is a sign of a better society. People are asking themselves, ""Is this what I want?"" Ben, a 32-year-old picture researcher, is going to Central America for a year. He does not think he is running away; he wants to find something for himself. But he feels nervous about leaving his comfortable routine.
Tim also feels unsure about leaving his easy life. He thinks he might not have made this decision if he had a better boss. Jennifer Cox says many people travel after a big change in their lives, like a breakup or losing a job. Tim is excited about the next 12 months. He wants to enjoy life and make the most of his adventure.

CAE_42,C1,"Working from Home**
Georgina McGuiness took a long break from her job as a journalist. She felt she did not know much about new technology. In this text, she shares how she changed her home into a good place to work.
Last Christmas, I turned 37 years old. I realized I needed to start my journalism career again. I looked at my resume and saw that I was still using old technology from the 1980s. Back then, I used a typewriter, and now I needed to learn how to use a computer. Many job ads asked for experience with desktop publishing, but I did not have any. I felt scared to use a computer.
I thought it would be hard to leave home to work, but then I entered a competition in a local newspaper. My family and I won a computer! We got a laptop for my husband and a personal computer for everyone. We started to learn about the Internet and began chatting with people from around the world. The children loved using the computer, and I set up a small office in the kitchen. I had a phone, a fax machine, and a modem to connect to the Internet. I could work from home and still take my children to school.
At first, I was nervous about using the computer. I thought I would lose my work if I pressed the wrong button. But I learned the basic skills I needed. It was easier than I thought. I started writing articles for a magazine, and now I feel proud of my work.
The computer helped me become more organized. I used spreadsheets to keep track of money and made invoices easily. With the Internet, I could research stories and talk to other journalists online. 
However, working from home has some problems. I sometimes feel lonely because I do not see many people. There are also distractions at home, like chores and sharing the computer with my children. 
Many people in my neighborhood are also using computers for work. A report says that most home workers are educated and own a personal computer. I feel I am doing well with my computer skills. One day, I hope to send my articles to a newspaper in Australia or even start my own magazine from home. The possibilities are endless!"

The Tartan Museum is in Edinburgh, Scotland. It has modern buildings that look like cheese wedges. The outside of the museum is very big and easy to see. It has a tall yellow tower and a garden hanging from the roof. 
Last winter, people had different opinions about the museum's design. Some people thought it was beautiful, while others were not sure about it. Now, the inside of the museum is almost ready to open. 
The museum tells many stories about Scotland's history. It has important objects, like jewels from Mary Queen of Scots. Dr. David Clarke, who is in charge of the exhibitions, wants the museum to be fun and interesting for everyone, not just experts. He believes that the museum should show the truth about the past.
Visitors will see many displays with explanations and pictures. There are also computers to help tell the stories. The museum has many rooms that connect to each other, with light coming in from the windows. 
There is a special area for children called the Discovery Centre. A group of kids helped create this space. They wanted to have fun with the displays. The top floor has a gallery that changes every three years. It shows objects that are important to Scottish life in the twentieth century, like electric guitars and toys.
Dr. Clarke believes that objects can tell stories about the past better than anything else. The museum's modern design is nice inside, but some people wonder if it is in the right place."

The end of print newspapers may take some time. ""Transition"" is a nice word. It means moving from one place to another. Some people may be scared of change, but it can also be good. 
Now, newspapers are trying to move to the online world. This is not easy. Many people know that print newspaper sales are going down, but visits to their websites are going up. For example, newspapers like The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian have seen their print sales drop by 8% to 10% each year, but their websites are getting more visitors.
However, there are some interesting facts. A survey showed that the total number of newspapers sold around the world actually went up by 1.1% last year. In some places, like Asia, sales increased a lot. Also, news magazines are doing well, with a 5.4% increase in sales.
When it comes to books, e-readers like Kindle are very popular, and their sales are high. But when bookstores looked at the sales of physical books, they found that sales were only down by 0.4%. This means people are buying both e-books and paper books.
Many people think young people do not read newspapers anymore, but this is not true. A survey shows that nearly 5 million people aged 15 to 35 still read the main national newspapers. Different countries have different trends. In Britain, print sales have dropped by 10.8%, but in Germany, the drop is only 7%. In France, it is just 3.1%.
Some experts thought that online advertising would help newspapers, but now that advertising is going down. Many US newspapers have started to charge for online access. The best way to get readers is to offer both a print copy and online access together. Print newspapers help sell online subscriptions, and they make much more money from ads than online ads.
However, it is hard for newspapers to keep both print and online versions. It costs a lot of money and is complicated. But print newspapers are still important for getting noticed in the busy online world. 
**Questions:**
1. What does the word ""transition"" mean in the text?
2. Are print newspaper sales going up or down?
3. How much did the total number of newspapers sold around the world increase last year?

CAE_32,C1,"**Photographing People**
People are very interesting to photograph. A photo with a person is usually more exciting than one without. However, taking good photos of people can be hard. The photographer must pay attention to how people move, their gestures, and their expressions. Sometimes, just having a camera can make people act differently.
**A. Grouping People**  
When taking pictures of groups, avoid straight lines. Ask people to stand at different angles and distances. You can have some people sitting or kneeling in front so you can see all their faces.
**B. Posing for Pictures**  
People often feel stiff in front of a camera. Help them relax by suggesting they find a comfortable position, like folding their hands or putting them in their pockets.
**C. The Right Approach**  
Do not pretend you are not taking a picture when it is clear you are. This can make people feel tense. Most people will agree to have their picture taken, but they might feel shy. You may need to guide them to look at the camera.
**D. Eye Contact**  
A photo looks better if the person is looking at the camera. Ask them to look into the lens. They might not be able to do this for long, so remind them just before you take the picture. You can also say something funny to get a real reaction.
**E. Candid Concentration**  
Instead of looking directly at the camera, the person can focus on something else in the picture. This can make the photo feel more natural, as if you are watching them without them knowing.
**F. Expressions and Gestures**  
The expressions and gestures of a person tell us a lot about them. A laughing child can make us smile, while a sad face can make us feel sad. Look for common expressions like smiles, frowns, or thumbs-up.
**G. Situation Interest**  
The background of a photo can add more interest. Make sure the background does not take attention away from the person. Use a wide-angle lens to make the person look bigger compared to the background.
**H. Interaction**  
Good photos can happen when people are talking, laughing, or working together. Look for moments of connection, like eye contact or a handshake.
**I. People and Places**  
Many photos of people are taken on trips. To show both the person and the place, use a wide-angle lens and step back to include the background. Make sure the people are close enough to be seen clearly.
**J. To Pose or Not to Pose?**  
Decide why you want to take the picture. If you want to remember someone you met on holiday, ask them to pose nicely. For family photos, candid shots of events can be more fun and lively than formal poses. A spontaneous picture can bring back memories better than a posed one."
CAE_65,C1,"Under Sarah's Spell**
Sarah Janson is an artist who creates trompe-l'oeil paintings. These paintings look real but are actually tricks for the eyes. In this interview with Joanna Watt, we learn more about Sarah.
Not many artists do not sign their work, but Sarah is one of them. She believes that the work is more important than the artist. She says, ""It's not the artist who is important, but the work."" Sarah is very humble and does not like to talk about herself. When asked if she wants to be photographed, she looks worried.
After a while, Sarah feels more comfortable, and the interview becomes fun and interesting. She has been a trompe-l'oeil artist for sixteen years. Before that, she studied drawing at art school and worked in graphic illustration. She did not enjoy illustration, so she started working with a special decorator named Jim Smart. He asked her to create one trompe-l'oeil painting, and she loved it. She decided to work on her own, even though she was not sure what would happen.
Sarah's skills in observing details helped her become a good trompe-l'oeil artist. She says, ""People often ask me where they can learn trompe-l'oeil. But no one can teach you. Trompe-l'oeil is the school of life. It's all about observation."" She believes that you should always keep learning. She is honest about her weaknesses, saying, ""I can't paint bread; it always looks like grey concrete."" 
When she had a big job to paint a ceiling at Lulworth Castle, she felt confused about the measurements. She thought, ""You're not Michelangelo. Who do you think you are?"" Sarah often talks about herself in the third person, saying things like, ""When I finished that ceiling, I thought, 'Well, I didn't do it, she did.'""
Sarah's trompe-l'oeil paintings are very special. She has many important clients and creates works inspired by buildings. For example, she made a trompe-l'oeil dining room that looks like a Venetian palace. She knows that once people understand the trick, they might lose interest. So, she believes her art must do two things: first, it must trick you, and second, it must keep your attention and make you think.
Sarah loves working with her clients. She says, ""I love the interaction with clients; that is where the ideas are born."" Some clients know exactly what they want, while others do not. She listens to them and tries to understand their ideas. Many of her clients become friends because she spends a lot of time with them while working.
Sarah is thankful for her clients, saying, ""I am very grateful for the mad ones who have let me loose on their walls."" They are happy with her work, which is why she is always busy. Even though she does not like to talk about herself, she believes her work should be seen. She says, ""Like my work, I am very restrained. I don't want it to shout."" 
In the end, Sarah's art is unique and deserves more attention."
CAE_61,C1,"**Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success**
Daniel Goleman talks about the important ""people skills"" that help us succeed at work.
A. The rules for work are changing. Now, we are judged not only by how smart we are or by our training but also by how well we manage ourselves and work with others. This new way of judging is used to decide who gets hired and who does not. It helps to show who will do well at their job and who may not. These new rules are important for our future jobs. They are different from what we learned in school. Doing well in tests is not as important anymore. Now, we need to have good social skills and personal qualities, like being able to take initiative, understand others, adapt to change, and persuade people. These skills are called emotional intelligence.
B. In a time when job security is low, personal qualities are becoming more important at work. For many years, people have talked about these qualities using different names, like ""character"" or ""soft skills."" Now, we have a better understanding of these skills, and we call them ""emotional intelligence."" This means being able to understand and manage our own feelings and the feelings of others. In our work, emotional intelligence includes being aware of ourselves, controlling our emotions, staying motivated, understanding others, and having good social skills. Some people think emotional intelligence just means ""being nice,"" but it can also mean being honest, even when it is uncomfortable. It is not about showing all our feelings but managing them so we can work well together.
C. More businesses are realizing that emotional intelligence is very important for good management. The more complicated the job, the more we need emotional intelligence. If someone lacks these skills, it can make it hard for them to use their knowledge and skills. Many people have succeeded despite having low emotional intelligence, but as work becomes more complex and requires teamwork, companies that work well together have an advantage. In today’s workplace, where teamwork and good customer service are important, emotional intelligence is essential for doing well in any job.
D. Unlike IQ, which does not change much, emotional intelligence can grow as we live and learn. Studies show that most people get better at managing their emotions, motivating themselves, and understanding others over time. This growth in emotional intelligence is called maturity. We can learn these skills and use them to help us in our jobs, especially now when having a stable job is not easy. Emotional intelligence is not a magic solution for companies, but if we ignore the human side of work, nothing else will work as well."
CAE_52,C1,"'Should the media make money from content they do not own? Digital cameras and camera phones make it easy to take pictures of news events. Social media has changed how people share these pictures. Now, some journalists look at social media for images when news happens quickly. However, some reporters use pictures from users without asking for permission. There are rules that say images on social media can be used without permission in special cases or if there is strong public interest, but people still argue about whether this is right. Research shows that about one in ten people would take pictures or videos of a news event, so user-generated content (UGC) is important for the future of the media. To keep a good relationship with the public, the media should make sure that people are paid for their work and that they always ask for permission.'"

Acupuncture is a type of medicine that is over two thousand years old. It comes from China and is part of traditional Chinese medicine. This system also includes using herbs, massage, diet, and exercise. Acupuncture is often used to help with pain. Many doctors, midwives, and physiotherapists in the West use it for pain relief.

They say that energy, called Qi (pronounced ""chee""), flows in the body along paths called meridians. There are twelve main meridians connected to organs in the body. If the flow of Qi is blocked or weak, a person may feel weak or sick. An acupuncturist checks the flow of Qi by feeling pulses on your wrist, looking at your tongue, and asking about your health, eating, and sleeping habits. They use very thin needles to help the Qi flow better.
**B. Acupuncture Points**  
Acupuncture points are connected to the meridians and may not be near where you feel pain. People often feel a gentle ache or tingling when the needle is used. This can be done by hand or with a machine. Acupuncturists say this feeling means the needle is working.
**C. Scientific Explanations**  
Doctors in the West believe acupuncture can help with pain, even if they do not follow traditional Chinese medicine. They think that acupuncture can block pain signals or release natural pain-relieving substances in the body.
**D. Types of Pain Treated**  
Many people with long-term pain try acupuncture when other treatments do not work. It can help with back pain, sports injuries, arthritis, headaches, and pain after surgery. Acupuncturists also say it can help with menstrual pain and pain in terminally ill patients.
**E. Modern Use of Acupuncture**  
Acupuncture has been used in China for over 2,000 years, but using it instead of anesthesia during surgery started in the 1950s. This helped some doctors outside China believe in acupuncture. In China today, acupuncture is used in many surgeries, and it can help reduce pain. Some people recover from surgery faster with acupuncture.
**F. Effectiveness of Acupuncture**  
It is hard to study acupuncture, but some trials show that 50 to 80 percent of people find it helps with chronic pain. Acupuncturists say it usually takes six to seven visits to feel real relief, but some people feel better after just two or three visits.
**G. A Different Way to Look at Pain**  
Western and Chinese medicine see pain differently. Acupuncturists look at the whole person, not just the pain. They spend time understanding the pain and what might be causing it, like weather or how it feels. This is different from how many doctors approach pain.
**H. Choosing an Acupuncturist**  
Some doctors have training in traditional acupuncture, while others use scientific methods. Traditional acupuncturists believe their methods can lead to better healing. It is important to choose a good acupuncturist, and they should refer you to a doctor if needed."

P.D. James is a famous crime writer. Her full name is Phyllis Dorothy James. She seems calm and confident, but she is actually shy. She says that Adam Dalgliesh, the detective in her books, is like her if she were a man. Dalgliesh likes to solve crimes alone, just like P.D. James likes to write alone. She needs quiet time to write and can do it anywhere if she has privacy.
P.D. James does not agree that she is the best crime writer in Britain, even though many people read her 12 detective novels. She loves the books of her friend Ruth Rendell, especially those written under the name Barbara Vine. She also enjoys books by women writers like Iris Murdoch and Anita Brookner, but she likes some male authors too, like Graham Greene.
P.D. James became successful later in life. She was 42 when her first book, Cover Her Face, was published. She was born in Oxford and grew up in Cambridge. She met her husband there, who was a student. Life was not easy for her. Her husband, Connor, was very sick after the Second World War. P.D. James had to work hard to support him and their two daughters, Clare and Jane. Her husband’s parents helped take care of the girls during this tough time.
While working for the National Health Service, she used her good organizational skills. She managed five clinics. Then, she worked for 11 years at the Home Office, first in the Police Department and then in juvenile crime. While working in forensic science, she saw many dead bodies, but she was not interested in death itself. She liked the challenge of writing crime stories. 
P.D. James did not want to write about her own life. She thought writing detective stories was a good way to learn how to write serious novels. She realized that she could follow the rules of a detective story and still write a meaningful book about people. She believes that solving a crime brings order to chaos and shows that life is important, even if it is not perfect."

The pen is stronger than the psychoanalyst. The study of handwriting to show a person's character is becoming more popular. If you apply for a job in some countries, you will likely be asked to give a sample of your handwriting. This handwriting can help decide if you are right for the job. Handwriting analysis, or graphology, is seen as a real science in many places. Researchers say it can help show some illnesses, like heart disease and cancer, and can show emotional problems.
Many big companies now use graphologists to look at the handwriting of people who want important jobs. However, many doctors and psychiatrists are not sure about the value of graphology. Patricia Marne, a professional graphologist for over 20 years, thinks they should take it more seriously. She believes handwriting can show psychological traits and some medical conditions. She says, ""Handwriting can show social class and intelligence. It can also help decide if a person should focus on arts or sciences and if they are honest or tricky.""
According to Ms. Marne, graphology can help find possible criminal behavior. She says, ""Criminals often have bad handwriting. Many come from difficult backgrounds and have emotional problems. This can show in childish handwriting and in writing letters many times."" She believes she can tell if people are honest or not. 
Ms. Marne says handwriting can show if someone is under a lot of stress or has violent thoughts. It can even help predict if someone might think about suicide. Heart and lung problems can also be seen in handwriting. She explains, ""You cannot make a diagnosis from one sample, unless the writing is very shaky. But if the handwriting changes over time, it could mean something serious is happening.""
A big emotional problem can also change a person's signature for a short time. Ms. Marne says handwriting can show other psychological traits. For example, people who write with letters that connect are often clever and tricky. Those who write mostly in capital letters may be hiding their true selves. Light pressure in writing shows sensitivity. Original handwriting shows confidence and creativity. Disconnected writing shows a person who is lonely. Very small signatures can mean a person feels shy or inferior. 
Ms. Marne says it takes six years of study to analyze handwriting well, and this needs empathy and intuition. She believes more research is needed to make graphology a real science. She thinks it is more accurate than psychoanalysis because it can show a person's history and emotional problems without asking them questions.
However, there is not much strong evidence to support these ideas. Some psychiatrists are very critical. They say handwriting is just a result of education and the way people are taught to write, and it does not mean anything else."

Is your office working well? Fresh air and good chairs are important for a happy and healthy workplace, according to a new survey. We visited four different offices to see how healthy and happy they are. We had three experts with us: a building health consultant, an ergonomist (who studies working conditions), and an occupational psychologist. Here are their opinions.
**Office A: Advertising Agency**  
*Building Health Consultant:* This office is very simple. It has no central heating and no mechanical ventilation. The windows open to the street. It is surprising that this office works well, but the small team of seven people seems happy. They change the office temperature by opening doors or using electric heaters, just like at home. This may be the reason they are happy.  
*Ergonomist:* The furniture does not match. Some chairs are old and broken, and they do not help good posture. However, the workers have different tasks, like meeting clients and making presentations. This variety helps them avoid tiredness and boredom.  
*Occupational Psychologist:* The staff likes the different types of work and the office space. They say the office is ""just the right size"" – small enough to know what others are doing, but big enough to work alone. The office looks nice and fun, and it feels efficient and creative.
**Office B: News Service**  
*Building Health Consultant:* This office is not very exciting, but it is comfortable. The air quality is good, and there is a No Smoking policy.  
*Ergonomist:* The company has good chairs and lighting. The space is okay, but the layout could be better. The walls are plain and dull.  
*Occupational Psychologist:* The walls have only a few planners and a poster about maternity rights. Most staff have worked there for at least five years, and they get along well. The office could be better if the desks were arranged to share information more easily.
**Office C: Bank**  
*Building Health Consultant:* This office gets mixed feelings from workers. It feels like being in a glass box. The air is not stale, even with smokers nearby.  
*Ergonomist:* The office is very standard and not inspiring. The desks are okay, but some chairs are not good for computer work.  
*Occupational Psychologist:* The staff helps each other and uses technology well. There are many awards on display. The office is busy, but the colors make it feel a bit dark.
**Office D: Newspaper**  
*Building Health Consultant:* This office has many problems. The air conditioning does not work well, and the temperature changes a lot. The space is messy, and there is not enough desk space. It is very dusty.  
*Ergonomist:* The furniture is not good for a modern office. Many chairs are old and do not help workers who are shorter.  
*Occupational Psychologist:* The office has old chairs and dirty carpets. It needs cleaning and better air conditioning. There are many smokers. When we visited, people seemed stressed and were not talking much. The company should encourage teamwork."
CAE_38,C1,"**Chewing Gum Culture**
Chewing gum is popular in America. People chew 12 million sticks of gum every day. It is a simple food and must follow rules from the American Food and Drug Administration. Each stick of gum has less than ten calories. 
Today, most gum is made with synthetic materials. These materials help keep the flavor and make the gum soft. Long ago, the ancient Greeks chewed a gum-like substance from the mastic tree, which grows in Greece and Turkey. Women in Greece used mastic gum to clean their teeth and make their breath fresh. 
American colonists learned to chew gum from the Native Americans in New England. They chewed resin from spruce trees. In the early 1800s, people in the eastern United States sold spruce gum. This was the first commercial chewing gum in America. 
Modern chewing gum started in the late 1860s when people discovered chicle. Chicle is a milky substance from the sapodilla tree in Central America. Gum made from chicle is smoother and more elastic. This created a big industry for chewing gum. However, it is hard to grow sapodilla trees, so many gum makers now use synthetic materials instead.
Today, there are few chicle gatherers, called chicleros. They work hard to collect chicle from trees. They walk for miles in hot and humid conditions. There are dangerous snakes and insects in the forest. Chicleros climb trees to collect the white sap and carry it back to a camp. At the camp, they boil the sap until it becomes sticky and forms bricks. 
Life at the camp is tough. Chicleros eat a simple diet of maize and drink local alcohol made from sugar cane. Even though their work is hard, chicleros worry about their jobs. Not long ago, the United States imported 7,000 tonnes of chicle each year from Central America. Last year, only 200 tonnes were collected in Mexico's Yucatan peninsula.
As chewing gum sales have increased, manufacturers have started using synthetic materials to save money. Gum makers also find new ways to sell their products. They say that chewing gum helps you relax, gives you energy, and reduces tooth decay. Chewing gum can help your saliva flow, which protects your teeth. 
Research is ongoing to create new textures and flavors for gum. Some new flavors are artificial, but some still use natural ingredients. In America, a large area is used to grow mint for the two most popular chewing gums in the world."

My favorite hotel is the Hermitage Hotel on New Zealand's South Island. I found it by chance while climbing. After climbing a glacier, I walked down and was surprised to see the hotel in beautiful countryside. It is very high up and surrounded by nature. After a long climb, it was amazing to find such luxury, with a man playing music on the piano.
C. **MAURITIUS - PARADIS HOTEL**  
The Paradis Hotel is on a quiet peninsula in the south-west of Mauritius. The road to the hotel goes along the coast with empty beaches. The hotel is big and offers free water sports, but you can find peace on the nine kilometers of private beach. If you swim a little way out into the ocean, you can hardly see the hotel. In the evening, when everyone is gone, it feels very calm and far away from everything.

Sue Brown is a hotel inspector. She checks hotels to see if they are good. Christopher Middleton watched her work. One minute into her visit to the Globe Hotel, things are already not good. The receptionist is talking on the phone and does not see Sue and Christopher. Sue says, ""She hasn’t even looked at us. This is very bad."" 
Sue has been an inspector for 11 years. She expects better from the Globe Hotel because it has three red stars. This means it is one of the best hotels. But even before they enter, Sue feels something is wrong. The door from the parking lot is not manned, and the hallway is long and empty. 
When they finally get to the reception, the receptionist says, ""We have no record of your booking."" There are 15 rooms in the hotel, but 12 are empty. One room is on the top floor, but it is not good. It is stuffy, and there is a big hole in the wall behind the wardrobe. 
Sue remembers when she started her job. People called her ""The Woman in Black,"" but she never wore black and did not think she was tough. The next morning, after paying her bill, she tells the hotel manager, Robin Greaves, who looks scared. He apologizes for a bad smell in the lounge. He says, ""We think there is a blocked drain."" 
Sue suggests that he should not let guests go into the room with the bad smell. She says it is better to take them to another lounge. Robin agrees and takes notes. He has worked at the Globe for only five months and is trying to understand Sue's advice. 
Not everything is bad. Sue praises Emma, the assistant manager, and Trudy, the waitress, for their good work. The dinner is also good, so the hotel keeps its two-rosette food rating. Robin asks, ""What do we need to do to get three rosettes?"" Sue replies, ""Do not serve a dessert that falls apart."" 
Sue's job is to tell the hotel what is wrong. Sometimes, people complain about her. She remembers a woman who said Sue got her son fired. Sue only told the truth: the son served her pie with his fingers. 
Sue must write a report about her visit. The hotels pay for her to help them improve. It is good for Robin to hear that Sue will not take away the Globe's red stars. The bad news is that another inspector will come back in two months to check if the problems are fixed. Robin smiles but looks worried. ""We will look forward to that,"" he says.

Doug Scott is a mountaineer who writes about climbing the highest mountains on each continent, called the Seven Summits. He started this journey later in his life. Here are his climbs:
A. **Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)**  
Doug and his climbing partner, Dougal Haston, were in a snow cave before reaching the top. They talked about sleeping bags, which Doug thought was strange because they were alone. He felt cold and worried about frostbite. Doug felt calm and confident because Dougal was with him. He found a good rhythm to reach the summit.
B. **Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)**  
This mountain is very dangerous. In April 1976, Doug and Dougal carried their equipment to the base. They realized the climb was hard. They followed a route from 1967 but chose a new route to the top. They carried everything on their backs. After three days, they were tired and cold. Finally, they reached the summit and felt happy.
C. **Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m)**  
In September 1976, Doug and his friend Paul flew to Nairobi to climb Mt. Kenya. Instead, they got a free ride to Kilimanjaro. They got lost in the jungle and had trouble finding water. They were happy to find a rock pool. They tried to climb a steep wall but decided to take a safer route to the top.
D. **Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)**  
In January 1992, Doug and his wife, Sharu, arrived at Punta del Inca. They met a guide named Phil who invited them to climb a different route. After waiting for bad weather to pass, they started climbing. The wind was strong, but they reached the summit and camped nearby. They met a group planning to climb the Seven Summits, and Doug thought about doing the same.
E. **Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)**  
Doug learned that climbing Vinson Massif was possible if he guided enough people. In November 1992, his team traveled to the South Pole. The sun was always shining, and it was very quiet. On December 7, they climbed to the summit in strong winds and very cold temperatures. They were happy but could not see much because of the storm.
F. **Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)**  
In the summer of 1994, Doug's team met in St Petersburg. They took a cable car to a high point on Elbrus. After two days, they climbed in strong winds and icy conditions. They thought they reached the top but found there was more to climb. They returned to their camp and then went down the mountain.
G. **Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)**  
On this climb, Doug wanted to explore a new route and meet the local Dani people. They were warned about dangers but decided to go. On May 12, they climbed and reached the summit by 11 am. Doug felt proud to complete his seventh summit.

The Merrion Hotel is a new five-star hotel in Dublin. It was made from four old houses and took almost two years to build. The hotel has modern technology to help both the staff and the guests.
The General Manager, Peter MacCann, wants his staff to know the guests' names. For special details about the guests, he uses a computer system. This system helps the hotel give good service to returning guests. It cost £250,000 to set up, but it will save money in the future. MacCann likes how well it works. For example, if a guest asks for certain music during their first stay, the hotel will have that music ready for them when they come back.
Many hotel guests often complain about room temperature. The hotel has a system that lets guests change the temperature in their rooms. They can set it between 14°C and 25°C. 
The hotel also has special technology for business guests. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that can also copy and print, and a video-conferencing system. The hotel is ready for new technology, so they have extra cables for future upgrades. They rent televisions and DVD recorders, so they can change them for newer models when needed.
Even with all this technology, the hotel wants guests to feel comfortable. There are 145 large and cozy bedrooms. The hotel also has a swimming pool, a gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a lovely garden.
The food at the hotel is very good. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, who has two Michelin stars, moved his restaurant to the Merrion. He has made a new kitchen and improved the restaurant.

There are two long flower beds along a path in the garden. The colors and shapes of the flowers are very nice. The previous owners of the garden were good gardeners. They left many plants that Susan likes. She also kept the gardener, Danny. Susan says, ""It was really his garden."" At first, Danny did not like some of Susan's ideas. But when she said she wanted to paint them, he understood.
Susan likes to paint individual flowers instead of the whole garden. Sometimes she picks flowers and takes them to her studio. She does not paint everything at once. She takes one flower, paints it for a few days, and then takes another flower. Sometimes it can take a couple of years to finish a painting.
Spring and early summer are her busiest times. This is when the tulips and poppies bloom. Susan loves how flowers change over time. For example, when she puts tulips in water, they change shape and look beautiful. At first, they may seem boring, but they become interesting.
Susan has always liked plants. She studied botany in school and collected wildflowers. She did not like garden flowers because they looked fake to her. She liked wildflowers that grew in difficult places, like rocks or cliffs.
Now, her garden has many plants from different countries. They grow well in her garden. Susan is relaxed about her garden, like a kind aunt who lets children play as long as they do not break anything. 
Susan is busy preparing for two art exhibitions. She has a lot of flowers to paint, but she finds it hard to work in the garden. She now has another gardener to help her. However, she knows that to paint flowers well, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""

Many trees in Brackham were damaged in the big storms in March. The town lost two big lime trees from the old market square. This change made the town look very different, and some people were not happy about it. One of these people was Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, who was the head of the local police. But during the storm, Pelham was very sick with bronchitis. He had a headache and felt tightness in his chest. His wife, Molly, wanted him to see a doctor, but he thought he was too important to go. He tried to keep working, but this made him forget things and made him angry.
Finally, his colleague, Sergeant Lloyd, took him to the doctor. Pelham was too weak to argue. Soon, he got medicine and went home to Molly, who sent him to bed. On Thursday morning, Molly told him that the walnut tree in their garden had fallen during the night. Pelham was too sick to understand. Later, he asked if the house was damaged. When he learned it was not, he felt relieved and went back to bed.
On Saturday, when the medicine started to work, Pelham got up and saw that the living room looked very different without the walnut tree. Their big house had a nice garden, and Pelham was happy he bought it. The garden made them feel private. Before, the walnut tree made the living room look nice with light and shadows. But now, without the tree, the room was too bright, and the old furniture looked bad. 
The view from the window was not nice either. The tall house next door, which was hidden by the tree, was now visible. It had ugly purple bricks and many windows that seemed to watch the Pelhams. 
“Doesn’t it look terrible?” Pelham said to Molly. But Molly, standing in the doorway, seemed happy. “I’ve been saying this since we moved here. We need to buy a new sofa, no matter the cost.”"
FCE_16,B2,"Living in the Valley**
We had lived in our valley for sixteen months when we first saw the dangers in the hills around us. It was the year when the storms came early, before winter started. Until then, we felt safe in our valley below the hills. Soon, snow began to fall. In one day, it was about 15 centimeters deep. It almost blocked our road and made the path by the stream slippery and dangerous. 
In the hills, the snow was much deeper and stayed longer. The wind was very strong up there. In our valley, we felt only some strong gusts of wind; the trees moved, but their branches stayed strong. We knew we should worry. The snow and wind were annoying, but they did not really scare us. The river, called the Ryburn, which usually flowed gently, was what worried us the most. It reminded us of what could happen if the water from the hills was not controlled by dams.
Soon, the snow started to melt. Day by day, we saw dark clouds gather over the hills. These clouds looked dangerous and warned us of what was coming. We watched the river, which was getting fuller and wilder. The snow melted as more rain fell from the clouds, but the reservoir in the hills was filling up and getting close to overflowing.
Then it happened - for the first time in years, the reservoir overflowed. It was like a small waterfall as the water rushed over the dam and into the stream below. The river looked wild as the water rushed down towards our cottage. Just a few meters from our home, the stream was deeper than we had ever seen, moving quickly against its banks. For three days, we hoped it would stay below the dam. Luckily, the dam held, and the water began to go down.
In the past, before the dam was built, the river had flooded nearby villages many times. Now, the dam controls the river, and usually everything is fine. The water from the hills, from snow and heavy rain, stays behind the dam, with just a little overflow sometimes. Because of this protection, we can enjoy the big clouds over the valley and feel safe in our home."

Film critic Mark Adams thinks about his work over the last ten years for a newspaper called The Front Page. Writing articles about films for The Front Page was his first real job. Before this, he wrote reviews for books in other newspapers, films for a magazine, and did some work for the radio. This is how he met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page. Tom also worked in radio and television. He hired Mark, but Tom was not a full-time journalist, so he did not choose his staff carefully.
At first, Tom wanted a team of critics to cover different art forms like books, TV, theatre, film, and radio. They would have a lunch every week to talk about what to write about. It felt like a dream for Mark to be part of a new newspaper. He thought it was strange that a new paper could start in a busy market. He even thought a rich person was helping him and pretending to hire him. The first time he saw someone reading his review in the newspaper on the London Underground, he felt very shy.
Tom's idea for a team of critics did not work out. They did not meet as planned, so they talked by phone instead. Mark found that people liked to read reviews from critics who focused on one subject. So, he chose to write about films. Without Tom's help, they would not have the current way of working, where Mark writes a long article each week about one film. He likes this way of working. He did not want to be a standard film critic who has to watch every new film. That would make him tired and unhappy.
Mark thinks about his role as a critic. He believes people choose films based on stars, ads, or the director. People usually stick to what they like. Someone who does not like westerns is unlikely to watch one just because of a review. So, if a film review is not a guide for buying tickets, what is it? Mark does not feel he must be ""right"" about a movie. He does not think there should be a set number of ""great"" or ""bad"" films each year. His job is to share his opinion. He does not want to be a judge."

Melanie Sears is a teenager who loves sports. She is looking for a training partner for triathlons, especially a girl. She wants someone who enjoys running long distances (15 kilometers), swimming in cold water, and cycling long distances (100 kilometers). It is important to be able to do all three sports without taking a break.
Triathlons are becoming very popular in the Olympics. Many people watch athletes swim 1500 meters, cycle 40 kilometers, and then run 10 kilometers without stopping. It looks hard, but Melanie enjoys it. She started doing triathlons when she was 14 years old. 
In her first triathlon, she won the junior section, but she was the only junior there. She felt confident and entered the National Championships. She swam fast and ran fast, but she got lost and cycled 20 kilometers too far. She cried while running, but she did not give up. She wants to keep trying.
Melanie is very determined. She trains hard, even when it is difficult. She was the top junior in the European Triathlon Championships this year, finishing 13th. She is working hard to improve her cycling because she is slower at it than swimming and running. 
Melanie is asking her parents to buy a new bike for her trip to New Zealand for the World Championships. The bike costs £2,000, but there is a special deal. 
Her training takes a lot of time, so she does not have a social life. She says, ""I don't go to parties. After swimming for two hours, I just want to sleep."" But she still talks to the other girls on her team about their training times.
Melanie has tried shorter triathlons, like the ""sprint,"" where you swim 750 meters, cycle 20 kilometers, and run 5 kilometers. She wants to try even harder events, but she has no one her age to train with. 
**Questions:**
1. What sports does Melanie do in a triathlon?
2. How old was Melanie when she started doing triathlons?
3. What happened when Melanie entered the National Championships?
4. Why does Melanie not have a social life?
5. What does Melanie want to improve in her training?"
FCE_70,B2,"The Collectors**
Amanda Roy writes about collecting things and why many people enjoy this hobby. I have always loved collecting, and one in three adults collects something. Collecting is a world of passion and joy. But if you want to collect, remember this: only collect things you love.
People have collected items for a long time. Long ago, early humans collected pebbles and wore them as necklaces. They liked the shapes and colors of the pebbles. Today, children still collect stones and seashells because they are beautiful.
I have collected many things in my life, from flowers like tulips to pottery and paintings. My first collection was stones from my parents' garden. When I was six, I went to a school in a cold, windy place in England. When my parents visited, they took me to a local museum. The museum had many interesting objects collected by people in the past. I loved looking at these objects. 
Many adults also enjoy collecting. Some people collect because it is the only part of their lives where they feel in control. For me, I just enjoy it. One famous collector was the Duc de Berry in France. He had a ""room of wonders"" with many strange and beautiful items. Another collector, Catherine the Great of Russia, had more than 4,000 paintings. 
You do not need to be rich to start a collection. I have collected many different things, like tulip bulbs and china cups. I remember when I convinced another collector to give me a special tulip. I planted it and took care of it, but one year it disappeared – stolen by another collector. 
I once collected 350 American rag dolls. I searched all over the USA for them. Sadly, my collection was destroyed when my house caught fire. The next morning, I looked at the remains of my home and felt very sad.
I find it interesting how collections change hands. A silver spoon that belonged to a king or a poet can be very valuable. As small items become popular, their prices go up. For example, toys from the 1950s are now worth a lot, especially if you still have the original boxes. (I threw away the boxes and the toys!)"
FCE_3,B2,"My Line of Work**
Four people talk about their jobs.
**Lisa - Exhibition Programmes Organiser, Science Museum**  
I put together temporary exhibitions. This means I plan and design the exhibition and tell people about it. I read about the subject of the exhibition and talk to important people to find out the main ideas. I decide what objects and pictures to show. I make sure the public can understand the exhibition. I plan activities like workshops and shows. I also work with engineers and electricians to keep visitors safe. Before the exhibition opens, I help create brochures and leaflets to inform people.
**Janet - Teacher of London Taxi Drivers**  
I start my day at 7:30 a.m. by checking the accounts. Then, I see what new maps and documents we need for the taxi-driver test. By midday, about 50 students are in school, learning the best routes to take. I help when there are disagreements, like if a right turn is allowed at a junction. When students are close to the test, I give them a simple route. I tell them they must find another way if the road is closed. This helps them think.
**Sarah - Marine Conservationist**  
I live by the coast and work from home. I answer phone calls, create educational materials, and set up training courses. Sometimes, I go to our main office, but I usually work by the sea. I work with schools and run courses for people who manage the coast. I take them out to sea in a boat to help them understand the life in the ocean. This often changes their views. I love my job because conservation is my hobby. However, I work for a charity, so I always need to find more money and resources.
**Chris - Map and Atlas Publisher**  
My job is varied. I make sure our publishing program meets market needs and keep about 300 books in stock. We have high standards for information and content. We get many letters from readers about things like international boundaries, and I must respond carefully. I discuss future projects and sales with my co-publishers. I work with a great team, which makes the job enjoyable. The downside is that there is too much administration, which takes time away from more interesting tasks like product development and design."

We always went to Ireland in June. Since we started going on holidays together, we spent the first two weeks of June at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. It is a big house by the sea, not far from the village of Ardbeag. The English couple who own the house, the Malseeds, have made some changes to it, but they did it carefully. Strafe found Glencorn for us. He saw an advertisement when the Malseeds were still advertising. 
""How about this?"" he said one evening and read the details. The summer before, we went to a hotel that friends recommended, but it was not good because the food was terrible. The four of us have been playing cards together for a long time: Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia, and me. They call me Milly, but my real name is Dorothy Milson. Dekko got his nickname at school. He and Strafe were in the same school, which is why we call Strafe by his last name. We are all about the same age and live close to the town where the Malseeds lived before moving to Ireland. 
""How nice,"" Mrs. Malseed said, smiling to welcome us again this year. She seems to know when guests are coming because she is usually waiting in the hall that smells of flowers. ""Arthur, take the luggage up,"" she told the old porter. She called our rooms by names: Rose, Tulip, Lily, and Geranium. Mrs. Malseed painted flowers on the doors instead of using numbers. In winter, when few people come to Glencorn Lodge, she takes care of small details like that; her husband takes care of repairs. 
""Welcome,"" Mr. Malseed said, coming into the hall from the kitchen. He was smiling, making us feel special. Everyone smiled, and I could tell the others felt our holiday had really started. Nothing had changed at Glencorn; everything was good. Kitty from the dining room came out to greet us. ""You look younger every year,"" she said, making everyone laugh again. 
Arthur took us to our rooms, carrying as much luggage as he could and coming back for the rest. After dinner, we played cards for a while but not for too long because we were still tired from the trip. In the lounge, there was a man alone and a French couple. There were other people at dinner because Glencorn Lodge is always full in June. From our table by the window, we could see some people walking on the lawns and others going down to the beach. 
In the morning, we would walk along the beach to Ardbeag and have coffee at the hotel there, then return for lunch. In the afternoon, we would drive somewhere. I knew this because we had done the same things for many years. Since we first came here, we all fell in love with the beautiful landscape."

Sarah Sutherland-Pilch is a chalet girl in Val d'Isere, France. She is 24 years old and comes from West Sussex. Sarah works for a company that helps visitors who come to ski and stay in wooden houses called chalets. This is her second year as a chalet girl.
Sarah studied French and History of Art at university. She says being a chalet girl is not a long-term job, but it is a fun way to spend a year or two. She meets many interesting people every week.
Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to work. The chalet can have up to 18 guests each week. She eats her breakfast first, then makes breakfast for the guests. They have porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants. After breakfast, she cleans up and either makes afternoon tea or cleans the rooms, which she thinks is the worst part of her job. By 11 a.m., she is ready to ski. On good days, she can ski until 4:30 p.m.
After skiing, Sarah goes back to the chalet to prepare dinner. Dinner is served at 8 p.m., and coffee is ready by 10 p.m. After dinner, she cleans the kitchen. Sometimes she talks with the guests, but other times they want to be alone. Good guests can make her week better, but some weeks are not as good.
Sarah lives in the chalet with her friends. They go out at about 11 p.m. They usually start at a place called Bananas, then go to G Jay's and maybe Dick's T-Bar. But on Saturday nights, she does not stay out too late because Sunday is her busiest day.
On Sunday, she starts work early. Breakfast for guests leaving has to be ready by 7 a.m. After the guests leave, she cleans quickly. If she did not shop for food on Saturday, she does it now. By 3 p.m., she finishes cleaning and prepares tea for the new guests who arrive around 4:30 p.m. Sometimes the new guests have many questions.
Between tea and dinner, Sarah helps guests who need ski boots or skis. She gets a ride back to the chalet from the ski shop staff. Then it is time for dinner again. Sometimes she has a drink after work, but if she is too tired, she goes to bed early."

Miss Rita Cohen was a small girl with pale skin. She looked much younger than Seymour's daughter, Marie, but she said she was six years older. One day, she came to Seymour's factory. She wore overalls and big shoes, and her hair was messy but framed her pretty face. Seymour was surprised that she was studying at the University of Pennsylvania and doing research about the leather industry in New Jersey for her Master's degree.
A few times a year, someone would call or write to Seymour to ask if they could visit his factory. Sometimes, he would help students by answering their questions on the phone or giving them a short tour if they seemed serious. Rita was very small, like the children from Marie's class who visited the factory years ago. Seymour showed them how he made gloves, especially at the laying-off table, where the men shaped and pressed each glove using hot brass hands. Marie called them the ""pancake hands"" because they looked strange.
Rita asked, ""How many pieces come in a shipment?"" Seymour replied, ""Between twenty and twenty-five thousand."" She took notes and asked, ""Do they come to your shipping department?"" He explained, ""They come to the tannery. We buy the material, and they make it ready for us. My grandfather, father, and I worked in the tannery here in town. Have you ever been inside a tannery?"" Rita said, ""Not yet."" Seymour said, ""You should go if you want to write about leather. I can help you visit one. They are old places. The technology is better now, but it is still similar to what it was hundreds of years ago. It is hard work. Tanning is one of the oldest industries. They found 6,000-year-old tools for tanning in Turkey. The first clothes were made from animal skins that were tanned by smoking.""
Seymour continued, ""My father knows a lot about leather. You should talk to him. He can talk for two days about gloves. Glovemen love their work. Have you ever seen anything being made, Miss Cohen?"" Rita replied, ""I can't say I have."" Seymour asked, ""Never seen anything made?"" She said, ""I saw my mother make a cake when I was a child."" Seymour laughed. He liked her spirit and eagerness to learn. His daughter was much taller than Rita, but Rita reminded him of Marie. 
He remembered how Marie would come home from school, full of what she learned. She wrote everything down in her notebook and remembered it all. Seymour said, ""Let's do something fun. We will show you how to make a pair of gloves from start to finish. What size do you wear?"""

**Is it a tough job?** Chris Arnot asks four people with dream jobs if they are as great as they seem.
**A. Raquel Graham**  
Raquel Graham calls from a taxi on her way to the airport. She cannot meet us tomorrow because her boss wants her in Los Angeles. As a personal assistant to a pop star, she travels a lot. Raquel loves her job and gets along well with her boss. But there is one small problem - she does not like flying. ""On a nine-hour flight to California, I usually take sleeping pills to help me relax,"" she says. Her worst experience was flying on Concorde. ""It felt so small with those tiny windows."" When she is not traveling, she works in offices in Manchester and London. She does some boring tasks like organizing schedules, attending meetings, and making travel plans. She did not apply for this job. She met the manager of a pop group by chance and took a secretarial course at night. Five years later, she became a personal assistant.
**B. David Brown**  
David Brown has worked as an accountant and a golf caddy, which means he carries a golfer's bags. He prefers being a caddy because he loves golf. However, there are some problems. He earns a small flat fee and a part of the winnings. He usually makes between £25,000 and £35,000, but much of that goes to travel and hotels. He was 31 when he first caddied for golfer Greg Norman. ""You are not just carrying bags. You give advice and try to understand the course,"" he says. His skills in accounting were noticed by European Tour Productions, and they made him a statistical data administrator. He collects and analyzes the statistics of each day's play, which are important for TV commentators, golf magazines, and the golfers.
**C. Martin Fern**  
Martin Fern is the editor of the 'Food and Drink' pages of a daily newspaper. One of his easier tasks is to try food in the best restaurants. What does he think about expensive restaurants? ""If people can pay, it is their choice,"" he says. ""I would rather spend £120 on a meal I will remember than buy a microwave."" His friend, who was an editor, offered him a food column because he is a good cook. At that time, Martin was working in advertising and it helped him earn extra money. He was 42 when another newspaper offered him a full-time job. ""It meant I would earn less money,"" he says. ""But it was a chance to turn my passion into a job."" He still cooks at home and tries to stay healthy by cycling to the nearest tube station.
**D. Dick Prince**  
""I started writing children's stories about 20 years ago,"" says Dick Prince, a popular children's writer in Britain. ""Before that, I loved words and wrote poems. Then I had an idea for a story. I was a farmer and knew about chickens being killed by a fox. So, I wrote a story called The Fox Busters, which was my first published children's story."" Where do his ideas come from? ""It is not easy; I have to work hard on them,"" he says. ""I usually do this in the mornings. I do not wake up very early. After lunch, I spend a couple of hours typing what I wrote in the morning. I use an old typewriter, not a laptop. I get 50 to 100 letters a week, and I enjoy that part of being a writer. I try to answer them all, but now I have some help."""

In the lumberyard by the lake, there was an old two-story brick building. Around the building, there were big piles of soft sawdust. The sawdust looked like golden mountains and covered the yard down to the blue lake. 
One afternoon, Michael and his friends were bored. They followed Michael up the ladder to the roof of the old building. They sat with their legs hanging over the edge, looking at the lake. Suddenly, Michael said, ""I dare you to jump down."" Without thinking, he jumped off the roof and landed in the sawdust. He rolled around and laughed. ""I dare you all!"" he shouted. ""You're all cowards!"" 
His friends looked down from the roof, scared. But one by one, they jumped down and landed in the sawdust, smiling with relief. In the warm sunlight, they lay on the sawdust pile and told jokes. Then one friend said, ""Let’s go back up to the roof and jump down again."" 
They were not very excited, but they went back up. They jumped off the roof one by one until only Michael was left. The others were down below, smiling and calling, ""Come on, Mike. What’s wrong with you?"" 
Michael wanted to jump down too, but he stayed on the edge of the roof, feeling nervous. He tried to count to ten and then jump, but he couldn’t. His friends started to laugh at him. They were tired of waiting, and it was almost dinnertime. ""Come on, you’re a coward! Do you think we will sit here all night?"" they shouted. When he did not move, they began to walk away, still shouting. 
Michael felt sad and alone. He stared at the ground for a long time. He stayed on the roof while the sun went down. His clothes were wet from sweating. Finally, he closed his eyes and jumped off the roof. He fell into the sawdust and lay there for a long time. The yard was quiet because the workers had gone home. 
As he lay there, he wondered why he could not jump before. Then he got up slowly and walked home, feeling ashamed. He was late for dinner. His stepmother said, ""You should be able to get home on time. If you won’t come home, you can stay out tonight."" She was a strong woman with soft skin and a little grey in her hair. She looked serious, but Michael did not really hear her. He was still thinking about his friends laughing at him."
FCE_44,B2,"**Careers Advice**
Are you unhappy in your job? Do you want to change but don’t know how? Kitty Doherty has some good advice. Many people who want to change their job go to a careers adviser. First, you write a short history of yourself. Then, you take some tests called 'psychometrics'. After the tests, you get a summary of the results and suggestions for different careers and any training you might need.
I tried Career Analysts, a big organization that gives career advice. Taking the careers test felt like being back in school. I was with about ten other people, and we had to answer questions quickly. I reminded myself that it was not about passing or failing. The tests were hard to understand. They included finding mistakes in lists of names and numbers and matching similar shapes. After the tests, I talked with an adviser. He gave me a report with his thoughts and suggestions. I agreed with most of what he said, but I was a bit sad to learn that I did not do well in the science and technical tests. I am glad I did not become a nurse! However, it was good to hear that I made the right choices about journalism.
Changing your career does not always mean a big change. Last March, Donna Laney, 25, lost her job as a marketing manager after five years. Her friends told her to go to Career Analysts for help. She said, ""Losing my job was a good chance to think about my career. I wanted to look at my skills and interests."" Some results surprised her. ""I didn’t know I was good at design. But I had to think about the cost of training in design and my money situation,"" she said. Other ideas included taking a year off to work in the Far East. In the end, she decided to use her current skills and find a job that suited her better than insurance. Now, she works as a Public Relations officer. She believes she could have reached this point without Career Analysts, but they helped her understand what she really wanted to do. She has sent six friends there, and they are all happy with the service.
Some people feel they would not have made changes without help. Juliet Greene, 26, visited Career Counselling Services and made important decisions. ""After working at a big bank for six years, I found my job boring and wanted a new challenge. I didn’t know what to do, so I went to Career Counselling Services with an open mind. I took the tests, and they showed I was interested in sciences,"" she said. ""I had four meetings with an adviser. The third meeting was recorded, which helped me remember what I said. After the fourth meeting, I listened to the results and decided I wanted to study geology. I plan to start a degree in it later this year. The advice from Career Counselling Services was worth the money. I am much happier now.""
However, career advice does not work for everyone. Amanda Margetts, 24, a sales representative, said, ""I reached a point in my career where I didn’t know what to do. I thought a careers adviser might suggest something new. I got many new ideas, but I rejected them because they needed a big pay cut or a lot of retraining. I didn’t learn anything new about myself. You have to give the adviser a lot of personal information, and I felt that if I told a friend the same things, they would give me similar advice."""
FCE_22,B2,"Fun at the Dentist's**
If you go to W. Lloyd Jerome's dental office in Glasgow, you will see bright paintings on the walls and a nice blue couch. Patients sit on this couch while he checks their teeth. Jerome says, ""Fifty percent of people only go to the dentist when they are in pain. They are scared."" To help with this, he wants to make a place where people feel safe. That is why he does not wear a white coat. He believes that dental visits should be relaxing and enjoyable.
Many people think dental visits are painful or very serious. Jerome says, ""If people are relaxed and happy, they will forget their bad experiences."" One of his new ideas is to use virtual-reality headsets. ""We were the first dental office in Britain to use them, and they are very popular."" Patients wear the headsets during their check-up. They sit on the blue couch and watch a film about underwater animals while Jerome checks their teeth. The headset also shows a special camera view of their mouth.
Most patients like this part of their visit. The office also smells nice, like a perfume shop. Today, it smells like orange. Jerome wants people to feel that this is not a normal dentist's office. He knows that bad smells can make people nervous.
Jerome is known as Glasgow's most stylish dentist, but he takes his work very seriously. The relaxation ideas are important, but good treatment is the most important. For example, he uses a special tool that sprays warm water to clean teeth instead of scraping them. It feels a little strange, but it is not painful if people are relaxed.
Five years ago, Jerome went to the United States to learn about new dental methods. He says, ""When you make it easier for the patient, it is easier for you too."" He wants to change the serious way of British dentistry. 
When a patient arrives, Jerome quickly goes to help. He offers the patient a cup of tea (herbal or regular), asks what video they want to watch, and leads them to the chair. The patient seems to enjoy this special treatment. The office feels more like a nice beauty salon than a regular dentist's office."
FCE_39,B2,"Chocolate and Its History**
Chocolate comes from South America and is now a big business around the world. In Britain, people spend over £230 million on chocolate at Easter. This is about 8% of all chocolate sales in the year. People eat more chocolate at Christmas than at any other time.
The cacao plant, which is used to make chocolate, was first grown by the Aztecs, Toltecs, and Mayans in Central America over 3,000 years ago. The cacao tree is a tropical plant found in Africa, South America, Central America, the West Indies, and Southeast Asia. The fruit of the cacao tree is big and has 20-40 seeds inside. When these seeds are dried, they become cacao beans, which are used to make chocolate. In English-speaking countries, these are often called cocoa beans, but this is a mistake from the 17th century.
The Aztecs used cocoa beans as money and made a drink called xocoatl, which means ""bitter water"" in their language. They added spices to this drink for special occasions. When the Spanish found this drink, they liked it better with cinnamon and sugar. However, it took a long time for this recipe to reach the rest of Europe.
In the late 17th century, chocolate houses opened in European cities where people could drink chocolate. Until the last century, people made chocolate drinks from solid chocolate blocks that had to be melted in hot water. In 1826, a man named CJ van Houten from the Netherlands created chocolate powder by removing most of the cocoa butter from the beans. 
The first chocolate bar we know today was made in 1847 by a company in Bristol called Fry and Sons. They mixed cocoa butter with chocolate liquor and sugar to make a solid chocolate bar. A Swiss company later added milk to make milk chocolate.
In the late 1800s, French companies were very popular in the British chocolate market. In 1879, the English company Cadbury named their factory Bournville, hoping to attract customers with a French name. Then, in 1905, Cadbury created the Dairy Milk bar, which became very popular because of clever advertising that linked it to the healthy milk from the English countryside.
Today, people in Britain eat about four chocolate bars each week. Chocolate companies are trying to find new ways to attract customers. One new idea is to make chocolate bars into ice cream, soft drinks, or desserts for people who want something different.
However, cacao farmers still face problems because cocoa bean prices fell in the late 1980s. Many small cacao farmers had to close their businesses. So, next time you enjoy a chocolate bar, think about the farmers who grow cacao."
FCE_18,B2,"**THE SHELL ARTIST**
Peter Cooke is 83 years old and is very good at making art. He wants to try new things like making paper and working with feathers, but for now, he is happy making beautiful objects from shells. 
As he shows me his work in his apartment, he asks, ""Am I boring you?"" He is not boring at all. He is very interesting and his art is beautiful. He shows me some shell-covered decorations above his fireplace. He says, ""I don’t mind if people don’t buy them because I love them."" Peter never planned to sell his art. About five years ago, some friends told him he should have an exhibition so more people could see his work. They helped him talk to a gallery owner in London. At his first exhibition, 70% of his pieces were sold.
His second exhibition opened yesterday. The prices for his art are very high, around £2,000 for some decorations. There are 86 pieces in the exhibition, with prices starting at £225 for a shell flower in a crystal vase. Peter says he does not set the prices, but he knows his work is special. The gallery owner told him that one day, when he stops making art, everyone will want his pieces.
Peter wishes he had started making art earlier in his life. He thinks he could have made even more wonderful things. Now, he feels he cannot do as much because he is older. However, his work is very different from the simple shell crafts you find in seaside shops. He has a creative mind and makes boxes covered in tiny shells, pictures made from shells, and baskets of very realistic flowers.
Peter has his own way of working. He uses materials he finds, like cardboard from shirts for flower bases, glue from a sail-maker, and washing-up liquid to clean the shells. He says, ""I have an idea of what I want to do, and it just happens."" His work is very detailed and beautiful.
Peter travels to many places to find tiny shells. He has been to France, Thailand, Mexico, South Africa, and the Philippines. He lies on the beach to look for beautiful shells. He only collects dead shells and does not take shells with living creatures inside. He explains that many people walk on the beach and break shells, and the sea also breaks them. He believes it is okay to collect shells that are no longer homes for animals.
Peter's argument about collecting shells is strong. He creates beautiful art from the shells he finds, and his work is often more beautiful than the shells themselves."

One day, a reporter named Jane Laidlaw is waiting to meet Kira. The receptionist at the modeling agency tells Jane that Kira will be late. Jane worries about this. She thinks about all the bad things she has heard about models, like they can be difficult or vain. She wonders if Kira will come at all.
When Kira arrives, she is smiling and relaxed. She is with her mother. Kira is not wearing fancy clothes; she has on a simple black dress and trainers. She is very friendly and tall. Kira explains that models under 16 must have an adult with them when they work. Her mother is proud of her.
Kira became a model by chance. Her older sister suggested she enter a modeling competition. Kira did not want to, but her sister sent in some photos. When Kira found out she was a finalist, she was at school. This made her feel confident, and she won the competition easily. After that, a modeling agency in London offered her work.
Kira has to balance her life as a student and a model. Her friends and teachers are proud of her, but some people at school are not nice. They say she thinks too highly of herself. Kira finds this hard, but she believes she is still the same person. She says, ""I have become more confident, but I can still stand up for myself.""
Being a model affects her social life. The agency can call her at any time for a job. Kira cannot always make plans with her friends because she does not know her schedule. However, her friends understand and do not complain.
Kira has a bright future ahead of her. She is talented and has support from her family and friends. When Jane asks Kira what she would like to do if she were not a model, Kira thinks for a moment and says, ""I would like to do what you are doing."""

Father and son start Gold Rush
Terence and Chris Madden have traveled from cold Canada to hot Africa to find gold. Terence is an explorer, and Chris is a mineral expert. They think their mine on a Welsh mountain could have up to 10,000 ounces of gold. After ten years of digging in Wales, they believe they are very close to a gold vein worth five million dollars. Terence, 68, from Liverpool, said, ""As we dig, we are finding a lot of gold; now we just need to dig a little more to find it all.""
The father and son have spent their lives looking for gold. Their search started when Terence read about gold in the 'Dolgellau gold belt,' an area near the town of Dolgellau in Wales. They read old mining journals and newspapers at the Welsh National Library in Aberystwyth. They chose the best area to study. After clearing the land and finding some gold in the rocks, they spent ten years getting permission to work, taking soil samples, and removing old cars and trash. They dug out 150 tonnes of rock to make a tunnel and a 10-meter shaft.
Now, they do not have enough money. They have spent their savings on this dream and need to find someone to invest £50,000 to dig a little deeper where the gold is. Chris says, ""Right now, it looks doubtful, but we have some people to contact.""
Last week, news about their dig spread in the valleys, and many people became interested in gold. Dolgellau depends on tourists, and the residents are hopeful. Peter Woolven, the manager of the Royal Ship Hotel, said, ""If they find gold, it could bring more people here, but I hope many people do not come and damage the hillside.""
The Welsh gold industry has declined since the late 1880s when many people worked in hundreds of mines. One of the last mines, Clogau-St David's, which made wedding rings for the Queen and the Princess of Wales, closed a month ago. Now, individual gold diggers are coming back. George Hall, another gold seeker, plans to dig a tunnel on the other side of the hill from the Maddens. He said, ""Searching for gold is very emotional. It is exciting to find hidden treasure. Maybe I will be lucky this time."""

Rachel Mills is a scientist. She spends a lot of time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. Rachel teaches and studies marine geochemistry. This means she looks at the chemicals in the sea. She works at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. 
When she is not teaching, Rachel goes into a small steel vehicle. This vehicle is for exploring underwater. It is the size of a small car. Rachel dives three kilometres down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes. Inside the vehicle, there is not much space. She can touch the two pilots. They cannot stand up or move. They must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. 
A dive can last for 16 hours. It takes three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours to collect rock and water samples, and three hours to come back up. If there is a problem, Rachel can press a panic button. This makes a small escape vessel come out. It goes quickly to the surface, like a ping-pong ball in water. Rachel says, ""No one has tested it yet, but I don’t think it would be a nice trip.""
Rachel remembers her first dive. She got into the vehicle on a ship with an instructor. He told her what to do in an emergency, like if the pilot had a heart attack. They wanted to see how she would feel in a small space. Now, Rachel has made six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian team. They went to a place five days away from the Canary Islands. There, they found many underwater volcanoes that blow out black smoke. 
When Rachel is not at sea, she works in her office at the Oceanography Centre. She says, ""Two-thirds of my salary comes from teaching, which I love, but I do it so I can do my research on the 'black smokers'."" Black smokers are underwater volcanoes that release hot water that looks like black smoke. This water comes out at one metre per second and is 350 degrees hot.
Rachel felt scared the first time she dived with an American team. They were using a 50-metre rope when there was an explosion. There was a loud bang, and she thought, ""I’m going to die."" They waited in silence. When nothing happened, they were very relieved. 
Rachel loves diving to the deepest part of the ocean. Every time she looks out of the porthole and sees the chimneys, she feels amazed. She thinks, ""I am at the bottom of the sea, and no one else has seen this before."" She studied black smokers for three years for her PhD. When she saw them for real, it was an incredible feeling."

I was dirty, smelly, hungry, and a little sunburned. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. My body was tired. My mind was confused with foreign train times, money, and languages. ""Never again,"" I said when I got home. I said the same thing the next year and the year after that. 
I just had to buy one train ticket. Because I was under twenty-five years old, I could travel for a whole month anywhere in Europe. After sleeping in a train corridor, normal beds feel different. Carrying all my things in a backpack made me travel simply. I learned to throw away things I didn’t need, like old socks and finished books. This way of traveling is part of the Inter-Rail spirit. With a ticket in my hand, I felt free. 
On my first trip, my friends and I didn’t know how special this train ticket was. We thought it was just a cheap way to get to our campsite in southern France. But we wanted to see more countries. The extra miles didn’t cost us anything. We were not only interested in culture, but this was our first holiday without parents. We made our own plans and only saw the most popular sights. 
I was proud that sometimes all I wanted to see was the view from the train station. We just wanted to enjoy ourselves. We were like other Inter-Rail travelers, sharing space, food, and music. The excitement of travel comes from seeing a place you only knew by name. When the train arrives, you see the city for the first time. 
To really understand Europe, you need to see it yourself. Everyone knows about it, but it is different when you experience it. This is why other people's holiday photos can be boring. The train trip may not show you new things in the world, but it is a valuable personal experience. Europe is big, and Inter-Rail helps people see this, even if it didn’t happen for us right away."

Arriving at an airport in another country and finding out that your luggage is missing can be very disappointing. You may have to wear the same clothes for a long time until the airline finds your bags. Sometimes, you might be in a different place with a different weather and have to wear clothes that are not right for that place.
Airlines do not often say how many bags they lose, but it happens to many travelers. Even good airlines can make mistakes, and it is hard for any airline to promise that your checked luggage will travel with you, especially if you have to change planes.
Here is how it works: Airlines ask passengers to arrive at the airport early. This is to give enough time for the bags to be checked and loaded onto the plane. There is also a minimum time needed to change from one flight to another. This time is often longer to help with moving bags. Usually, this system works well. But sometimes, extra security checks and air traffic problems can delay flights. This can cause issues with the baggage system. Human mistakes can also happen, like if a label on a bag gets lost.
Big airports, called 'hubs', can have more problems because they handle many bags. For example, last year, Heathrow airport in London had over 41 million passengers, with nine million changing planes. British Airways had two million passengers changing planes at Heathrow, mostly between Terminal 1 and Terminal 4.
Even busy airports like Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Singapore, and Zurich can have bad days. Some airports have a higher chance of losing bags when passengers change planes. Miami airport in the United States is known for losing luggage when passengers connect to flights in Latin America.
To avoid losing your luggage, try to book direct flights when you can and check in early. If you must change planes, try to use the same airline for all your flights. Allow extra time for connections by taking an earlier flight. Make sure to label your luggage with your home and holiday addresses, and include your flight numbers.
If your luggage is still missing, contact the airline staff in the baggage area and fill out a property irregularity report (PIR) before you leave the airport."
FCE_2,B2,"The Kingfisher**
Wildlife photographer Charlie James knows a lot about the kingfisher. This is a beautiful blue-green bird that lives near streams and rivers and eats fish. Old trees grow over the stream, giving some shade to the shallow water. The main colors around are soft greens, browns, and yellows from the sunlight. The kingfisher moves quickly and looks like a flash of light. It is gone in a second, but you remember it because it is so special.
Charlie James loved kingfishers when he was young. He feels very strongly about this little bird, but he cannot say exactly why. There are many stories about kingfishers. In Greek mythology, the kingfisher is a moon goddess that became a bird. Another story says that the kingfisher flew so high that its top became blue like the sky, while its bottom was burned by the sun. This story has some truth. Kingfishers do not have blue pigment in their feathers. Instead, the way their feathers are made scatters light and makes them look blue. This is why a kingfisher can look bright blue or green depending on the light.
Many wildlife photographers love kingfishers. They are colorful and can be watched easily from a hiding place, even though they are shy. Charlie's first hiding place was an old blanket he put over his head while he waited near a kingfisher's favorite spot. The bird came back in a few minutes and sat very close to him. But it took him four more years to take his first good picture. During this time, the European kingfisher became very important in his life. He spent as much time as he could by a stream where kingfishers lived. However, school took away some of his time with the birds. He missed classes and called himself an ""academic failure."" But people noticed his interest in kingfishers, which are the most common type of kingfisher in the world and the only ones that breed in Europe. 
At 16, he got a job as an advisor for a nature magazine. Then he worked as an assistant to the editor and later became a freelance wildlife cameraman. Now, he wants to make a special kingfisher film. ""No speech, just beautiful images that say everything,"" he says. ""I like to photograph parts of kingfisher wings..."" He stops talking, thinking about the colors of the bird he loves. His photographs show some of his feelings, but Charlie knows there is much more to his love for the kingfisher than what his work can show."
FCE_68,B2,"Conducting an Orchestra**
Giving directions to an orchestra is not easy. Anne Inglis talks to five new conductors about their work.
A. **ANNE MANSON**  
Anne Manson is 30 years old. She asked conductor Claudio Abbado if she could watch his practice sessions in Vienna. When an assistant was not there, she helped out. Later, she was asked to help with another opera. ""I had to lead the first rehearsal for Abbado. I was not nervous. I like standing in front of an orchestra,"" she said. Anne is from America and works with a London opera company that focuses on modern music. She is also becoming known in other European countries, thanks to help from the British Arts Council. Since her first experience, she has worked with Abbado on many projects.
B. **ANDREW CONSTANTINE**  
Andrew Constantine is 31 years old. He says the hardest part of being a conductor is getting good opportunities. He won a big competition in 1991 after trying two other times. He is thankful for the timing: ""If I had won earlier, I would not be here now."" The competition gave him many chances to perform and work as an assistant to a famous conductor. However, he finds it hard to move on from being known as a competition winner. ""If in three years my name is still linked to the competition, I will be worried,"" he said. But orchestras like the English Chamber Orchestra are inviting him back, which is good for his career.
C. **WASFI KANI**  
Wasfi Kani started Pimlico Opera. She enjoys the long practice time needed for opera. ""The music needs four weeks of focus,"" she said. She began conducting seriously in her late twenties. After university, she worked in London until Pimlico Opera became professional two years ago. Learning from Sian Edwards was important for her. ""I saw her conduct and realized she was my size. I had always learned from bigger people, which is different."" She likes the complex nature of opera: ""There are many arguments, and you have to think about the singers' personalities.""
D. **ROGER VIGNOLES**  
Roger Vignoles is 48 years old. He says conducting surprised him, but he finds it very interesting. He started as a musician in an opera house and worked with good conductors. Last year, he directed Handel's Agrippina from the piano at a festival, which he had never done before. ""It was easier than I thought. I knew the music well and what I wanted it to sound like. I tried my best to get the performance I wanted. People respect my skills as a musician. I learn from every experience I have had in music and performing. Now, I will do whatever people ask me to find out what I enjoy.""
E. **WAYNE MARSHALL**  
In 1986, conductor Simon Rattle noticed Wayne Marshall, a young assistant conductor, and told his agent about him. Now 32, Wayne soon found himself conducting a musical in London at short notice. It was a tough start. He had to deal with some musicians reading newspapers during the show. ""I was strict with them. I always gave a clear beat and did my best. Many musicians do not seem to need advice from a conductor. But I am not afraid to say what I want. If people see you are worried, it gets worse. I have never studied conducting formally, and no book teaches you how to conduct, but people have been nice to me. I am determined and know what I like."""
FCE_23,B2,"**Variations on a Theme**
If you want to take children to a theme park, there are many to choose from in Britain. We asked five families to try some of the best parks.
**Fun Island - The Burns Family**  
Last year, we went to a big theme park in the US and thought Fun Island would be boring. But we were surprised! The park is good for younger children, so our three-year-old had fun too. The kids loved the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. There is a special dodgems ride for little kids, which was very popular. For older children, there are scarier rides, like Splash Out, where you jump into a pool! After five hours, Steve and I wanted to leave, but the children wanted to stay because they were having so much fun. Our only problem was that the park could be more exciting, and the scenery was not great. But the staff were very helpful, and the park was clean and safe.
**Wonderland - The McMillan Family**  
None of us had been to a theme park before, so we did not know what to expect. We thought Oscar might be too young, but he loved it! He enjoyed the Mountain Train and liked Little Land, which has small models of famous buildings. The older children liked the ferris wheel and driving toy cars on a real road. We spent six hours there and were happy there were places to rest. The park looked nice, and the staff were friendly. There is something for everyone, even adults.
**Adventure World - The Jeffree Family**  
After seven hours, we still wanted to see more. The children loved the Big Top Circus, which had a great trapeze act. We went on the Terror Line, and even though the girls were scared, they said they enjoyed it. Their favorite ride was Running River, where you think you will get wet, but you don’t. For younger children, Toy Land is very fun. The children wanted to try the new ride, Fear Factor, but we were happy they were too small for it! The park is so well designed that waiting for rides is not boring. It is very clean, and the staff are nice. One time, I could not sit with both girls, so a staff member went with one of them.
**The Great Park - The Langridge Family**  
We arrived at one o'clock and were sad that the park closed at 5 p.m. This is a great theme park for younger children because the rides are not too scary. I am scared of rides, but I had fun. We all loved Exotic Travels, a boat ride that starts slow and then becomes very fun. We waited for half an hour for Lightning River, and it was over quickly! I would not go on the Big Leap, but it looked exciting. If the children were a bit older, they might have found it too easy, but they loved it.
**Fantasy World - The Break-all Family**  
The park says there is ""No Limit to the Fun,"" and we felt that was true. Europe's tallest roller-coaster, the Rocket, is very big, and Ben thought it was the scariest ride. Jennie thought the Hanger, where you hang upside-down 30 meters above the ground, was worse! There are many main rides, and the older children went on them many times. Sarah was too small for some rides but enjoyed the Long Slide. The staff were nice to younger children, but some were not very friendly. You need a whole day to enjoy Fantasy World. We could not tell the kids we were going home early!"
FCE_60,B2,"Running a Business in the Countryside**
Five women talk about their experiences starting a business in the countryside.
A. ""My customers are friends,"" says CHRISTINE HOGAN. She has a computer design business that makes over £200,000 a year and has four full-time workers. ""My husband and I moved from London to the countryside when our children were small. I wanted to work from home. I had worked with computers before I got married, so my husband suggested I start a computer design business. It was hard at first and needed a lot of money. But I was careful and told the bank manager if I might spend too much. Working from home saves money, and I can work in the evening if I want. My business is small. People from the area usually come to pick up their work.""
B. ""I enjoy being independent,"" says MAGGY SASANOW. She designs greeting cards from home. ""I studied art at university and wanted to work in a museum. But when I got married, we moved to the countryside, and there were no jobs like that. So, I started my own business and now I make 50 different greeting cards that I sell to museums. I work in a big room upstairs. The bad thing about working from home is that there is always something to do, like mowing the lawn. I don’t advertise; my business grows by word of mouth. People send me work from London because I am cheaper than other artists. I work alone, so I miss sharing ideas with others, but there are more good things than bad.""
C. ""It has been hard at times,"" says DELIA TURNER. She makes curtains and has had good and bad times in her business. ""I started my business eight years ago. At that time, my business was growing, and in two years, my income went from £24,000 to £80,000. I used to have six full-time workers, but I had to let them go because the economy got worse. This was hard because it is not easy to find jobs here. Now, I am back to making curtains at home with my husband’s help and using women who work from their homes. I have to lower my prices sometimes and look for new opportunities.""
D. TESSA STRICKLAND runs a children's book publishing business from her farmhouse. ""I moved to the countryside three years ago for two reasons. First, it was cheaper than London, and second, I love the countryside. I like being able to work when I want. Most of my income comes from deals with Australia, the Far East, and North America, so I have to take calls at strange times. The bad thing is that I need to be disciplined to close the office door. I publish children's books from different cultures, working with authors and artists. I had worked in London before, so I felt very alone at first.""
E. MEG RIVERS runs a cake business that sells cakes by post and has a shop. Her business makes £250,000 a year and employs six people, some part-time. ""I started ten years ago at home. I care about health, so I began making fruit cakes with good quality flour and eggs. Friends and family asked for cakes, and soon I was sending them all over the country. Seven years ago, I rented a small building where we make the cakes. Now, I have a baker and an assistant, and a professional cake decorator. I don’t bake anymore because I manage the business. My biggest problem has been the money side of the business, which has been hard because we didn’t have a lot of money to start."""
FCE_1,B2,"Meet the Amazing Watkins Family**
The Watkins family is very special. The sons are musicians and composers, and their dad makes musical instruments. 
John and Hetty Watkins are teachers from South Wales. They wanted to buy a cello for their son, Paul, who is ten years old. But the cello was very expensive. John thought, ""Maybe I can make one."" He found a school nearby that teaches how to make instruments. He took evening classes for three years.
After making some violins, John made his first cello. Paul, now 28, says, ""It turned out really well. He made me another one later, and I used it until a few months ago."" John has now stopped teaching to make instruments full-time. He makes about twelve violins each year. He was very happy to sell one to a famous American musician named Jaime Laredo.
Paul and his younger brother, Huw, started playing music when they were young. Paul remembers, ""I played the piano first. I loved to bang the keys."" Later, he wanted to play the cello. His dad played the viola and wanted Paul to play the violin. Paul tried it for six weeks but did not like it. He liked the cellist in his dad's group and asked for lessons.
Huw, now 22, says, ""My parents were supportive. I wanted to do well like Paul."" Huw is now a pianist and composer.
Paul used his dad's cello to win a music competition. At just 20 years old, he became the main cellist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra. He played his dad's cello until last year. Now, he has a new cello that is very old, made by Francesco Rugeri. 
Paul will soon play on television with his new cello. He will perform Elgar's Cello Concerto. He says, ""I will play it my way."" But he cannot watch himself on TV because he is playing at the Cheltenham Festival that night. Huw will also perform his String Quartet in London at the same time. John and Hetty will be very busy trying to see all their sons' performances!"
FCE_53,B2,"**Looking after the Countryside: The National Trust**
The National Trust is a group that wants to protect the British countryside. Gill Page visits the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and talks to Gareth Roberts, a warden who works for the Trust.
Gareth says that a National Trust Warden needs common sense. ""You must be good with people,"" he explains. ""You talk to farmers, visitors, and builders every day."" Gareth grew up on the Lleyn Peninsula and worked on his parents' farm until he got married. Many people wanted to be the National Trust Warden for the Lleyn Peninsula, but Gareth got the job because he knows the area well and has farming experience, even though he did not have formal training.
Gareth still helps on his parents' farm. This helps him understand farmers and their problems. He says, ""I can talk to them easily."" His farming background also helps him with the physical work, like building fences and planting trees. Since he started working with the Trust, Gareth has learned more about nature conservation. He remembers picking flowers and collecting butterflies when he was young. Now, he wonders where all those flowers and butterflies are. He believes farming has changed the countryside, but it is not the farmers' fault; they were just following government rules.
At first, farmers and conservationists did not get along. They both wanted things done their way. Now, they are talking and understanding each other better. Gareth says, ""We are close to working together.""
Gareth's job includes conservation, allowing people to visit the Trust's land, planting trees, and meeting tenant farmers. He wants to finish jobs quickly and without problems. He enjoys seeing projects completed, but he also spends a lot of time on reports and paperwork.
Gareth likes his job, even though he is always working. He enjoys talking to people, but some visitors can be difficult. ""Some people come in, ask for everything, and leave as if they own the place. It can be annoying!"" he says. But he believes that common sense is important.
If you have common sense and want to work outside, you might think about becoming a warden like Gareth. But be ready; there may not be a job available in the Lleyn Peninsula for a long time!"
FCE_55,B2,"**The Netball Captain**
In our series about women in sports, Suzie Ellis met England's netball captain, Kendra Slowinski. Kendra is the captain of the England netball team. When I met her, she had a busy day. She taught at a local school and then trained in a supermarket car park.
I asked her, ""Don't you get strange looks?"" She replied, ""I am focused on my training. I don’t notice much around me. I might see cars slow down, but that’s all.""
Kendra said, ""My life is about being my best for the World Championships."" She is following a strict schedule to be fit for the games. This is her fourth World Championships, and it will be the biggest one yet, with 27 countries joining.
Kendra said, ""We will have support from our home crowd, which is special. It is important to improve the reputation of netball in our country. There will be more pressure because people expect us to play well.""
Their first game is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. Kendra said, ""We have always won against them, but they are exciting to play. They are very skilled."" The England team is ranked fourth in the world. Kendra knows the Championships will be hard. ""You must push yourself every day. There is no rest between games. In a series, you can lose the first game and still win. But in the Championships, you only have one chance.""
In the fifteen years she has played at a high level, netball has become harder and faster. Players are more aggressive. Kendra said, ""You train hard to win. But after the game, we are all friends.""
Netball is also using more science for fitness testing. Kendra said, ""We must think and train like world-class players. As captain, I need to have a strong mind and lead by example. I support and encourage my team.""
Kendra said, ""My netball career has been planned from the start. I decided that this competition would be my last as a player."" She will likely coach young players in the future, but now she is focused on her last big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she might have a tear in her eye."
FCE_50,B2,"**SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS**
What should you do if your child is very good at music? It can be hard to know how to help them. Some parents may not see their child's talent until they become frustrated and act out. Most regular schools can help children who are good at subjects like math or English, but children who are good at music need special support that regular schools may not provide. 
Children who are musically talented, and those whose talent is encouraged by their parents or teachers, can benefit from going to a specialist music school. There are five of these schools in Britain, and they are new. They help children aged seven to eighteen develop their musical skills with professional musicians. 
At these schools, children spend a lot of time on music. They have individual lessons, play in orchestras and groups, and learn about singing and music theory. They also practice in special rooms, sometimes with a teacher. The rest of their time is spent on important subjects like English, math, science, and languages. Some students can study more subjects if they want.
All five specialist music schools in Britain are independent. They have small classes and more teachers than students. Most children live at the school, which means they eat and sleep there. This helps them be with other children who have the same interests.
What are the problems? One big issue is the cost; it can be very expensive (around £12,000 to £17,000 a year for boarding). However, schools try to help with scholarships and financial aid for families with talented children. Also, not all parents want to send their children to live at school, especially when they are very young. The directors of these schools worry about admitting children as young as seven because it can be a tough environment. They want to help children grow up to be well-rounded individuals.
There can be stress for musically gifted children. Sometimes, their musical talent may fade as they grow older, and the pressure to succeed can make them feel like they are failing. However, the schools watch how each child is doing and offer help when needed. 
Many former students say they learned a lot from the music teaching, but some feel that the focus on music means they do not get enough academic learning. Many talented music students are also very smart and want to learn more in school. Because of this, it might be better to wait until a child is older to decide if they should go to a specialist school. 
Children who are good at both music and academics can do well in regular schools with good music programs. They can also take music lessons on weekends at music colleges. These colleges offer lessons and group music experiences, but this may not be possible for families who live far from big cities."
FCE_25,B2,"Susan Shepherd and Her Garden**
Susan Shepherd is an artist. She is famous for her flower paintings. Her large garden around her house gives her many ideas for her art. The garden has many flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow everywhere in the garden. 
There are two long flower beds along a path in the garden. The colors and shapes of the flowers are very nice. The previous owners of the garden were good gardeners. They left many plants that Susan likes. She also kept the gardener, Danny. Susan says, ""It was really his garden."" At first, Danny did not like some of Susan's ideas, but when she said she wanted to paint them, he understood.
Susan likes to paint individual flowers instead of the whole garden. She often picks flowers and takes them to her studio. She does not paint everything at once. She takes one flower, paints it for a few days, and then takes another flower. Sometimes, it can take her a couple of years to finish a painting.
Spring and early summer are her busiest times because the tulips and poppies bloom. Susan enjoys watching how flowers change. For example, when she puts tulips in water, they change shape and look beautiful. At first, they may seem boring, but they become interesting over time.
Susan has always liked plants. She studied botany in school and collected wildflowers in the countryside. She did not like garden flowers because they looked fake to her. She liked wildflowers that grew in difficult places, like rocks or cliffs.
Today, her garden has many plants from different countries, and they grow well there. Susan is relaxed about her garden, like a kind aunt who lets children play freely. She has two art exhibitions coming up, so she has less time to work in the garden. She now has an extra gardener, but she knows that to stay connected to her flowers, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""
FCE_34,B2,"Keeping Holiday-Makers Happy**
Sarah Sutherland-Pilch is a chalet girl. She is 24 years old and comes from West Sussex, England. This is her second year working in Val d'Isère, France. She cooks and cleans for visitors who come to ski and stay in wooden houses called chalets.
Sarah studied French and History of Art at university. She says being a chalet girl is not a career, but a fun way to spend a year or two before starting a regular job. She meets many interesting people every week.
Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to work. The chalet can have up to 18 guests each week. She eats her breakfast first, then makes breakfast for the guests. They have porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants. After breakfast, she cleans up and either makes afternoon tea or cleans the rooms, which she thinks is the worst part of her job. By 11 a.m., she is ready to ski. On good days, she can ski until 4:30 p.m.
After skiing, Sarah goes back to the chalet to prepare dinner. Dinner is served at 8 p.m., and coffee is ready by 10 p.m. After dinner, she cleans the kitchen. She does not like to see a messy kitchen in the morning. Sometimes she talks with the guests, but other times they want to be alone. Good guests can make her week better, but some weeks are not as good.
Sarah lives in the chalet with her friends. They usually go out at about 11 p.m. They like to start at a place called Bananas and may go to other places later. But on Saturday nights, she does not stay out too late because Sunday is her busiest day.
On Sunday, she starts work early. Breakfast for the guests is at 7 a.m. After the guests leave, she cleans quickly. She clears the breakfast, strips the beds, and gets everything ready for the new guests. If she did not shop for food on Saturday, she does it now. By 3 p.m., she finishes cleaning and prepares tea for the new guests who arrive around 4:30 p.m. Sometimes the new guests are confused and have many questions.
Between tea and dinner, Sarah helps guests who need ski boots or skis. She takes them to the ski shop and gets a ride back to the chalet. Then it is time for dinner again. Sometimes she talks with friends, but if she is too tired, she goes to bed early."
FCE_12,B2,"Changing Lives with a Stranger**
Mandie Currie is a zoo-keeper. One day, she worked at the magazine Marie Claire. ""Choosing my clothes for Marie Claire was hard because I usually wear a uniform at the zoo. First, I went to a photo studio, then to see new clothes before lunch. The zoo is a calm place, but here I was busy when I could be quietly with an animal. Some people on the fashion team looked stressed, but my job is not stressful. In the afternoon, I laughed because I usually clean cages or handle rats. I like to see how magazines work, but I enjoy my job at the zoo, so I will stay there.""
Alice Cutler is a fashion assistant at Marie Claire. She spent a day at London Zoo. ""I wore leather boots and dark blue trousers. The zoo gave me a green polo shirt to wear, which was good because I got very dirty. When I petted an elephant, I thought Mandie was probably packing clothes. By five o'clock, I smelled bad, but I had a great day. When I stop working in fashion, I could work with elephants, maybe in Africa.""
Karen Hodson is a nurse at Hammersmith Hospital. She worked with the gardening show Ground Force. ""I was very excited to meet the team, and Alan Titchmarsh, the presenter, was nice. I liked being outside because I sometimes do not see daylight at work. It was hard work, but fun. I thought I was strong, but I felt weak compared to the team. I did not think gardening would be so hard, so I will not quit my nursing job.""
Charlie Dimmock is a gardener on Ground Force. He worked a shift at Hammersmith Hospital. ""I made beds and gave out medicine. I thought I would feel faint, but I was okay. The nurses are friendly, and it felt very different from my usual job with men. I think my job is not as important as nursing. My day at the hospital was not easy, but I felt good about it.""
Lucy Harvey is a personal trainer. She worked with Ryanair as cabin crew. ""I changed into the uniform, and I felt different. People looked at me. Before the flight, our supervisor talked about safety, which I knew from my training. When the passengers got on the flight to Paris, I gave out magazines. Everyone looked at me, and I felt shy. On the way back, we had 80 schoolchildren who would not sit still. I wished I was back in the gym with one sensible adult.""
Sonia McDermott is an air hostess with Ryanair. She worked as a personal trainer in a gym for a day. ""I was nervous because I do not exercise. I was surprised at how much attention you give to one person. In my job, I meet 130 passengers four times a day. At lunch, I saw that some trainers did not eat very healthily, but they all drink a lot of water. I would not change my job for this, but it made me want to join a gym and be healthier."""
FCE_26,B2,"Train Memories**
Five famous people share their favorite memories of train journeys.
**Andrea Thompson - Newsreader**  
I fell in love with the south of France a long time ago and try to go back often. There is a local train from Cannes along the coast that goes to Italy. It shows you beautiful views of the sea. It does not matter what the weather is like or what time of year it is; it is always lovely. Out of the other window, you can see nice gardens and homes in France. The people on the train are always happy because there are many tourists and locals, all enjoying the beautiful trip.
**Raj Patel - Explorer**  
I have had many train journeys, but my favorite is the Nile Valley Express in northern Sudan. When I was young in South Africa, I missed a family train trip from Cape Town to Kruger National Park because I was too young. When I moved to England as a teenager, I still had not traveled by train. London Waterloo was the first big train station I saw, and it amazed me.
**Betty Cooper - Novelist**  
I remember one special train: the Blue Train. It took my husband and me on our honeymoon across France to catch a boat to Egypt. On the train, my husband gave me a pink dress, which I loved. Someone said that pink is good for the brain, and I still wear it. The journey was lovely, traveling through France and then by boat up the Nile. It was a perfect way to relax after our wedding.
**Martin Brown - Journalist**  
We were writing articles about a trip around the world and had to cross a desert in Africa. There was no road, so we took the Desert Express train. The schedule was not reliable; we only knew we would leave one day. The driver sometimes waited for people to arrive. When the train came, many people rushed to get on, even on the roof! At night, the train went through beautiful landscapes. It felt like a dream.
**Arisu Mezuki - Actress**  
Many people have favorite memories of trains from when they were children, but I do not. I grew up in Singapore and Cyprus, where I saw few trains. It was not until I was a teenager that trains became important in my life. I made a film about a railway in Yorkshire. We filmed on an old train line that volunteers took care of. That is where I started to love steam trains. When we were not filming, we rode the train, and when I went back last year, everything was the same, even the gas lights on the station platform!"

Do you want to get your story published? If you are not sure where to send it, Margaret Stubbs can help you. Many readers of this magazine ask, ""I have written a story/book. Who should I send it to?"" 
First, you need to learn about publishers and practice your writing. To sell your writing, you must know about the market. You can do this by reading a lot. Go to your local library, bookshops, and newsagents. Reading different things will help you understand what publishers want. 
You should keep your knowledge up to date because new magazines and books come out all the time. Publishers are always looking for new writers. If you want to write short love stories, find magazines that publish them. Get recent copies and read them. Learn what kind of stories they like and who their readers are. 
Sometimes, new writers send their stories to me and say, ""This has been rejected three times. Am I wasting my time?"" I try to give honest advice, but I also want to be positive. Many new writers are too quick to send their work out before they are ready. If you have only written one story, it is very unlikely to be published. 
When you hear about someone’s success, they usually have been writing for a long time. When you send your work for the first time, keep writing more stories while you wait for a reply. Write ten or twenty more stories. Each one will be better, and you will feel more like a writer. 
Do not give up on your stories. Improve them instead. In the beginning, it is best not to show your work to others. Remember, every successful writer has faced many rejections before they succeeded. 
Do everything you can to help your writing career. Look for a creative writing course near you. If you can’t find one, join a local writers' group. This will help you get ideas and confidence from other writers. Think of yourself as a writer and practice writing every day if you can."

On the last day of a bad year, I was waiting at the Baltimore train station for the 10:10 train to Philadelphia. There were more people than I expected. The station did not feel clean and nice like usual. Older couples with matching bags filled the benches, and many college students had their bags on the floor. 
A grey-haired man was walking around and talking to different people. He looked rich: he had tanned skin, a nice sweater, and a soft coat. He asked a woman sitting alone if she was going to Philadelphia. She said she was going north, but to New York. Then he asked a girl near me, who had long blond hair. I thought about talking to her too. The man asked her, ""Are you going to Philadelphia?"" She said no, and he moved on.
Now I was paying attention to him. He asked an old lady if she was going to Philadelphia, but she said she was going to Wilmington. He kept walking to a couple with matching bags. I moved closer, pretending to look at the train platform. I was going to Philadelphia, but I understood why he didn’t ask me. He looked at me quickly and then went to another bench.
He looked stressed. He asked a woman reading a book, ""Please tell me you are going to Philadelphia!"" She looked up and said, ""Yes, I am."" He asked her for a favor. I stood a little away and looked at my wrist, even though I didn’t have a watch. I could see the woman was getting cautious. The man said, ""Nothing too difficult, I promise!""
They announced my train, and people started moving to Gate E, pulling their bags behind them. I heard the man talking. He said, ""My daughter is flying out this afternoon for a study year abroad from Philadelphia. I put her on a train this morning and went home to find my wife upset. She hardly said 'hello' to me. My daughter forgot her passport. She called from the station in Philadelphia and didn’t know what to do.""
The woman listened sympathetically. I thought it was better to stay quiet and see what he would say next. The man continued, ""I told her to stay at the station, and I would get someone to bring her passport."" 
I thought it was strange. Why didn’t he go himself if it was so important? The woman asked, ""Why don’t you go yourself?"" He replied, ""I can’t leave my wife alone. She is in a wheelchair."" I thought this was not a good excuse. 
I looked at them. The man was holding a packet, not a simple envelope, but a padded one, like a small book. I thought, ""Watch out, lady,"" silently."
FCE_30,B2,"Gary and Me**
John Moore is the owner of a restaurant. He talks about his son, Gary, who is a famous TV chef. John believes everyone has a chance in life. Gary had his chance with cooking, and John had his chance to run a restaurant. When John heard about a restaurant for sale, he went to see it. The place was in bad condition, but it was perfect for him.
John remembers his childhood. His mother worked in a factory, and he felt sad when she left him alone. He wanted to have time for family. John's wife took care of their children and helped with the restaurant. They lived above the restaurant and always had meals together. This helped their children, Gary and Joe, become confident. From a young age, they talked to the restaurant's customers.
Gary was a lively child. When he was seven, he jumped into a corner bath and hurt himself. As he grew older, he did small jobs to earn pocket money. By ten, he worked in the kitchen every weekend and had a lot of money at school. He was very disciplined and woke up early. In a family business, everyone helps out, and John liked seeing Gary work.
Gary was not very good at school, but he was great in the kitchen. By 15, he was as good as the adult cooks and sometimes was in charge. He could make over a hundred meals. John knew Gary would work in catering because he had talent. When Gary needed work experience for school, John sent him to a friend’s restaurant.
Gary also started playing the drums and formed a band. John worries about what will happen to Gary's cooking if the music becomes successful. He advised Gary to focus on one thing at a time. John told him that if he wanted to succeed, he needed to do it by age 30.
At 17, Gary went to catering college. On his first day, he finished his work quickly and helped other students. Everyone is surprised by how successful Gary's TV cooking show has become. John is very proud of him. He always tells Gary that to get what you want, you must work hard because no one gives you anything. Gary has seen his chance and taken it.
John believes that when you talk to your children, they may only remember a little of what you say. He thinks Gary has listened to him sometimes."
FCE_7,B2,"Finding a Flat in Dublin**
Finding a good flat in Dublin that you can afford is very hard. The best way to find one is to know someone. If you know a person who knows someone leaving a flat, that can help. But if you are new in Dublin, like Jo, you may not know anyone. Jo had to stay in a hostel and look for a flat. For Jo, Dublin felt very big and new. She felt nervous when she took the train to work there. She did not think about why she was going. Everyone at her school thought she would leave her small town. They wanted to go to bigger places and have a better life. Some of her friends went to towns like Ennis or Limerick, where family helped them. But Jo was going to Dublin alone.
Jo's mother thought it was good for her to stay in the hostel. It was run by nuns, so her mother thought she would be safe. Jo's father hoped the hostel was warm because many hostels are cold. Jo's sisters, who worked in a hotel, thought it was crazy for her to stay in a hostel for a whole week. But Jo did not know they were talking about her while she answered an ad for a flat in Ringsend. The ad said, ""Own room, own television, share kitchen and bathroom."" It was very close to the post office where she worked, and it seemed too good to be true. Jo hoped it would be nice and that the people would like her. 
There was no line for this flat because it was not just a ""Flat to Let,"" but more like ""Third Girl Wanted."" Jo wondered if it was too fancy for her, but the house looked normal. It was a red-brick house with a basement. The flat was upstairs. A girl with a college scarf was coming down the stairs. She looked unhappy. ""Bad place,"" she told Jo. ""The people are awful."" 
Jo asked, ""What happened?"" The girl said, ""She just looked around and acted like she was better than us."" Jo continued up the stairs. Another girl named Nessa was there. She had a T-shirt with her name on it. Nessa said, ""Did you see that girl? I can't stand her."" 
Jo introduced herself, ""I'm Jo, I work in the post office."" Nessa said they were about to have tea. She got three mugs: one with 'Nessa,' one with 'Pauline,' and one with 'Other.' ""We can put your name on a mug if you come to stay,"" Nessa said kindly."
FCE_43,B2,"Behind the Dolphin's Smile**
People love dolphins. We like to see them in seaside places, movies, and TV shows. But the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society says dolphins are in trouble. Mark Simmonds talks about the problems dolphins face.
Dolphins are special to us. They are very smart animals, they can feel human emotions, and they make us dream of freedom in the ocean. We see this love for dolphins in TV shows. First, there was Flipper, and now there is Darwin from Seaquest. But these happy shows hide the real problems dolphins have in the dirty and overfished seas today.
The number of North Sea harbour porpoises (a type of dolphin) has dropped by up to 89,000. You might think that such popular animals are protected by law and cared for in special marine areas. But this is not true, and the lack of help for them could be a big wildlife disaster.
There are forty different types of dolphins in the world. In northern Europe, the most common dolphins are the striped dolphin, the common dolphin, the bottlenose dolphin, and the smaller harbour porpoise. The striped and common dolphins usually live far out in the sea. We see them in small groups, and we do not know much about them. 
Bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises used to be seen near European coasts. Bottlenose dolphins are very social and were often found in places like the Channel coast and the Thames River in Britain. Now, we can only find them in a few places, like the Moray Firth in Scotland and Cardigan Bay in Wales. The few that are left show signs of stress.
It is hard to know exactly why the number of dolphins is going down. Overfishing is taking away many fish from the sea, which also affects dolphins and porpoises. Porpoises need to find food quickly. If fish are taken from one area, they may not have enough time to find food in another area. They can also get caught in fishermen's nets, which they cannot see. 
In modern fishing, big nets are often left in the water or pulled quickly through the sea. In recent years, many dead dolphins have been found on the beaches of France and Cornwall. Marks and cuts on their bodies show that they died because they were caught in these nets.
Pollution in the sea can also harm dolphins. For example, pesticides can build up in their bodies. Female dolphins can pass these poisons to their babies through their milk. There is already one case of a young dolphin dying from its mother’s poisoned milk.
Another big problem for dolphins is noise from humans. Dolphins live in groups and use sound to understand their world. Noise from ships and oil wells travels better in water than in air. This noise can disturb dolphins in ways we do not fully understand."
FCE_51,B2,"**Getting Fit**
Exercise is very important for your mind, body, and spirit. It helps you feel balanced, especially when life feels busy and stressful. Many articles talk about fitness because it is really good for you. There are many reasons to exercise, and very few reasons not to.
Exercise helps your muscles and can change your body shape. It makes your muscles stronger and helps you stand and sit well. It can also help prevent injuries. Exercise can improve areas like your thighs, stomach, and arms. It is good for your heart, lungs, and blood flow.
Exercise can also help with feelings of sadness and tiredness. It can help you sleep better and reduce stress. It can even help with some health problems. 
There are many types of exercise you can do, like aerobics, jogging, or using weights. But be careful! If you train too hard or lift too much weight, you can get hurt. Start slowly and ask your doctor if you are not sure what is good for you.
Good posture is very important. If you sit or stand badly, it can make you look and feel tired. To help with posture, imagine a balloon pulling the top of your head up. This can help you breathe better and make your body look slimmer.
Stretching is also important. It helps you move easily and keeps your muscles from getting hurt. If you stretch four or five times a week, you will feel more flexible and fit. 
A good exercise routine should include warming up, stretching, a workout, and cooling down."
FCE_11,B2,"**IN THEIR NATURAL HABITAT**
What makes film-makers Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman stay away from home for many months? They are looking for the perfect shot. In the jungles and plains of East Africa, it is not easy to find producer Amanda Barrett and cameraman Owen Newman. Right now, they are in the Ngorongoro Crater, where it has rained a lot for six months. This has caused some problems. Newman said they had to buy a special piece of equipment. This helps Amanda pull him out when their vehicle gets stuck in the mud.
Amanda and Owen have made some of the best wildlife films on TV, like their famous film about leopards. While this film was being shown, they were already back in the field, looking for another shy animal, the jackal. This is normal for film-makers. They travel around the world to film wild animals since television started.
I talked to Newman at a safari lodge, where he was meeting other people. He said, ""We do have some arguments, but we get over them quickly."" Neither of them thinks they are the leader. They get along well because they see the animals in the same way. 
When they travel, they set up their tents each night. But now, they have a fixed camp. They wake up at 5 a.m. and make tea the night before to keep it warm. They eat pre-packed meals that they heat up. Newman said, ""We can be out for up to eight weeks, so cooking can be a bit stressful.""
It can be tough, but being in remote areas lets them get close to the animals. Newman remembers filming a family of lions. One lioness would go off alone and then come back to greet the other lions. She even greeted their car!
Newman first worked with Barrett in 1988 on a film called ""The Great Rift."" Two years later, they started working together to film Arctic foxes. Since then, they spend four months in one place to gather enough material for each half-hour film. Before they start, they must submit a script for approval. 
Newman said, ""Amanda and I have a good working relationship because we share the same ideas. We want to make a film that shows the true spirit of the place and the animals. We want to touch people's hearts. If you can make people feel something, that is better than just making them think."""
FCE_14,B2,"**The Netball Captain**
In our series about women in sports, Suzie Ellis met England's netball captain, Kendra Slawinski. Kendra is the captain of the England netball team. When I met her, she had a busy day. She taught at a local school and then trained in a supermarket car park. I was surprised to hear about her training place. I asked her, ""Don't you get strange looks?"" She replied, ""I focus on my movements and my feet, so I don’t see much else. I might notice cars slow down, but that’s all.""
Kendra said, ""My whole life is about being my best for the Championships."" She follows a strict schedule to be fit. This is her fourth World Championships, and it will be the biggest one yet, with 27 countries joining. ""We will have home support, which is special,"" she said. ""It is important to improve the reputation of netball in our country. There will be more pressure because we are at home. People expect us to play well.""
Their first game is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. Kendra said, ""We have always beaten them, but they are exciting to play. They have a lot of talent."" The England team is ranked fourth in the world. Kendra knows the Championships will be hard. ""You must push yourself to play every day. There is no rest between games. You can lose the first game in a series and still win, but in the Championships, you have only one chance.""
In the fifteen years she has played at a high level, netball has become harder and faster. ""You train hard to win,"" Kendra said. ""But after the game, we are all friends."" Netball is also using more science for fitness testing. ""We must think and train like world-class players,"" Kendra said. As captain, she believes it is important to have a strong mind and to lead by example. ""I support and encourage my team.""
Kendra said, ""My netball career has always been planned."" She decided that this competition would be her last as a player. She may coach young players in the future, but now she is focused on her last big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she might have tears in her eyes. Her loyal supporters will be with her every step of the way."
FCE_63,B2,"In Hot Water**
Rachel Mills is a scientist. She spends a lot of time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. Rachel teaches and does research about marine geochemistry. This means she studies the chemicals in the sea. She works at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. 
When Rachel is not teaching, she goes into a small steel vehicle. This vehicle is for exploring underwater. It is the size of a small car. Rachel dives three kilometres down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes. 
Inside the vehicle, there is not much space. Rachel can touch the two pilots. They are used to being in this small space. They cannot stand up or move around. They must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last for 16 hours. It takes three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours to collect rock and water samples, and three hours to come back up to the surface.
If there is a problem and Rachel needs to get to the top quickly, she can press a panic button. This makes a small escape vessel come out. It goes quickly to the surface, like a ping-pong ball in water. No one has tested it yet, but Rachel thinks it would not be a nice journey.
Rachel remembers her first time in the vehicle. She got in with an instructor on a ship. He explained what to do in an emergency, like if the pilot had a heart attack. They wanted to see how she would react in a small space. Now, Rachel has made six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian team. 
They went to a place five days away from the Canary Islands. There, on the ocean floor, are many underwater volcanoes. These volcanoes blow out black smoke. The Russian team was dropping off equipment to study a project that would make a hole 150 metres through a volcano.
When Rachel is not at sea, she is in her office at the Oceanography Centre. Two-thirds of her salary comes from teaching, which she loves. She teaches so she can do her research on ""black smokers."" This is another name for underwater volcanoes. Water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke. It comes out at a speed of one metre per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees.
The only time Rachel was scared was when she dived with an American team. They were towing equipment when suddenly there was an explosion. There was a loud bang, and Rachel thought she was going to die. They waited in silence. When nothing happened, they were very relieved. They were still alive!
Diving to the deepest part of the ocean is an adventure. Every time Rachel looks out of the porthole and sees the chimneys, she feels wonder. She is at the bottom of the sea, and no one else has seen them before. Rachel studied black smokers for three years for her Ph.D. When she saw them for real, it was an amazing feeling."
FCE_56,B2,"**Interview Tips**
First impressions are very important. Studies show that people make opinions about us in the first few minutes of meeting. They notice how we dress, our eye contact, our body language, how fast or slow we talk, our voice volume, and our words.
Mary Pearce wanted to be a teacher. She worked hard to get her degree. When she graduated, she felt very confident. She applied for a job at a nearby primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher. That morning, she saw a small hole in her jacket. She thought about changing, but she didn’t want to be late. She believed it was important to be on time. Mary did not get the job. A friend who teaches at the school told her that the Head Teacher said, ""If someone does not take the time to look their best at an interview, what kind of teacher will they be?""
Simon Grant, a hotel manager, says, ""People who look like they care about themselves are more likely to care about their jobs. People think what is inside is important, but in an interview, you should try to look your best.""
Many people do not understand how important a professional image is. For example, Janet Goodwood worked for ten years as an administrative assistant in a big accounting firm. When the office manager retired, she applied for the job but did not get an interview. She thought it was a mistake and asked the Director of Personnel what happened. He told her she did not fit the image of an office manager and suggested she improve her wardrobe before applying again. She was shocked because she believed she did a good job and that her clothes should not matter.
Movement and gestures also affect how an interviewer sees a candidate. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian found that 7% of our message comes from the words we use, 38% from our voice, and 55% from our facial expressions. If our facial expressions and words send different messages, the listener will pay more attention to the non-verbal message. So, make sure your words match your body language. Mixed messages can confuse the interviewer.
It is also important not to seem too desperate for the job or too eager to please. When Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, applied for a promotion, her interview went very well, and she was offered the job right away. She was very happy but showed too much excitement. The boss saw how excited she was and offered her a lower salary than she wanted. She believes she could have gotten more if she had controlled her excitement.
Finally, what we say and how we say it can help us succeed in an interview. David Artesio, a manager of an employment agency, suggests learning about the company before the interview. For example, the annual report will tell you about what the company does. Mention something that interests you during the interview. This will show your interest in the company.
Business consultant Marian Woodall suggests having a few questions ready and avoiding long, confusing sentences. She says, ""Poor communicators talk in long sentences. Successful communicators talk in short sentences and key points."""

Matt Froggatt used to work as an insurance agent in London, but now he runs a sheep farm. He worked in the city for 14 years. Matt thought the city was fun at first, but later it became boring. He did not plan to leave his job yet, but he lost it suddenly. He did not get a lot of money when he left, but it was enough to start his farm. He met the head chef of a local hotel, which is one of the best in the country. By selling meat to the hotel, he became well-known. Now, he also sells meat by mail order. Matt is happy to be out of the office, but he still works long hours, like before.

Ron Able was a manager in advertising, but now he is an artist. He started painting as a hobby and found it more exciting than his job. He decided to leave his job and become an artist. A career counselor helped him. Ron told the counselor that he did not want to go back to his old job. This surprised the counselor because most people want to find work quickly. Ron and his wife got married young, and their children are grown up, so they did not need to worry about money. They moved to the north of England, where they did not know anyone. They left their friends, but they still keep in touch, and many friends visit them.

Katherine Goodison worked as a lawyer for five years before starting her own hat business in her London flat. She enjoyed her job as a lawyer and earned a lot of money, but she worked very long hours. Katherine did not want to become a senior partner and work even more, so she left. Many people thought she would get bored, but she has not. She has deadlines for her fashion business, which keeps her busy. Katherine feels happier and less stressed now. However, she misses talking to her colleagues. She loves being responsible for her work. If she does a bad job, she knows it is her fault. When she worked for a company, she cared, but now she cares even more because her name is on the products.
**The Masseur**  
Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16 years before becoming a masseur at the Life Centre in London. He started working in finance when he was 22 years old. He liked the excitement of the job, but he did not find it rewarding. In 1989, he almost lost his job, so he decided to leave and travel for a year. During that year, he thought about what he wanted to do. He was interested in health, so he visited gyms and talked to the owners. Paul knew he needed training to change careers, so he took courses in massage. Then, he got a part-time job at the Life Centre. He has no regrets about his choice. He feels more in control of his life now and is very happy."
FCE_6,B2,"'Dedicated to Their Sports'**
Four young sports stars talk about their lives.
**A Darius (runner)**  
I have always liked sports. I played many sports, but I was best at football and athletics. When I was 14, I tried out for a professional football club, but I chose to focus on athletics instead. My biggest moment was when I competed for my country in the youth team and won a medal. I did not get much attention from the media, which was disappointing. I hoped to get some sponsorship because training is expensive. I train at home all winter and then go to Florida for three weeks before the season starts. It is fun there because the facilities are great and the nightlife is good too. But I have to be very disciplined. If my friends ask me to go out the night before training, I have to say no. I wish I could go out, but hard work is important in this sport. My main goal is to get to the next Olympics - that would be amazing.
**B Gabriel (surfer)**  
The surfing community is small, so I meet the same people at competitions. Professional surfers are serious, and the best waves are early in the morning. If I want to succeed, I have to stop going to late-night parties. I do not mind this too much, but I love sleeping in, and I usually have to give that up too. But it is worth it because I won the National Championships last year. After a big win, I always celebrate, and if I win money, I go somewhere nice. The sacrifices are worth it because winning the championship helped me get a job presenting a surfing show on TV. Now, I am a bit of a celebrity.
**C Dieter (yacht racer)**  
When I am on a boat with my friends, we have a lot of fun. We are traditional and always celebrate a win in style. Some people say we act a bit childish, but we do not look for media attention. Sometimes reporters care more about our celebrations than our race results. I am away for eight months a year, so it is nice to come back and spend time with my friends. You cannot always focus on the sport; it is not healthy. I am known in sailing, but I do not get recognized often in the street. I would not like to be a celebrity. I get nice letters from fans who want signed pictures, and I reply to every one, even if it takes time.
**D Tomas (tennis player)**  
It feels great to walk on the court and feel the crowd's support. At my last tournament, it got a bit crazy with many people around. I enjoy being recognized by fans when I am out shopping. But it has some downsides. My last girlfriend did not like it when I got too much attention from female fans. Tennis players travel a lot, and that is why we broke up. It was hard, but you have to make sacrifices in sports; you need to be serious and professional. I focus on my game now and will catch up on other things in life after I retire, which happens early in this sport."
FCE_33,B2,"Young Shoppers**
Shopping in a supermarket with children can be very hard for some parents. One mother says, ""They want everything they see. If it’s not a new sugary cereal, it’s a Disney video or a comic. Usually, they want all three. I can’t buy everything, and when I say yes, I feel bad for buying unhealthy food. But I also feel bad when I say no all the time. I try to avoid taking them shopping, but I worry they need to learn how to make choices. I can’t win.""
Research shows that children ask to buy something every two minutes when they are in a supermarket. A lot of money is spent on advertising for children, mostly on TV. This advertising makes children want things, and they often do not understand why their parents say no. Parents often talk about how bad sugar is for teeth, but children do not listen when they see fun ads on TV.
Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, ""Most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, but these ideas are not always right. It is good for parents and children to talk about food. If children only hear about products from ads, they get a one-sided view. Parents feel they are competing with ads and often disappoint their children.""
The Independent Television Commission, which controls TV ads, does not allow ads to tell children to ask their parents to buy things. But Dibb says, ""The goal of advertising is to make people want to buy something. Even if they cannot say, 'Tell your mom to buy this,' that is what they want.""
Shopping with children can be stressful for parents because they have to decide which requests to agree to and which to refuse. One mother says she talks to her children about food and ads. She feels better because her son now thinks most ads are not good. They do not argue much in the supermarket because the children do not ask for things she does not want to buy.
Parents also admit they are not always consistent with their children’s requests. Mike, a father of a seven-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter, says, ""We say no to sweets for our son because they are bad for him, but we buy cream and chocolate for ourselves. It is nice to buy good things, and it is normal for children to want to share that. But I still get annoyed by their requests. It depends on how I feel. If I am happy, I am more likely to say yes. It is hard to be consistent.""
Supermarkets could help parents by moving sweets away from the checkout areas or by having play areas for children. Even if parents spend less money without their children, shopping without their children’s demands could bring in more customers."

**Five-Star Hotel with Modern Technology**
The Merrion Hotel is a new five-star hotel in Dublin. It took almost two years to change four old houses into this hotel. The hotel has the latest technology to help both the staff and the guests.
Peter MacCann is the General Manager. He wants his staff to know the guests' names. For special details about the guests, he uses a computer system. This system helps the hotel give good service to returning guests. It cost £250,000 to set up, but it will save money over time. MacCann likes how well it works. For example, if a guest asks for certain music CDs during their first stay, those CDs will be ready for them when they come back.
Many hotel guests often complain about room temperature. The hotel has a system that lets guests change the temperature in their rooms. They can adjust it by three degrees around the normal 18°C. The front desk can also change the temperature between 14°C and 25°C.
The hotel has special technology for business guests. MacCann thinks that about 65% of the guests will be business people. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that can also copy and print, and a video-conferencing system. The hotel is ready for new technology by adding extra cables. They rent televisions so they can change them for newer models easily. DVD recorders can also be updated.
Even with all this technology, MacCann wants guests to feel comfortable. The hotel has 145 large and cozy bedrooms. There is also a swimming pool, a gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a beautiful garden.
The food at the hotel is very good. Chef Patrick Guilbaud has a restaurant in the hotel. His restaurant already had two Michelin stars before he moved it to the Merrion. He has made a new kitchen that is modern and better than before. The hotel has good parking too. This helps the hotel have a great restaurant without taking big financial risks. With good technology and staff, the Merrion Hotel is likely to be very successful.

FCE_40,B2,"Where I Get My Energy**
Emma Marsden asked six women how they get their energy in life.
A. **Jeanette Kupfermann, Journalist and Author:** ""I get energy from excitement. I like to do things that are a challenge. When I learn something new, I feel very energetic. I also get energy from rhythm. Right now, I am learning flamenco dancing. Dance is fun and gives me energy. If I am bored, I feel tired. Doing something useful, even a little, gives me energy.""
B. **Linda Kelsey, Magazine Editor:** ""I have a lot of work, but I enjoy it. I love my job, so it does not feel hard. If you like what you do, you don’t feel sad, even if you are tired. I need a good amount of sleep. When I sleep six hours a night, I feel a bit tired. I know exercise gives me energy, but I need to find the energy to do it! I go to a yoga class once a week and try to exercise at home. After I exercise, I feel much better. I often feel low in the afternoon, so I think it is good to eat something then.""
C. **Annie Nightingale, Disc Jockey:** ""I don’t eat very healthy food for energy. I think my energy comes from being positive and excited. I don’t like negative people. I believe we should enjoy life. It is important to achieve things and set goals. I love my job, and the last two years have been exciting. I work with many young and lively people, which gives me energy. I enjoy taking photos, even if I am not very good at it. I also write words for fun songs when I travel.""
D. **Floella Benjamin, Author and TV Presenter:** ""My energy comes from doing things I enjoy. I believe in what I do, both at work and with my family. Being positive helps me. I love working with kids because they give so much energy. Energy is like a natural feeling that comes from talking to others. Just smile at people and see how good it feels when they smile back. I try to eat healthy food and don’t smoke or drink, but I don’t have a special exercise plan. I get my energy from playing with kids.""
E. **Deborah Moggach, Author and Playwright:** ""I love making a garden from a bad place. I once turned a concrete area into a garden by breaking the concrete and adding soil. This gives me more energy than exercise. I also feel energy when I know someone wants to read my writing. I enjoy sneaking into a farmer's land or a forest. If someone sees me, I say, 'Oh, what a lovely place! I didn’t know it was private.' I like this because it feels fun and childlike.""
F. **Katherine Monblot, Therapist:** ""I think it is important to care about what you do in life. I like to take risks and get bored easily, which keeps me motivated. Doing things I don’t want to do makes me tired. I used to be part of many committees, but I didn’t like how they took my time. You only have a certain amount of energy, so use it for what is most important to you."""
FCE_45,B2,"**Ice Skating**
Ice skating has been around for thousands of years. Archaeologists found skates made from animal bones. These bone skates were used until iron skates were made in Scandinavia around the year 200 AD. For rich people in Scandinavia, skating was an important skill.
In the early 1900s, skating was seen as stylish. But in 1924, an 11-year-old girl named Sonja Henie changed this. She made skating more athletic and popular. Today, skating combines art and sports. It is both beautiful and hard work.
For beginners, balance and control are very important. You can go faster as you get better. To balance, your legs should be slightly bent, and your body should lean a little forward. When you start skating, your heels should almost touch, and your feet should point outwards. Push with your back foot and make small movements with the other foot. It is not too hard! If you practice, you can make bigger movements as you get better.
Learning how to fall is one of the first things a skater should know. Even the best skaters fall sometimes. To fall safely, stay relaxed. This helps reduce the pain when you hit the ice. To get up, use your hands to kneel, then stand up.
Once you can skate confidently, you can try different styles like figure skating, freestyle, distance skating, speed skating, and skating in pairs. It is best to start with figure skating and then learn freestyle. Most ice rinks have teachers who can help you learn the basics quickly. 
Good skaters look relaxed and move easily. To skate well, you should practice exercises regularly. It is dangerous to skate with a stiff body, so warm-up exercises are important. These should include exercises for your legs, back, and shoulders, especially for your ankles and knees. After skating, do the same exercises to avoid stiffness.
Skating helps improve balance, coordination, relaxation, and movement. It is good for your heart and lungs and makes your body stronger. When combined with swimming or jogging, skating is a great way to stay healthy and fit."

If you want to see something that makes people cry happy tears, it is a child winning a medal. Julia Gregson talked to three young stars and their mothers about their lives.
A. Annika Reeder, 15, won a gold medal for gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games. She wants to be a physiotherapist and compete in the next Olympics. ""The training is very hard right now. I don’t have time to watch TV, go out with friends, or do much besides gymnastics and school. I take it one day at a time. When I feel very tired, my coach sometimes gives me a day off, but usually, I keep going. You can’t take too many days off because it makes you stiff.""
B. Annika's mother said, ""From a young age, Annika showed great talent. I have seen some parents push their children, but it doesn’t work. To perform at Annika's level takes a lot of time and energy. You have to want to do it. People say we, as parents, have given up a lot, but they don’t see what the sport has given us. We love it and what it has done for Annika. Before gymnastics, she was a shy girl who hid behind me. Now she has friends from all over the world and is very confident.""
C. Sarah Stokes started show-jumping at ten years old. She has won the British National Championship. ""It’s good that my parents like show-jumping because they train me and take me everywhere in the horse box. The shows can last from one to five days. I never get tired of it; I love show-jumping. Even if my parents were not there, I would still do it because I am very determined. I am happy when they are proud of me, but I do it for myself. This year, I want to qualify for the British young riders (under-18) team. My big dream is to win a gold medal at the Olympics.""
D. Sarah's mother said, ""From the moment Sarah sat on a horse at age 1, I knew she loved it. When she was 5, she would wake up early to exercise her pony. To qualify for big shows, we travel all over England. To save money, we sleep in the horse box. Sarah is very organized. She is always happy on a horse and knows what to do. Watching your child succeed at something they love is amazing.""
E. Jane McShane, 10, is the Under-14 Chess Champion in Britain. ""It is very friendly at chess tournaments. I know everyone, and it is fun. When I play, I don’t concentrate as much as I should. I just look around and don’t think too much. I am not scared of being proud; I don’t talk about my success at school because I don’t like to feel embarrassed.""
F. Jane's mother said, ""Jane played her first game when she was 5. My father said, 'Let’s see if she likes it.' My father tried to teach me when I was young, but I was bored. Jane loved it from the start. By the end of that day, she knew all the moves, and by age 6, she was beating adults. When she wins, I am happy, but if she wanted to stop playing tomorrow, I would support her. I don’t want to stop her from doing something she is good at. If she has this talent, I want her to use it."""
FCE_29,B2,"
Chris Greener was fourteen years old when he told his teacher he wanted to join the navy after school. The teacher joked, ""What do you want to be? The flagpole on a ship?"" This was funny because Chris was already almost two meters tall. Today, he is the tallest man in Britain at 228 cm.
Every ten years, people in Europe get a little taller. More tall people are being born, but this does not mean we are becoming a super race. Instead, we are going back to how our ancestors were. We are getting taller because we are eating better food now. Professor Chris Stringer says we are becoming like Cro-Magnons, who lived 40,000 years ago.
Long ago, our ancestors ate many different foods. Women gathered fruits and herbs, and men hunted animals. They ate from 85 different wild plants. About 9,000 years ago, farming started, but it changed our diet badly. Now, most of our food comes from just three plants: wheat, rice, and maize. This poor diet has hurt our health. 
In Ohio, scientists found that when people started farming corn, they became sick and underweight. Tooth decay and diseases increased. Even though farming could feed more people, many were not healthy. Only recently have richer countries started to eat better again. In the US, the average man is now 179 cm tall, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm.
This is a good change, but there are still problems. Beds have not gotten longer since 1860, and there is less space for legs on planes and trains. Clothes companies have to change their sizes often. 
Some scientists think we might stop growing taller soon. Robert Fogel from a university says we could reach a height of 193 cm this century. But there is a problem: while some people are getting taller because of better food, as a group, we might be getting shorter. 
10,000 years ago, during the last ice age, people were rounder and taller to keep warm. Now that the climate is warmer, we seem to be getting thinner and shorter. If the planet keeps getting hotter, we might get even shorter. 
**Questions:**
1. How tall is Chris Greener?
2. What did Chris want to do after school?
3. What are the three main plants that provide food for many people today?
4. What happened to people's health when they started farming corn?
5. What is the average height of men in the US?"
FCE_57,B2,"Studio Audiences**
What is it like to be in the audience when a television show is being made? Cosmo Landesman found out. Studio audiences are a common part of television, but many people do not understand them. When we watch game shows, we see the audience getting excited and wonder, ""Who are these people?""
Some people think that studio audiences are not important. They say that even people who work in television do not respect them. I thought studio audiences were just made up of silly people who want to be on TV. But there is no typical studio audience. They come from different backgrounds and jobs. Television wants to attract different people for different shows.
Many people who watch TV at home do not understand why anyone would want to be in a studio audience. Why would someone apply for tickets, travel far, and sit for a long time in a studio just to watch what they can see at home? One reason is that people hope to be on TV for a moment. I did not believe this until I spoke to Angela. She said, ""I came for a chance to be on television.""
Another reason is that people are curious to see how a show is made. But the most common reason I heard was, ""A friend gave me a ticket."" Most of us have not been in a studio audience, but we think we know what it is like. You sit close to strangers while someone shows cards that say APPLAUD or LAUGH, and you clap or laugh when you see them. This is true for some shows, but not all. One studio manager said, ""We believe a show should be good enough not to need these signs.""
Is there a real difference between being in a studio and watching TV at home? For Claire, being in a studio is ""more exciting."" Charlotte liked being part of live television. She said, ""Last year I saw my favorite comedian. When you watch him at home, you miss a lot."" What I missed was seeing the live actors. I could only see the back of someone’s head. The opening scenes were far from where I sat, so I ended up watching the show on a monitor.
Going to a studio may not be the best way to watch television, but for most people, it was just fun and a free night of entertainment."

**Favorite Places**
**Bruce**  
I do not like wild landscapes. I like places with people. When I travel, I enjoy lovely villages with old temples, not empty deserts. When I was eight, I went to school in England. On Saturdays, I would ride my bike to the village of Lastingham in its beautiful valley. Cycling helped me relax from school. I loved exploring the hills, valleys, and old villages. I am from Scotland, so the landscape felt familiar but also different. I still visit there today. I wrote about my adventures in my diary. This was my first try at travel writing.
**Sophia**  
There is a small train that goes from Hythe to Dungeness, run by volunteers. I always travel first class because it is not much more expensive than regular tickets. The view is not amazing. The train goes over Romney Marsh with sheep and next to a canal. But there is one part of the journey I love - when the train goes through back gardens. For a few moments, we see people doing everyday things, like making tea or folding a chair. I see myself in their eyes, a woman in a small train, looking into their homes. I like the simple landscape of fields, sheep, and a distant grey sea. It makes me look closer and find something new.
**Matthew**  
The Hartland Peninsula is a quiet and beautiful coast. The beaches are hard to reach and have many rocks, so there are not many people here. Some brave surfers come, but most visitors just enjoy the sea. This coast faces the Atlantic and is known for shipwrecks. There are walking paths along the coast and trips into beautiful valleys with oak trees, ferns, and wildflowers. We stay in a simple place with a family in the village of Southole.
**Annette**  
My favorite place in England is the Trough of Bowland. It is a wide-open area perfect for hiking. There are not many people living there or visiting. It is quiet and remote, and I like the feeling of space. I found this place by chance when I was a student, and I visit every year, either alone, with my boyfriend, or now with my son. It has not changed much since my first visit. Having a child makes these visits special. I feel sad that he is growing up in a city.
**James**  
I bought Glenthorne, my favorite house in Britain. I wanted peace and to reconnect with my English roots. I grew up in what is now Sri Lanka, but when I was twelve, I went to school in Devon, in the west of England. I used to ride my bike around the moors and village streets. There was a story about a place we would never cycle past: if you went down the driveway, you would never return. That place was Glenthorne. It is my dream place. It is a magical, quiet, romantic house. You can only hear the sea, wind, and birds.

FCE_42,B2,"'HAPPY HUNTING GROUND'**
We are 'animal people' who love all kinds of animals. One afternoon, my daughter called me at work. She was excited because she found a pine snake. ""Can we keep him?"" she asked. I said, ""Yes, but only for one night."" We had a special tank for animals that visit us for a short time. 
I got home late. I quickly put a pot on the stove to boil. Suddenly, I heard my son screaming, ""Oh, Mother! Help! Do something!"" I ran to his room. There was a problem with our cat, Domino, and a white mouse named Bianca, which I got as a Mother's Day gift. Domino had the mouse in his mouth and was running around the room. 
I jumped into the room and tripped over something. I saw the snake escaping from the table and onto the floor. The snake was long and strong. The cat, the mouse, and the kids were all jumping and screaming. The dog was barking loudly. The pot in the kitchen boiled over, and I ran to turn it off. 
I caught Domino by the tail and saved the mouse from him. The mouse was wet but not hurt. I then looked at the snake. It seemed very strong. I sat on the floor and tried to calm the snake down. Slowly, the snake relaxed and rested its head on its body. 
I carefully lifted the snake and walked to the end of the garden. I wanted to let the snake go. I pointed it towards a tree. When I let go of the snake's head, it surprised me by climbing up onto my shoulders like a warm scarf. 
My four children and I stood together with the snake. My oldest child, DJ, said, ""Mum, you are warm, and the shed is not."" I asked the children to help me encourage the snake to move. Slowly, the snake went up the wall and disappeared over the roof. As the last part of the snake left our yard, my three-year-old son, Clay, said, ""Wow, that was one big snake!"""
FCE_59,B2,"'Write to Me!'**
In our fast world with phones and computers, writing letters is becoming less common. But for me, getting a letter is special. There is excitement when it arrives, joy in seeing who sent it, and happiness in reading it. Writing letters has been part of my life for a long time. I started by writing little notes to my mother. She always made me write thank-you letters for Christmas and birthday gifts. It did not matter if they were short or messy, as long as they were letters.
When I was 18, I moved to London to study to be a doctor. I wrote to my mother every week, and she wrote back. Sometimes my father wrote to me, and I loved his funny letters. Most letters from home talked about everyday life with my parents and their friends. We also called each other, but I remember the letters more.
I also received letters from my boyfriends. Many of them had to work or study far away, so we wrote to each other. Writing letters helped our relationships. I found it easier to say what I felt in writing than by talking. I love letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. Notes are nice, but it is even better to get a lot of news in a letter! I especially like letters with beautiful stamps from other countries.
I get letters from my friend Mangala in Sri Lanka, a penfriend in Australia, and another in Vancouver. I also have a friend in France. We started writing after talking in a restaurant on holiday. If I had not asked for her address, I would not have been able to write to her. Now we write regularly. I can practice my French with her because she does not speak English. We have visited each other’s homes.
This summer, my family and I visited my American penfriend in Texas. We had been writing to each other for 29 years but had never met. People were surprised that we wrote for so long. The local newspaper even wrote about us!
I am happy that my children are also writing letters. Like my mother, I make them write their own thank-you letters. My daughter writes me little letters, just like I did for my mother. She and my son have penfriends in Texas, set up by my penfriend. I encourage everyone not to let letter writing become a lost art."

**Careless Tourists Damage Ancient Rock Art**
Many ancient pictures carved into rocks in France are being damaged. There are about 36,000 drawings on rocks in Mont Bego in the French Alps. Scientists are worried that these drawings will not last for future generations. The mountain has drawings that are 4,000 years old. They show cows, fields, and different gods and goddesses. 
More and more tourists are visiting the site, but some are ruining the pictures by writing on them. Jean Clottes, who is the chairman of the International Committee on Rock Art, says, ""People think these pictures will always be here. But if the damage continues, there will be nothing left in 50 years."" He has seen tourists stepping on the drawings and damaging them. Some visitors even take pieces of the rock home as souvenirs. 
When tourists cannot take a good photo, they rub the drawings to make them clearer. The weather makes the drawings smooth, but when the sun shines, some people rub them to see them better. Some visitors bring sticks to scratch their own drawings or names into the rocks.
Experts have different ideas about how to protect the drawings. Henry de Lumley, from the Museum of Natural History in Paris, thinks the best way to save the site is to make it a ""no-go"" area. This means only guided tours would be allowed. He believes that if we do not protect the site, it will be destroyed, and important research will stop. 
Clottes disagrees. He thinks that closing the site will upset local people. The site was made a historic monument by the Ministry of Culture, and we should try to save it. David Lavergne, a regional architect, also wants to keep the site open. He says, ""Henry de Lumley's idea is not the best. We want people to see the site, but it is hard to stop damage because the area is very big. We may need to charge a fee to help pay for guards.""
Annie Echassoux, who has studied the site, is worried that it is now easier for tourists to visit. They can avoid a long walk by using vehicles. She believes the best solution is to block off the area and have guides. ""We need money to protect this historic site,"" she says. ""If we do not act, we will lose the drawings for the next generation."""
FCE_32,B2,"Young Shoppers**
Shopping in a supermarket with children can be very hard for some parents. One mother says, ""They want everything they see. If it’s not a new sugary cereal, it’s a Disney video or a comic. Usually, they want all three. I can’t buy everything, and when I say yes, I feel bad for buying unhealthy food. But I also feel bad when I say no all the time. I try to avoid taking them shopping, but I worry they need to learn how to make choices. I can’t win.""
Research shows that children ask to buy something every two minutes when they are in a supermarket. A lot of money is spent on advertising for children, mostly on TV. This advertising makes children want things, and they often do not understand why their parents say no. Parents often talk about how bad sugar is for teeth, but children do not listen when they see fun ads on TV.
Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, ""Most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, but these ideas are not always right. It is good for parents and children to talk about food. If children only hear about products from ads, they get a one-sided view. Parents feel they have to compete with ads and often disappoint their children.""
The Independent Television Commission, which controls TV ads, does not allow ads to tell children to ask their parents to buy things. But Susan Dibb says, ""The goal of advertising is to make people want to buy something. Even if they cannot say, 'Tell your mom to buy this,' that is what they want.""
Shopping with children can be stressful for parents because they have to decide which requests to agree to and which to refuse. One mother says she talks to her children about food and ads. She feels better because her son now thinks most ads are not good. They do not argue much in the supermarket because the children do not ask for things she does not want to buy.
Parents also admit they are not always consistent with their children’s requests. Mike, a father of a seven-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter, says, ""We say no to sweets for our son because they are bad for him, but we buy cream and chocolate for ourselves. It is nice to buy good things, and it is normal for children to want to share that. But I still get annoyed by their requests. It depends on how I feel. If I am happy, I am more likely to say yes. It is hard to be consistent.""
Supermarkets could help parents by moving sweets away from the checkout areas or by having play areas for children. Even if parents spend less money without their children, shopping without their children’s demands would likely bring in more customers."
FCE_65,B2,"Climbing Walls**
Climbers used to go to the mountains to climb. Now, people can climb indoors or outdoors. The crowd is excited. High on the climbing wall, hanging upside down by two fingers, is the French climber Francois Lombard. He is in the World Cup Climbing Championships at the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham. This arena is also known for the TV show Gladiators, but both events have one thing in common - The Wall.
Before the 1960s, climbers practiced on cliffs. In winter, they had to deal with cold weather, go for walks, or climb on snow and ice in Scotland. As climbing became more popular, it was important for climbers to stay fit. Since they could not use cliffs for much of the year, they started to climb on brick edges or stone buildings. This helped them keep their fingers strong and avoid boredom.
Soon, many sports centers built climbing walls with special bricks. One of the first climbing walls was made by Don Robinson, a physical education teacher, in the mid-1960s at Leeds University. He created a wall with natural rock in concrete. Many climbing walls like this were built in sports halls in the 1970s, but they had problems. These walls were only straight up and down, while real cliffs have different shapes like overhangs.
In 1985, a Frenchman named Francois Savigny made a new material that looked like the shapes on cliffs. This material could be attached to any wall and removed when climbers wanted something new. French companies also started to make climbing walls with steel frames. Steel was lighter than concrete, so they could build overhanging walls easily. This new system gave climbers many different holds to use."
FCE_61,B2,"'So You Want to Be an Actor'**
Do you want to be an actor? If you tell someone this, they might say it is a risky job. Acting can be risky because there are many actors but not enough jobs for them. When you decide to be an actor, some friends may think you are crazy, but others may support you. Everyone will give you different advice. It is a personal choice, and you are responsible for your own dreams.
There are no easy ways to become an actor. You do not have to take written tests, and there is no guarantee that you will get a job after your training. Success depends on luck and talent. There is a need for new actors, and acting can be exciting and rewarding.
Many people want to know what talent is. Talent is a natural skill and imagination. Imagination is hard to measure. It also depends on a person's courage and belief in what they do. 
Why do people want to act? It can be hard to explain. In theater, the important thing is the moment when the actor connects with the audience. This connection is what makes actors want to perform.
If you ask actors how they succeed, they may not know. They understand some things about their skills and the skills of others, but they do not take success for granted. They know they are only as good as their last job, and fame can be short. 
Disappointment is a big problem for actors. Last month, you might have been without work, selling clothes or serving food. Then, you may get a chance to audition for a role. But even if you want the job, you might not get it. Because of this, actors often do not talk about their chances. They find ways to deal with the stress of trying for a role and the fear of being rejected. No one likes to be rejected. 
From the first moment you start trying for acting jobs, you are saying you are ready and hopefully talented enough. In many ways, it is up to you. If you do not care enough, others may not care about you either."

Chris Greener was fourteen years old when he told his teacher he wanted to join the navy after school. The teacher joked, ""What do you want to be? The flagpole on a ship?"" This was funny because Chris was already almost two meters tall. Today, he is 228 cm tall and is the tallest man in Britain.
Every ten years, people in Europe get a little taller. More tall people are being born, but this does not mean we are becoming a super race. Instead, we are going back to how we were as cavemen. We are now getting better food than before, which is helping us grow taller. Professor Chris Stringer says, ""We are becoming like Cro-Magnons, the people who lived 40,000 years ago.""
In the past, our ancestors ate many different foods. Women gathered fruits and herbs, while men hunted animals. They ate from about 85 different wild plants. But about 9,000 years ago, farming started, and this changed everything. Now, most of the world's land is used for farming, and three main plants—wheat, rice, and maize—give us more than half of our food. This simple diet has hurt our health. 
In Ohio, scientists found that when people started farming corn, healthy hunter-gatherers became sick and underweight. They had more tooth problems and diseases. Farming allowed more people to live on the same land, but many of these people were not healthy. Only recently have richer countries started to eat better, like our ancestors did. 
Now, the average man in the US is 179 cm tall, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. This is good, but there are still problems. Beds have been the same length (190 cm) since 1860. Also, there is less space for legs in planes and trains, and clothing companies have to change their sizes often.
The question is: how tall can we get? Some scientists think we might reach a height of 193 cm this century. But there is a twist. While people may be getting taller because of better food, as a group, we are actually getting smaller. A long time ago, during the last ice age, people were rounder and taller to keep warm. Now that the climate is warmer, we seem to be getting thinner and shorter, even when we eat well. If the planet keeps getting warmer, we might get even shorter. 
**Questions:**
1. How tall was Chris Greener when he was fourteen?
2. What did Chris want to do after school?
3. What are the three main plants that provide most of our food today?
4. What did scientists find out about hunter-gatherers in Ohio?
5. What is the average height of men in the US?"

Matt Froggatt used to work as an insurance agent in London, but now he runs a sheep farm. He worked in the city for 14 years. Matt thought the city was fun at first, but later it became boring. He did not plan to leave his job yet, but he lost it suddenly. He did not get a lot of money when he left, but it was enough to start his farm. He met the head chef of a local hotel, which is one of the best in the country. By selling meat to the hotel, more people learned about his farm. Now, he also sells meat online. Matt is happy to be out of the office, but he still works long hours, like before.
**The Painter**  
Ron Able was a manager in advertising, but now he is an artist. He started painting as a hobby and found it more exciting than his job. He decided to leave his job and become an artist. A career counselor helped him. Ron told the counselor that he did not want to go back to his old job. This surprised the counselor because most people want to find work quickly. Ron and his wife got married young, and their children are grown up, so they did not need to worry about money. They moved to the north of England, where they did not know anyone. They left their friends, but they still keep in touch, and many friends visit them.
**The Hat Maker**  
Katherine Goodison worked as a lawyer for five years before starting her own hat business in her London flat. She enjoyed her job as a lawyer and earned a lot of money, but she worked very long hours. Katherine did not want to become a senior partner and work even more, so she left. Many people thought she would get bored, but she has not. She has deadlines for her fashion business, which keeps her busy. Katherine feels happier and less stressed now. However, she misses talking to her colleagues. She loves being responsible for her work. If she does a bad job, she knows it is her fault. When she worked for a company, she cared, but now she cares even more because her name is on the products.
**The Masseur**  
Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16 years before becoming a masseur at the Life Centre in London. He started working in finance when he was 22 years old. He liked the excitement of the job, but he did not find it rewarding. In 1989, he almost lost his job, so he decided to leave and travel for a year. During that year, he thought about what he wanted to do. He was interested in health, so he visited gyms and talked to the owners. Paul knew he needed training to change careers, so he took courses in massage. Then, he got a part-time job at the Life Centre. He has no regrets about his choice. He feels more in control of his life now and is very happy."
FCE_5,B2,"'A Winning Game'**
Two brothers are finding that their childhood game is good for business. Dave and Norm Lagasse are two brothers in their forties. They live in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA. They are playing a game called pichenotte. This game is special to them because their grandfather, Lucien Rajotte, brought it from Quebec, Canada. He taught the game to the family. Every weekend and holiday, the family played pichenotte and had a great time.
When the family moved to New Mexico, they still played the game. Their grandfather made the pichenotte board from old wooden crates. Visitors were often curious because no one knew the game in southern USA. Three years ago, Dave saw that their old board was damaged, so he made a new one. A relative saw it and wanted one, and then a friend wanted one too.
One night, the brothers took a new board to a sports bar in Santa Fe. People were surprised and said, ""I won’t play that silly game."" But soon, they sat down to play and enjoyed it! When people asked about the game’s history, Dave did some research. He found that the game probably started in India, where a similar game called 'carroms' is played. This game changed into 'squails' in Britain, and British people brought it to Canada. The name pichenotte comes from the French-Canadian version of the game in Quebec.
Pichenotte can be played by two to four people. Each player has 12 pieces called 'pucks'. They flick the pucks across a round board using their fingers. If a puck goes into a small hole, it is worth 20 points. There are three rings around the hole worth 15, 10, and 5 points. The game has eight small posts that make it harder to play. A game usually lasts about two minutes.
When the brothers saw how much people liked the game at the bar, they made more boards and took them to markets and craft fairs. Many people came to buy them, and the game became popular. They even started having championships and a trophy called the 'Lord Pichenotte Cup'. As more people learned about the game, the brothers sold boards quickly. They decided to make pichenotte boards full-time. They set up a workshop in their garage and have made more than 450 boards. Each board is made of birchwood and mahogany, weighs 12kg, and is 1cm thick. Norm says, ""They are very strong and last a long time.""
The boards cost $595 each and can be bought from the brothers' website. There are no professional pichenotte players or TV shows about the game yet. But the brothers hope that one day they will have a nice car instead of a workshop full of wood. For now, they are happy to play the game they love."
FCE_41,B2,"**WELCOME TO THE MODEL VILLAGE**
When you first come to the Model Village, it is hard to believe that a few years ago this was just a flat piece of land covered with weeds. For a long time, people thought this land was useless. One man, with the help of his wife, worked very hard to change this land into the beautiful place you see today. 
Many tons of soil and clay were moved to change the flat land into the lovely landscape you see now. Machines like bulldozers helped, but a lot of hard work was also done by hand. After the land was shaped, about 1,000 tons of topsoil were added to create the lawns, flower beds, and rock gardens. 
In the Model Village, hundreds of trees and bushes were planted. These plants were chosen carefully because they needed to survive near the sea and in strong winter winds. Most plants came from local garden centers, but some were brought from Canada and New Zealand. 
The whole village was created by Colin Sims. He made over 100 models by himself over nine years, starting in 1972. The models are made from different materials like stone, concrete, wood, and plastic so they can last in all kinds of weather. At first, Colin needed help from experts to learn how to use these materials, but soon he became an expert himself. 
You will see that all the models are made to the same scale and have many small details. This took a lot of patience and special building techniques. The Model Village is very popular and is known for its high quality and care. The methods used here have been used in other model villages in England and even in some college courses about modeling. 
All the buildings in the village show traditional British styles and are not based on one specific place. One of the most impressive buildings is the Manor House. This is a typical 13th-century stone building with a brick tower and stone walls, similar to manor houses in the West Country. 
As you walk around the village, you will also see a Castle, St Mary's Church, a zoo, and a mini golf course, which is the newest addition. Please stay on the paths during your visit and do not touch the models; if you slip, it can take us a long time to fix them. You can take photos from the paths only. Dogs are welcome on a short lead. 
To make your visit more fun, you will find buttons in front of some models. Press these buttons to see the models move. At the end of your visit, we would love to hear your comments. We are always planning new models, and your ideas can help us create a more interesting display. We also want to know if any models did not meet your expectations. We are always updating the models and need to know which ones need work. 
We hope you enjoy your visit and look forward to seeing you again. Don’t forget to tell your friends about it!"

Every week, British tabloid newspapers print pictures that invade people's privacy. These pictures often break the rules that newspaper editors should follow. Sometimes, pop stars take pictures with paparazzi, but this is not common. Most of the time, it hurts people in the public eye when they see their private moments on the front page. Very few people ask for help from the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), which was created to help with these problems. These pictures are rarely important for the public. For example, do private pictures of pop stars help solve a crime? How does a picture of a famous actress on a hotel balcony help public health and safety? The actress has complained about long-distance pictures before. Since she was in a hotel, where people expect privacy, she had a good reason to complain, but she did not take any action. It is a scandal that the PCC did not start an investigation. 
The PCC should look into the recent story about a pop star's love life. Like the actress, the pop star has not made a formal complaint. Shouldn't the PCC take action against these bad stories? This seems like a good idea. It could lead to many decisions against newspapers. Other newspapers would report this, and it would be on TV and radio. The public would not support these newspapers, and editors would have to stop publishing such stories. Photographers would also be affected and might not be able to hide and take pictures of celebrities anymore.
If the PCC decided to act like a ""police officer,"" there would be problems. How would it decide to start an investigation? Should it talk to the person affected and encourage them to complain? If the person does not want to complain, should the PCC still investigate? Celebrities and royals might expect the PCC to take action, but they could be upset if it does not. The job is too big for the PCC. How could it watch all the British press: national, local, and magazines? There is also the problem of embarrassment. Even if someone’s privacy is invaded, would they want to go through an investigation? Most people probably just want to forget about it and move on with their lives. Some might have other reasons to stay quiet. They might have a worse story that they do not want to become public if they complain. In this way, the PCC could also become a problem.
One British comedian had trouble with the press when he and his wife were secretly photographed on their honeymoon. He did not complain then, and he did not complain later when a photographer took pictures of him and his family on holiday. He was afraid that the newspaper would use the pictures again and say he was angry, thinking it was just a joke. This fear is understandable. People think they will be targeted again if they challenge the tabloids. It is hard to find an easy solution to this serious problem.
**Questions:**
1. What do British tabloid newspapers often print?
2. What is the Press Complaints Commission (PCC)?
3. Why did the actress have a good reason to complain?
4. What might happen if the PCC takes action against newspapers?
5. Why did the comedian not complain about the pictures taken of him?"

FCE_17,B2,"'Confident People: What’s Their Secret?'**
Confident people seem to be born that way, but many say it is a skill they learned. Nina Hathway talks to five people about how they became confident.
**A. Jenny**  
When I left school, I was very shy. I thought I would always be shy. When I was about twenty-five, I helped at my daughter’s school. I was nervous, but I did well. Someone suggested I take a university course. On my first day, I was very scared, but my confidence grew. Working at the school changed my life.
**B. Michaela**  
Four years ago, my father got sick, and I had to run the family business. I was scared and became too aggressive. I learned that to be confident, you must believe in yourself. If work is too hard, I don’t feel guilty if I leave some tasks for the next day. When I face something difficult, I remind myself that I have nothing to lose. Fear can make you feel less confident, so I talk to myself to calm down.
**C. Lisa**  
People think I am confident, but I often feel scared. I learned to look confident because it is important in TV. Interviewing people showed me that many of us feel tense in important situations. My mother gave me good advice when I worried about my clothes: “Who is looking at you? Everyone is busy worrying about themselves.” I believe you gain confidence by facing your fears. I was nervous during my driving test, but I passed. After that, I felt more confident.
**D. Barbara**  
I feel confident because I enjoy my work. I have built my confidence over the years. If you keep working and learn from mistakes, you will be more confident next time. I work hard and am liked at the restaurant, but not everyone likes me. I don’t let that bother me. You must like yourself for who you are. My company offers training courses, which help me feel better about myself. It is good to set small goals and see what you achieve.
**E. Kim**  
After college, I worked as a secretary. I sat in meetings and was scared to speak. Eventually, I found the confidence to share my ideas. When I started working in politics, I had never spoken in public and was very nervous. I told myself, “Don’t be silly. People do this every day.” I also wrote down some notes to help me. I think everyone feels a little nervous when speaking in public. The secret to confidence is to keep telling yourself, “Nothing is impossible.”"
FCE_47,B2,"A Visit to Malaysia**
Paul Forster goes to a kite-flying festival and spends a nervous night in the forest. Adnan Ali smiled when I gave him his broken kite. ""You have to keep it,"" he said. ""It's traditional. If the line breaks, finders keep it. I have many more kites."" He showed me a pile of beautiful kites at his feet. All the kites were 120 cm wide and long, made of paper and bamboo. We sat in the shade of the trees behind the Beach of the Seven Lagoons in Kelantan, and watched Malaysia's biggest kite festival. 
In the middle of the beach, there were 10 platforms where helpers held up the kites. A row of competitors held the lines of their kites and waited for the countdown. When the whistle blew, the crowd cheered, and the kites flew into the sky like rockets. More than 500 men and boys were in the competition, which lasts for five days every year. Each person had four different kites to show. The kites were judged on how they looked, how stable they were in the air, and how well they flew. 
""Flying kites is not hard,"" said Adnan, ""but making them takes real skill. Come to my house, and I will show you how to make a kite."" I got five invitations that day, and I decided to go to his house. There, I drank cold tea and ate fish crackers in a big room. As it got dark, he asked me to come back the next day to help him fix his kite, but I could not. Instead, I drove to the southern part of the state, heading towards Kuala Lumpur, into the mountains with thick rainforests. 
I took a wrong turn, and the road ended at a river. A small boat was waiting to take people across. Nearby, I saw a sign that said: ""Jelawang Jungle 3 km."" Before I started walking, I should have known that most of the path was steep and slippery. When I reached the track, I met Baba, who took care of a kitchen and some bamboo huts. I decided to stay there, trying not to think about the insects under my thin mattress. 
At night, it was very dark, and I heard many sounds. A waterfall was loud nearby, and many creatures were moving around. In the morning, I saw a great view of green mountains. In the afternoon, it rained. First, there was wind, then lightning hit the trees. I got very wet. As I slid down the hill, I wondered how the big butterflies avoided the rain. I also worried about my car getting washed away and if I would drown if I opened my mouth. Luckily, my car was still there, muddy, at the bottom of the hill. 
In Kota Bahru, the capital of Kelantan, everyone asked me questions: ""Where are you from?"" ""How old are you?"" They were very friendly. Kelantan is known for its kites, but I remember it more for the kindness of the people."

PET_21,B1,"**MONEY**
What is money? Money is things like the pound, the dollar, or the franc. They are like a gram or a kilometre. The difference is that you can use money to buy things. For example, a five-pound note can buy a book, a big bag of sweets, or two cinema tickets. But the note is just a piece of paper that does not cost much to make.
A long time ago, people did not have money like we do now. There were no banks or shops. Back then, Mr. Green, the farmer, traded the corn he grew for Mr. Hive's honey. This was a trade between two people who wanted what the other had. Over time, many societies made their own types of money, called 'currencies', so people could trade more easily. Different currencies started to work together, which is why today everyone uses a national currency."

2. **Get your facts right**: If you describe a town or explain something, make sure it is correct. Don’t write about things you are not sure about.
3. **Hold the reader's attention**: Start your story in an interesting way and end it with a surprise. A bad ending is not good.
4. **Think about the characters**: Make the people in your story feel real by using good words.
Your story must be your own work, between 2,000 and 2,500 words, typed, double-spaced, and on one side of the paper. We cannot accept stories by fax or email. You must include the application form with your story. We cannot return your story or discuss our decisions.
You should not have had any fiction printed in any magazine or book in this country. The story must not be printed or recorded anywhere in the world. Your fee of £5 will go to the Writers' Association. Make your cheque payable to Keep Writing and send it with the application form and your story to us. 
The closing date is 30 July, and we will tell the winner within one month. If you win, you must agree to have your story printed in our magazine."
PET_3,B1,"**THE FIRST WOMAN SCIENTIST**
Hypatia was born in Alexandria, Egypt, in 370 A.D. For many years, she was the only woman scientist in history books. Her father was the director of Alexandria University, and he made sure she got a good education. This was not common because most women did not have many chances to study.
After studying in Athens and Rome, Hypatia returned to Alexandria and started teaching mathematics. She became famous for her knowledge of new ideas. We do not have her books, but we know she wrote important works about math. Hypatia was also interested in technology and created some scientific tools to help her work.
At that time, many rulers were afraid of science, and people who studied it were in danger. In March 415, Hypatia was attacked in the street and killed."

PET_27,B1,"Grass**
Grass is one of the most successful plants in the world. There are more than 9,000 types of grass, and they grow in every part of the earth. Grass can live in very cold places like the Arctic and the Antarctic. 
Grasslands are home to many animals, from small insects and birds to big animals like cows and lions. All these animals need grass to live. 
Grass grows back very quickly after it is cut or damaged. Unlike other plants, new grass grows from below the soil, not from the top. This is why many animals can live together in one place. When they eat all the grass, new grass starts to grow again, so there is always food for them."

Kal Kaur Rai is a young woman who loves fashion. She just won the title of Young Achiever of the Year at the Asian Business Awards. Since she was a child, she liked to draw clothes and make designs. She did not tell her parents, who own a supermarket, that she wanted to work in fashion. She thought they wanted her to have a different job, so she went to university to study management.
After university, Kal moved to London and worked at an advertising agency. She went to many events but could not buy the designer clothes she wanted. So, she started to make skirts and tops for herself. Her friends liked her clothes and asked her to make some for them too. 
Kal found a small shop in London that agreed to sell her designs. The clothes were very popular, and none of them came back. This made her feel good, and she decided to leave her advertising job. She took a loan of £20,000 to start her own women’s clothing brand. 
Kal's parents were happy for her and said they would support her. Now, her clothes are sold in over 70 stores, and her business makes more than £500,000. Her designs are in fashion magazines, and she makes clothes for pop stars. She feels very lucky to have won this award. She says, ""What I do is my hobby - and I get paid for it! But remember, I've worked hard for this."""
PET_22,B1,"**Sunningdale Hotel**
The Sunningdale Hotel was built in 1913 and opened by Princess Louise. It has given good service to many people from all over the world. Over 50,000 guests from 174 different countries have stayed here in the last 80 years. 
The hotel is on a main road to the town center. It takes about 20 minutes by bus to get to the center of town. Buses to other parts of the town stop outside the hotel. Guests should not take buses with a blue sign that says ""Express"" because they do not stop near the hotel. An underground station is less than 100 meters away.
The hotel has 200 comfortable single rooms. Each room has hot and cold water. Showers, baths, and toilets are at the end of the hall. The hotel also has a shop, sitting rooms, four TV rooms, a table tennis room, a library, and a laundry. There are eight pianos for guests to use. There is parking for cars in the hotel area. Guests can get daily newspapers for free and buy stamps at the office.
Guests who stay for a long time must pay for their room every week in advance. They need to tell the hotel one week before they leave. Both short and long-term guests are welcome, but long-term guests get rooms first.
Meal times are: breakfast from 7 am to 9:30 am, lunch from 1 pm to 2 pm, and dinner from 5:30 pm to 7 pm. If guests are studying or working late, they can ask for dinner until 11 pm by writing their name on a list or calling before 7 pm. There are 10 choices for breakfast and dinner.
No animals or fires are allowed in the hotel. Guests should be quiet, especially between 11 pm and 8 am. If guests arrive by train, it is better to take a taxi to the hotel because it is far from the main train station."

Tom Cruise is a very successful actor. But his life was not always easy. When he was a young boy, Tom was shy and had trouble making friends. He liked to be in school plays.
After high school, Tom went to New York to find a job. He worked as a porter and also took drama classes. In 1980, a film director named Franco Zeffirelli gave Tom his first role in a movie. 
Ten years later, Tom became very famous. He was one of the highest-paid actors in Hollywood and earned a lot of money for each film. Today, Tom still acts in movies and has many fans all over the world."

Bo the cat wanted to explore a furniture van. She had a big adventure! The driver found her after he drove for more than 500 kilometres. It was a long day, and both the driver and Bo were hungry. The driver gave Bo some milk and tried to find her owner. He called his last customers, but they did not lose a cat. 
It was getting late, so he took Bo home for the night. The next morning, he took her to an animal hospital. Bo's owner was also looking for her. After searching everywhere, he remembered the furniture van that delivered to a neighbour. He remembered the name of the company. He called them, and soon Bo was back home safely.'"
PET_49,B1,"The Ghan Train**
Mark Ottaway took a train from Darwin, in the north of Australia, to Adelaide, in the south. The Ghan train goes across Australia, from the warm north to the cooler south. It is often called the ""famous Ghan,"" but it is known for being late.
In the 1920s, there was a plan to connect Darwin and Adelaide by train. A train line was built from Adelaide to Alice Springs, but it often had problems with flooding. A new train line was finished a few months before Mark's trip. The train can go fast, but the Ghan is not a high-speed train. It has few stops, and most passengers are on holiday.
The Ghan was first built to carry goods, not people. It was thought that sending goods from Europe to the south of Australia by train would save time and money. The Ghan is the first train in the world to go north to south across a continent.
When Mark waited to get on the Ghan, he saw that everyone was excited for the trip. Many older Australians were especially happy. The first stop was Katherine, where the train stayed for four hours. Some passengers got off to take a boat trip. Mark stayed on the train until Alice Springs, where he went on a two-day trip to Uluru (Ayers Rock) with a small group and a guide. Climbing the rock is not encouraged now, so they just walked around it and watched the sunset.
From Alice Springs, there are two trains a week going south, so many passengers stop there. The view from the train after Alice Springs is not very interesting. There is a lot of flat land with cattle. But on the third day, they reached the hills near the Southern Ocean. Mark's journey was over. The train may not have done everything the ads promised, but it took him to some amazing places in Australia."
PET_31,B1,"Climbing Ben Nevis**
Every year, many people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland. It is the highest mountain in Britain, and it can be very cold there. Climber Keith Hewitt talks about his first climb on Ben Nevis.
It was February, and it was my first big winter climb. We climbed up the north side of the mountain to a place called Tower Ridge. It is 600 meters high, which is a long climb. We planned to camp for three days in the ""Carries,"" which are big bowls in the mountain halfway up. We carried tents, sleeping bags, and metal spikes for our boots. You need these spikes because the snow can be very hard, like ice.
Even though some people in my group were very experienced, we took safety equipment. This included lights to get help, hard hats, and extra clothes. The weather was good, with no strong winds, but we still felt nervous when we started climbing. Climbing Ben Nevis in winter is always hard.
The path went up, and my legs felt heavy. I was the weakest climber, so I had to rest more often. The others stopped to let me catch up, but when I did, they started climbing again. I promised myself to train better before my next climb.
After climbing 200 meters, we reached Tower Ridge. It is only 1.5 meters wide, and the mountain drops down very far on both sides. We had to stay calm and focus on every step as we moved slowly along it. After seven hours of climbing, we reached the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and the island of Skye, which is 48 kilometers away. But we were not lucky; a mist came down.
Getting back down to camp can be as hard as going up. You need to read a map well because a wrong turn can lead to dangerous places in winter. I was happy we took turns reading the map. That first time, I only felt I enjoyed the climb when I was safe in the tent. But at least I made it to the top!"
PET_58,B1,"Anna's New School**
This week is very exciting because we have moved into our new school building! It is a great place. The builders used wood to make it, like our old school, but this school is also good for the environment. It took many months to build, and we watched it being built. It was exciting to see the builders working, but it also meant some nice land was gone. The building was noisy, and sometimes the builders had to stop because of the rain. We thought the building would never be finished.
Now, we have five big classrooms, much bigger than the old school next door. We share one room with people from the town for meetings. There is also a nursery, a nice dining room, and big changing rooms. We are excited to use them when our new sports field is ready.
When you enter the school, you will see that there are no heaters! The heat comes from the people inside, like the children, teachers, and computers. The building keeps the heat and sound inside, so when we sing in our classrooms, it feels like a concert hall!
You will also notice that there is a tree on the roof! The builders put it there because it is a custom in Austria, where the roof was made. The electricity for lights and computers comes from a wind turbine on a hill behind the school. We went with our teacher to see it yesterday, and it spins very fast. It is so big that we can see it from far away! We took pictures to put on our website.
Even though we are using the school now, some parts are still being finished. For example, we are putting on a play for our parents, but we have to go back to our old school hall to do it. The new hall will be ready next year. We are very happy with our new school, and our teachers say we will learn much faster here!"

PET_2,B1,"No Title**
A month ago, I did not know that on a Saturday afternoon in November, I would be 30 meters above the ground and enjoying it. Now, I looked down at the river far below me and understood why people love rock climbing. My friend Matt and I arrived at the Activity Centre on Friday evening. The place was not very nice, but we had everything we needed: beds, blankets, and food. We were happy to be out of the city and in the fresh air.
On Saturday morning, we met the other ten people in our group. Cameron came with his friends, Kevin and Simon. Sisters Carole and Lynn came with their friend Amanda. We all came from different places, and none of us knew the area. We knew we would spend the weekend outside, but we were not sure how.
Half of us went caving in the morning, while the others went rock climbing. Then we changed activities at lunchtime. Matt and I went to the caves first. Climbing out was harder than going in, but after a lot of pushing, we finally got out. We were covered in mud but happy and excited about what we had done."

**Letter to the Newport Evening News**
On Saturday afternoon, I left my handbag on the bus. In my handbag were my cheque book, address book, and my purse. My purse had about £50 in cash and some credit cards. When I realized I lost my handbag, it was too late. I didn’t know what to do. I am 72 years old, far from home, and I was very worried. I stood by the road and cried.
A young man asked me what was wrong. I told him what happened. He gave me some money for my bus fare home. When I told the bus driver what happened, he said I could keep the fare. I got home safely. Soon after, the phone rang. It was the manager of CityBus, the bus company. He said they had my handbag and would bring it back to me. 
I got my handbag back, and everything was inside and safe. I want to say thank you to everyone who helped me that day. I appreciate their kindness and honesty.

PET_60,B1,"Sharks**
Sharks are some of the most scary animals in the ocean. They are very good at finding food in the water because they can see well and feel movement with special lines on their bodies. This makes sharks dangerous for smaller sea animals that they eat.
Sharks are like other fish in some ways, but their bodies are different. For example, most sharks must swim all the time to breathe and stay alive, so they do not sleep much. Also, if sharks are turned upside down, they can stop moving completely. This is helpful for scientists who need to study sharks. It helps them learn more about these interesting animals."

PET_53,B1,"'Joining the Kirov Ballet
My name is Nathalie. Last year, I was one of the youngest foreign students to join the Kirov ballet school in St Petersburg, Russia. At my first ballet class, I was nervous because I didn’t know anyone. Everyone came to me and asked questions in Russian. I tried to speak in Russian, and then they started talking in English, so we could understand each other.
Now, six months later, everyone is very nice to me. My Russian has improved a lot, and I understand my teachers. For the first two weeks after I arrived, my mom stayed with me. When she left, I felt a little sad. I even called her late at night because I felt lonely.
The ballet classes in Russia are harder than in England. I eat a lot to keep my energy up. This helps me do well in class. In the evenings, I watch my favorite films on my computer, but sometimes I fall asleep before the movie ends.
Now that I feel settled, I feel at home here. I like to walk around the city and visit different shops, even in December when it was very cold. I bought a fur hat because it was minus 10 degrees Celsius, but the Russians said it was warm for that time of year! My room is warm and cozy.
Right now, we are getting ready for a new show, and there is a competition for young dancers that I will enter. I feel very lucky to be here.'"
PET_55,B1,"**THE ICEHOTEL**
For many years, the Arctic was a popular place to visit in the summer to see the midnight sun. In winter, only a few people lived there, and they enjoyed the snow and ice. In the late 1980s, people decided that the dark and cold winter could be a good thing. 
In the winter of 1990, a French artist named Jannot Derit had an exhibition in a special igloo (a building made of snow) in the small town of Jukkasjarvi, on the frozen Torne River. This building was called Arctic Hall, and it attracted many visitors. One night, some guests thought it would be fun to sleep in Arctic Hall. The next morning, they were very happy with their experience, and the idea of an ice hotel started.
Today, the ICEHOTEL is famous around the world. When winter starts, a team of builders, architects, and artists from many countries come to Jukkasjarvi to build the hotel for that year. As they finish one part, it opens for visitors and guests, while they continue to build other parts. The first part is ready in December, and each week a new part opens until January 7th, when the hotel is fully completed. 
The ICEHOTEL is built outside, using snow and ice, so the finishing date can change depending on the weather. In spring, when it gets warmer, the hotel melts. Inside the hotel, the temperature is never colder than -5 to -8 degrees Celsius, even if it is very cold outside. Guests receive warm clothes like overalls, hats, and gloves as part of their stay. It is also a good idea to bring sweaters, scarves, and warm socks. Guests should wear shoes that are a bit bigger than normal to fit thick socks.
If you want to visit the hotel, you can buy warm clothes and other items on the ICEHOTEL website. You can order these things when you book your visit, and they will be delivered to your room when you arrive.
The hotel is in the village of Jukkasjarvi, 200 km above the Arctic Circle, but it is only 15 km from Kiruna airport and 17 km from Kiruna train station. You can take a bus from the airport or train station to the ICEHOTEL."
PET_50,B1,"Shopping for Furniture**
A report by Dave Worthington
Homestyle is a new furniture shop. It opened at midnight last Thursday. Many people, up to 6,000, came to the shop. There were special offers, like a leather sofa for £45 (only until 3 am) and a bed for £30 (only between 3 am and 8 am). 
The shop's normal hours are from 9 am to 9 pm every day. But Homestyle said it would stay open for the first 24 hours. However, it had to close within half an hour of opening. 
A police officer said: ""We knew a lot of people would come, but they were not patient. The shop was full, so the managers decided to close the doors. The people outside got angry because they thought everything would be sold before they could go in. They did not want to wait in line. 
There was also a long line of cars trying to park. Many people left their cars in the middle of the road and walked to the shop. This blocked the road.
One customer, Jenny Smith, got into the shop. She said: ""I waited in line for three hours, but I did not have time to buy what I wanted. The staff were calm and explained what was happening. It was not safe, so I will come back when they reopen, but I do not want to wait in line again."""

PET_34,B1,"Free-diving in the Caribbean**
Tanya Streeter is a famous free-diver. She has four world records in free-diving. This sport is about diving deep into the ocean while holding your breath. In 2003, Tanya became the first person to dive 120 meters deep without help. She held her breath for more than three and a half minutes. This made her the first woman to break a world record that was held by a man.
A team of fourteen safety divers watched her dive. Some people think free-diving is too dangerous because of accidents, but Tanya believes safety is very important. She also thinks training is important. Most free-divers focus on one or two types of events, but Tanya has a regular training schedule. 
She spends two-thirds of her training in the gym and the rest in the pool and ocean. She uses an exercise bike to make her heart strong. She does not run because she does not want to hurt her knees. Instead, she walks fast to stay fit. 
When she practices diving, she usually travels away from home. She tries to do fourteen dives in four weeks, with a rest day between each dive. It is important for her to not get tired, or it can affect her training.
When Tanya is not training, she often appears in public to promote sports products. She also helps environmental groups by doing research or making films. Tanya grew up on the Caribbean island of Grand Cayman. She loved swimming and exploring the sea life in rock pools. She says her life now is like living her childhood dreams. 
Because she is famous in some countries, people listen to her when she talks about the environment. Tanya is in her thirties now, and she wants to keep breaking her own records. She started free-diving at twenty-five, so she does not plan to stop for many years."
PET_12,B1,"**CARTOON FILMS**
Cartoon films have very few limits. If you can draw something, you can make it move on the screen. New ideas and computer programs make cartoons exciting for people of all ages. 
In the late 1970s, many people thought cartoons were only for children. But then, some directors had new ideas. They showed that it was possible to make films that both adults and children could enjoy. 
However, not every cartoon film was a success. For example, *The Black Cauldron* did not do well. It was too scary for children and too silly for adults. Directors learned from this mistake, and film companies started to make a lot of money again."
PET_26,B1,"New TV Star Caroline Benson Talks About Her First TV Role**
Caroline Benson is a new TV star. She talks about her first role on TV. ""I never thought I would spend my first year at university making a TV show called The Finnegans. I only acted in school before, but I loved the book since I was eleven years old. My grandmother said I was like Polly Finnegan, and I always wanted to play her.
I took a year off to travel before university. While I was in Chile, my mother emailed me. She said they wanted to make the book into a TV show. I knew I had to try for the role. My mother was surprised, but she sent my photo to the director and asked him to meet me. I flew back and got the role.
Filming started a week after university began, so I asked for permission to be away for three weeks. When I returned to university, I woke up at 6:00 am to write the essays I missed. I didn’t tell my friends at university, but they found out and thought it was great. It was an amazing experience, and I feel very lucky.
After university, I want to be an actor. My family is not in acting, but my grandfather was an opera singer. I have tried for other TV roles, but I have not received any offers yet. I don’t know how I did it all because I also had a busy social life. When filming finished, I didn’t know what to do. I have acted in two college plays since then. Unfortunately, I have not been home much, and now that my first year at university is over, I am going to Greece for the summer with friends."""

I opened the first 'Body Shop' in 1976. My goal was to earn enough money to feed my children. Today, 'The Body Shop' is a big company that is growing all over the world. Since we started, I have learned a lot. I want to share what I have learned in this book. I believe we have important ideas about running a successful business while staying true to our beliefs.
This is not a normal business book, and it is not just about my life. The main idea is that to be successful in business, you need to be different. Business can be fun, and it can be run with love. It can also help people. In business, like in life, I want to enjoy what I do, feel like I am part of a family, and be excited by new things. I want the people who work for 'The Body Shop' to feel the same way.
Now, this book shares my ideas with everyone. I believe there are no limits to our 'family' and no limits to what we can do. I find this thought exciting, and I hope you do too.'"

PET_30,B1,"HONEY**
Honey is a sweet liquid made by bees. It is made of water and sugars. Bees can travel very far, up to seventy-five thousand kilometers, and visit over two million flowers to make just half a kilo of honey. The color and taste of honey depend on the flowers the bees visit. There are more than three hundred types of honey. Lighter honey is usually milder in taste than darker honey. 
In ancient times, honey was the main sweet food because sugar was very rare. The ancient Egyptians valued honey a lot and used it as payment. Today, honey is made and eaten all over the world. Research shows that honey can help reduce tiredness and improve sports performance. Honey is not just food; it can also help with sore throats and is used in many skin and hair-care products."
PET_7,B1,"Norwich**
Norwich is the capital of East Anglia, a part of Britain. It has been a place to live for more than two thousand years. It started as a small village by the River Wensum. When the Normans came in 1066, it was one of the largest towns in England. Norwich has two cathedrals and a mosque, making it a popular place for different religions. The first cathedral was built in 1095 and celebrated its 900th birthday recently. In 1994, Norwich celebrated 800 years since it became a city and could govern itself.
Today, Norwich is smaller than cities like London or Manchester, with about 150,000 people. In the 16th century, it was the second city of England. It grew for 300 years and became rich. It was famous for having many churches and pubs. Now, there are fewer churches and pubs, but in 1964, the University of East Anglia was built in Norwich. The city has many students and is a busy place for business, especially for insurance services.
Norwich has many fun things to do, like theatres, cinemas, nightclubs, cafes, restaurants, and arts centres. There is also a football team called 'The Canaries', which wears green and yellow. No one knows why they are called that. 
One new attraction is a shopping centre called 'The Castle Mall'. For over two years, there was a big hole in the city while builders worked on it. They moved a lot of earth to make a park on the roof of the Mall, with water pools and many trees. The people of Norwich are happy that the old open market is still there, next to the new shopping centre. Both places are busy, showing that Norwich has a good mix of old and new."
PET_43,B1,"**The Albuquerque Balloon Festival**
Every autumn, the sky above Albuquerque, a city in the south-western United States, becomes very colorful. This is the Albuquerque Balloon Festival, which happens every year for nine days. The first festival was in 1972 to celebrate the 50th birthday of a local radio station. There were about twelve hot-air balloons that took off from a car park in Albuquerque. Since then, the festival has grown a lot. This year, at least a thousand balloons from many countries are expected to come.
**What to See**
The pilots talk to each other using radios. They light up the burners of their balloons at the same time. This is called a ""balloon glow,"" and it is a great time to take photos. You should arrive just after night falls or before 5:30 am to see these ""glows"" as the balloons rise into the dark sky. During the day, you can walk around the balloons and talk to the pilots as they get ready to fly. The balloons are in many sizes and colors, some look like animals or cartoon characters, and some are shaped like popular drinks and fast food. Kids will enjoy it.
In the afternoon, you can also take a balloon ride over the desert with one of the many companies that offer this. Another option is to take a cable car from the desert to the top of the nearby mountains. This is the longest cable car ride anywhere, and you can see the festival from above.
There are many other fun things for visitors of all ages, like balloon races and fireworks on the first night and the last three nights of the festival.
**The Albuquerque Box**
This is a special wind pattern that helps balloon pilots. The Sandia Mountains protect the balloons from strong winds and create gentle winds at different heights. This means that skilled pilots can control where their balloons go by going up or down.
**Practical Advice**
Buy your tickets in advance online to avoid a long wait. Wear several layers of thin clothes because it can be cool at night and in the early morning, but during the day, you will need sunglasses and sunscreen. Bring a flashlight for night events and, of course, bring your camera. If you do not have a digital camera, you will need high-speed film for evening and night photos."
PET_51,B1,"The Eden Project**
The Eden Project is in the south-west of England. It is a very popular place for tourists. The big 'biospheres' look like something from a science-fiction movie. Each biosphere has a different climate. They show how important plants are for people. 
Many things we use every day come from plants. For example, we get wood, rubber, fruit, rice, sugar, coffee, and chocolate from plants. There are over 135,000 types of plants grown at the Eden Project. 
Even if it is cold outside, electric heaters keep the plants warm. In the Rainforest Zone, it is always wet because of a big waterfall. There is also a zone that looks like the Mediterranean, California, and South Africa. Soon, they will build a desert zone too."
PET_11,B1,"No Title**
Some people have said they do not like this year's book, New Writing 3. I do not understand why. It has 500 pages of good writing for £6.99, which is great! Most of the book is fiction, with parts of novels and short stories. There are nice pieces by famous writers like Candia McWilliam and Rose Tremain. 
It is interesting that many less-known writers wrote about food. For example, Jane Harris's story, Those Nails, should not be read after eating. It has some very unpleasant scenes! 
There are also poems from nineteen poets, including R. S. Thomas and John Burnside. You can find parts of novels that are not finished by Jim Crace and Jane Rogers. Lastly, there is a little non-fiction. This includes a funny article by Alan Rusbridger about some newspapers and a surprising piece by Ursula Owen about herself. 
This is a great collection, and I am excited to see what next year's book will be like!"
PET_14,B1,"**Text:**
""The best age to start learning the violin is between three and six,"" says Margaret Porter, a violin teacher. ""It's a time when you learn about the world."" Margaret, who lives in London, likes to teach children who are three or four years old, but she also teaches some five-year-olds who really want to learn.
When she started teaching in 1972, her first class was made up of her children's five-year-old friends. Margaret's students have group lessons. Each group has about twelve students, and each lesson lasts one hour, every two weeks. Also, each student has one private lesson with her every week. Parents must come to the classes too. It is important for parents to be interested in the lessons.
From the first lessons, students learn to play by ear. They do not try to read music until they have played for several years. For a long time, there is a big difference between how they play and how they read music. Margaret says her method is not meant to make great violinists. She suggests that students who do very well should leave and learn the violin in a more traditional way."
PET_56,B1,"Moonshine**
The band Moonshine released their third CD last week. The CD is called ""Here Again"" and it comes after their last CD, ""The Waves."" There are some changes in the band. Tom Wilcott is now playing the bass guitar. He replaced Simon McVee, who left the band last year. Tom Simpson has joined the band as the drummer.
The first song on the CD is a dance song. This shows that the band is not going to focus only on slow songs anymore. The second song is also a dance song and is even louder. Most of the other songs are in the band’s usual slow style. These two dance songs may surprise many fans. They could become popular hits because they are very good. 
The singer, Rob Letchford, shows how talented he is by hitting every note perfectly. Fans should be happy that he recorded these songs before he had problems with his throat. Because of this, the band had to cancel their next tour. But fans who bought tickets do not need to worry. All the concerts will be rescheduled when Rob gets better.
On this CD, Moonshine shows they can make great music in different styles, from slow songs to dance songs that make you want to move. However, I think they put their best songs at the beginning, and the last few songs are not as good. Still, ""Here Again"" is sure to be a big hit and will bring more success to the band."
PET_36,B1,"San Francisco**
San Francisco is a city on the coast of northern California. The first Europeans to see this area were led by a Spanish explorer named Gaspar de Portola. He saw it for the first time in 1769. Even though San Francisco Bay is a beautiful natural harbour, it was found by land, not by sea.
In 1849, many people came to San Francisco to find gold. But the people who became rich were not the gold miners. The richest people owned banks and law firms, and they built big houses on a hill called Nob Hill.
Today, many tourists visit San Francisco to see famous places like Chinatown and the Golden Gate Bridge. Some people even take a short boat trip to Alcatraz Island to see the old prison."
PET_6,B1,"SAMUEL PEPYS**
The most famous diary in English was written by Samuel Pepys. It talks about everyday life in England from 1660 to 1669. Pepys writes about important news, like sickness, an enemy navy coming up the River Thames, and the Great Fire of London. He also writes about himself, including his mistakes - he often slept in church or looked at pretty girls. He describes his home life, like a fight with his wife and how they made up, and he worries about her being sick. 
Pepys liked books, music, the theatre, card games, and parties with good food and fun. He was a busy man with many important jobs - he was a Member of Parliament and President of the Royal Society. He is also remembered for his work with the British Navy."
PET_33,B1,"**The History of Shoes**
A long time ago, people did not think about shoes being comfortable or stylish. Early shoes were probably made from animal skins. People tied these skins around their ankles when it was cold. Today, we still use leather for shoes, but we also use other materials like silk, plastic, and cotton, depending on what is popular.
About one hundred and fifty years ago, people started to wear different shoes for each foot. Before that, shoes were straight and could be worn on either foot. In the past, all shoes were made by hand. Now, many shoes are made by machines in big factories. The use of sewing machines helped the shoe industry make many shoes quickly and at lower prices for more people."
PET_20,B1,"No Title**
When I hurt my back, I had to stop running for a while. I wanted to help more women enjoy running and feel good about it. So, I started a running club for women in my area. I was upset because many race organizers say there are not enough women in running, but they do not make separate changing rooms for them.
I put up posters, and 40 women joined the club. They were young and old, fit and not fit. Many of them wanted to lose weight, but I think they had not thought about running before. When they did think about it, they imagined it was hard and painful. They did not think about having fun, talking, and smiling while running in nice places, like by a river.
At first, they could only run for one minute, but now they can run for thirty minutes! They also learned about healthy eating and staying fit. I wanted to help women with running, and I feel very happy to see how much they have improved. They are happy too!"
PET_40,B1,"**THE HISTORY OF THE IDITAROD - THE LAST GREAT RACE ON EARTH**
In the 1880s, people found gold in Alaska, the northernmost state of the USA. Many people came to Alaska to find gold and get rich. New towns were built quickly. One town was called Iditarod, which means ""far, distant place."" In 1909, Iditarod became the largest city in Alaska for a short time.
In summer, boats brought supplies to the towns. But in winter, rivers and the ocean froze, and it was hard to reach the towns. So, in 1910, a winter path was made for dog teams pulling sleds. They carried mail, food, and clothes to the gold miners. This path was called the Iditarod Trail. It took about three weeks for a dog team to travel across Alaska. They stopped at ""roadhouses"" to sleep and eat.
The trail was used every winter until the 1920s when airplanes replaced boats and dog teams for transport. However, in 1925, dogs became famous again when a disease called diphtheria hit the city of Nome. The medicine to cure the disease was in Anchorage, far away. Airplanes were new, and no one knew if they could fly in the cold. The best pilot was away, so they decided to use dog teams to bring the medicine.
The trip was over 1,000 kilometers, mostly on the Iditarod Trail. It took twenty dog teams just six days to finish the journey. Leonhard Seppala, a Norwegian looking for gold, traveled the first 400 kilometers with his dog Togo, who was a great guide in the snow. The last part of the journey was done by Gunnar Kaasen, who had driven dog teams in Alaska for 21 years. His lead dog was Saito. At one point, Balto, another dog, stopped the team from falling into icy water. The medicine arrived, and Balto became a hero.
Today, a dog sled race is held every year from Anchorage to Nome, following the famous route from 1925. This race is called the Iditarod and is known as ""The Last Great Race on Earth."""
PET_45,B1,"Sweden's Ice Hotel**
The village of Jukkasjarvi is in Swedish Lapland. In winter, the temperature can be very low, around -40 degrees Celsius. Every year, 6,000 visitors come to see a very special hotel. This hotel is made of ice. In this hotel, you can eat, drink, and sleep in ice rooms. You can even have a wedding there!
The bar is also made of ice, so it is not good to put hot drinks on it. The bedrooms are about -4 degrees Celsius, but guests get special sleeping bags to keep warm. If you need warm clothes, the hotel can give them to you.
The hotel is always new because it melts in summer. Each winter, workers rebuild it. It takes 10,000 tonnes of ice and 30,000 tonnes of snow to make the hotel."
PET_29,B1,"Maria Mutola**
In 1988, Maria Mutola was the only girl on a boys' football team in Mozambique. ""We won,"" she said. ""At first, no one thought it was a problem that I was a girl. But then the other team complained."" The story was in a local newspaper. Jose Craveirinha, who helped other African athletes, heard about Maria. He went to see her and found her playing football outside the club. He saw that she was very fast.
Jose talked to Maria about athletics. She did not understand at first because she only knew about football. Then he bought her running shoes and took her to train. It was hard work, and her legs hurt a lot. Jose spoke to her parents and convinced them that she could be successful and help their family. They agreed to let him take her to train.
In 1991, Maria accepted an invitation to train in the United States. She had said no before because she would miss her family. Her life was very different from the girls she met in the US. She said, ""They were good athletes, but I worried about my parents having enough food. They worried about dresses and make-up. They did not know much about me or my problems. But I knew I was lucky to be there. The trainers were great, and I learned a lot.""
Today, Maria still runs, and for most of the year, she lives happily in South Africa with her mother."
PET_57,B1,"**The Skywalk**
The Grand Canyon is in the United States. It was made by the Colorado River. Many people visit the Grand Canyon Park to walk, run, and see the view. The view is very beautiful, and it is even better because of the Skywalk. 
The Skywalk is 1219 meters above the bottom of the Grand Canyon. It is a platform made of glass, so you can see the lovely rocks below. Up to 120 people can stand on it at the same time. The Skywalk opened in 2007, and many people have visited it since then. 
When you walk on the Skywalk, you must wear special covers on your shoes to protect the glass. Walking on the Skywalk feels like flying high in the air, like a bird."
PET_9,B1,"**THE ROCKIES**
The Rocky Mountains are a big mountain range in North America. They start in the North-west and go down to the south. The Rockies are not as high as the Alps, but they are still very beautiful. 
There are many roads to drive through the Rockies, but the best way to see them is by train. You can start your journey in Vancouver, which is one of the most beautiful cities in Canada. In Vancouver, you can enjoy the water and the mountains. You can even ski just 15 minutes by car from the city.
Before, there were thirty trains every day from Vancouver to other places. Now, there are only three trains a week, but the trip is still very exciting. You can sleep on the train, which is fun, but you will see the best views at night."
PET_42,B1,"ZOOS**
People have kept animals in zoos for over 3,000 years. A long time ago, the rulers of China opened a big zoo called the Gardens of Intelligence. In early zoos, animals did tricks for visitors. Now, this does not happen. Today, the purpose of zoos is for people to see animals acting naturally.
Most cities have a zoo or wildlife park. Some people think zoos are good. They say zoos help us learn about nature and see wild animals up close. These things would not be possible without zoos.
However, some people do not like zoos. They believe it is wrong to keep animals in cages. They also say that in some zoos, animals live in dirty places and do not get good food."
PET_59,B1,"**JAZZ**  
By Katie Atkins, aged 14  
I play the trumpet in my school jazz band. Last month, we had a jazz competition with bands from local high schools, and our band won! Each band wore different costumes. My band wore black school uniforms, and other bands wore bright T-shirts. We did not look like professional adult bands, but we were good at playing because we practiced a lot. It was exciting to watch the performances, especially when my band played on stage!  
My school has a great jazz band, but not everyone can join. Only about half of the students who want to play get accepted. However, anyone who wants to play can go to jazz practice before school. We also spend time together after school, listening to jazz and learning about it. There are trips to jazz summer camps across the country. I have been to a couple and learned a lot.  
Many adults are surprised that young people like jazz. My music teacher thinks it is because pop music is not challenging enough for serious music students like me. I find jazz exciting because it is both new and old. You can create your own music, but you also feel part of its history, like the great jazz performers before you. My school is lucky because we have great teachers and supportive parents. Without them, we would not be able to improve our music!"
PET_54,B1,"Watering the Desert**
In Marrakesh, Morocco, it can rain from November to March. It does not rain often, but when it does, the water pipes in the city cannot handle it. This makes the streets very wet, like rivers. Many winters have been dry, so when it rains, the people are happy.
Marrakesh has parks and gardens, not because of the rain, but because of underground channels. These channels were made in the 11th century and bring water from the mountains all year. Places that are mostly dry and get water this way are called oases.
If you travel south from Marrakesh, you will reach Skoura. In Skoura, people use all the land they can to grow food. There are small squares made by the water channels. The Atlas mountains, which have snow in winter, look beautiful in the background."
PET_32,B1,"Gareth Ellis**
Gareth Ellis is 13 years old. He is the youngest son of Alan and Kath. Alan is an engineer, and Kath is a nursery teacher. Gareth has two older brothers who work in banking and computers. But Gareth wants to be a clown. 
Three years ago, Gareth and his parents joined a circus. Kath says, ""People laugh when we tell them, but it's true. Gareth has wanted to be a clown since he was three years old."" When Alan lost his job, he and Kath looked for jobs in the circus. They both found jobs, and Gareth started to train to be a clown. He calls himself Bippo. 
In the summer, they travel with the circus and go home in the winter. Gareth's brothers can take care of the house while they are away. Kath says, ""It was not easy. We had to think about many things. We only had a car and a small caravan to sleep in, and we left our nice house. The only thing Gareth missed was his long, hot baths.""
Gareth talks about his education. He says, ""People ask about my school, but wherever we go, someone teaches me. I use the same books as my friends at school, and I have a computer. I have not fallen behind."" 
About the future, Kath says, ""It was a hard choice, but this is the best way to teach Gareth about being a clown. I am happy, and we enjoy it."" Gareth adds, ""I want to be the main clown in a circus one day, maybe Bippo's circus."""
PET_52,B1,"**Eight-eighteen News**
Eight-eighteen News is a news agency for young people. The members are aged 8 to 18 years old. We collect news and write reports, stories, and articles. We send these to newspapers, magazines, television, radio, and websites to be published. You can read or listen to the news stories and articles by our members on the Eight-eighteen website.
We have three centers in the country where young people can meet and work on projects. We want to open more centers in other places. Since we started in 1994, when we were called 'Young News', over 2,500 young people have been members. 
Sophie was one of them. She says: ""I first heard of Eight-eighteen when they interviewed me about young people's opinions on hip hop music. I was in a room with young journalists and was amazed by what they could do. Age didn't matter; they could do stories on their own. I started going to the Eight-eighteen center in my city, got some training, and was a member until I was 18. Eight-eighteen helped me achieve more than I thought I could. With the skills I learned, I got a job at 19, and now I am the youngest worker on a big news website, checking articles before they go online.""
**Get Involved at Every Level**
When you join Eight-eighteen, you will get training and take part in monthly meetings to decide who will write each news story. Eight-eighteen encourages members to help each other. 'Peer trainers' are members who are 12 years old and older. They train new members and teach them basic journalism skills. Some members also present sessions to young people and adults outside Eight-eighteen, often in youth clubs and summer camps. These young trainers are always supported by older staff.
Eight-eighteen News has training sessions for new members three times a year. Our next training for new members will be in February. If you or someone you know wants to join, call Director Den Ley at 01622 657874 for more information. The Eight-eighteen program is suitable for children with reading and writing skills at all levels. Membership is free, and there is no test to join."
PET_28,B1,"**Antarctica Sightseeing Flights Website**
Welcome to our website! Here is what you need to know before booking a flight.
During the short summer in Antarctica, we take tourists on a big plane (Boeing 747) from Sydney, Australia, over Antarctica and back. The flight dates for next year are not set yet, but if you book now, your deposit can be changed if we need to change the date.
**Questions**
Here are answers to common questions about Antarctica Sightseeing Flights.
**How long is the flight?**  
The flight is about 12 hours. After about four hours, we usually see the first sea ice and icebergs. We spend four hours over Antarctica and the rest of the time flying back home. During the flight, experts who have worked in Antarctica will talk about the environment and history, and they will answer your questions. There is a camera next to the pilot that shows you what the pilot sees from take-off to landing.
**Will I get a seat next to a window?**  
All passengers get two boarding passes. At the middle of the flight, you will move to the seat on your second boarding pass. Business and first-class passengers will have a window seat for half of the flight and a seat next to the window for the other half. Economy passengers will have a window seat or a seat next to a window for half of the flight and a seat at the end of the row for the other half. While we are over Antarctica, we encourage passengers to get up and move around the plane so everyone can see the sights. The pilot flies in long 'figure 8s' over interesting places so everyone can see well from both sides of the plane.
**What happens if the weather is bad?**  
We have 17 different flight plans. Our captain checks the weather on the morning of the flight and chooses the best direction for clear views.
**Will I see penguins and other wildlife?**  
Most wildlife in Antarctica lives at sea level, which is over 3,000 meters below the plane, so we cannot see them clearly. We do not land in Antarctica because of environmental reasons. If you want to see wildlife, you need to join a boat tour.
**Can I take photographs?**  
Yes! You can bring all cameras. We also have some fun photo opportunities on board where you can try on Antarctic cold weather clothes."
PET_35,B1,"Little Chefs**
A group of children aged ten to fifteen spend their Saturdays learning to cook. Many children want to join, so there is a waiting list of 30 kids. Parents pay £280 for the course, where children can have fun and learn to make good food.
Bill, who is ten years old, says, ""I love my mum's cooking, and now I can do it better than her. The teachers make us laugh, especially when we eat the food we made together.""
Flora is twelve years old. She has some trouble with onions. She says, ""I love cooking. I made a meal for ten friends, and they really liked it. My mum told me to find a hobby instead of staying home on weekends. At first, I didn't want to come, but now I am very happy I did.""
Their teacher, Philippe, says, ""It's a lot of fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, but the kitchen can be messy when they cook! Adults keep learning about food. If parents teach their children to cook when they are young, the children will know how to make food for themselves when they grow up."""
PET_5,B1,"**Winter Driving**
Winter can be dangerous for driving. It is hard to know what will happen, and accidents can happen easily. Fog can appear suddenly over a hill. Ice can be under the melting snow, which can make you lose control of your car. A car coming towards you might slide on the road.
**Rule Number One** for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly. If you move the car too quickly, it can be hard to control. When you turn the wheel, touch the brakes, or go faster, do it gently and slowly. Imagine you have a full cup of hot coffee next to you. Drive carefully so you do not spill it.
**Rule Number Two** is to pay attention to what might happen. If there is a lot of ice, look further down the road. Test how long it takes to stop by gently pressing the brakes. Remember, you might be driving faster than you think. 
In general, allow double your normal stopping distance when the road is wet, three times this distance on snow, and even more on ice. Try to keep control of your car at all times to avoid problems."
PET_41,B1,"Craigie Aitchison**
Craigie Aitchison was a painter from Scotland. He moved to London to study law, but he went to art school instead. In art school, he found drawing classes hard, but he kept painting. When he was in his late twenties, the Italian government gave him money to study art. He became interested in early Italian artists, and this can be seen in some of his paintings. He loved the green and brown colors of the Italian fields and the bright light there. He wanted to show this light in his paintings. 
Aitchison painted colors in layers, from light to dark. He said, ""It's a secret - because I don't know what will happen."" He does not start with a plan for the colors. He believes anyone can use colors because you can buy them. He just pays attention to how colors look next to each other. 
Unlike some artists, Aitchison does not make drawings before he paints. He thinks that if he draws first, he might get bored and not finish the painting. He often changes his paintings many times before they are done. He likes to paint people who do not want to see their pictures while he is painting. He says, ""If they are worried and want to look, I can't paint.""
Since he moved to London, Aitchison has not felt part of the Scottish art scene. He does not want to follow any tradition; he just paints in his own way. Still, his work inspires young British painters."
PET_38,B1,"'Rock Band'**
Two years ago, our 14-year-old son, Ben, asked us for a drum set for his birthday. At first, we did not want to buy it because of the noise. Ben said, ""It's better than watching TV or playing computer games. It will keep me out of trouble."" In the end, we agreed. We said, ""Okay, but you must think about the family and the neighbors when you play.""
That was just the start. Drums are hard to move, so Ben's friends came to our house with their guitars and other equipment. Now, for many hours each week, our house is loud with their music and singing. 
At least Ben's hobby is good for our health. When the band practices, my husband and I go for a long walk. I must say, even if their music is a little strange, they are a nice and polite group of young men. I cannot say if they are good musicians, but they play often in local clubs for young people.
Our main worry is that they will not spend enough time on their school work because of music. So far, this has not happened. I always tell Ben how important his studies are. But one thing is sure: Ben was right. Playing music has kept him out of trouble, and he is never bored."
PET_17,B1,"Atlantic College**
Last week, I visited Atlantic College, a great private college in Wales. This college helps young people get experience outside the classroom and study for their exams. The students are between 16 and 18 years old and come from many countries. In the morning, they study. In the afternoon, they do useful activities, like helping on a farm, caring for people with learning difficulties, or checking rivers for pollution.
One good thing about Atlantic College is that students come from different backgrounds and countries. Many students cannot pay the fees of £20,000 for two years, so there are grants available. About a quarter of the students are British, and many of them can only go to the college because they get help from the government.
Barbara Molenkamp, a student from the Netherlands, said, ""I really admire the college for helping young people understand each other. You learn to live with people and respect them, even if you don’t like them. During the summer, my mother was surprised that I argued less with my sister.""

I am 32 years old, and I just finished my first year at university. I go to classes regularly, and I have learned to read books quickly and write long essays. I decided to go to university after being away from school for fourteen years. 
Before, I worked as a secretary. I earned good money, but I was bored because my job was easy. I felt sad because I thought I was stuck in that job. I saw students at the local university who looked happy and full of hope. I wanted to feel that way too.
Now that I am a student, I find it hard to make friends with younger students. They often think I am a teacher and ask me questions I cannot answer. I also feel different from the teachers because, even though we are the same age, I know much less than they do. 
But I am happy to study because I know I need a good qualification to get a good job, and that is very important to me. Unlike most eighteen-year-olds, I prefer to spend my weekends reading books instead of going to parties. I also enjoy the benefits of being a student, like long holidays and discounts for the theatre and cinema.
Sometimes I worry about what I will do after university, but I hope that going back to school at this age is a good choice."
PET_48,B1,"Henry Ford**
Henry Ford was born on a farm in Michigan in 1863. He did not like farming. When he was fifteen years old, he started working as a mechanic. In 1893, he made his first car. After driving it 1,500 kilometers, he sold it and made two bigger cars. In 1903, he started the Ford Motor Company. He used strong and light steel to make cars that were cheap for regular people to buy. 
In 1908, he made the first Ford Model 'T', which cost $825. Soon, he was selling 100 cars every day. By 1927, the Ford Motor Company was worth $700 million. Early Ford cars were simple and cheap, but this sometimes meant there were fewer choices. Henry Ford said about the Model T, ""You can have any color you like, as long as it is black."""
