CPE_15,"**Simplified Text: 'Garbage in, garbage out'**

Charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems like a good idea for the environment and the economy. However, it may not be. Many aspects of modern life are similar across developed countries, including how we collect rubbish. Regularly, rubbish bags or bins are taken away by special trucks to be disposed of. Economists find this practice strange because, in many places, it is free. Households pay for this service through local taxes, but a family that produces a lot of rubbish pays the same as a couple that produces very little. However, rubbish disposal is not free. The more rubbish people throw away, the more collectors and trucks are needed, and the more local authorities must pay for landfill and disposal fees. This creates a basic economic problem: if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. 

A common solution is to make households pay for the disposal of their waste. This would encourage them to throw away less and recycle more, assuming local governments provide places to collect recyclable materials. However, economists Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman found that this logical solution can lead to complicated and sometimes disappointing results. They studied several American towns that recently started charging households for rubbish. The most common method is to sell stickers or tags that must be attached to rubbish bags or cans. Only bags with these tags are collected each week.

In a paper published last year, Fullerton and Kinnaman focused on a scheme introduced in July 1992 in Charlottesville, Virginia, a town of about 40,000 people. Residents were charged 80 cents for each tagged bag of rubbish. This seems like a sensible use of market forces. However, the authors concluded that the benefits of the scheme did not cover the costs of printing materials, paying sellers, and the wages of those running the program. Although the number of bags collected fell sharply by 37%, this was mainly due to a behavior called the 'Seattle stomp,' where people crammed more rubbish into each container, sometimes jumping on it to fit it in. This method is less effective than using machines at landfill sites. The weight of rubbish collected, which is a better measure of disposal costs than volume, only fell by 14% in Charlottesville. In 25 other Virginian cities without a pricing scheme, the weight also fell by 3.5%.

Worse still, some people chose to dump their rubbish illegally instead of paying for collection. While this is hard to measure, the authors estimate that illegal dumping may account for 30-40% of the reduction in collected rubbish. A positive outcome was a 15% increase in the weight of recycled materials, suggesting that people preferred to recycle (which is free) rather than pay for rubbish removal. However, this increase may not be directly related to the fee, as many residents were already participating in a voluntary recycling program.

In a more recent study, Fullerton and Kinnaman looked at the economics of rubbish in greater detail. They found that pricing does reduce the weight of rubbish, but not significantly. On average, a 10% increase in sticker prices only reduces rubbish quantity by 0.3%. This figure is lower than in other studies, but is it surprising? To significantly reduce rubbish, people would need to buy less of almost everything. A small tax on garbage is unlikely to make a big difference. If this is true, we should consider whether other factors, like income and education, are just as important as price. For example, in wealthier towns, people tend to throw away more rubbish and have less time for recycling.

Should we conclude that charging households for rubbish is a bad idea? Not necessarily; free disposal is likely too cheap. However, the effects of seemingly simple policies can be complex. Detailed economic models are often needed to understand them, and sometimes the results are not pleasant."
CPE_19,"**Simplified Text:**

Theodore Zeldin explores how our work life might change. Do you feel respected and valued in your job? Success in a career is no longer enough. Many professions feel they are not appreciated or understood, and even famous individuals often feel unhappy despite their success. Loving your job used to be enough to be envied, but now you must consider how your job affects you as a person, your mind, character, and relationships. This is an important question. No matter how skilled you are, if your work makes you boring or unable to connect with others, then no amount of status or money can make up for that.

Zeldin wants to find ways for work to fulfill our personal aspirations instead of just serving industrial needs. Work should not only create wealth but also provide a meaningful life, help us discover new talents, and allow for diverse human connections. However, this change will not eliminate unemployment. As more people get educated, they seek jobs that are interesting and enriching.

Even traditional professions like medicine and architecture are losing their appeal. Doctors often feel more stressed than their patients, and accountants worry about their profession's ethics. Many architects cannot use their creativity, and middle managers are losing their confidence. Meanwhile, companies and public institutions are shrinking. Efforts to improve decision-making and rewards have not increased employee commitment. In Britain, only 8% of workers feel their values match those of their organizations.

Zeldin is studying various jobs to see how they shape or harm people. He has looked at what humans can achieve in different cultures and how courage can be developed. He is now focusing on finding more satisfying ways to earn a living. While many experts work to improve corporate profits, we also need to reflect on ourselves as human beings and consider who we want to spend our lives with.

How many of us feel truly alive at work? How many are like part-time slaves, feeling trapped by our jobs and qualifications? For example, in the hospitality industry, which employs 10% of the workforce, many talented people endure low pay and long hours. This is because the concept of a hotel has not changed much since the Ritz, which represents an old idea of luxury. A hotel is not just a place to sleep; it is a small version of the United Nations, where people from around the world meet, often without speaking to each other.

Many hotel staff are foreigners eager to learn new languages and cultures, but they often have only superficial interactions with guests. Hotels could become cultural centers, connecting guests with the city and each other. Hotel owners could utilize the knowledge of their staff instead of assigning them only basic tasks. If they listened to their employees' true ambitions, they would discover many new services hotels could offer. However, accountants often limit this by insisting that businesses focus on one main activity to maximize profits.

It is time to rethink what work means from a human perspective, not just a financial one. For Zeldin, work is about relationships. As many people seek more than just obedience in their jobs, they should have the opportunity to design their own roles and choose their colleagues and customers, within practical limits. This requires the ability to communicate across different professional languages and understand diverse perspectives.

Everyone knows communication is important, but true conversation is different. The new kind of conversation people crave is more personal and creates a bond of respect. It allows us to understand each other better and can change us in the process. This type of interaction is more than just relaxation; it is a powerful way to establish equality. Each meaningful conversation we have can change the world, even if just a little."
CPE_24,"**Text: 'BROADCASTING: The Social Shaping of a Technology'**

The term 'broadcasting' originally referred to the act of spreading seeds widely by hand. This idea is not just about farming; it also represents a hopeful view of modern progress. It suggests planned growth that can lead to a fruitful outcome if conditions are favorable. The metaphor implies that there are central resources, like a bucket of seeds, meant for spreading and reproducing.

We need to explore why a new technology that sends words and images electronically was organized in a way that fits this farming metaphor. Although television is linked to two-way communication methods like the telegraph and telephone, it was designed from the start as a centralized 'mass' medium. This means that it transmitted content from a central source to private homes, which matched the social and economic structures of modern societies.

There were attempts to create different forms of television, but these remained just experiments. Two lesser-known alternatives are worth mentioning because they show what television could have been in a different social setting. In the early 1930s, radio enthusiasts in Britain experimented with two-way television as a possible substitute for regular telephones. Popular science magazines, like Radio News, published detailed guides on how to build television transmitters and receivers, and many amateur experimenters were active across the country. However, in 1938, the British Radio Manufacturers Association established standards for television equipment and channel regulations, which pushed these grassroots innovators out of the picture. This marked the end of a potential counter-cultural development of television as a widely accessible and egalitarian form of communication.

Broadcasting was closely linked to strong economic interests and the fundamental structures of modern societies. Despite the efforts of TV amateurs, television was mainly a medium for public entertainment in the USA during the early 1930s and was seen as a competitor to the film industry. In fact, throughout the 1930s, television was mostly viewed in public places, not just in private homes. For instance, in Britain, most early audiences experienced television in public settings, a trend that was even more pronounced in Germany.

While the idea of grassroots or amateur two-way television was unlikely to succeed, systems based on collective public viewing were operating in several countries during the 1930s. In hindsight, these systems could have posed a greater challenge to the domestic use of television. However, this challenge did not materialize. Manufacturers recognized the potential for mass sales of home television sets once prices dropped. Given the separation between public and private life that is characteristic of modernity, centralized broadcasting to a wide domestic audience was the most suitable way to organize the medium.

As working-class people improved their living standards and joined consumer society from the 1920s onward, the dream of the home as a center for entertainment and cultural experiences became a reality for many in Western countries. This trend is now occurring globally. There is a clear link between social modernization and the dominant structures of broadcasting. While social and economic modernization led to greater centralization of capital and political power, the breakdown of traditional communities created new lifestyles. People became more mobile, both socially and geographically, which often left them feeling isolated compared to those in more stable early communities.

Centralized broadcasting addressed the need for governments to efficiently inform all citizens about important matters and helped create a unifying 'imagined community' of the nation-state. The widespread nature of these processes made broadcasting the dominant form for both radio and television. However, it is important to recognize the positive view of broadcasting as a social tool that can support democracy. During the period between the World Wars, many countries valued broadcasting as a way to ensure equal access to the resources needed for informed participation in political, social, and cultural life.

Television is evolving, and there is a chance that the term broadcasting may become outdated or insufficient. If that happens, this metaphor will only refer to a specific organization of audio-visual technology during a certain centralized phase of social modernization."
CPE_13,"**Text: Clutter**

Sometimes, it feels like no matter how many things you own, you still don’t feel secure. It is natural to want a home that meets your needs, but there comes a point when the desire to acquire more possessions becomes excessive. Modern advertising is designed to exploit our insecurities. A common message we receive is that if you don’t have certain items, you are somehow less valuable. To see how much advertising influences you, try not to read any billboards the next time you walk down the street. These expensive messages condition us in persuasive ways without us even realizing it. We are constantly exposed to them through television, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, t-shirts, and the internet, all urging us to buy more.

**Caves**

Research institutions and universities worldwide have spent years studying caves, focusing on their origins, water systems, and ecosystems. Caves are a small but intriguing part of nature that sparks our curiosity and desire for knowledge, leading to significant research efforts. Their natural presence has been studied for a long time, especially in areas where caves impact our lives. However, exploring many caves requires physical skill, which means that cave research often involves both professional scientists and amateur enthusiasts who visit caves for recreation.

**Weather Watch**

Many observant people, using only their senses, laid the groundwork for meteorology, which has evolved since the 17th century into a complex science. Today, satellites and electronic devices provide us with quick weather information, and computers can solve complicated calculations faster than humans. Meteorological terms can be difficult for non-professionals to understand, and it may seem that there is no place for simple weather knowledge. However, human experience is still crucial in turning data into weather forecasts. Personal observations can offer valuable insights that help professionals understand the complexities of the atmosphere."
CPE_16,"**MUSIC AND THEATRE**

Until recently, I believed that opera was primarily theatre. However, after working at a national opera house, I realized that music is actually the main focus, with theatre being secondary. This makes sense, but my background is in theatre, where the spoken word and the actor are most important. In theatre, once the performance starts, there is no one directing the action, and the performers and audience usually share a common language.

At musical performances, whether in a concert hall or an opera house, many audience members, like me, may not have a deep understanding of music. Some might feel embarrassed about their lack of knowledge, while most are simply amazed by the performers' skills. A talented singer or a skilled string section is easy to admire. Even a decent musician demonstrates years of hard work. Watching top-class music is similar to watching athletes; we understand the effort involved, but we also see how much better they are than us.

In contrast, theatre audiences have different expectations. They often do not grasp the complexity of an actor's craft and may not be as impressed by an actor delivering a long speech, even though they frequently ask, ""How do you memorize all those lines?"" This does not mean that theatre audiences are less demanding than concert-goers; in fact, many are the same people. However, in theatre, audiences and performers often interact on more equal terms, regardless of the difficulty of the material or the spectacle of the event.

The question arises: does music have anything to learn from theatre about this relationship? I believe it does. I have seen how a different approach can enhance the experience for concert-goers. Live music is inherently theatrical, filled with emotion, humor, and intimacy. It can be unpredictable and engages the audience's imagination, both individually and collectively. 

Current music presentation often follows strict dress codes and shows excessive respect for conductors and soloists, which can create a sense of hierarchy between performers and listeners. On the other hand, contemporary audiences sometimes disrupt performances by applauding between movements or after impressive pieces. While this is often a genuine expression of appreciation, it can also disrupt the overall flow of the work.

Is there a solution? Yes, many initiatives are underway to attract new audiences to concert halls and opera houses and to dismantle the barriers that make people feel that ""serious"" music is not for them. I recall a remarkable event, the community opera ""In Search of Angels,"" which took place in various locations within a cathedral and extended into the town. This experience was not only musical but also transformative for many audience members, who were not just spectators but also participants.

What I desire in music is a bit more of the boldness and innovation that theatre can offer. This can come from using unusual or challenging locations that disrupt normal expectations, creating surprising effects for both performers and audiences. While some discomfort may be involved, such as poor acoustics or cold temperatures, theatre audiences have learned to embrace these challenges as they follow artists into unexpected spaces.

I acknowledge that most plays are presented in conventional ways, similar to concerts. However, I firmly believe that the conventions of music-going should change. My only claim to authority is that of a passionate enthusiast: I love theatre and spend as much time and money as I can enjoying music. I want both art forms to flourish and for more people to experience the joy I find in being part of the audience."

**Sand**  
While I appreciate how sand can be turned into useful things like glass and concrete, I do not enjoy it in its natural form. To me, it is mostly an annoying barrier between a parking lot and the sea. It blows into your face, gets into your food, and can swallow important items like car keys and coins. When you are wet, it sticks to you like glue and is hard to remove, even with a strong hose. However, the strange thing is that as soon as you step onto a beach towel, get into a car, or walk on a clean carpet, it falls off you easily. For days, you find small amounts of sand on the floor every time you take off your shoes, and even more when you remove your socks. Sand seems to stay with you longer than some illnesses. So, I would prefer to avoid sand altogether.

**Lock and Key**  
The search for a safe home, privacy, and security has been important since humans first built permanent homes. The simple wooden beam behind a door has changed to electronic locks that use plastic cards with many combinations. However, the desire to keep out intruders remains. The idea of a lock and key is partly psychological. Recently, some companies have tried computerized locking systems that use smart cards to control electronic locks. But people do not seem to like them. You might accept them at work, but at home, everyone prefers the comfort of using a physical key. Therefore, when a locksmith company created a new electronic system, they made sure to include a real metal key.

**Modern Art**  
I felt nervous about visiting the new Tate Modern gallery because, like many people, I find modern art confusing. I do enjoy some pieces, especially furry objects, neon light sculptures, and large photographs. Maybe if I knew more about it, I would have stronger opinions. However, art is not meant to be understood in a strict way; it should connect with you. This is a great idea, but it has not worked for me in the past. The new gallery tries to give visitors real insight into the reasons behind the artworks. The first thing I noticed was the informative labels that explain the context of each piece and what it aims to convey. Instead of just staring at the art as I used to, these helpful details allowed me to understand better."
CPE_46,"**Text: Every Picture Tells a Story**

**Adapting Novels for Film**

Turning novels into films often means cutting down the original story. This can be frustrating for writers, but it can also be enlightening. While working on a script, I realized that I could remove much of the dialogue and description from a scene in the novel and still convey the same message. This does not mean that the original dialogue and descriptions were unnecessary. It relates to how each medium engages the audience and the type of repetition it uses. 

In a novel, repetition can include reminding readers of character traits or using phrases like ""he said."" A character's trait only needs to be described once, but repeating it helps readers remember. Usually, we can tell who is speaking in a dialogue scene from the context, but speech tags make it easier to read. In stage plays, which mainly consist of dialogue, this repetition mimics real speech, sometimes to an extreme, where the dialogue seems to be mostly unnecessary words that only serve to connect the speakers, leaving the audience unclear about the actual message.

**Watching Movies**

When watching movies, people can feel completely immersed in the film's world. It is an experience that allows one to escape from reality, at least for the duration of the film. However, once the lights come on, this illusion is shattered, and one returns to the real world. People often do not feel accountable for the time spent lost in the film, and this sense of unreality makes it hard to take the film seriously. In the past, many people, including our parents and teachers, viewed movies as mere entertainment rather than art. They enjoyed being entertained but did not see films as a form of artistic expression.

**The Film Studios**

The Leiper Film Company studios were a collection of many different buildings. The layout was confusing and hard to navigate. There were a few recognizable places, like the Script Department, but most of the rooms looked the same and were used for both official and unofficial meetings. Finding a specific room without help was quite a challenge. The studio lacked a clear main entrance; instead, there were three equal entrances, none of which provided clear guidance. Strangers rarely visited, as the organization did not encourage outsiders. However, employees were expected to know their way around. Through their teamwork, they created films that allowed viewers to escape from everyday problems and enjoy stories of romance and adventure.

**Film-Makers**

It seems that many people want to make movies. Bookstores are filled with guides on scriptwriting and film production, and universities offer related courses. There are competitions that provide equipment similar to what successful directors use. For example, Robert Rodriguez made the film *El Mariachi* for just $7,000, which launched his career as an independent director. He reflects on his early success, noting that he felt pressure to create a breakthrough film before he turned 26, just like famous directors Orson Welles and Steven Spielberg did.

In the past, filmmakers were expected to take their time to develop their skills. They often worked behind the scenes as editors, writers, or cinematographers before directing their own films. For instance, John Huston was 35 when he made *The Maltese Falcon*, and Fred Zinnemann, who directed *High Noon*, found success in his forties. Today, without the support of studios or television, aspiring filmmakers often have to work independently."
CPE_3,"In the past, the council houses were spread across the western part of the city, with many rows of small, dull homes made of orange brick or pale white stucco. In the summer, the chemicals from the May and Baker factory, located two miles away, created a strong smell of sulphur that lingered around the doors and gardens. A common sight in that area of Norwich in the early morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he walked along someone’s front path. I have forgotten much of my early life, but I remember sitting near an upstairs window, looking at the houses as they faded into the distance. 

There are also other memories, like my mother ironing towels in a house that I don’t think was ours, and snow falling on the turrets of a large mansion at Earlham. It is not surprising that my mother appears in these early memories. I remember her as a small, precise, and often angry woman, and I never fully understood the reason for her anger, so I couldn’t do anything to make it better. Even as a child, when I went with her to the small shops in Bunnett Square or on longer trips into the city, I sensed something unusual about her personality. She was the most solitary person I have ever known, feeling just as alone in a crowded room as she would on a moor. 

Her solitude was combined with a strict sense of propriety that was unusual for the West Earlham estate. This sometimes resulted in intense spring-cleaning sessions or strict instructions to ""behave properly."" I found this moral code hard to understand, and even now, I’m not sure I fully grasp it. It meant not wandering into neighbors' gardens or damaging their rose bushes while walking down the street; it meant sitting quietly for long periods in a dining room, hands folded, listening to radio programs my mother enjoyed; and it included many other rules and restrictions. 

Over time, other figures appeared in these serious early memories. Despite her solitude, my mother had a few friends. There was Mrs. Buddery, who was obsessed with the Royal Family; Mrs. Winall, who rarely spoke except to agree with others; and Mrs. Laband, who was more lively and not always approved of by the others. Looking back, I realize that this trio was not good company; they often talked about their bad legs, the cold weather, and ungrateful children, a category in which I often felt I belonged. 

Reflecting on this, it felt like a heavy weight made up of the West Earlham houses, my mother, her friends, and the pressure to ""behave properly"" was resting on my shoulders, and I felt it was my responsibility to break free from it. However, this was not easy. Growing up in West Earlham followed a predictable pattern. Until you turned five, you stayed at home and got in your parents' way (I remember long, aimless days playing on a rug while my mother sat coldly in an armchair). Then, in September after your fifth birthday, you were sent to Avenue Road infants school, half a mile away. The lucky children had mothers with old bikes and child seats, which were unusual but helpful. I think my mother let me go with other children from the street for this journey. 

If I remember anything from those early years, it’s the summer holidays, when I caught glimpses of the world outside West Earlham: a vague old man next to Mrs. Buddery who told stories about his time in the Merchant Navy; a charity fair held at a house far away where a kind woman offered lemonade and tried to get me interested in something called the League of Pity, a kind of junior charity. My mother dismissed this idea, saying the organizers were ""only after your money."" My mother often spoke about mercenary motives, and she held politicians in deep contempt. If she thought about the House of Commons, it was as a place where wealthy people opened letters filled with money sent by gullible citizens. 

I may be exaggerating and overlooking her good qualities while focusing on her flaws. However, there was little kindness in my mother; it seemed to have been drained from her. To be fair, she was aware of her role in my education. Occasionally on Sundays, she would take me, dressed in my ""good clothes,"" on the 85 bus to the Norwich Castle Museum. Hand in hand, we would walk through rooms filled with paintings by the Norwich School of Artists. My mother was not completely against this activity and eventually developed some opinions about the art. I remember her stopping in front of a painting of a Roman soldier in full armor and saying, ""Well, I wouldn't want to meet him on a dark night!"" This was one of the few times I remember my mother trying to make a joke."
CPE_10,"**Text: Philadelphia Avenue**

I walked down the odd-numbered side of Philadelphia Avenue. The evening was settling in, and the air was humid with a light drizzle that made my walk feel secretive. I knew this side of the street well; I remembered our neighbors, the Matzes and the Pritchards, Han Kieffer's grocery store, and the houses of my first playmates, all girls. Although I didn’t know everyone by name, each house was clear in my memory, just like the small channels in the sidewalk that carried rainwater from the roofs to the street, which I would skate or scoot over.

As the street sloped down, I noticed a slight decline in the social status of the houses: the porches were lower, and the front yards were smaller. Over the years, things changed: wooden porch railings were replaced with wrought iron in a style that felt Southern or Spanish. In Shillington, houses I remembered as homes had turned into stores, and strangely, some stores, like Pep Conrad's and Han Kieffer's, had become homes again. I wondered how the residents used those open spaces and how they lived with the lingering smells of the goods that used to be sold there.

Rick Gilbert, a furniture designer, lives in a flat that used to be a curtain warehouse. It has the typical features of a loft, like exposed brick and large doors that once let in curtains from the nearby railway. However, Gilbert didn’t want an empty, open space for practical and aesthetic reasons. He explained, ""In my last place, my living and working areas were mixed. It was hard to relax or start working when everything was in view."" To create a separate area near the entrance, he used a large piece of corrugated plastic. ""It hides the office, creates a hallway, and leads to the kitchen in the middle of the flat. I wanted the kitchen to be a neutral space for cooking dinner for friends or making coffee for clients."" To balance the modern look of his plastic screen and stainless steel kitchen, he chose light wood for the floors. His flat is filled with futuristic chairs and sofas, but also with sentimental furniture from his parents or found at markets.

**Bruce Chatwin**

Bruce Chatwin's adventurous life has puzzled many. His life and writing were filled with secrets and lies, but he was a brilliant and unique author. His first book, *In Patagonia*, published in 1977, is a remarkable work of imagination. It reinvented travel writing, combining the excitement of a thriller, the charm of romantic fiction, and the deep insight of great literature. Even in this book, Chatwin mixed fact with fiction; he often changed details to make stories more interesting or to highlight the deeper meanings of his experiences. He suggested that through travel, one could uncover histories that seemed to exist just to inspire future explorers.

**Swimming**

During a warm summer rain, I rushed across my lawn and jumped into the pool. As I swam, I kept my eyes just above the water. Each raindrop created a small splash that turned into bubbles. The best moments were when the rain got heavier, drowning out the birdsong, and steam rose from the water as if the pool was reaching up to the sky. It was during this summer in 1996 that I began to think about swimming across Britain. I wanted to follow the rain as it traveled to the sea, escaping the frustration of my usual swimming routine, like a tiger pacing in a cage.

Many of us live in a world where everything is labeled and explained. This makes reality feel more like a visual experience. That’s why walking, cycling, and swimming are always rebellious activities. They help us reconnect with the wild and ancient parts of our world by taking us off the beaten path and away from the official stories. A swimming journey would allow me to explore the parts of our world that still hold mystery, like darkness, misty woods, or high mountains."
CPE_67,"**Text: 'CRYING**

Charles Darwin believed that crying in humans did not have a clear purpose in evolution. However, he was likely mistaken. Recent studies have shown that crying has social importance. Psychiatrist John Bowlby emphasized how crying helps create a bond between a mother and her child. Many people think that tears, especially in children, mainly show feelings of helplessness. 

Understanding why adults cry is more complicated. The sound of crying is often less important than the visual message it sends. Crying may have been beneficial for early human groups by helping to build trust and social connections. 

There are many reasons why we cry. We might cry to show sympathy for those facing great injustice. Sometimes, we cry unexpectedly, even if it feels embarrassing, when we hear touching music or powerful speeches. We may also cry while watching a sad movie, and interestingly, this happens more often when we are with others than when we are alone. The social role of crying is clear, but research on this topic is ongoing.'"
CPE_27,"**The Heat is On**

We have all heard about global warming, but how much warmer will the Earth become, and how will it affect our lives? Most people have some understanding of global warming, but few know its consequences. A warmer climate is likely to change the weather everywhere. Since the atmosphere is closely connected to every part of our planet, any climate changes will significantly impact plants, animals, water, and soil. Humans have learned to use these natural resources to our advantage, allowing us to grow food, build cities, and support billions of people. Therefore, any changes to these resources must be taken seriously.

The challenge we face is understanding how the world will change and what is causing these changes. Over the last century, human activities have significantly increased the levels of certain gases in the atmosphere, which are linked to global temperatures. These rising gas levels are likely already affecting the global climate, but our limited knowledge of the Earth's heat balance makes it hard to predict future changes. 

We know that greenhouse gas levels have varied in close relation to global temperatures over the past 40,000 years, suggesting a strong connection between the two. Evidence indicates that the Earth's surface has warmed by about 6°C in the last century. Most scientists believe this warming is not entirely natural and is partly due to human pollution. 

A lot of research has been done to predict the effects of higher global temperatures. Most of this research uses computer models called general circulation models (GCMs). These models use the laws of physics and chemistry to analyze how temperature, pressure, solar radiation, and other factors interact to predict climate conditions. However, these models are simplifications of reality and have many limitations. Their predictions are only rough estimates, and they can be slow and costly to run. 

Despite these challenges, most experts agree on one crucial point: the rate of climate change will be faster than anything we have experienced before. The predictions from GCMs help us understand the conditions we may face in the coming generations. Currently, they suggest that by the year 2100, the average global surface temperature could rise by between 1°C and 3.5°C, sea levels could increase by 15-95 cm, and changes in rainfall patterns are expected. Scientists also predict that extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, floods, and droughts, will become more common in some areas. 

These forecasts highlight the potential impact of climate change on the environment and humanity. Changes in climate could affect where ecosystems, like forests and grasslands, are located, the types of species they contain, and their ability to provide essential resources for society. This includes food production, water supply, and human settlements. While some effects may be harmful, not all changes will be negative. In fact, some regions may benefit from climate change. For example, in Australia, research has shown that wheat yields have increased by about 0.5 tonnes per hectare since 1952, partly due to rising minimum temperatures that have reduced frost damage to crops.

However, many predicted effects of future climate warming are concerning. Even small climate changes can impact water availability, especially in dry regions or areas already facing shortages. The Mediterranean Basin is one such area, where decreasing rainfall has been observed in recent decades. In southern Portugal, for instance, rainfall is now more concentrated in autumn and winter, with less falling in spring.

Another worrying effect of climate change is its impact on glaciers, which will affect ice levels and, in turn, vegetation, wildlife habitats, and human infrastructure. There is a strong possibility that Arctic ice will completely melt, making marine transport and oil exploration easier but increasing the risk of icebergs.

Perhaps the most dramatic effect of global warming will be rising sea levels. This will happen due to the expansion of warmer ocean water and melting ice. With about half of the world's population living in coastal areas, the consequences of rising sea levels could be severe. Increased flooding and inundation are likely, affecting cities like London, New York, and Tokyo. Many people could lose their homes and livelihoods, leading to millions of environmental refugees. 

The most severe consequences may be felt by small, low-lying island nations, which could disappear entirely if worst-case scenarios occur. This would be devastating not only for the people and cultures of these islands but also for the countries that would need to take in those displaced."

The 2018 date is set because the next time Mars and Earth will be in the right position for a launch is in 2031. This is a challenging task, but there is a race to create new technologies for the mission. If these technologies are ready in time, the spacecraft may succeed. Even if it does not launch, the work done will still help future missions.'"
CPE_44,"**AESTHETICS**

The existence of artworks, which are the basis for aesthetic theory, can actually hinder our understanding of them. This is because artworks are physical objects, like buildings, books, paintings, or statues, that exist separately from human experience. However, the true essence of an artwork lies in how it interacts with our experiences. This disconnect can make it difficult to grasp their significance.

Moreover, the high regard for certain artworks, which have been admired for a long time, creates established ideas that can block new perspectives. Once an artwork is considered a classic, it often becomes detached from the human experiences that led to its creation and the effects it has on our lives. When artworks are viewed separately from their origins and their impact, it becomes challenging to understand their broader meaning, which is what aesthetic theory aims to explore. Art is then seen as something separate, disconnected from other human activities and achievements.

A key task for anyone writing about the philosophy of fine arts is to reconnect the refined experiences that artworks provide with the everyday events and struggles that everyone recognizes as part of life. Just as mountains are not isolated but are part of the earth's processes, artworks should not be seen as separate from the human experiences that shape them. 

If we accept this idea, we may reach a surprising conclusion: to truly understand artworks, we might need to temporarily set them aside and focus on the ordinary experiences that we usually do not think of as aesthetic. We must take a detour to reach a deeper understanding of art. 

For example, while one can enjoy flowers for their beauty and scent without knowing about plants, understanding how they grow requires knowledge of the soil, air, water, and sunlight that support them. Similarly, to grasp the essence of art, we should start with the raw experiences that capture our attention and bring us joy.

However, many people are influenced by the idea that art is something distant and separate. They often enjoy forms of art that they do not recognize as such, like movies, jazz, comic strips, and sensational news stories. When art is confined to museums and galleries, people seek enjoyment in their everyday surroundings instead. 

Even those who criticize the traditional view of art may still hold onto the belief that separates art from ordinary experiences. The times when people appreciate art the most are when it is closely linked to everyday activities."
CPE_22,"**Text: Observing Lions**

In popular culture, lions hunting for food are often seen as a remarkable display of teamwork. As the sun sets, a group of stealthy lions emerges from the shadows and surrounds their unsuspecting prey. They appear to be perfect social animals, setting aside minor disagreements to work together for a common goal: their next meal. However, after many years of studying these animals in the wild, we have come to a different understanding. When we began our research in 1978, we wanted to find out why lions hunt together, raise cubs, and scare off rivals with their roars. If we measure an animal's success by how many offspring survive, then cooperation might not always be beneficial. If one animal is too generous, it may end up helping its companions at its own expense. So, why do lions seem to ignore the rules of self-interest? We thought we could answer this question in two to three years, but lions are very good at being inactive. We would add them to the list of unreactive noble gases like krypton, argon, and neon. Therefore, it has taken various research methods to find clues about their behavior. Since wild lions can live up to 18 years, we are only now beginning to understand the answers to our questions.

**Text: Pop Music Review**

The release of Bedrock's third album was a significant moment for a talented band that had previously struggled. ""New Life"" started a movement that changed rock music in this country for the rest of the decade. Gone were the serious themes, dull clothing, and loud guitars of the past; instead, a lighter mix of catchy local styles emerged. This album combined social commentary and strong emotions with sounds from fairground organs and brass bands. Humor and irony were prominent, and the singers proudly expressed their backgrounds. The album showed Bedrock as skilled collectors and observers, as well as versatile songwriters. They playfully addressed traditional English themes like sunbathing and lazy Sundays. However, the album's true strength lay in its deeper, more emotional tracks like ""So Low,"" a beautiful song loosely based on weather, and ""To the Brink,"" a serious ballad. The beauty of ""New Life"" is its consistently high quality—16 tracks with no filler, setting a record in an era of long CDs.

**Text: Extract from an Autobiography**

As a child, I was always intrigued by stories of 'The Sibyl,' wise women who had great influence in ancient times. Initially, I only knew of one from a story my mother told me. An old woman from Cumae offered Tarquin, the King of Rome, nine books for 300 gold pieces. When he refused, she burned three of them and offered him six for the same price. He refused again, and she burned three more. Finally, he bought the last three for the full price. I realized even then that there was a deep lesson in this story about salesmanship and life. As an only child, I often felt lonely. I would ask to play with other kids, but they would say no. My mother advised me to do something so interesting that they would want to join me. It worked, and it’s a lesson I’ve never forgotten. When I had the chance to write a travel book, I needed to find a topic that mattered to me. I’m not a keen traveler; I even sent my editor a long list of places I didn’t want to visit. Ultimately, I’m only interested in ruins because I prefer to travel through time in my mind.

**Text: What Happens to Your Manuscript?**

When you submit your manuscript, it will likely join a pile of other submissions waiting to be reviewed, known as the slush pile. The person sorting through these is usually either a junior member of the editorial team (often under 18) or an experienced freelancer who works a few mornings a week. Neither has much power, but they are generally looking for something original. The junior hopes to make a name for themselves and find a promising author, while the freelancer wants to justify their job. If they find your novel interesting, they will pass it to a senior editor, and it will eventually be discussed in a meeting. The editor who supports your novel must explain why it deserves to be accepted based on its quality and potential sales. They also need to consider whether you, as an author, seem like a long-term prospect, which you will have assured them of in your letter. Additionally, they will evaluate how marketable you are, as this is crucial for promoting a new novel. For this reason, publishers often prefer to meet potential authors before making an offer."
CPE_39,"**Text: Advertising on Trial**

If you work in advertising, the early 1990s were likely very challenging. The recession was worse than expected, affecting many industrialized countries for thirty years. In Britain, 1991 saw a decline in the economy, high interest rates, reduced consumer spending, job losses for over half a million people, and around 75,000 homes being taken back by banks. Every business was impacted, with some sectors, like vehicles and construction, down by 30%. Many people and companies around the world faced difficulties.

While advertising professionals were not the only ones losing jobs, those who remained often felt intense pressure. They were seen as responsible for helping companies make money, which meant they were closely watched by their colleagues and bosses. Additionally, they were expected to do more with smaller budgets, being told that ""less is more."" Despite these challenges, the importance of marketing grew. Companies began to focus more on creating products and services that customers wanted, rather than just what was easy for them to produce. This shift led to greater attention to marketing by management, more knowledge about the field, and some brands starting to market themselves effectively. As a result, the status of marketing professionals increased, but so did their workload.

Marketing is often mistakenly viewed as a simple solution to problems. Since about half of marketing budgets go to advertising, the pressure on advertising professionals increased. The 1980s were a prosperous time for advertising, but the early 1990s brought significant challenges. The economic downturn forced clients to reconsider their advertising budgets and question the effectiveness of their spending. Many companies struggled to see clear returns on their advertising investments, leading to increased skepticism about the value of advertising.

Client companies expressed a desire for better strategies, targeting, creativity, media placement, and overall thinking from their advertising agencies. They wanted the best talent working on their accounts and expected them to produce exceptional results. While this situation does not necessarily evoke sympathy for the advertising industry, it highlights the shared challenges faced by advertising professionals and their clients: how to achieve more with less.

Several factors made effective advertising even more difficult. Some were direct results of the recession, such as debates over production costs and a reluctance to take risks, which are often essential for good advertising. Other changes were happening regardless of the economy, including demographic shifts, the growing power of retailers, changing consumer needs, the rise of sponsorship, and stricter advertising regulations. Additionally, some companies faced the new challenge of advertising internationally. 

These issues forced advertising professionals to reconsider the famous saying by Lord Leverhulme: ""Only half my advertising works. The trouble is I don't know which half."" The pressure to increase the effectiveness of advertising has never been greater. Unfortunately, support for those seeking to improve their advertising is not readily available. Companies and their advertising agencies have been too busy managing these challenges to share their experiences. Those who have managed to succeed often keep their strategies private. As a result, while conferences and seminars may offer some insights, the available literature on advertising often fails to provide practical guidance. Many books treat the advertising process with too much reverence, suggesting that the work produced by agencies is always of high quality and value, which is not the case and does not help the employees responsible for the advertising."
CPE_18,"**The Allure of Cooking**

When I was in university, I decided I wanted to become a chef. This was an unusual choice among my peers. Cooking was not a popular career; it seemed unattractive. Chefs often have tough lives: the work is long, stressful, and low-paying. However, these factors did not discourage me. I was unhappy at university. The studies were difficult, and the social life felt closed and self-important. Becoming a chef seemed like the perfect escape from the pretentiousness of college life. It offered a sense of seriousness and honesty that I felt was missing in my studies.

My desire to cook was not just a reaction to my university experience; it also reflected a deeper appreciation for the art of cooking. My first real understanding of this came when I had a meal at a well-known restaurant in London. It was a life-changing experience. I still remember my appetizer clearly. After that meal, I felt so moved that I wanted to kneel and thank the chef. I felt light and happy for days. This experience sparked a strong desire in me to learn the secrets of this wonderful art. I turned my student life into preparation for my future in cooking. My history degree became meaningless, distracting me from my true passion. I learned about cooking by reading cookbooks, exploring markets, and making elaborate meals.

**The Swimming Instructor**

The swimming instructor at my school was a former drill sergeant, small and muscular, with tattoos on his arms. When I asked him to teach me how to dive, he told me to sit on the edge of the pool, raise my hands above my head, and roll forward, pushing off with my feet. I practiced this until the hour was over. The next time, he had me stand up and dive off the edge. He was strict, and every time I came up from the water, he looked at me disapprovingly: ""Don't look down, look up!"" ""Keep your legs straight."" ""Point your toes!"" The following week, I climbed up to the high diving board. It felt very high as I stood there, trying to gather my courage. Gradually, the noise around me faded, and I felt like I was in a bubble of silence. I waved my arms as I had been taught, tried to look up, and jumped into the air. For a moment, I felt like I was flying. When I hit the water, I landed awkwardly, and my legs flailed. The instructor looked at me with disappointment and shook his head. But even he could not take away my joy. I thought to myself, ""This is what they mean by 'free as a bird.'""

**The Traveler**

For those of us who value a comfortable bed, running water, and the chance to live another day, the idea of a traveler can seem strange and fascinating. These are people who willingly take risks, climbing dangerous mountains, sailing alone on small boats through rough seas, and eating whatever they can find, even insects. They can live for months in uncertainty. It is easy to see them as odd or eccentric, like hermits or extreme adventurers. While they exist, their unusual world is far from our daily lives, and we often dismiss it as irrelevant. We can simply return to our comfortable lives, grateful that our risks are predictable, like crossing a busy street.

**Sailing**

Jonathan Raban is afraid of the sea, which is likely why he spends so much time on it. He does not claim to be an expert sailor, but he is skilled. His main reason for sailing is that, as a writer, he enjoys writing about his sailing experiences. Sailing provides him with exciting stories to tell. Raban's small boat has a device that shows sailors their exact location anywhere on Earth. While he appreciates this technology, he also believes that the invention of the compass harmed the connection between humans and the sea. He argues that since the compass was invented, sailors have focused too much on it and no longer pay attention to the waves or feel the ocean. The sea, once full of life, has become just a space to navigate. Because of this, Raban has time to observe the waves closely."
CPE_62,"**Holiday Reading**

Summer brings us two great joys: escaping home and reading books. These joys are closely connected. Books can help us feel more at home in the wider world. We can relate our own experiences to those in classic books from the past or from faraway places because there are more similarities among people than differences. In the writings of others, we discover our own thoughts, feelings, and struggles. Authors can express emotions we thought we were alone in feeling, using words that capture our experiences with clarity and depth. What we feel shy or confused about is clearly articulated by them, which is especially striking when the work comes from a distant time or place. We feel thankful to these authors for reminding us of who we are.

Through reading and travel, we break free from our daily routines. Our eyes are most open during the first few days in a new place, just as they are when we read a great book that reveals things we might have overlooked before. Our minds become more aware, noticing the colors of the sky, the changing expressions on faces, the insincerity of friends, or a sadness we didn’t know we could feel.

**Author's Note**

These reflections on travel were published as articles in the Observer newspaper over seven years. I have made only minor edits to restore some cuts made by the editor for space, and I corrected a few mistakes. While I could have improved the pieces further with hindsight, that process could go on indefinitely. For instance, in my second article about China, I thought the Hong Kong dollar would remain stable, but it fell a year later. If I rewrote it to include this prediction, it would no longer reflect my thoughts at that time. Like any traveler in Southeast Asia or elsewhere, I was there in the moment, unaware of what would happen next, focused on understanding what had already occurred. This is the essence of modern air travel: the world opening up to those who can afford a ticket. However, I believe my fellow travelers were not completely unaware; even a postcard can have a purpose.

**Ecotourism**

If there were awards for tourism terms that have been misused, ""ecotourism"" would win first prize. This term appeared in the early 1980s, reflecting a growing awareness of environmental issues and a realization by tour operators that many travelers wanted to ensure their presence abroad would not harm the environment. It quickly became a popular marketing term for vacations. Today, the ecotourism label includes everything from two-week stays with remote tribes to one-hour boat trips through Australian gorges. Any tour involving cultural experiences, natural beauty, wildlife, or a bit of adventure is likely to be labeled ecotourism. While the original intentions were good, the lack of clear regulations and definitions has left many travelers confused in an ""ecotourism jungle.""

**Transylvanian Journey**

I lost my notebook from my journey in Transylvania for 50 years, but I found it again by chance a few years ago. It has helped me remember that time and write about it, but it wasn’t as reliable as I hoped. In Transylvania, I had a much easier experience than expected, moving from one welcoming country house to another and often staying for weeks. When I settled down during these long stays, I stopped writing, thinking there was nothing to record. I was slow to pick it up again when I moved on, and my notes sometimes replaced detailed writing. Worried that some details might be out of order when I started writing this book, I added many disclaimers. However, I realized that these pages were not meant to be a guidebook, so I allowed the story to unfold without excessive caution."
CPE_49,"**Text: Fashion and Writing**

**Fashion**  
Fashion is often thought of as a recent development, mainly influenced by capitalism in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. However, many fashion historians argue that the concept of style and design has a much longer history. They often trace its beginnings to the growth of trade in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. As societies have become more complex, populations have grown, and new technologies for making various types of clothing and accessories have emerged, the meanings associated with dress have also become more intricate. Therefore, it is challenging to determine what any piece of clothing or accessory truly signifies today. For instance, a man's suit, which is often seen as a symbol of uniformity, can have very different meanings depending on the context and the person interpreting it.

**Writing**  
Media reports about publishers competing for popular manuscripts can create a misleading image of life for most novelists. For those of us who are not best-selling authors, there are two main ways to make a living. The smartest writers work in the evenings and have other full-time jobs that will support them even if their book is not quickly published or made into a movie. Others, like me, take on various part-time jobs, such as teaching and writing articles, to get by. I have heard of a writing job at a chocolate factory, but I have never found anything like that. Somehow, by balancing part-time work and using credit cards, and often thanks to the kindness of those mentioned in the Acknowledgements section of books, I manage to write my novel.

**Sudden Fame**  
The small venues where we performed started to sell out, and we needed extra security to manage the growing number of excited fans. We had to use secret entrances to avoid being overwhelmed by admirers at the village halls and ballrooms where we played. On the few nights we were not working, it was hard to leave the house without being followed by enthusiastic fans. In just a few days, we became celebrities. Our actions were closely watched by our fans, and our management took care of all our needs. Although my natural shyness never completely disappeared, it was replaced by a strange, innocent confidence that many shy people can understand when they suddenly find themselves in similar situations. In short, I felt completely out of my comfort zone emotionally."
CPE_31,"**Text: Music - The Future Ahead**

Technological advances are changing our lives in many areas, including music. Susan Hallam talks about how these changes affect music in Britain. In the late 20th century, there was a big increase in ways to listen to music, such as through radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, and videos. However, this also led to fewer live music performances and fewer full-time jobs for professional musicians. 

It is clear that access to music will keep growing, as it meets many human needs. Music is present at all major state events and offers many activities for individuals, both formal and informal. A society without music seems impossible. The real question is not whether there will be music in the 21st century, but what kind of music it will be and if people will still feel the need to learn to play instruments. I believe that there will still be a need for musical education. The music industry is a major source of income in Britain, and musical skills will remain important for various jobs, especially in media-related fields.

Moreover, there is evidence that playing an instrument can help develop skills early in life. Research in the USA suggests that listening to or making music positively affects spatial reasoning, which is a part of intelligence measurement. While these findings need further confirmation, studies in Europe show that group music lessons can improve social relationships in schools and help children focus, especially those with behavioral issues.

Current research is also exploring how playing an instrument might help develop transferable skills. For example, regular practice can lead to better study habits and concentration, while performing in concerts can teach punctuality and organization. Because of these benefits, there will likely be a continued demand for instrumental teaching in the near future.

Looking further ahead, will there be changes in music focus? I see two likely possibilities. First, the types of music people listen to will become more varied, with new genres combining different styles. Second, technology will play a bigger role in composing and performing music, making it easier for more people to create music without needing advanced technical skills. However, this may also reduce the need for live performances and musicians focused only on that.

At the same time, more people of all ages may want to participate in music-making, often in community settings that reflect local musical traditions. If this future is to happen, the music profession must prepare. Instrumental teaching will need to adapt to help more people learn various instruments throughout their lives. This will require changes in the curriculum and how progress is assessed, making it relevant to a wider audience.

Training for musicians will also be essential. They must learn to inspire and teach students of all ages, work with diverse groups, and develop skills in communication, social interaction, entrepreneurship, and management for community work. This represents a significant shift from traditional methods and will require accountability to the public. 

Positively, this change offers a chance for those in music education to showcase the quality of music teaching available. Finally, we must work to raise the importance of music in our lives. Music is vital, yet often taken for granted. Everyone in the music profession should collaborate to ensure this perception changes."
CPE_58,"**The Actor's Craft**

Actors sometimes face criticism and scorn. Much of this negativity comes from the actors themselves when they are asked to discuss their work in interviews. Instead of sharing their true feelings, they often resort to tired clichés or gossip. Paul Scofield once wrote to a friend that an actor's work is only alive when performed. Discussing it makes it feel empty and theoretical. Each time an actor performs, they start anew, learning from the characters and the writer. After a play ends, they feel empty until the next performance, and this emptiness is evident in discussions about acting.

**A Review of Hamlet**

Adrian Lester's portrayal of Hamlet captures the character's transition from boyhood to manhood with remarkable simplicity and confidence. His control over the text and his physical presence elevate him from a promising actor to a leading performer. Lester plays a young man filled with suppressed anger, using sharp wit and humor that make him both intimidating and endearing. His performance is skillful, evident in his body language, which suggests a character waiting to be brought to life. Similarly, Handy's portrayal of Horatio conveys a sense of being moved by an inner force.

**What is Acting?**

What does it mean to act? Is it merely copying behavior, or does it bring something deeper to life? This question lies at the heart of theatre.

**One Director's Approach to Rehearsal**

This director's rehearsal begins with a process called ""dropping in."" The stage manager displays the script on a screen while the actors listen quietly. When it’s their turn to speak, they read the first line, reflect on its meaning, and wait for the impulse to speak. For example, when the line is, ""Queuing all night, the rain, do you remember?"" they take a breath and let the thought come to them. They might visualize a queue at a bus stop or a concert. The director encourages actors to connect with their character's situation and to trust the process without overthinking.

**The Perfect Theatre**

The ideal theatre should make you feel that your presence matters. Attending a live performance is a special event, and the staff should recognize this. It feels isolating if the front-of-house staff treat it like just another job. The theatre must create a connection between the performers and the audience. Audience members should feel close enough to hear and see everything clearly. The design of the auditorium is crucial; it should complement the human voice and body. If the space feels too large, it detracts from the experience. Many theatres built in the late 1800s achieved this balance, creating an inviting atmosphere. 

When it comes to plays, you cannot please everyone. Audiences often don’t know what they want until they see it. When you go to the theatre, you seek something unexpected; otherwise, you might as well stay home."
CPE_37,"**Text:**

**Paul Simon**  
In the 1950s, rock and roll was mainly a music style for young people, but it had a huge effect on the middle class and older adults. It also opened doors for the next generation of rock stars, who listened to this exciting and unusual music, knowing it would be an important part of their lives. For Paul Simon and many other young people in the US, the best way to hear this new music was through Alan Freed's radio show, Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party. Freed's show was essential listening for many young aspiring rock stars. Just like John Lennon, who was far away in Liverpool, listening to Radio Luxembourg—the only European station playing rock and roll—Paul Simon was captivated by the music from Freed's show. He was getting ready to take the next big step for a teenager obsessed with rock and roll: moving from listening to creating his own music.

**Snow**  
I couldn't see a clear path, but I thought I would be fine if I walked carefully. The wind was strong, pushing me down as I slipped on the icy ground. Suddenly, the snow that looked harmless gave way, and I fell into a hole about four feet deep. The snow had formed a roof over a gap between two rocks, and when it melted, it left only a thin layer that I fell through. I managed to pull myself out, feeling shaken and worried about what would have happened if the hole had been much deeper. I leaned against a pine tree sticking out of the snow to think about my situation. After an hour, I had only gone about half a mile. It was clear that I would have to change my plans.

**Qualitative Research**  
There are many books that try to help researchers understand qualitative research. While a lot has been said about how to collect data, these books often do not explain how to analyze that data. There is still much confusion about how researchers analyze their findings. To address this, we invited various social scientists who have worked on qualitative projects to share their methods. The goal was to provide insight into the process of analyzing qualitative data, rather than creating a guide for new researchers. This task involves making unclear processes clearer. Although this may seem easy, we found it quite challenging. Therefore, we allowed our contributors to present their work in different styles, including personal stories and more formal approaches."
CPE_2,"**Simplified Text:**

**Screen Learning**  
Recently, I saw my six-year-old son eating noodles in a funny way. He was pretending to be a dinosaur, pulling the noodles up with his teeth and trying to look fierce. I asked him what he remembered about dinosaurs, but he didn’t know much. Many people are excited about learning through the internet and computers, but is this a good way to learn? One writer shared his experience using an interactive program with his son. The father read the words while the son played with the pictures. The father thought that if his son had spent ten minutes reading a book, he might have learned more. Research shows that learning happens best when there is conversation with teachers or parents. While using new technology to teach children is good, traditional education is still very important.

**Hollywood**  
By 1918, most of the world’s film-making had moved to Hollywood. The local people were not happy, seeing their neighborhood in Los Angeles changed by these newcomers. However, they eventually accepted this change because success became the main focus. Hollywood knows how to spot a good film, one that can create stars and make money. In less than a hundred years, Hollywood has transformed from a small village to a place as famous as New York, Rome, or Paris. Physically, it has changed a lot; a century ago, you would walk through orange groves to get to the village store. Yet, in some ways, it still feels like a small village, with a narrow focus. People in Hollywood mainly talk about films: how much money they make, who is dating whom, and who is working on which project. Many successful people try to leave Hollywood to live elsewhere, but it remains the center for everyone in show business.

**Photography**  
Photography was created by artists in the 19th century as a way to capture their surroundings. They wanted a lasting record of what they saw, and photography provided that. The combination of light, lenses, and special surfaces created images that were more detailed and realistic than paintings, which took much longer to create. This upset many traditional artists. They initially enjoyed the new images but later claimed that photography could not be considered art because it relied too much on machines. Despite this criticism, photographers recognized that they had discovered a new form of art. They used photography to express their views of the world, just as other artists used brushes and pencils.

**Book Illustration**  
In the past, it was common for every children's book to have illustrations. This also applied to novels for older children, although fewer copies were printed over time. Children's publishing was mostly low-budget, which led to many average-quality works, but the best artists always gave their best effort. Therefore, the collection of black-and-white illustrations is a mix of both valuable and less valuable works, making it a great place for research and discovery. The best illustrations are likely to be shown to the public again, either through new editions of classic books or exhibitions of original artwork. There are signs that interest in this art form is growing again, and soon a creative publisher may produce a series of classic children's book illustrations from this time."
CPE_68,"**Text: Blogging: Sharing with Caution**

Not long ago, a website warned about the dangers of public check-ins, which are online announcements of where you are. The message was clear: while you might think you are simply saying, ""I'm here,"" you are also letting many people know your location, including those you might not want to meet. This highlights a growing concern that there can be negative consequences to the constant sharing that the internet encourages. 

The internet offers many exciting opportunities to share our lives with a global audience, promising wealth and fame. However, as we dive into this digital world, we often find ourselves overwhelmed and lost. This situation may seem discouraging, but there is hope. The path forward was outlined years ago by early internet users who explored these challenges. 

In the early days of the web, these pioneers faced many difficulties, losing jobs and friends while navigating the temptations of fame, long before social media existed. These early bloggers experienced what many of us are now facing. It is important to learn from their experiences, as those who do not learn from the past are likely to repeat it.

In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, began sharing his life online. At that time, the web was mostly used by graduate students and scientists. Hall saw a chance to share his personal experiences. He created a blog filled with his thoughts, photos, and art. By January 1996, he started posting daily, attracting many readers who were fascinated by his boldness. Hall's approach was open; he would feature anyone who crossed his path, and no topic was off-limits. While some may see this as attention-seeking, there was also a unique beauty to his work.

However, one day, visitors to Hall's blog found it replaced by a video titled ""Dark Night."" In it, he shared that he had fallen deeply in love, but when he wrote about it, he was told to choose between his blog and his relationship. He felt that sharing his life online made people distrust him. The blog ended, but the issue of sharing personal information remains. While sharing online can be enjoyable, expecting it to attract people to you can lead to disappointment.

In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a young worker in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, a colleague sent her blog's link to the company's vice presidents, including those she had criticized, which resulted in her losing her job. This situation illustrates what experts call the ""online distribution effect,"" where people feel they can say things online that they would never say in person. However, our online lives are connected to our real lives, and ignoring this can lead to serious mistakes.

Armstrong's story had a positive outcome. Although she was upset and stopped blogging for a while, she eventually got married and restarted her blog, focusing on her family. Today, she is a well-known ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her household. Once a cautionary example of online mistakes, she has become skilled at sharing her life wisely. Armstrong's experience teaches us an important lesson: just because the internet allows us to say anything, it doesn't mean we should."
CPE_23,"**Text: Enough Sleep?**

Tiredness is often seen as a common issue in modern life. As wealthier and busier countries have developed, sleeplessness and anxiety have also increased. Research in the USA shows that 40 million Americans suffer from chronic sleep problems. Some popular novels in Britain even feature characters who cannot sleep or focus on sleep research. 

A key concern is that ""People need more sleep,"" says a sleep expert. Many people reduce their sleep when they are busy, often waking up early to avoid traffic. One researcher conducted an experiment where participants were allowed to sleep for up to 14 hours a night for a month. After three weeks, they settled into an average of eight hours and fifteen minutes of sleep, showing a strong need for more rest.

In Europe, a university sleep research lab in the English Midlands has studied various topics, including how fatigue affects sailors and how noise at airports impacts sleep. They recruit participants through student newspapers, offering £5 an hour and asking them to change their sleep patterns. Dr. Louise Reyner reassures participants who worry about electrodes on their heads, explaining that the lab focuses on physical aspects of sleep.

In a dark room, there is a driving simulator where participants are asked to drive while answering questions. They arrive at 2 PM, a time when people naturally feel sleepy, especially after little or no sleep. As they drive, one participant tries hard to stay awake but begins to blink more frequently and eventually nods off, causing the car to veer off the road. Dr. Reyner notes that drinking two cups of coffee can help someone stay alert for at least half an hour. She suggests various products to help with alertness, especially for shift workers.

What do we know about sleep? Humans, like other mammals, sleep in cycles. When asleep, we go through four stages, from light to deep sleep. Dreams usually happen during light sleep, and the brain temporarily paralyzes the body to prevent injuries. There are theories that sleep helps repair the body or restore muscles, but it is unclear if this happens faster during sleep or while awake. Scientists agree that women tend to sleep about half an hour longer than men, and older people generally need less sleep, though the reasons are unknown.

Some researchers describe sleep in grand terms, saying, ""Sleep is a way to travel through time without harm."" Sleep patterns have changed over time. A history professor studied British sleep habits from 1500 to 1850 and found that people would go to bed early, wake up after midnight for a while, and then sleep again. This break allowed for reflection and even nighttime activities. However, by the 17th century, as artificial light became more common, wealthier people began to adopt a more efficient sleep pattern. The industrial revolution further changed sleep habits, making people work longer hours in lit buildings.

In many non-western cultures, the old sleep patterns still exist. People may sleep for a few hours, wake up, and then sleep again. The idea of a solid night's sleep is not universal. In some tribal societies, sounds from animals and the need to watch over fires make continuous sleep difficult. It appears that people everywhere are in need of more sleep."
CPE_60,"Text: ""We are talking about very expensive cowboy boots. I stood in my 800-dollar designer cowboy boots on the rocks of an old formation in the Arizona desert. Money was not a problem. I wore a complete cowboy outfit, and if you had the outfit, you might be a cowboy. But I was not. It wasn't working for me. I squinted into the morning sun, looking at the Arizona mountains, and I had to admit that I did not feel at home in the wild. After flying in from Denver just after dawn, I thought I might look like a cowboy arriving from the sky. However, that feeling disappeared when I saw a real cowboy in the luggage area of Phoenix airport. He was wearing a dirty shirt, needed a shave, and was lifting a worn bag off the conveyor belt when he noticed my new cowboy boots. He raised one eyebrow and walked out without looking back.

There should be a set of clothes that an ex-racing driver can wear without feeling out of place. Something that allows him to feel comfortable wherever he goes, without feeling like everyone else is moving slowly and speaking a different language. I loved being a racing driver and driving racing cars. I am addicted to it, and it is all I know how to do. But I don’t do it anymore. I couldn’t even if I wanted to. I wondered what I should do now. A racing driver should have one or two backup identities ready for when he stops racing. I thought I had some, but when I tried to reach for them, they vanished.

How about being a commentator at the racetrack? There were many former Indy and Formula One drivers wanting to be commentators, and I was told, 'We’ll call you.' Or how about starting a partnership to sell classic cars? That lasted almost all winter with phone calls, lunches, lawyers, and meetings with bankers. But it was a bad year for selling old Ferraris, and in the end, I stepped back before I lost everything. Being an 'ex' anything is hard. Who wants to hear about how I almost became the World Champion? Nobody wants to hear a story that ends with 'almost.' Even if I had been the champion, you would probably only listen for five minutes before getting bored. Last year’s champion is just that—last year.

Not that I want sympathy, which is good because I don’t get any. Why should I? I had a good career, made money, and saved enough. But I miss the thrill of getting into that powerful racing car with seven hundred horsepower. I miss going from zero to one hundred fifty miles an hour in 4.9 seconds. I even miss the danger of almost crashing every race. I miss the exciting people and the reporters who acted like what I said was important. Being famous, even a little, has its perks. Businessmen and politicians liked to brag that they knew me. Young boys would sneak under fences to get my autograph. 

Now that I don’t drive anymore, I have a lot of free time. Just last week, the phone rang twice. I have time in the morning and afternoon, and tomorrow looks free too. I looked up at the clear blue sky. There were no buzzards flying above. Maybe Arizona doesn’t have buzzards. But a couple of small brown birds in a cactus nearby were telling me to leave their nest alone. I had never thought the desert had songbirds. It made me realize that a fake cowboy in designer boots still has a lot to learn."""
CPE_1,"**Text: Vancouver**

In the past ten years, many people from around the world have moved to Vancouver, a city in western Canada. In the evenings, residents walk through the streets, and if you join them, you will likely hear many different languages. People are attracted to Vancouver because of its mild weather, beautiful location between the ocean and mountains, clean and safe environment, and good educational and job opportunities. Although some locals may complain about the rapid construction of new buildings, it is clear that the new residents and growing tourism have contributed to a vibrant city life. Vancouver was once called 'Terminal City' because it served as a gateway to other places. While this name is less common now, Vancouver is still a major gateway.

**Putting Pen to Paper**

Journalists like me often struggle with writing letters. Some say this is because we dislike writing for free, but I think it is more about how we aim for the best impact in our work, which makes writing a letter feel different. A true artist, who may rewrite their work many times, does not face this issue. I believe that understanding the impact of their words is a key sign of a real artist. For example, when Shakespeare wrote his famous lines, he likely did not think about how the use of longer words made them powerful and showed his talent.

**Supermarket Opening**

In Britain, the opening of a new supermarket used to be a big event. You could expect a celebrity, like a soap star or a member of the royal family, to come and cut the ribbon. Now, new supermarkets seem to open every day, and celebrities are no longer needed. Why pay a famous person when anyone can do it for free? Last week, while waiting, older people didn’t care who opened the new Superbuy store, as long as they were at the front of the line. According to someone who knew an employee, the first five men to enter would receive a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women would get a bunch of flowers. This news spread quickly among the crowd, making those at the front feel proud and causing envy among those who arrived later."
CPE_53,"**Text: Citizen Kane**

When the film *Citizen Kane* was released in 1941, it created a lot of excitement, but it was not a financial success. The release was delayed because the distributors were worried about what William Randolph Hearst, the person the film was thought to be about, might do to them. Although it received very positive reviews, it was television that later brought it back into the public eye. This film has inspired many people to become filmmakers, which is impressive since it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles believed that its success came from his lack of knowledge about what he could or could not do; he simply went for it. He also had a talented team, including cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and special-effects expert Linwood Dunn. When Welles and Mankiewicz decided to create a story about a newspaper magnate who was both like and unlike Hearst, Welles realized he had found the perfect role for himself as both director and actor, and he took this opportunity with great enthusiasm.

**Dermot and Carmel**

That morning, Dermot thought Carmel seemed a bit strange. He had mentioned twice that he might be late and that he might stop by the golf club on his way home to chat with someone. Carmel had nodded as if she hadn’t really heard him. “Will you be okay? What are you planning to do today?” he asked. She smiled and replied, “It’s funny you ask. I was just thinking I have nothing to do today, so I’ll take a walk downtown and look at the shops. I feel like it’s almost wrong to waste the day like this.” Dermot smiled back, saying, “You deserve to enjoy yourself. And if I’m late, I won’t need any food, so don’t worry about it.” “That’s fine,” she said.

**Title Race**

“Tea boy? Do you mind? I’m a mobile lukewarm beverage resource facilitator.” Human nature provides many amusing situations. A recent study revealed that job titles often cause jealousy and problems at work. A survey by a well-known recruitment firm found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees believe that job titles create divisions among coworkers. Surprisingly, 70% of office workers said they would give up a pay raise for a more “motivational” or “professional” job title. If our desire for status is so strong that it overcomes basic greed, we are in trouble. In the early twenty-first century, no one wants to be called subordinate. The job titles being discussed focus on skills (like specialist or coordinator) but are really just fancy words."
CPE_55,"**The Vienna Assignment**

I was in Vienna to take photographs, which was usually why I traveled. Photography was not just my job; it was my passion. The way light fell on different surfaces always inspired me. I believed that a single photograph could capture the essence of a moment, a place, or a person. I always hoped to take the perfect shot, as long as I had film in my camera. My motto was simple: finish one roll, load another, and keep my eyes open. This had been my approach for a long time.

Once, I had a moment of success when a photo of a smoke plume from a burning oil well became popular worldwide. It was a brief moment of fame, mostly due to luck. They say you create your own opportunities, both good and bad. After that, I decided to work freelance, which seemed like a smart choice. However, life took some unexpected turns. The mid-nineties were not as successful as I had hoped, especially after my photo made the cover of Time magazine. That’s why I found myself in Vienna instead of a more exciting location. But I was still taking photographs and getting paid for it, which I didn’t mind.

The assignment came about by chance. I had previously taken photos for a book called *Four Cities in Four Seasons*, which featured London, Paris, Rome, and Vienna. I had received a good commission for capturing my city in different seasons. I had my own unique style, but I knew that much of my work would be overlooked since it was just a picture book. After a cold snap over Christmas, I submitted my winter photos of London and learned that the Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, had left his job in Vienna for unknown reasons. Instead of hiring someone new, they offered me the job. The Austrian publishers liked my work, and I was available, unlike the French and Italian photographers. I was eager to go, as things were not going well for me at home. A week in snowy Vienna was a welcome change.

They arranged for me to stay at the Europa hotel in the old city. My last visit to Vienna had been a busy weekend with my wife, where we rushed through many palaces and museums. It had been hot and chaotic, and I hadn’t taken many photos. This time, being alone in the cold January weather would be different. I felt it the moment I arrived and saw the beautiful light over the snow-covered roofs. I was excited to take great pictures.

On my first day, I didn’t rush to take photos. Instead, I rode the trams around the Ringstrasse, getting on and off to experience the city’s atmosphere. The weather was cold and still, like the grand buildings from the old empire. I hadn’t seen what Schussner had captured in the other seasons, and I didn’t want to. This was going to be my Vienna, and I was ready to discover it.

A photograph captures a moment, but you must wait for the right moment. So, I took my time, observing until I was ready. The next morning, I woke up early. The overnight snow made Stephansplatz beautifully white and almost empty. I struggled to find a way to photograph the cathedral, which towered high into the grey sky but appeared massive at ground level. I realized I might have to focus on just part of it. In that weather, it could still be magical. Photography has always had a sense of magic, even for those who first explored it in the nineteenth century. You can watch a blank sheet of paper turn into a photograph in a dark room. Even when you understand the process, the mystery remains. Perhaps that’s why what happened at Stephansplatz that morning didn’t surprise me in the way I expected."
CPE_50,"**Text: Kinetic Art Celebration**

The Hayward Gallery in London has changed from a serious place into one full of wonder. This transformation is not due to a big-budget show, but rather a unique exploration of a lesser-known part of the last 60 years: kinetic art, which is art that involves movement. The new exhibition looks at the history of kinetic art in the twentieth century. It shows that creating art that moves or explores the idea of movement has been an important, though often overlooked, theme in creative work during this time. 

Curator Guy Brett, who has studied kinetic art for many years, has gathered a wonderful collection of paintings, drawings, documents, and films. These are mostly presented without much text, allowing visitors to enjoy discovering connections and insights on their own.

**David Hockney**

David Hockney's art attracts many people who might not usually be interested in art. This could be because his work is figurative and easy to understand, or because it offers a break from everyday life. Some might even be drawn to Hockney's lively personality and humor, which make him popular in the media. However, this raises the question: does this popularity mean his art lacks depth? Some critics believe Hockney is an overrated artist. Yet, one could argue that his popularity today might be seen as a negative rather than a reflection of his artistic value. Hockney himself is aware of his limitations and believes it is not important to judge his work against an abstract idea of greatness. He does not claim to be a great artist and understands that only future generations can truly assess his importance.

**Window-shopping - An Art Exhibition**

In recent years, I have attended many contemporary art exhibitions, some brilliant and others mediocre. What frustrates me are shows that seem to push a specific agenda, suggesting a common viewpoint among certain artists. Sometimes this approach works, revealing new trends in seemingly unrelated works. More often, it highlights a questionable angle or a forced idea. This led me, as a curator, to create a show that opposes this trend. Along with seven artists, I took over an empty warehouse space. 'Window-shopping' was meant to showcase individual artworks that connected only by being labeled as art. 

For example, Sam Cole's knitted cats chased each other on a toy train track, while Matthew Crawley filmed a video camera, opening it up and breaking it, creating a flickering display on a monitor. These pieces did not fit into a specific theme and would not usually be shown together, but they complemented each other in their contrast. While I did not make grand statements about contemporary art, I believe that art is fundamentally an individual activity where artists define their own boundaries.

**Art History**

People who enjoy paintings sometimes hesitate to analyze them, fearing it will ruin their enjoyment. Some believe that art historians, who focus on theory rather than practice, overlook the joy of viewing art and the special act of creating it. This idea is similar to thinking that knowing a recipe and cooking method takes away from the enjoyment of a dish. Understanding something can actually enhance our pleasure in it. 

Moreover, pleasure is complex. Our senses and how we perceive them can be questioned. Our preferences for certain art characteristics are influenced not just by our genes or personalities, but also by the values of the society we live in. While it is important to appreciate our instinctive responses to art, the belief that intellectual understanding diminishes enjoyment is an outdated idea that once promoted art as a substitute for thought."
CPE_25,"**Text: Metals**  
Stone Age people may have been interested in metals for decoration. While sitting by a river, one of our early ancestors might have found a shiny yellow pebble and picked it up. It felt different from stone and was attractive. This could be how gold became important to early humans. Because gold is easy to shape, it quickly became a popular material. Copper may have also been discovered by chance, and once people realized how useful copper tools were, they actively searched for copper ores and ways to extract the metal. This led to the development of metalworking, adding to the skills that helped our ancestors improve their lives.

**St Ives**  
We were quiet as we carried our bags down the narrow, cobbled street leading to the town center, trying to stay upright against the strong wind and avoiding the icy waves crashing over the walkway. The streets were empty, and every cottage by the water had its shutters closed tight against the storm. We had seen the weather get worse as we arrived in St Ives on a small train. With the dark skies closing in, visiting Cornwall in the off-season without a car didn’t seem like a good idea anymore. I had convinced my friend to come with me by promising beautiful walks along the Cornish coast and cozy evenings by the fire.

**Computer Modelling**  
Studying the past is challenging because it is gone. The people who lived in times of peace and hardship are no longer here. The reasons they settled in certain places or formed families and communities have been forgotten. Archaeology gives us some clues, but we cannot test our ideas with experiments on past cultures. We cannot rewind time to see what happened. However, computer modelling allows us to recreate ancient landscapes and environments, filling them with virtual communities that have some needs and abilities like real humans. We can set rules for these communities and simulate social groups. Then, we can change the weather or increase the population and observe how these digital cultures and their artificial people respond."
CPE_34,"**Simplified Text:**

**Vervet Monkeys**  
Cheney and Seyfarth studied vervet monkeys and observed a dominant male in a group. One day, he saw a strange male nearby, who seemed interested in joining the group. If the stranger succeeded, the current male could lose his position. To keep the stranger away, the dominant male cleverly made an alarm call that vervet monkeys use to warn of a leopard. This scared the stranger back into the trees. He repeated this tactic whenever the stranger approached. However, the dominant male made a mistake by calling out the alarm while walking across the open ground himself. 

**What Cats Catch**  
In a survey in the English village of Felmersham, residents recorded what their cats caught over a year. Seventy cats caught over 1,000 prey items. An American professor estimated that all cats in Britain might kill 100 million birds and small mammals each year. However, this number is misleading. Most cats live in towns and catch fewer animals than those in the survey. The important question is whether these numbers are sustainable. The answer seems to be yes. In winter, many people feed birds, and gardens provide nesting sites, keeping bird populations above natural levels. The survey showed that while cats are significant predators, they are not destroying Britain's bird population.

**Buffalo's Day**  
Buffaloes are very important to the marshmen, who care for them deeply. Each morning, the buffaloes, after sleeping near their owners, slowly leave for the reed beds beyond the water. They often groan about their tiredness before finally moving forward into the water. Once in the water, they seem to forget their purpose and wallow there, making low sounds of complaint. Their movements away from the house are slow and almost unnoticed, but eventually, they swim, appearing to struggle to keep their noses above the water. They spend the day among the reeds, grazing on green shoots at their eye level.

**Picasso, Pablo**  
In early spring 1940, while in the fishing port of Royan, Picasso painted several still lifes of fish. One painting shows a fishmonger's table with a crab and some soles. Despite being on the table, the fish look alive. The painting is complex, with overlapping shapes and soft colors, creating a calm underwater feel. However, there is tension as the fish seem to be preparing for a fight with the crab. The sharp shapes in the painting, including a chain around one fish, add a sense of danger and hidden violence, giving the artwork a deeper meaning."
CPE_12,"**Text: Photography**

Over the last 150 years, photography has been used to capture all parts of human life. In this relatively short time, photography has improved its ability to record moments in time and space, allowing us to see both large and small details. It has given us images from faraway places, distant parts of the solar system, and the complex social issues of modern life. Photography has become one of the most important ways to express what it means to be human.

However, the idea of recording events visually has a much longer history. The earliest forms of visual recording date back to the Upper Palaeolithic period, around 35,000 years ago. We cannot be sure why early cave paintings were created. They may have recorded actual hunting events, served as magic to help with hunting, acted as religious symbols, or simply brightened daily life. Nevertheless, visual images are deeply connected to human culture.

Throughout history, people have questioned how accurate visual images are and what role they play in society. The saying ""seeing is believing"" has always given special importance to visual images. When photography was invented in the mid-1800s, it seemed to promise a truthful visual record. The camera was thought to work like the human eye, capturing fixed images that closely resembled what we see. The chemical process used to fix images allowed for the capture of what we consider natural phenomena.

At the same time, photography was seen as a sophisticated cultural achievement, producing images that artists had long tried to create through skill and effort. Ironically, because photography seemed so realistic, it was believed that everyone could easily understand photographs. This led to the idea that photography might be a ""universal language."" For instance, in 1933, photographer August Sander suggested that even the most isolated person could understand a photograph of the sky, whether it showed the sun, moon, or stars.

However, with the rapid growth of global communication in the late twentieth century, we must consider how well photographic images can cross cultural boundaries. Is photography as influenced by cultural norms as other forms of communication, like language? Has our familiarity with photographs made us overlook the complex ways they convey vivid impressions of reality?

Photography is often seen as providing convincing evidence, making the medium seem transparent and blurring the line between our perception of the world and its photographic representations. It is common for someone to show a photograph and say, ""This is my grandson."" Since its invention in 1839, photography and the attitudes towards it have changed significantly. This change may be partly due to photography moving into what could be called ""mythic time."" Its original role as a record-keeper has evolved, and photographs, once immediate and personal, have become historical documents. These images often reveal as much about the people and society that created them as they do about their subjects.

I aim to show that the camera is not just a silent recorder of events. Photography does not merely reflect culture; it can also inspire social and political change. For example, it is hard to imagine the cultural shifts of the Italian Renaissance without acknowledging how the development of perspective changed visual representation. Similarly, photography has played a significant role in shaping the media culture of our time, while also bringing the harsh realities of the world into our everyday lives."
CPE_26,"**How to Write Poetry**

Telling people how to write poetry can be tricky. While creativity is important, making one mistake can lead to confusion. I believe that for beginners, the best way to learn is through reading a lot, writing often, and allowing your imagination to flow freely, as long as it doesn’t become chaotic. Some people need a stable life to write poetry, while others find inspiration in their struggles. Some writers follow a schedule, while others wait for a moment of inspiration. All approaches are valid, as long as they don’t follow strict rules. The key is to find your own voice, nurture it, and let it grow until it can stand on its own.

**The Short Story**

In a short story, it’s important not to overcrowd it with too many characters or long descriptions. Flashbacks should be brief and only used when necessary to clarify something. A memory in the main character’s mind can help move the story forward, but it should not slow down the action. Dialogue is very useful; it can show different perspectives quickly and keep the reader engaged. Avoiding excessive writing is crucial, but being brief doesn’t mean the story should feel incomplete. Conflict and action should be strong in a short story, but every word must be meaningful in the limited space.

**Screenplays**

Writing a screenplay is similar to playing chess. Many chess players make moves without knowing the outcome, but they learn to see a few steps ahead. Over time, they understand that chess is about long-term strategy rather than just immediate moves. They begin to see the game as a whole, recognizing patterns and strategies. The more you practice writing screenplays, the more you understand its complexities.

**Looking at Writing**

Humans naturally communicate, as seen in how children talk. However, writing is not instinctive. Charles Darwin noted that while language is a natural human ability, written language is not. All cultures have language, and while languages evolve, they do not necessarily improve. Children learn to speak without formal lessons, and when they lack a common language, they create their own. In contrast, writing systems have been developed only a few times in history and often started as simple codes. Until recently, many children did not learn to read or write, and even today, some struggle. Children are naturally good at listening and speaking, but learning to write is a skill that takes time and effort. We need to understand how writing works and how to help children learn it effectively."
CPE_8,"Text: ""I have never started a novel with so much doubt. If I call it a novel, it is only because I don't know what else to call it. I have little story to tell, and I do not end with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave my reader uncertain. This book is about my memories of a man I met only occasionally, and I do not know much about what happened to him in between our meetings. I could invent details to make my story more complete, but I do not want to do that. I just want to share what I know. To protect the privacy of living people, I have given the characters in this story names I made up, and I have taken care to ensure that no one can recognize them. The man I am writing about is not famous, and he may never be. When his life ends, he might leave no more mark on the world than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the water's surface. If my book is read, it will be for its own interest. However, it is possible that his way of life and the unique qualities of his character may influence others, so that long after he is gone, people may realize that a remarkable person lived in this time. Then it will be clear who I am writing about, and those who want to know a bit about his early life may find something useful in my book. I believe my book will be a helpful source of information for my friend's biographers. I do not claim that the conversations I recorded are exact. I never took notes, but I remember well what concerns me, and although I have put these conversations in my own words, they reflect what was said. I mentioned earlier that I have invented nothing, but I have taken the liberty that historians take to create dialogues for characters that I did not hear. I did this to make the scenes more lively and believable, as they would be less effective if told plainly. I want to be read, and I think I am justified in making my book engaging. A thoughtful reader will see where I have used this technique and can choose to ignore it. Another reason I feel nervous about this work is that the people I write about come from a different culture. It is hard to truly know people, and I believe we can only really know our own countrymen. People are shaped by their surroundings: the place they were born, the home they grew up in, the games they played, the food they ate, the schools they attended, the sports they followed, and the poets they read. These experiences shape who they are, and you cannot understand them just by hearing about them; you must live them. You can only know them if you are one of them. Because you cannot fully understand people from a different nation except through observation, it is challenging to give them authenticity in a book. I have never tried to write about anyone but my own countrymen, and if I have done so in short stories, it is because those allow for a more general treatment of characters. You can give broad descriptions and let the reader fill in the details. In this book, I do not claim that my characters see themselves as they truly are; they are seen, like my main character, through my own perspective."""
CPE_4,"**POETRY RECITALS**

Throughout history, the world of literature often seems confusing to those experiencing it. However, later generations can see clear patterns and important figures in retrospect. Currently, there is a complex mix of poetic styles, different types of poetry, and various opinions on how poetry should be presented, criticized, and taught. 

A major discussion in contemporary poetry is between serious 'literary' poets, who write poems meant to be read on the page, and 'popular' poets, who prefer to perform their work for an audience. This division is not strict. Over the last twenty years, public poetry readings have become more common in many forms. Small literary groups in towns hold readings in community centers or members' homes; schools and colleges invite poets to speak to students; and arts festivals often feature poetry readings by well-known authors.

The impact of these events on poets is varied and uncertain. For 'pop' poets, whose work is designed for live performance, public readings are beneficial. Their poems are usually simple and can be understood easily in one hearing. However, the weaknesses in their writing often show up when read on the page. 

On the other hand, dedicated poets, who strive to create deep and meaningful work, may not be appreciated by audiences who are hearing their poems for the first time. The risk is that these poets might choose to read only their simplest pieces to connect quickly with the audience, which may not represent their best work. 

Attending poetry readings cannot replace reading poetry from a book, but it can be a fun and educational experience. Hearing skilled poets read their work, even if they are not great speakers, helps the audience understand the important parts of the poems. It is best if listeners have the text in front of them or know the poems beforehand. 

The main reason for popular poetry recitals, sometimes combined with music, is to help audiences enjoy poetry and see it as an art form accessible to everyone, not just a select few."
CPE_30,"**Oral History**  
Historians increasingly use oral evidence, but this approach has challenges. It is overly simplistic to think that a person's testimony is a clear reflection of their past experiences. In an interview, both the interviewer and the interviewee influence each other. The historian chooses who to interview and what topics to discuss. Even if the historian only listens, their presence can change how the informant remembers and shares their past. The final account is shaped by the historian's social status and their understanding of history, which may be communicated to the informant. Thus, historians must acknowledge their role in creating new evidence. The challenges continue even after the historian leaves. The informant's memories are not direct connections to the past; they can be influenced by other sources, such as the media. Memories may also be colored by nostalgia or feelings of loss from childhood, which may have developed later in life. The emotions and attitudes expressed can make the testimony seem convincing, but they might reflect later experiences rather than the actual past.

**Animal Science**  
Animal science has two main approaches: physiological and whole animal. Physiologists focus on how the body functions, including how nerves, muscles, and senses work together to create complex behaviors. Those who study the whole animal look at the behavior of animals in their natural state and the factors that influence it. Within this approach, there are psychologists and ethologists. Psychologists often conduct experiments in labs with a limited number of species, like rats and pigeons. Ethologists study natural, unlearned behaviors of animals in the wild. While this distinction still exists, there is now collaboration between the two fields. Physiologists often claim their methods are more fundamental. However, understanding how nerve cells work does not eliminate the need to study behavior itself, as behavior has its own structure and units that must be examined. Trying to explain a bird's nest-building behavior solely through nerve cell activity would be like trying to read a book with a powerful microscope.

**The Social Sciences**  
Students beginning to study social sciences face a dual challenge. They must learn both the content of their new subject and the methods used to study it. This means they need to understand not only the knowledge and research findings in textbooks but also the methods used to gather and organize that knowledge. These two aspects are interconnected. Although we all have experience with social life, social sciences go beyond common sense. Each discipline focuses on specific aspects of social life, uses particular research methods, and has its own concepts. These concepts form the logical foundation of the subject, allowing social scientists to move beyond everyday understanding and differentiate one discipline from another.

**Classical Architecture**  
In the classical world of Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building structures. According to the Roman architect Vitruvius, architecture involves Order, Arrangement, Proportion, Symmetry, Propriety, and Distribution. He also provides Greek equivalents for some of these terms, likely based on earlier Greek sources that are now lost. While utility and function are not part of his initial definition, Vitruvius later discusses the best forms and arrangements for different types of buildings. At the start, the focus is on aesthetics, viewing architecture as an art. The origins of classical architecture are complex, with a long history of simple constructions in Greece and Italy that did not meet Vitruvius' artistic standards. Although these early structures may seem basic, they contributed essential elements that influenced later architectural concepts. Despite its elaborate appearance, the classical temple essentially resembles a simple, single-room hut."
CPE_7,"The two sisters kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for a while. Lily would drive around the gardens and the railway, jumping over a small bridge with all four wheels in the air, which was her only mistake. After that, they would arrive at the gasworks, where there was a strong smell of sulphur. Surprisingly, Chen found it funny that his wife was driving without him knowing. ""So you can really drive, Lily? Well done!"" he said. Mui thought it was strange that her brother-in-law was not upset. Instead, he was excited and made plans with Lily for a trip. They decided to go on a Monday at the start of next month, the quietest day of the week, leaving early and returning by noon to avoid losing customers. In the meantime, Lily would practice driving. Despite her doubts, Mui bought a road map and got a ten percent discount, which impressed Chen, but Lily felt a bit insulted by Mui's lack of trust in her navigation skills.

Within an hour of leaving home, they were looking at the English Channel. Lily drove very well. Even Mui, who was in the back seat ready to give directions, had to admit this. On the road, Lily overtook a few slow cars with great skill, making Mui hold back her own comments. Chen even applauded her. After passing the gasworks and the lagoon with its small boats, they drove smoothly along the empty promenade. Lily parked in a quiet street with many empty spaces. She was unsure about the road signs and preferred to pay for parking rather than risk getting a ticket. She thought this might ease Mui's worries. 

While driving, Lily noticed her sister's tense face in the mirror. She decided not to add to Mui's worries. Lily locked all the van doors and checked each one carefully. ""Don't worry,"" Chen joked. ""No one will want that old thing."" The sisters were offended. Lily accused Chen of being ungrateful, and Mui scolded him for being too quick to judge by appearances. Surprised, Chen took Man Kee to look at the grey sea. He held his son close and thought about how he wanted to raise him. Chen wanted Man Kee to learn about numbers, which he struggled with, and to grow up owning many restaurants, gaining experience along the way. The dark sea made Chen feel thoughtful as he planned for Man Kee's future.

In the distance, he saw smoke where the sea met the horizon, and then, sparkling in the morning sun, he spotted a ship. He found a telescope nearby and put a coin in it to look at the ship. At first, he couldn't find it, but then he saw it—a large, rusty tramp steamer. He lifted Man Kee to the telescope. ""Do you see the ship, Son?"" he asked gently. ""It's a special ship for people like us. It's small and old, but that's just what others see. We know better, don't we, Son? This ship will take us back home when we're done here. It will take you to your homeland, which you have never seen."" Chen kissed Man Kee's head. Lily and Mui were behind them. Lily put her arm around Chen's shoulders. ""The little old ship,"" Chen said. ""Let your mother see, Son."" Man Kee didn't want to let go of the telescope, and when he finally did, the view was just a blurry white light. By the time Chen found another coin, the ship had disappeared over the horizon, leaving Lily watching seagulls searching for food in the water."
CPE_43,"**Text: THE WELL**

I had read that if you dig deep enough, you can see the stars on a clear day. I convinced you to help me with my idea; you watched, surprised, as I pulled up the well bucket, steadied it, and then climbed in. I asked you to lower me down. I didn’t think about how heavy the bucket would be or that you might not want to just let it happen. You held the handle, helping me as I pushed the bucket off the edge. As soon as it was free, I fell. You screamed and tried to stop it, but then you let go. I fell into the well and hit my head. At that moment, I didn’t realize I had achieved my goal. I saw strange lights, like the stars I usually saw in cartoons when a character got hurt. At first, I was confused, then scared, then relieved, and finally angry at you for letting me fall and worried about what Mother would say. You called down to check if I was okay. I opened my mouth to shout, but then I heard panic in your voice, and I couldn’t speak. I lay still, peeking at you through my eyelashes. You ran off to get help. I waited a moment, then climbed back up and pulled myself over the edge, landing on the courtyard stones. I heard worried voices coming from the castle. I ran away to hide in the shadows by the moat bridge. Mother and Father came with you and old Arthur; Mother was screaming. Father shouted for Arthur to help with the winch. You stood back, looking shocked. I felt a rush of excitement. Then I noticed the drops of water I had left from the well to where I stood. I looked in horror at the dark spots on the dry stones. A small pool of water formed at my feet. I looked back at the courtyard, where Father was shining a flashlight into the well. The drops sparkled in the sunlight. I couldn’t believe no one had seen them. Mother was now screaming loudly, a sound I had never heard before. It shook me. What should I do? I had gotten back at you, but things had become more serious than I expected. What started as a fun prank quickly turned into something that would lead to serious trouble for someone, probably me. I regretted not thinking this through. From clever plan to disaster in just a few minutes. Suddenly, an idea came to me. I gathered my courage and left my hiding place, staggering out and blinking. I called out softly, then yelled louder when no one heard me. I stumbled a bit further and then fell dramatically on the stones. Sitting up, comforted by my crying mother, I sighed and said I had found a secret tunnel from the bottom of the well to the moat, and crawled through it until I got out. I thought I was almost getting away with it until Father squatted in front of me. He made me repeat my story. I hesitated. His eyes narrowed. Thinking I was filling in gaps, I said the secret passage had collapsed after me; there was no point in sending someone to look for it. I said the well was dangerous. I looked into my father's eyes, and it felt like looking into a dark tunnel with no light. It was as if he was seeing me for the first time, and I was seeing how the world looked from an adult's perspective. My words got stuck in my throat. ""Don't be ridiculous, boy,"" he said, sounding more disappointed than I thought possible. He stood up and walked away. Arthur looked down at me, his face showing regret and concern. He seemed to understand my lie, worried about what it meant for my character and future. His pity felt like a harsh judgment, even worse than my father's, and it affected me deeply."
CPE_51,"**REMOVAL DAY**

Now that her children are grown, Susan, who is a widow, must leave her family home. The van was labeled 'Removers of Distinction', and indeed, everything that made the house special was being taken away. Fred, the removal man, carefully packed all the fragile items, while his helpers were not as gentle. The house was beautiful, a four-story building with a view of a small harbor. Memories of her children growing up lingered in the air, like dust. When they first bought the house, her son Robert, who was five at the time, had asked, ""Mum, how do you get a house home?"" It was easy to miss the little boy he used to be; now he was here, helping, especially making sure Susan didn’t forget about the piano. Francesca, their daughter, was also helping, insisting that only she could take care of the valuable Steinway piano.

Fred commented, ""She doesn’t look like she’s going to cry."" Susan asked, ""Do people cry?"" Fred replied, ""You’d be surprised. They seem happy while packing, but then they cry in an empty room. They’re fine once they reach the new place; it’s just hard to see everything taken apart."" Susan understood that feeling. If it were up to her, she would have warned the movers about the piano before they started. But Robert insisted it was the movers' responsibility to notice any issues. The piano stood alone in the best room of the house, and they planned to move it last.

Sitting on the bottom stair, with all the chairs gone, Susan remembered the day they moved in. Today felt like that day played in reverse—the piano had been the first thing brought in, but it got stuck on the stairs. The movers struggled for nearly two hours, and little Robert watched in awe while Francesca cried, ""We can’t live in a house without a piano!"" They had to find a way to get it inside, and her late husband, Peter, had solved the problem. They left the piano outside while they moved in the other furniture, which was much less back then. The next day, a builder removed the first-floor window, and a crane was borrowed to lift the piano through the window. The children were overjoyed to see it come in, but it took months to afford to have it tuned.

Peter had said, ""That’s there forever."" But forever is a long time. The children were too busy to visit often, and Susan found it harder to move around the house. She thought about the stairs and remembered the banister rails were still not perfectly fixed. She should have warned the movers, but it was too late now. She felt dazed and panicked. Fred asked, ""Are you all right?"" He reminded her that the piano was the last item to go. Susan moved away from the stairs, her heart racing. Robert and Francesca appeared to watch.

Fred casually asked, ""No tears then?"" Truthfully, she was close to crying. It was strange how moving things made them feel so important. Items that seemed unimportant while they were in place now felt full of emotion. Just then, the piano appeared, being carefully carried down the stairs. Fred called out, ""Easy does it!"" They brought it outside and set it down behind the van. Robert laughed first, and soon they were all laughing, relieved it was over. They leaned against each other, gasping for breath and laughing more. Fred asked, ""What’s the joke?"" but his question only made them laugh harder. As they walked down the path for the last time, the only tears Susan shed were tears of laughter."
CPE_11,"**Text: Online Literary Criticism for Everyone**

**Do-it-yourself literary criticism: Is it just harmless fun?**

From the beginning, one of the main ideas behind the Internet was to allow open access. In theory, anyone could publish their thoughts or share music online. However, in the early days, some technical skills were needed. Still, there was one area that truly became available to everyone: literary criticism. By visiting Amazon.com, the first popular online bookstore, anyone could try writing book reviews. 

Amazon's approach to book reviews was simple: anyone could share their opinion and give a book up to five stars. Each book had its own page, and when a reader wrote a review, it appeared automatically. This allowed Amazon to fill its site with free reviews, and potential buyers could see what other readers thought, rather than just relying on publisher descriptions or professional critics.

Other online bookstores, which also had physical locations, offered similar features. However, Amazon was the largest, controlling over 80% of the online market. This meant it had the most customers and received the most reviews, but it also faced issues with fake reviews. Thousands of reviews were submitted daily, making it hard to check them all. A team of editors monitored the site to ensure reviews followed the rules, such as not allowing one-word reviews or personal attacks on authors.

Despite these rules, reviewers remained anonymous, and inappropriate reviews were only removed if noticed by Amazon's team. This created opportunities for mischief. For instance, authors could write positive reviews for their own books. One author, Lev Grossman, was upset by the negative reviews of his first novel, so he wrote several anonymous positive ones to balance things out. His trick worked until he revealed it in an article, after which the fake reviews were removed.

Authors had a way to comment on their books by clicking a link that said, ""I am the Author, and I wish to comment on my book."" Most authors used this to share cheerful messages encouraging readers to buy and enjoy their books. Some even provided their email addresses for direct communication. However, Amazon did not verify that these comments were truly from the authors, except for well-known writers. A lesser-known author once submitted a comment pretending to be famous writer John Updike, but it was quickly identified as fake and removed.

The real drama often came from readers, not writers. When James McElroy's book, *We've Got Spirit*, about a small-town cheerleading team, was published, it received good reviews from the press. However, many people mentioned in the book felt hurt and used Amazon's page to express their anger. Many negative reviews appeared but disappeared a few days later. Despite this, Amazon saw the high level of engagement with reviews as beneficial for business. 

Amazon aimed to keep reviews focused on discussing books rather than casual chatting, especially for bestsellers. This meant that silly reviews were more likely to appear on pages for less popular books. For example, *The Story about Ping*, a classic children's book about a duck, inspired humorous reviews that compared its plot to Internet technology. One long review even made a detailed analogy between the book and networking concepts.

However, such silliness was rare. Most reviewers took their contributions seriously, and overall, the reviews provided a good indication of whether a book was worth buying. Writer George Orwell once said that reviewing too many books required inventing feelings about books he didn’t care for. This highlights why the democratization of literary criticism is a positive development."
CPE_14,"**Text: Art in Modern Times**

In recent years, especially over the last two hundred years, we often think that every artist must challenge the art of their time. Art is celebrated for being unique, revolutionary, and sometimes shocking. We enjoy admiring artists whose work was not valued in the past. However, when it comes to contemporary art, we often hesitate and claim that some artists have gone too far, suggesting that their work is no longer art. The media often reflects this sentiment, and we tend to agree because we expect art to constantly surprise us. This expectation makes us overlook the traditional themes and techniques that are still present in modern art. We want artists to be different from us, with special talents that set them apart. In the past, people commissioned artists for specific purposes, making art a part of everyday life. Today, we leave artists to work independently and sometimes become frustrated if they try to connect with us.

**Picture This**

I will describe a situation and then ask an important question. An artist selects a text from an art book that discusses the variety of pictures. The text asks, ""What are they all about?"" and concludes that there are countless types of pictures. This may seem simplistic, but bear with me. The artist then asks someone to prepare a canvas and take it to a sign painter. He instructs the sign painter to write the chosen text on the canvas in plain black letters without any decoration. The sign painter follows these instructions. My important question is: is the final product a painting?

**Underground Encounters**

At the Mercury Gallery in London until June 26, there is an unspoken rule in the art world: once an artist finds success in a particular style, they should stick to it. Collectors expect artists to continue producing similar work, and if they try something new, it can lead to disappointment among fans. Gallery owners prefer artists who are reliable, and perhaps buyers feel more comfortable with familiar styles. However, some artists, like Picasso and Hockney, successfully break this pattern. Eric Rimmington is another artist who is trying something different. He is moving away from the still lifes that made him famous to focus on the London Underground. Rimmington finds the railway fascinating. His earlier drawings of King's Cross Station led him to explore the underground world. His new exhibition, ""Underground Encounters,"" features 40 paintings and drawings that capture the unique charm of this hidden environment.

**Extract from a Novel**

I have come to this island with a few books. I use the word ""escape"" because the villagers jokingly say that only someone unwell would choose such a remote place to recover. So, I am here to heal myself. Besides an old woman from the village who comes daily to clean, I am alone. I feel neither happy nor sad; I am like a feather floating in memories. I mentioned the uselessness of art but did not speak of its comforts. The true comfort of my work lies in the fact that, in the quiet moments of a painter or writer, reality can be reshaped and revealed in a meaningful way. Our everyday actions often hide the deeper significance of life. For artists, there is joy in using art to confront the challenges of daily life, not to escape from them, but to embrace our true potential through imagination. Otherwise, why would we hurt each other?"
CPE_63,"**Family Business**

""Listen, this isn't good!"" said my Dad. We were in the car heading back to London. My father, with my brother Maurice beside him, had just picked me up from the fancy girls' school I attended. He had also just been to Parent's Day, where I received the Latin prize and the award for the best results in my final exams. He had a long talk with my headteacher, and now we were on our way home for the holidays.

""What isn't?"" I asked, though I had a feeling I knew what he was thinking because he was unusually quiet. Normally, he talked a lot. ""You can't trick me. You'll do what you want now,"" he said. ""With all those certificates, I heard you might get a scholarship to Oxford."" ""So?"" I replied, trying to act tough. ""Wouldn't that be useful?"" ""I also heard,"" he continued, and I knew a serious talk was coming, ""that you want to be a barrister. A barrister!"" My father knew a lot about lawyers and the law. ""I just said that,"" I replied. ""I couldn't think of anything else!"" ""And apparently,"" he went on, ""you have the right personality - you can quickly understand complex information, you are good at speaking, and you enjoy performing."" ""I don't know about that,"" I said. ""All I know is what I see on TV."" ""Regardless,"" he said, gathering himself, ""I feel like your heart won't be in the family business. Clearly, you'll go to Oxford, and after that, I can't see you wanting to join us.""

The problem was that, like many children of family businesses, I felt trapped by my father's expectations. I saw many career options and wanted to explore them. At the same time, I didn't want to upset my father. I wasn't as scared of him as Maurice was - I was the favorite - but I still found him intimidating. ""It's too early to know,"" I said weakly. ""I tell you, you won't want to join us,"" my father said, who often turned out to be right about such things. ""It's a shame because you have the talent - the intelligence, the courage, the vision."" ""There's still Maurice,"" I said, feeling down. My father scoffed. We both knew Maurice disliked the business. ""Anyway,"" I added, ""you could always use me as a consultant."" My mother had passed away when I was young, and my father raised me and Maurice. Maurice was two years younger, and since he was motherless, I took care of him. It wasn't hard; I loved him. Because the business was successful, we lived comfortably - in a big house in London, attended nice schools, wore good clothes, and enjoyed parties, theaters, and operas. My father knew many interesting people - politicians, actors, and businesspeople - and our home was lively with great conversations.

""I have an idea,"" my father continued. ""You can help us during holidays until you leave Oxford, and then if you decide to leave us, you can. It will give you some pocket money and really help me."" ""Okay,"" I said, relieved to avoid making immediate choices and especially the sadness my father would feel if I disagreed. This was how he controlled us. So, it happened. In my last term at school and during university breaks, I helped out, never more than twice a year, and always with the easier tasks. I became one of the top students, with a small house, a nice car, designer clothes, and a black dress from Paris that I planned to wear for my final exams.

In my last term, my father visited me and took me to a village for a meal and a chat. There were only a few weeks left. My tutor predicted I would get a First Class degree in Law, and I knew that if I focused and organized my thoughts, he might be right. I felt ready, confident, and focused. But then my father told me that in about a week, he needed me to do one last important task for the family business, the biggest one they had ever attempted, and he promised it would be worth my while. ""But Dad,"" I protested, ""I have my final exams coming up, and I need to focus on that. It's really important that I do well, and I don't want to think about anything else right now."" I could tell that my father couldn't understand this pressure (or maybe he was jealous of my life away from him), and he would see my refusal as a betrayal in his time of need. 

As he explained the task, I saw more clearly than ever his determination - the clarity and resourcefulness with which he approached his work, his energy, and his self-control. In his way, he was a kind of genius, and I respected that in him. It made my own plans seem less significant. ""All right,"" I said. ""I'll do it."""
CPE_56,"Simon Costello realized that buying the house in Pembroke Square was a mistake within a year of moving in with Lois. Owning a home that requires strict budgeting is often not worth it. At first, it seemed like a good decision. He had been winning cases regularly, and Lois had returned to her job at the advertising agency shortly after their twins were born, receiving a salary increase to thirty-five thousand. Lois strongly wanted to move, and Simon did not resist her arguments, which seemed reasonable at the time: their flat was too small for a family, and they needed more space, a garden, and a separate area for an au pair. They could have found these in a less trendy part of London, but Lois wanted more than just extra room. Mornington Mansions was not a suitable address for a rising barrister and a successful businesswoman. She felt that even saying the name of their old flat lowered her social status.

Lois decided that one of them should save money by using public transport, and it was clear that Simon would be the one to do so since her office was far away. The crowded tube rides became a frustrating thirty minutes of thinking about what was wrong in his life. He often remembered his grandfather's house in Hampstead, where he had spent time as a child, enjoying the smell of dinner and his grandmother's care for her husband after a long day at work. She had been a supportive lawyer's wife, active in legal causes and content with her role. But that world was gone. Lois had made it clear before they married that her career was just as important as his. This was a modern marriage, and their lifestyle depended on both of their incomes.

Now, their hard work could be ruined by Venetia, who had come to their office in a bad mood. Something had upset her, and she confronted Simon with intense anger. He regretted not leaving his room earlier; if he had, the confrontation might not have happened, and she could have had time to think. He remembered her accusations clearly. She had defended a man named Brian Cartwright, who claimed that Simon had known about jury bribery four years ago but did nothing. Simon denied it, but his response felt unconvincing, as if he were guilty. The shame he felt reminded him of being punished in school. When he looked into Venetia's eyes, he saw her disbelief.

He wished he had said, ""Cartwright told me after the trial, but I didn't believe him then, and I don't believe him now."" Instead, he had told a more dangerous lie, and she recognized it. He wondered why she was so angry and if she had the right to judge him. Was her own behavior always perfect in court? Did she have the right to threaten his career? He was uncertain about what she could do, but if rumors spread, it could ruin him."
CPE_36,"I chose this place to live because I thought I would be anonymous among people who didn’t mind if their rented homes were falling apart or if their gardens were messy. I was wrong. The shopkeepers, who are living their real lives, soon start to recognize me. The beautiful roses from next door remind me that gardens were once cared for. Usually, I stay inside, trying to ignore the summer outside, but tonight I am watching the swifts flying between the trees and roofs. I have trimmed the rosemary and lemon balm to make space for a chair, and my arms are stinging from scratches. It is a small London garden where plants must grow tall or spread out to survive.

“Been doing some clearing, I see,” says my upstairs neighbor, Jaz, leaning out of her window. She is a writer with several unpublished works, and I sometimes have to pretend to know about them as an English teacher. I have her latest manuscript with me now. “How’s the work going, Jaz?” I ask. “For goodness sake! In no other job do you have to explain yourself so many times a day,” she replies, then pauses before continuing, “I have something to drink in the fridge. I’ll bring it down.” I don’t want Jaz in the garden, and I realize it looks messy and sad. The only way to access the garden is through my flat, and Jaz is knocking on my door.

“So, you’re on holiday now, you lucky person,” she says, lounging in shorts and a tank top while I drop a cushion onto what used to be a small lawn. “Cheers,” she says, acting young. “I should have become a teacher—writers don’t get holidays. But you know what they say, those who can, do; those who can’t, teach.” And then there are those who can do neither. “So, what are your plans for the holidays?” All my worries about the end of the school year come rushing back. Empty days. Hot sidewalks covered in melting gum. The walk to the shops and back. The little park with its fountain, and loneliness sitting beside me on the bench.

“Actually, I’m going to Stonebridge tomorrow. I wanted to ask if you could feed the cats.” My heart races as I say this. “Of course I will,” Jaz replies, knowing she will be around. “Where will you stay? Some fancy bed and breakfast?” “No, I’ll be staying with my oldest friend, Ruby, at the Rising Sun. We’ve known each other since we were eight.” This isn’t true, but I often deal with fiction. “Going back to your roots. What do you think of my work so far?” My silence makes Jaz ask about her manuscript, The Cruelty of Red Vans, which is only half-read on my desk. I like the title and tell her so. I can see how red vans could be cruel, always bringing gifts to other houses and delivering rejected manuscripts to hers.

Something makes me speak honestly for once. “Let me give you a little tip,” I say. “What?” she asks, looking offended. “Try writing about nice people for a change, people who want to be good: a little less self-centeredness, a bit more fiction…” “Teachers!” Jaz responds like a rebellious student about to take back a poorly graded paper. “I keep a journal, where I write something good about each day, no matter how small.” My words sound as old-fashioned as my dress. “Keep a journal! Nice people! Get a life, Ann.” Oh, I have a life. I have my work, and I go out sometimes, reading on the tube. When we finally go inside, my calm kitchen gives me a moment of comfort, but suddenly I remember my school geography teacher, Miss Tarrantine, who was about my age now, winking at us and saying, “I’ve had my moments.” We nearly died laughing."
CPE_6,"**Heritage**

Heritage is important because it connects people and communities to their past. We often feel connected to our personal heritage, knowing about our grandparents and hearing stories about their lives. However, there is also a broader need to understand our history to help us shape our future. Heritage gives us a sense of continuity; knowing about the past helps us feel secure about what lies ahead. Just as we inherit our genes, we also inherit a culture passed down through generations. While there may be aspects of our national heritage that we do not agree with, it is still a part of us, and it is comforting to belong to something larger. Heritage teaches us valuable lessons and is essential for our well-being, influencing everything from traditions to material culture. In the past, we learned about our heritage through stories and legends from our ancestors. However, modern society has disrupted many of these oral traditions. Now, we often rely on historical places and architecture to understand our past. It is crucial to preserve these connections as a tribute to our ancestors' identities.

**The Fens**

Some time ago, I started writing a novel called *Waterland*, where the landscape of a region in England known as the Fens became significant. People often ask why I, a Londoner with no personal ties to the area, chose to write about it. The simple answer is that I found the Fens to be an unobtrusive setting for my story. However, I soon realized that the Fens are not flat or empty; they are rich and strangely beautiful. It is surprising that in the heart of England, there is a place that many English people find unfamiliar, especially since many other unique areas have become part of the national culture. The Fens are both empty and full, cultivated yet wild, seemingly simple but deeply mysterious. My research while writing was not extensive; I have not visited places like Wisbech or Prickwillow. As a fiction writer, I prefer to create imagined worlds rather than seek strict evidence. Yet, trying to envision the Fens has its own logic, as they are not just a landscape but also a state of mind.

**Museums**

Museums need to make their collections easy to access. In the past, this meant simply putting items in display cases with long descriptions that were hard for the average person to understand. Today, accessibility should involve more than that. Displays can be engaging and use creative techniques to attract visitors and evoke emotions. However, museums should offer more than just displays; they should reach out to the widest community possible. For example, some museums provide loan boxes of objects for teachers, and recently, similar materials have been made available to help elderly people with memory loss. Museums focus on real artefacts and specimens, not replicas. They exist to provide authentic experiences, showcasing items that have historical significance. This authenticity is what sets them apart from heritage centers, theme parks, books, and digital media. Museums that embrace this challenge and create exciting, accessible displays and outreach programs will find that their competitors in ""virtual history"" can actually help spark interest in the real experiences that only museums can provide.

**Architecture and Environment**

The desire to preserve our surroundings is not new, but the rapid changes in our towns affect us all. This can lead some people to become passionate preservationists while encouraging others to think more deeply about the nature of our towns and their future. It can be argued that those who have lived through significant events, like world wars, are more inclined to value preservation than previous generations, as anything that represents stability becomes important. If there is a psychological need for preservation, planners must consider it. Change is not necessarily bad if we learn to manage it. Physical changes in our towns reflect social changes, including shifts in population, welfare, and demands."
CPE_33,"**Text: Einstein**

If you stop someone on the street and ask them to name a scientist, they will likely say Albert Einstein. His image is often used to promote products that suggest intelligence, like computers and encyclopedias. Most people know little about his work, except that he created complex theories called 'relativity', which are known for being hard to understand and for making strange predictions that seem to go against common sense. 

Einstein was part of a major change in scientific thought, a revolution that marked the beginning of modern science in the twentieth century. Physicists and mathematicians were trying to develop a new, clearer understanding of the universe by examining the connections between matter and natural forces. Einstein made significant contributions by rethinking the basics: time, space, matter, and energy. Earlier explanations were based on Isaac Newton's idea of a universe where stars and planets moved in a fixed space and time. Einstein challenged this idea, claiming that time and space are not fixed but relative.

**Young Readers**

As children, Lydia and I often avoided prize-winning books because we thought they would be boring. Our mother disapproved of our attitude, while our father would give us small coins as rewards to encourage us to read better books. He sometimes included a few good books in our Christmas and birthday gifts, clearly marked as 'This Book is NOT Literature'. Although we often dismissed his choices as 'boys' books', he did introduce us to some shorter works of good fiction and, once, to a famous collection of poetry.

**Language**

Jacob Grimm wrote in 1851 that the origin of human language is a secret and wonderful thing. This mystery has led to many strange ideas. For example, Charles Caller suggested in 1928 that early humans made sounds like ""meuh"" when they sensed danger. This sound is sad. The early human who traveled through dangerous lands made desperate noises, and some words have kept a trace of this, like 'malaria', which means ""fever"", and the Latin word 'mors', which means ""death"". 

Many people avoided discussing the origin of language, thinking it was a topic for odd theories. However, recently, the study of how language began and evolved has become very important. Language likely started in East Africa about 100,000 years ago. Initially, speech was mainly used for friendly communication and was a key tool in struggles for power. Sharing information was probably not the main purpose of language, which goes against the ideas of philosopher John Locke, who described language as a major way to share knowledge."
CPE_20,"**Text: Writing Reviews**

Frank Kermode discusses the art of writing reviews from the perspective of someone who practices it. Most reviews are created and shared in ways that limit their lifespan. They often have strict deadlines and length restrictions, and once published, they are only relevant for a short time—usually a day, a week, or at most a month. The temporary nature of reviews often affects how they are viewed. Many people, including writers, believe that reviewing is a task done out of necessity, often due to financial reasons, or because writers cannot spend all their time on a novel or serious book.

However, writing reviews is a skilled and complex task. Writing a concise review of six to eight hundred words for a newspaper is different from crafting a detailed review of six to eight thousand words for an international journal. The length of the review is not the only factor to consider. Reviewers must think about their audience, which can range from casual readers to those deeply interested in the subject.

A good reviewer needs to have knowledge about various topics and must write in a way that is clear and enjoyable for intelligent readers. It is common for reviewers to also write other types of work. For example, American novelist John Updike, who is not particularly fond of criticism, still writes reviews between his novel projects. He collects all his reviews, no matter how short, into books with modest titles.

Some might think that less prominent writers should accept the temporary nature of their reviews, but it is understandable if they wish to have a lasting record of their work, especially if they feel that some of their best writing is found in reviews. I share this sentiment about my own writing. My main work has been academic, and my serious books are typically academic in nature, which is what professors are expected to produce.

In the English-speaking world, there is no strict separation between reviewing and literary study, unlike in some other cultures. It is common for the same individuals to engage in both activities. The past stigma against professors who write reviews has diminished, and complaints from non-professors about professors taking opportunities away from them are less frequent. This is partly because there are more reviewing opportunities available now, allowing many people to participate.

I believe this situation benefits both readers and professors. Readers can trust that reviewers have some expertise, and for professors, reviewing helps maintain their sanity. It also serves as a reminder that they should communicate clearly with non-professors. While they may feel the need to use complex language among themselves, they must ensure they are understood by a broader audience.

Ultimately, despite its value, reviewing is often a secondary activity. It is something that can only be done well if one is also engaged in another primary pursuit."
CPE_40,"Ralph unlocked the door to his apartment and, as he stepped into the dark, still hallway, he felt a brief sense of ownership that still surprised him after three years of living there. When he first bought the flat, he would come home excited and curious, wondering what had happened while he was away. The flat felt like a welcoming place, a space where he could focus without distractions. He thought he should worry about things like intruders or broken pipes, but his flat always seemed to be waiting for him, either looking independent or neglected, depending on how tidy he had left it. Over time, he began to see it as an extension of himself, a place where his thoughts and feelings spilled out. He grew frustrated with its inability to change.

There were always a few letters piled up by the door and the answering machine sometimes blinked with messages when he returned. He was thankful that his windows were intact and that nothing had been stolen, though he often wondered what the flat would look like if something bad happened. From his dull office on the third floor, Ralph looked forward to his quiet evenings at home. After leaving the busy office and riding the bus home, he no longer wanted to be alone, even though he often thought he did. At his desk, he craved solitude and time to himself, but once he escaped, he felt empty and lost, questioning who he really was.

He would read or listen to music as the night went on, but he began to wonder for whom he was doing these things. His sense of direction in life had faded, and his thoughts would come and go without making sense. He remembered a time when he felt more in control, when he believed he could change his life. But in his eagerness to find something better, he had followed the first opportunity that came his way, thinking it was meant to be. After university, he tried to plan for a better future, but he was not surprised to find that he only wanted to get by.

He applied for jobs he heard about from friends, following them as they rushed toward their goals, unable to see how he could find happiness in his work. He went to one job interview, grateful for the chance, but he didn’t think to evaluate the job itself—a vague editorial position at a local free newspaper. After a pleasant conversation with Neil, his future boss, he was offered the job on the spot, and he took it as a compliment, not realizing it would lead to many more long days at work."
CPE_45,"**Goat Racing**

I was about to see goat racing on Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. I pushed my way through ice-cream vans, large crowds, food stalls, and loud music. Although everyone was moving towards the racecourse, I tried to find a good spot to watch. An area was blocked off to create a course for the goats. It wasn’t as fancy as regular racecourses, but the idea was similar: spectators lined both sides of a stretch of ground where the goats would run. Keeping a few selected goats in line was challenging, especially since goats are known for eating almost anything they find.

**Canoe Trip**

As the day ended, I began to worry about the night ahead. The canoe was too wet to sleep in, there were no places to stop, and we hadn’t seen any villages or huts since early morning. In the dim moonlight, we could barely see the cliffs. Our torch batteries were dying, so we replaced them, but the new ones didn’t work. Clearly, we wouldn’t find a camping spot. A few miles later, Lesley shouted that she saw a distant flickering light, and we felt hopeful. However, the light was just moonlight reflecting on the waves. Soon, we heard the loud sound of rushing water, but we couldn’t see what was happening. Time seemed to stop as we continued on.

**How to Be Presentation Perfect**

I am not naturally good at making presentations, but as managing director, I often need to present to my colleagues and major shareholders. How can I improve my presentation skills and confidence? You are not alone. Presenting requires different skills than running a company, yet many senior executives are expected to be good at it. To convince your audience, you must first believe in what you are saying. Show your belief through the passion and enthusiasm you bring to your presentation. This means you need to prepare well. Test your ideas beforehand and ask colleagues to help identify tough questions your audience might ask. You should also create a positive atmosphere from the start. Begin with something everyone can relate to and gradually lead to your main point."
CPE_64,"Text: ""Some activities cannot be rushed; they require their own time. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you rush making mayonnaise by adding oil too quickly, it will spoil. If you pull on a tangled fishing line in frustration, the knot will only get tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some functions happen very quickly, while others take seconds, minutes, hours, days, or even years. We can speed up some tasks, like solving crossword puzzles or doing math, but others cannot be rushed. If we try to hurry them, they may fail, just like the mayonnaise or the fishing line.

The idea of 'Think fast; we need results' can be as unhelpful as trying to shorten a night's sleep. We learn, think, and understand in various ways, and these mental processes work at different speeds, each suited for different tasks. There are sayings like 'He who hesitates is lost' and 'Look before you leap,' and both have truth in them.

Generally, the mind has three processing speeds. The first is faster than thought. Some situations require an immediate, instinctive reaction. For example, when my motorbike skidded on a wet road, my body reacted quickly to keep me safe, and only later did my conscious mind catch up. A concert pianist or an Olympic fencer also must react without thinking. This quick response can be called our 'wits.'

The second speed involves actual thinking, where we analyze situations, weigh options, and solve problems. A mechanic figuring out why an engine won’t start, a scientist interpreting results, or a student working on an assignment all use this logical thinking, often referred to as 'intellect.' People who excel in this area are considered 'bright' or 'clever.'

The third speed is slower and less direct. It is more relaxed and contemplative. In this state, we may daydream or reflect. For instance, sitting on a beach, listening to the waves, or drifting between sleep and wakefulness puts us in a different mental space than when we are planning a meal or writing a letter. This slower way of thinking is just as valuable as the faster types. Allowing our minds to wander is essential, especially when life gets busy. We need both the 'tortoise mind' and the 'hare brain.' 

Some everyday problems are better solved with a slow mind. Certain mysteries can only be understood with a relaxed attitude. Recent studies show that patient, less deliberate thinking is especially good for complex or unclear situations. Deliberate thinking works well for straightforward problems. For example, deciding where to go on holiday may have clear options. But when the situation is complicated or unclear, we need to use the tortoise mind. 

If we are trying to manage a difficult group at work or considering a career change, it may be wiser to take time to think rather than rush for answers. This slower type of intelligence is linked to creativity and wisdom. Poets have long recognized the limits of fast, deliberate thinking and have sought to embrace these slower, more intuitive ways of knowing. Philosophers have discussed the deeper areas of the mind beyond conscious thought. Recently, scientists have begun to study these slower, less direct ways of knowing. The field of cognitive science is showing that the unconscious mind can effectively handle many complex tasks if given enough time. It can recognize subtle patterns, make sense of complicated situations, and address difficult issues more successfully than quick, conscious thought."""
CPE_29,"**Text: Surviving in a Foreign Land**

I have been welcomed warmly. This place is a friendly and well-equipped base camp in a very isolated area. At any time, there are about forty people here—scientists, students, weather experts, and satellite trackers—forming a close community where everyone helps each other. My basic French is just enough to communicate, but not enough for casual conversation. I miss the subtle meanings, and my phrasebook is not helpful at breakfast. While this is not a practical problem, I initially struggled with self-confidence. I found myself a bit anxious about mealtimes. I would hesitate, unsure of which table to choose, and I felt nervous when I spoke, recalling the anxiety I felt in my early school days. I still smile awkwardly or feel panicked when people talk to me. I think this occasional sadness comes not from missing company or communication, but from losing the social confidence that my ability to speak well has always given me.

**Elliot**

When I first met Elliot, I was just a young author, and he did not pay much attention to me. However, he always remembered faces. When I saw him occasionally, he would greet me politely but showed no interest in getting to know me better. If I saw him at the opera with someone important, he would often ignore me. But then I had a surprising success as a playwright, and I noticed that Elliot started to look at me more warmly. One day, he sent me a note inviting me to lunch, and I thought he was testing me. After that, as my success brought me many new friends, I began to see him more often.

**Alfred Hitchcock**

The film director Alfred Hitchcock always claimed that he did not care about the story of his films or the acting, but he did care about the visuals and the sound. For Hitchcock, it was not a message or a great performance that moved the audience; he believed that people respond to the pure experience of film, regardless of their cultural background. Therefore, if a film is made well in terms of its emotional effect, the audience in Japan should react the same way as the audience in India. Hitchcock was always precise and rational in his self-assessment. He was a man of reason and a brilliant craftsman who enjoyed hearing the audience scream. He did not focus on speculation or deep intellectual ideas, and his view of his characters was straightforward. He concentrated on film itself and the clear, measurable beauty of what film can do to an audience."
CPE_57,"**Text: Amateur Astronomy**

Astronomy has changed a lot in the last fifty years. About thirty years ago, there were not many charts or catalogues available. Telescopes were limited, and there were few practical astronomy books. Today, there are many types of telescopes and equipment available for everyone. Electronic calculators and computers have improved the production of almanacs and charts, making it easier to analyze observations and publish results. This could be seen as the golden age of amateur astronomy. However, some things have been lost. Now, you may need to travel 80 km to find a dark sky, which was easier to find in cities fifty years ago. Daytime skies are often filled with airplane trails that can last for hours and create clouds, making it hard to observe the sun and stars at night.

**Too Much Choice**

People today face too many choices. There are too many activities, options, and opportunities. In our modern economy, the desire for new products and services has become an addiction, and technology speeds up this change. New products appear quickly, and before you know it, another one is coming. This can be overwhelming and tiring, leading to a feeling of disconnection from life. While choice is important in today’s economy, having too many choices can cause stress, take up time, and create complexity. As a result, many people are looking for ""simplexity""—the simple things that bring meaning to life in a complicated world. However, simplifying life is challenging in a time of excess. There are more brands of detergent and breakfast cereals than we need, and too many software updates and plans to keep track of.

**McAndrews Hotel**

Every summer, my family spends two weeks at McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. This tradition started with my grandmother and has become very important to us. Nothing can disrupt this ritual. We are a specific type of guest at McAndrews: perhaps old-fashioned or even snobbish. I dislike the rudeness of shop assistants, which some people see as equality. I also dislike overly friendly waiters who seem to want to treat customers like friends. I know the names of many other guests, as they have been coming here since childhood like me. However, I appreciate that when I see them in the hotel, we only exchange polite greetings, respecting each other's privacy. This kind of respect is rare in hotels today."

**Othello**  
A remarkable production of Shakespeare's play *Othello* has moved from Stratford to London. This gives me a chance to correct an unfair review I wrote when the show first opened last spring. At that time, I said that Ray Fearon was too young for the title role and I criticized his acting. I still believe that changing the age difference between Othello and Desdemona alters the tragedy, but I take back my negative comments about Mr. Fearon's outstanding performance. The entire cast is excellent. Memorable scenes include the one where Cassio's competitive games with other young officers become dangerous, and the moment when Iago starts to lose control and struggles to regain it. I challenge anyone not to be moved to tears during the scene where Emilia helps Desdemona prepare for bed. The pace and tension throughout the play are fantastic. Do not miss this production.

**Lake Vostok**  
In the center of Antarctica, there is complete stillness. On the edges of the continent, there are many penguins, seals, and birds. However, in the vast white interior, life does not exist. Except for a large hidden body of freshwater called Lake Vostok, which lies beneath nearly 4 kilometers of ice, directly under the coldest place on Earth. The water has been cut off from air and sunlight for up to 25 million years. Biologists are eager to explore its mysterious depths and find out what strange organisms might be there. Geologists and glaciologists are also very interested. For two years, researchers around the world have been planning ways to uncover the lake's secrets, and if they succeed, we will soon see a new era of exploration for Lake Vostok.

**Scientists**  
Last week, I heard something interesting on the radio. A group of scientists is debating what motivates them to be scientists; the phrase ""because it's there"" comes to mind. We all know it is the long-standing quest for knowledge, the wish to understand everything from atoms to black holes. But these scientists want to know why we have this desire for knowledge and why science cannot explain this motivation. I believe it is more important to focus on whether what we scientists are doing is right, rather than getting caught up in discussions about the purpose of it all. The key issue is not why we pursue science, but to understand that science is a tool, and we should decide how, where, when, and why to use it."

**Food**  
Our relationship with food is very basic and fulfilling. Many people who enjoy cooking buy cookbooks like this one. However, we often think that cooking is only worth it for special occasions or complicated dishes. This is not true. For example, if you chop some carrots, a leek, celery, and herbs and put them in water, you can make a delicious soup. This is much more satisfying than buying a pre-made soup. Instead of purchasing a sweet chocolate mousse filled with preservatives, you can quickly make a tasty dessert that both adults and children will enjoy. Cooking is also a way to show care and love by sharing your own creations, no matter how simple. Sharing food symbolizes our basic human needs, which is why we celebrate important events like birthdays and anniversaries around the table. No one would choose to have takeout for a wedding or anniversary party, nor would anyone want to discuss a business deal over canned soup.

**In the Elevator**  
This morning, Alistair tried to tidy up his office, but papers were still everywhere. Tax forms were overflowing from drawers and boxes, waiting for a day when he felt like organizing them. He also had a lot of paperwork from owning an apartment building. Many books and years of journals were close to new bookshelves. As the elevator took him to his floor, he knew Mallory would arrive on time for their meeting. She would knock on his office door exactly on the hour. She was very strict about time and neatness. How would she react to the mess? She might think someone had broken in. He could walk in behind her and pretend to be shocked. Mrs. Wilson, his cleaning lady, had come while he was trying to clear some space on the floor. When he peeked out of his office as she was unlocking his apartment, he smiled at her, hoping for a good response. But her expression was cold. She seemed to think there was no way she would go into his messy office, which was not her responsibility. He felt that Mrs. Wilson saw him as someone from a different world, far away from her own life in Brooklyn.

**KAREN**  
Karen had a simple wish: not to be like her mother. This desire led her to create her own story, one of difference and strength. In her story, there were important moments, like when she was twelve and her brother accidentally hit her in the eye with a golf club. At first, she thought she would go blind, but the bone protected her, as the doctor later confirmed. The club had missed her eye, and she only needed a few stitches that healed over time. When she opened her eyes in the doctor's office and saw her mother there, complaining about both miracles and small mercies, she realized she was saved for a reason.

**Miss Fogerty**  
Miss Fogerty was both excited and sad as she walked briskly across the wet grass of the village green. It was thrilling to be the first to know something important in a small community, where her life was usually quiet. However, she felt deep sadness for Dr. Bailey's health. He had been her doctor for many years, and she appreciated his care during her frequent laryngitis episodes, which were her only health issues. Miss Fogerty valued his ability to make patients feel like there was always enough time to talk about their worries. This quality made him very loved in the village. He was always willing to share his time, knowledge, and humor, and in return, he received great loyalty and affection from the community."
CPE_59,"**Joanna's Lessons**

Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist. So, why has she decided to write books for young children learning the piano? Even someone who cannot hear music well would be moved by her performances. Watching her play the piano, especially when she tackles difficult modern pieces, shows how far she can push her abilities. However, during a recent concert for children, one small boy was not impressed. After watching her play various styles of music, he asked, ""Can you play Match of the Day?"" This request surprised many experienced musicians, but for Joanna, it was amusing. She realized that until she played that tune, the boy did not see her as a real pianist. Of course, she played it and likely remembered this moment for her next children's concert.

Joanna is unique among top concert pianists because she cares about how young children learn to play. She has just published a beginner's piano book for kids called *Joanna MacGregor's Piano World*, despite her busy schedule. This summer, she is performing at many festivals and collaborating with young composers and artists. She also runs her own recording label, Sound Circus, and often suggests new projects to artists she meets. So, why take on the extra work of writing a book? ""People are surprised,"" she says. ""But I believe the first lessons are very important. The music world often focuses on talented children, but most people enjoy music in a more everyday way. I find that much more interesting!""

In writing her first three books, Joanna draws from her own experiences. From ages 18 to 25, before she became a concert pianist, she taught many beginners. Growing up, her mother taught piano, and many children came to their home to learn. ""I was not part of a system that forced exceptional talent. I grew up believing that music should be available to everyone."" Just as everyone should learn to swim or speak a little French, she thinks everyone should try to learn the piano. Some children learn quickly, while others progress slowly and may give up. This can happen at any stage. Some find the beginning too hard, while others feel pressure to perform like talented children they see on TV.

""I worry that some people use music, like sports, to push their children to achieve, rather than just enjoying it. Children often quit because they feel they cannot meet their parents' expectations."" When asked if she thinks poorly of other piano teaching methods or books, she is careful not to criticize. She acknowledges that her colorful and engaging books are not the only ones available to help beginners enjoy learning. To attract young learners, she includes stories in her books and CDs. The challenge is to make learning fun. From the first lesson, there are musical accompaniments for teachers or parents to play along with the child. For those whose parents do not play piano, the accompaniments are available on the CDs.

Learning should be enjoyable, Joanna insists. ""Children should be allowed to improvise and explore the piano freely."" As they progress, they need encouragement to read music instead of just playing by ear. Joanna understands this struggle because she relied on her ear as a child. However, she believes that practice is the most important factor in learning. How can children be motivated to play a piece repeatedly? She admits that she did not practice seriously until she attended the Royal Academy of Music, where she began to build a challenging repertoire that required dedication. Now, she loves practicing. She spends about eight hours a day on it, which she considers essential to her musical life, even more than performing.

""I have great sympathy for those who find practice difficult. People do not talk about this enough,"" she says. The key, whether practicing for twenty minutes or five hours, is to have a clear goal. Other tips include rewarding yourself by playing through a piece, even with mistakes, and mixing difficult pieces with easier ones."
CPE_54,"**Text: Writing by Hand and on Screen**

Dr. Johnson believed that ""what is written without effort is usually read without pleasure."" This means that good writing often requires hard work. When I look back at my handwritten school essays, I notice they had very few corrections. Today, I would rewrite them many times. I think this is because writing by hand was physically challenging. The slow pace of writing helped me think carefully. In contrast, typing on a computer can lead to careless mistakes. Many writers find that the time spent fixing early drafts on a computer is about the same as the time spent on handwritten work. 

Also, emails, unlike handwritten letters, often lack emotional depth. While many love letters are now sent via email, they can feel less personal. At least these emails are written in some form of English and grammar. However, words on a screen can feel dull. Writers may not fully understand the impact of their words and often exaggerate their meanings. Words typed quickly can lack the care and personality of handwritten notes.

**The CD**

I put down my cup and looked at the CD. The case was not impressive, but the shiny disc inside caught my attention. ""Wonderful little things, aren't they?"" Mr. Warriston said as he entered the room. I agreed and handed him the disc carefully. ""It's amazing they can fit seventy minutes of music on these,"" he said, turning on the hi-fi. Lights lit up, and he opened a small drawer to place the disc inside. He pressed a button, and the drawer closed. ""Some people say they sound sterile, but I think they..."" 

""Do you have to turn them over, like records?"" I asked. 

""What? No,"" Mr. Warriston replied, surprised. ""You only play one side."" 

""Why?"" I asked. He looked puzzled and then thoughtful. ""You know, I have no idea. I don't see why both sides couldn't be playable to double the capacity..."" He stared at the machine. ""You could use two lasers or just turn it over by hand... hmm."" He smiled at me. ""Yes, good point."" He gestured to my wooden chair. ""Anyway, come on, let's get you sitting in the best spot for the stereo effect, okay?"" I smiled, happy to have asked a technical question that Mr. Warriston couldn't answer.

**Books vs. Electronic Text**

Malcolm Bradbury made a good point when he said that if matches had been invented after cigarette lighters, we would have admired the improvement. Many people claim that electronic text is as significant as the invention of printing and that it is almost complete. However, they overlook the fact that changes in how we think take generations. This thinking is often egocentric, believing that our generation is at a crucial moment in history. 

For example, a book from 1979 predicted that by the 1980s, traditional books would slowly fade away. So far, this has not happened. Reading long texts on a screen is often frustrating, and many people avoid it. Additionally, the way information is organized on computers encourages people to skim rather than read deeply. Some advocates of technology argue that this leads to new forms of storytelling. However, the idea of ""non-linearity"" is not new; many books, like religious texts and poetry collections, have never been read from start to finish. What is different now is that computers do not encourage the deep thinking that comes from reading a complete text.

**The Office**

Charles walked into the office and saw a perfectly organized space. The carpet was clear of papers, and the dark wooden desk looked just as it did at the Sotheby's auction five weeks ago. Neat file holders were being placed in their drawers, and twelve years' worth of trade journals filled one wall. Kathleen struggled to close the filing cabinet and then turned to him. ""You have to use computers, Charles. This is too much."" 

""Hello, Kathleen. This is amazing,"" he said, admiring the antique furniture. He was not thinking about computers or any mechanical devices, not even a pencil sharpener. ""Simply amazing,"" he repeated, avoiding the topic of computers. Over the two years he had known her, they had discussed this many times. She could never understand why he resisted technology, especially since he was skilled with computers and had even published an important paper on computer-related topics. She had inspired that paper. Through her keyboard skills, she could transform any software into something new and exciting."
CPE_32,"Text: ""You don’t take sugar, do you?"" shouted his secretary, not really asking but stating a fact, as she had been making Lancelot coffee for many months. She often forgot small details because he wasn’t usually supposed to be there. However, he had started coming in all the time, realizing that staying away only led to more problems. He thought about how he had gone from being a respected advisor, meeting authors and playwrights over lunch, to a stressed worker trying to avoid disasters, struggling to find parking in the mornings.

""This came,"" she yelled, waving a manila folder before placing it in front of him. ""From that guy in Los Angeles. You wanted to see it."" A label read: ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert,"" with ""An Expanded Synopsis"" underneath. Lancelot didn’t want to see the word ""synopsis."" He preferred to see ""A First Draft."" He had already seen a synopsis of this book and didn’t want to see another one, even if it was revised. Ian Cuthbert had received a large advance for this book when Lancelot had bought the company. Ian was one of several friends Lancelot had mistakenly commissioned books from. Ian was a clear example that a person with a difficult temperament often becomes even harder to manage when given a chance.

Lancelot skipped the introduction he had read many times and looked at the synopsis. He recognized almost every phrase. He closed the folder and pushed it aside. Clearly, at this rate, Ian's manuscript would never arrive. The synopsis lacked the brilliance Ian was known for and had a tone that felt empty. Lancelot remembered stories of a famous author whose last book was published incomplete after his death, written chapter by chapter, with payments made one at a time. In that case, the payments were small amounts of an advance that had never been given. Ian's advance had been huge, breaking the usual rule that authors must deliver a manuscript before getting paid.

Lancelot, who had studied modern languages at Oxford, recalled when Ian Cuthbert was seen as a promising talent in Cambridge, a place full of potential. Ian's peers aimed to take over British theatre and succeeded quickly. But Ian seemed lazy compared to them. He wore his overcoat like a cape and spoke about a famous French writer as if he had been there. Yet, for some reason, Ian's creative talent remained hidden. While less talented people succeeded, Ian withdrew further. At the peak of his influence, he was already known to be hard to work with. He was officially appointed to edit a major arts magazine but failed to produce anything, wasting the budget for many issues. His renewed contract with a fashion magazine led to stories about his high pay, which was increased in hopes of getting him to produce more, then even more to get him to produce anything.

At editorial meetings, where photographers were always present to capture the moment, Ian would criticize others' ideas harshly. Ten years later, he could hardly be counted on to show up for his own funeral. Lancelot was close to admitting that ""A World History of the Short"" had been a mistake from the start."
CPE_65,"**Text: England's Breakfast Revolution**

Health experts agree that a good breakfast is very important. However, in history, breakfast is a relatively new concept in England. There are few mentions of breakfast in medieval literature. Some travelers did eat a meal at dawn before long journeys, and sick people sometimes had breakfast for health reasons, but most people did not eat breakfast unless they were kings or nobles.

In the sixteenth century, breakfast started to become common for everyone. Some writers believe this change happened because food became more available. However, they may not have considered other important social changes. For instance, new work patterns meant that more people had jobs with set hours, often starting very early in the morning. As a result, eating a meal in the morning became necessary and was no longer just for the wealthy."
CPE_61,"**Photography**  
When a photographer takes a picture, they choose visual information based on their technical skills, personal views, and experiences, along with social and cultural norms. In this book, we will explore how these factors influence the style, content, and expression of a photograph, as well as how viewers perceive and react to these images. For instance, a casual newspaper reader may have an implicit understanding of the photographs in the paper. However, instead of accepting the photograph as it is, we might ask whether it truly represents the scene as it appeared at the time. Alternatively, does it express the photographer's perspective? Is the exact moment captured particularly important, or should the photograph be seen as a symbol representing a situation in the world?

**More than a Game**  
For me, sport has always been more than just a game. The most successful athletes have strong self-belief. To succeed in sports, you need to focus completely. There is only one path to being the best, and you must set everything else aside. Sports can be harsh, and no one will do the work for you. It’s a matter of survival. Sports have taught me discipline and determination, but they also show the value of teamwork. My sport allows me to excel individually, yet it is still a team effort, and I must balance both aspects. This is similar to life – you can achieve as an individual, but you must remember the people around you. Sports have given me a lot, not just financially. They have opened doors for me and broadened my perspective, allowing me to see things around the world that many will never experience. However, you also have to sacrifice a lot for these rewards.

**Tuning In**  
Some experiences are so vivid that they create clear memories. For me, such a moment happened one night in California many years ago when I lay awake, listening to the beautiful song of a mockingbird from a hidden spot in a tall tree in my neighborhood. I don’t have insomnia; it was the bird’s amazing singing that kept me awake. As I listened to its complex melodies, I found myself in an unexpected artistic experience. To appreciate the bird's patterns, I drew on my knowledge of jazz and Indian classical music. The bird made me feel like I was enjoying an incredible live performance filled with stunning improvisation. I reacted with groans and cheers as one surprising musical variation followed another through the open window until I finally fell asleep."
CPE_52,"Text: 

""People have always had strong feelings about birds, whether it's love, fear, or admiration. But what does this reveal about us? Paul Evans explores this idea. 

In a greenhouse, a little brown wren is bumping against the glass. This bird is often seen as a sign or a message. Is it trying to tell me something from a world beyond my understanding, or is it just a bird trapped inside? Depending on how you look at it, both could be true. 

Wrens have been part of British culture for a long time. In medieval times, people believed that the direction a wren flew could predict their luck. Today, images of wrens can still be found in many British homes. Even if old beliefs have faded, the wren still holds a special place in our hearts. A place without wrens feels empty and sad. 

This connection to birds comes from a rich history of folklore that shows how people once understood the world around them. In the past, when people relied more on nature for survival, they developed a way to communicate the importance of other creatures. However, cultural changes can alter how we view these animals. 

Take the red kite, for example. In the early 1500s, visitors to London were amazed to see red kites swooping down to take bread from children. These birds were valued as helpful scavengers. But soon, they were seen as pests and nearly disappeared from most areas, except Wales. Over time, red kites became symbols of conservation and were reintroduced to help them thrive again. 

Our bond with birds goes back to our early human history. The first birdwatchers likely paid close attention to birds because they signaled danger, bad weather, or food sources. Birds also connected them to their dreams. When we wonder why birds matter to us, we are also exploring what it means to be human. The ideas of flight, song, and freedom reflect our own identity in relation to nature. 

Some may think these feelings are outdated, remnants of our past. But like our appendix or wisdom teeth, they are still part of us, and losing them would be difficult. This is likely why birds have become symbols of environmental change, serving as indicators of ecological health. In Britain, conservationists highlight the endangerment of 30 bird species, which is troubling not only for the loss of these birds but also for the cultural impact. 

Birds carry significant cultural meaning. For instance, the skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing represent different kinds of love and magic. Readers of poets like Shelley, Shakespeare, and Robert Graves feel a sense of loss for these once-common birds. However, the disappearance of other birds that are not part of literature or folklore often goes unnoticed. 

Folklore is crucial. The stories and legends that endure over time create a deeper connection to their subjects than scientific terms do. This connection evokes feelings and attitudes that are often hidden beneath the complexities of modern life. Whether we watch wildlife documentaries or observe birds in our gardens, the joy we find in these experiences cannot be fully explained by science. Birds engage us in ways that are difficult to express, and the stories we share about them help us understand their significance. 

The wren in the greenhouse connects the present with a rich history, holding onto its song and moving into the future—a mystery that keeps me intrigued."""
CPE_28,"**Maps**

The main purpose of a map is to visually show the relationships between different points and features on the Earth's surface. These relationships are based on distance and direction. In ancient times, distance was often described in terms of time, such as ""a few hours' walk"" or ""a day's journey by river."" These descriptions were more about how easy it was to travel through the local area than about the actual distance. Direction was also important, but for most travelers, the key questions were ""Where do I go from here?"" and ""How far is it?"" Therefore, precise direction was not always crucial. For a long time, written directions were just as important as maps. Even today, some maps, like those showing train routes, do not always represent true directions. 

In the past, important landmarks along a route were marked by signs, which could be realistic or symbolic, and their size indicated their significance. The way maps were made varied based on their purpose and location, so understanding the specific style used in early maps is essential. The history of map-making, or cartography, is mainly about improving the accuracy of distance and direction and expanding the information included on maps. 

To achieve this, cartography has incorporated knowledge from other sciences. For instance, instead of finding direction by looking at shadows or stars, people began using the magnetic compass and developed tools to measure angles accurately. The understanding of astronomy and exploration helped map the known world. Astronomers later discovered that the Earth is not a perfect sphere but slightly flattened at the poles, which led to further improvements in mapping large areas.

Over time, the needs of map users changed. Travelers and merchants were no longer the only ones using maps. Soldiers, especially after the invention of artillery, needed accurate maps to understand the terrain for military purposes. This led to the creation of contour maps. Other professionals, like archaeologists, historians, and modern geographers, also had specific mapping needs. To meet these demands, today’s cartographers have developed methods to map various distributions, such as geological layers, climate zones, and land use.

The growing recognition of maps' value in many scientific fields has sparked a modern revival in cartography. However, it is important to note that the development of mapping has not always been smooth or straightforward. There have been times of decline or stagnation, interrupted by periods of rapid progress, where old ideas coexisted with new ones. Cartographers have often understood the theory behind advancements but had to wait for better tools to implement their ideas. Since copying old maps is the easiest way to create new ones, and because map publishers have sometimes resisted change, maps should not be taken at face value as evidence of current knowledge and techniques.

The many thousands of maps we have today are the result of significant human effort and thought. They serve as a valuable record for those studying human history. This aspect makes the study of historical cartography both fascinating and educational."

**Tim Rice** 

I was taken into a young man's living room, which was a calm and cultured space surrounded by a messy collection of rooms where the less ambitious family members lived. Moving from the kitchen to his room felt like going from economy to business class. This room had the largest collection of records I had ever seen, the first stereo record player and tuner I had encountered, and surprising evidence that a teenager had spent money on Georgian wine glasses, pictures, and furniture. His name was Andrew Lloyd Webber. He had received a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford, to study history, and he had nine months to fill before starting, during which he wanted to become England's version of the composer Richard Rodgers. My own dreams were just as unrealistic; I wanted to be a pop star for the usual reasons: women, money, and fame. The difference between Andrew and me was that my dreams were not life or death, although I could have felt that way if I had failed. So, when Andrew suggested a new crazy ambition for me—to become as famous a lyricist as Oscar Hammerstein—I was open to trying it. This was partly because, within ten minutes of meeting him, he played me three of his own tunes, and I could tell he was very talented. As he confidently played selections from the many shows he had written and produced at school, I was reminded of the best show albums from my parents' collection. He needed a new lyricist for the outside world. I didn’t have much to impress him with, except for my praise for his music and a seven-inch single of a song I had written (both words and music) that an unknown pop group had recorded three months earlier, which had not helped their failing career. We said goodbye, promising to meet again and write something together. I was still more interested in pop charts than in West End theatre, but on the bus back to my flat, I thought I had just met someone with rare talent and determination, and I would be foolish to miss the chance to work with someone who was clearly going to succeed in musical theatre soon. Even if we didn’t become top musical composers, we could try to compete with the Beatles and Rolling Stones later in the summer. The Everly Brothers had just made a comeback and would need new material. 

The next day, back at my desk in the office where I was training to be a lawyer, the excitement I had felt about a life in show business with Andrew Lloyd Webber had faded a bit. I would still look at small ads in Melody Maker for groups needing a vocalist and write a few more simple songs that wouldn’t show off my limited singing ability, but it was likely that I would finish my exams and become a respectable lawyer by the time I was twenty-five. By then, I would probably have outgrown pop music, as my father had confidently predicted I would by twenty-one. This worried me—if he was right, I only had a few more months to enjoy it. But for now, I felt I had nothing to lose by seeing Andrew again. It would be fun to go to a musical with him and write lyrics that mimicked musical lyricists instead of pop stars. Andrew was an interesting person who talked about Good Food Guides and Victorian architecture and supported Leyton Orient football team. I wasn’t sure about the idea for a musical he had been working on for the past year, but in 1965, I was rarely sure about anything. His talent was undeniable, and he claimed to have all the right contacts. I soon found myself back in his living room. 

The idea was about the life of Dr. Thomas Barnardo, a nineteenth-century philanthropist who founded orphanages that carry his name. His story was indeed worthy, but it didn’t truly inspire me. The hero seemed too perfect, at least in Andrew's version, and the project felt unoriginal, too similar to Lionel Bart's hit show, *Oliver*. However, Andrew's strong belief in the brilliance of his music was contagious and not entirely unjustified. What did I know about musicals? As David Land, who would later be my agent for over twenty-five years, often said, if there is a demand for one hamburger bar on the block, there is room for two. We could be the second hamburger joint. I began working with great enthusiasm, especially for the funny songs. Andrew explained the plot, played me the tunes, and often gave me the titles, most of which had likely been thought up by his former school friend who had already tried. I even skipped a day at the law office, pretending to be sick, to write my first set of theatrical lyrics. I didn’t know it then, but I had changed my career."

**Language**  
You and I are part of a species with a unique ability: we can influence each other's thoughts with great accuracy. Language is so deeply connected to human life that it is hard to imagine living without it. If you see two or more people together anywhere in the world, they will likely start talking to each other. When there is no one to talk to, people often speak to themselves, their pets, or even their plants. I like to think of language as an 'instinct.' This means that people know how to communicate in a way similar to how spiders know how to spin webs. Web-spinning was not created by a brilliant spider, and it does not require special education or skills in building.

**Climate and Weather**  
Climate and weather, which are mainly influenced by the air around us, greatly impact the lives and locations of animals and plants. Climate can strongly shape the appearance of landscapes. For instance, warm and wet conditions throughout the year allow tropical rainforests to thrive, which are rich in various species. In contrast, cold and windy regions can only support a limited number of living things. The daily weather patterns that contribute to the overall climate are caused by large air masses rising and mixing, as the atmosphere is always in motion. Some of this movement is due to the fact that the layer of gases sits on a spinning Earth. Because air is light, it does not move at the same speed as the Earth and tends to lag behind. However, a more significant cause of air movement is the sun.

**Coffee**  
As a barista, my job included serving drinks, but more importantly, I was responsible for making coffee. In Lygon Street, Melbourne, a restaurant's success can depend on its coffee quality. I underwent several days of intense training in coffee-making, learning more than I ever thought I would about cleaning and maintaining the restaurant's shiny espresso machine. I also learned the key principles for making the perfect rich, frothy cappuccino. By the end of the first week, I realized that making a good cup of coffee was not as simple as it seemed, and I feared I would be assigned to less important tasks again. Fortunately, my boss was patient. ""Making coffee is both an art and a science,"" he said, ""and you need time to develop the skill."""
CPE_41,"**Art on TV**

Why does television often struggle with programs about visual arts? Painting and sculpture are perfect for the camera, which can show an entire artwork and zoom in on details. However, there are few TV series that truly capture the joy and complexity of viewing art. A clear example of this issue is Robert Hughes's eight-part series on American art, titled *American Visions*. Hughes is a respected critic with a strong presence, and he has nearly eight hours to introduce British viewers to an art movement that has been overlooked by British galleries. I expected the series to highlight great artworks, but instead, it focused on how American history and culture are reflected in its art and architecture.

**Dealing in Metals**

For 20 years, I worked as an international metals dealer and gained a reputation as a speculator. The metals market is less regulated than others. With some luck, a willingness to take risks, and a good understanding of the market, it is possible to earn a lot of money. Risk-taking is essential in this industry, which fits well with a free-market global economy. However, free-trade economists who believed that the market would keep the prices of scarce metals stable have discovered the opposite is true. More minerals are being extracted, and the cost of raw materials is falling. When considering inflation, the prices of most metals are now about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to investigate claims against a multinational company that benefits from these low-cost raw materials.

**Extract from a Holiday Brochure**

Abaco and its offshore cays are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas, stretching from Florida to Cuba. Each island has its own character and offers something unique. To explore the islands and cays of Abaco, a boat is essential. If a boat is not included with your accommodation, don’t worry. There are many ferries and water taxis available. You can also rent boats if you prefer to explore on your own. Sailing is the most popular way to travel here, and Abaco is known as 'The Sailing Capital of the World' for good reason. The calm, protected waters are a paradise for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The cays and their beaches stretch for 200 miles like a string of pearls. At night, the lights of the restaurants and cafes in Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay also shine brightly."
CPE_69,"**Text: Build Your Own Bamboo Bike at the UK’s First Workshop**

Join a course at the Bamboo Bike Club, led by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan, where you can create your own custom bamboo bike frame and enjoy a fun weekend of bike-building. It’s Saturday morning in Hackney Wick, east London, and the Bamboo Bike Club is buzzing with activity. This is the only place in Britain where you can learn to build bamboo bikes.

Bamboo is becoming a popular material for bike construction. Companies like Calfee Design from California and Bamboo Bikes from Yorkshire have brought back this method, which dates back to 1894. However, many cyclists find ready-made bamboo frames too expensive, costing around $2,995 or £1,868. This high price inspired James and Ian to spend years working in a shed in Brecon, Wales, to create a bamboo bike business that is affordable for everyday cyclists. They realized they wanted to share the joy of making something unique and sustainable, rather than just selling bike frames.

Now, the Bamboo Bike Club offers monthly courses where participants can build their own bikes. The course includes a computer-designed custom frame and a fun weekend experience. As someone who struggles with DIY projects, I was curious about the quality of the bikes. On the first day, James and Ian teach us how to choose strong bamboo and create sturdy joints. We start by assembling the front triangle with 40 mm diameter bamboo, followed by the thinner parts for the seat and chain assembly. Alloy tubes are added for the handlebars and other parts that need extra strength.

James and Ian are always nearby to help, checking every cut and joint. Many participants are engineers, but Ian reassures everyone that mistakes are okay. If you mess up, just try again with a new piece of bamboo. Each bamboo length is checked for quality, allowing us to choose the look of our frames: plain bamboo, black, or mottled.

On Sunday, we focus on building the lugs, which are the joints of the bike. We wrap them with hemp bindings and glue them with epoxy resin to create a strong bond. After adding a waterproof coating, the bike is ready for wheels, brakes, gears, and personal touches. James and Ian claim that their bamboo bikes are as strong as metal ones. Ian has used his bike for over a year on a 16-mile commute, and James has tested his bike off-road for three months without breaking it.

While bamboo bikes may not look as polished as professional ones, they have a unique charm. I believe that bikes made from bamboo should be enjoyed for leisurely rides rather than racing. I choose a 'Classic English' frame for a comfortable ride. When I test James’s bike, I find it light, stiff, and smooth, thanks to bamboo’s ability to absorb vibrations.

James says, “Some people love the building process, but for me, the real joy comes when the bike is on the road. They are so light and fun to ride.” And the best part? The price is under £500."

**Self-Help Books**  
Diane Reverend was an editor at Random House in New York when she first saw a manuscript by an unknown psychologist, Dr. John Gray. ""I knew it would be a bestseller,"" she says, and she was right. Dr. Gray became very successful, and Diane started her own company. Dr. Gray's book about improving communication between men and women is a key part of a growing self-help industry that aims to meet many American desires for self-improvement. This industry also creates new desires and supports the New York publishing world. In Britain, people are discovering that this genre can produce many books that are questionable in quality, but there are even worse examples. For every self-help book published, many more are rejected for being too similar or too specific. This is a good thing. As new editors search for the next big hit, the quality of writing is often overlooked. What matters most is how marketable the book is. ""How promotable is the author? What's the 'hook'? Is it universal enough?"" Diane lists the important questions, then adds, ""If someone has a catchy title, that's a big part of the success. You know you can connect with readers.""

**Autobiographies**  
There should be an understanding between an autobiographer and the reader that the truth is being shared. However, this understanding is often not fully honored. Writers may choose not to share certain actions or thoughts because they feel ashamed or think they are not important. There are also more complex reasons for not being completely honest. An autobiographer might believe that telling a story in a different way can express the truth better than sticking strictly to the facts. Alternatively, they might decide from the start not to follow this understanding. They may label their book an autobiography to gain the reader's trust, which can help them tell their story, even if it is not entirely true. This can happen without any intention to deceive.

**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**  
Scholars of detective stories say that this genre reflects the conflicts of society in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The detective story often symbolizes deeper human desires like lust or greed, and solving the crime represents restoring order in society. In Hammett's stories, society is shown to be corrupt. The detective and the criminal are two sides of the same person. The detective understands the criminal and feels a strange connection with them. He is seen as too honest by the criminal and too shady by the law. The detective's mission is influenced by his mixed feelings about his role, sometimes making him more eager to punish, and other times making him feel guilty.

**Science Writing**  
Stephen Jay Gould is one of the best science writers today. To discuss his work, I met him at the Grand Hotel while he was promoting his new book. Neither of us felt comfortable there. Gould said he couldn't write in such a pretentious place. He believes that understanding the culture is essential for a successful writer. Science is its own world, and only those who are part of it can write well about it. If you don't understand the community and its rules, you will struggle. One of Gould's key beliefs is to never talk down to the reader. ""Make no concessions,"" he advises. ""You can simplify the language, but never change the main idea. If readers feel patronized, they will lose interest."""
CPE_17,"**Text: Air-conditioning**

At Cannons Gym, a popular spot for City of London workers, the air feels very cold. To cope with this summer's high temperatures, the gym has used a lot of air-conditioning. Sometimes, it feels like the Arctic when it’s quiet. This shows how we often misuse air-conditioning today. It has become a common part of our lives, symbolizing our ability to control the climate. However, many buildings could use other cooling methods. They could use natural light and ventilation, and have thicker walls that keep heat out during the day and release it at night. These simple changes could greatly reduce the need for air-conditioning.

**Sundials**

It is interesting that as we enter a new millennium, people are becoming more interested in sundials, which measure time based on the sun's position. A hundred years ago, sundials were essential for keeping clocks accurate. As clocks improved, sundials became just garden decorations—beautiful but outdated in our technological world. Now, they are being appreciated again. David Harber, a maker of sundials, believes their charm comes from their connection to the universe. He says there is a magical moment when a sundial starts to work. They are calm and beautiful objects that remind us of our place in the cosmos.

**Paint Your Own China**

My idea of china-painting came from a visit to an arts and crafts show where serious-looking older women showed how to paint delicate flowers on teacups with skillful brushstrokes. It was fascinating to watch, as each stroke created a perfect petal or leaf. Their hands were steady, and the paint never smudged. I thought these women must have practiced for years or had a special talent. Because of this, I wondered what kind of people would join a china-painting class. Would beginners have natural talent? However, the atmosphere in the class was friendly and relaxed. Everyone was there to enjoy themselves, and even the teacher didn’t want to paint with the same speed I had seen before."

Uncle chose a package holiday for them at a good price: a flight from Gatwick Airport, twelve nights in Venice, the beautiful city, at the Pensione Concordia. When Keith and Dawne went to the travel agency to book, the clerk told them that the other travelers were a school group from the south coast, all learning Italian. But something went wrong. Either at the travel agency, the check-in desk, or in a computer, a small mistake happened. Dawne and Keith ended up in a hotel called the Edelweiss, in Room 212, somewhere in Switzerland.

At Gatwick, they gave their tickets to a girl in a yellow-and-red uniform. She called them by name, checked their tickets, and said everything was fine. An hour later, they were surprised to hear older people on the plane speaking with accents from the North of England. Keith thought there must have been a cancellation, or maybe the Italian class was on another plane. They ordered drinks, and then more drinks. 

When they landed, a stout woman with glasses said, ""The coach will take us on. Stay together now."" There was no mention of an overnight stop in the brochure, but when the coach arrived at its destination, Keith realized that this was clearly an unexpected stop. As they got off the coach close to midnight, tired and dirty from travel, they didn’t question their right to the beds they were offered. But the next morning, when they learned they were being offered the beds for their entire holiday, they became worried.

""We have the lake and the water birds,"" the receptionist smiled. ""And we can take the steamer to Interlaken."" 

""There's been a mistake,"" Keith said calmly, aware of his wife's nervous breathing beside him. ""We were supposed to be in Venice, at the Pensione Concordia."" 

""I do not know that name, sir. This is Switzerland,"" the receptionist replied. 

""A coach is supposed to take us on. An official said so on the plane. She was here last night,"" Keith insisted. 

""Your group is booked for twelve nights at the Edelweiss Hotel. If you have changed your minds—"" 

""We haven't changed our minds. There’s been a mistake."" The receptionist shook his head, saying he didn’t know about any mistake. 

""The man who made the booking was bald, with glasses and a moustache,"" Dawne added, giving the name of the travel agency in London. 

""Is there a problem?"" a woman said, smiling at Keith. She was the stout woman he had seen talking to the yellow-and-red girl at Gatwick. On the plane, she had walked up and down the aisle, smiling at people. 

""My name is Franks,"" she said. ""I’m married to the man with the bad leg."" 

""Are you in charge, Mrs. Franks?"" Dawne asked. ""We’re in the wrong hotel."" Again, she gave the name of the travel agency and described the bald clerk. 

""It seems we got into the wrong group. We reported to the Your-Kind-of-Holiday girl and left it to her,"" Keith explained. 

""We should have known when they weren’t from Dover,"" Dawne added. ""We heard them talking about Darlington."" 

Keith made an impatient sound, wishing she would let him speak. ""We noticed you at Gatwick. We knew you were in charge."" 

""And I noticed you. I counted you, although you probably didn’t see me. Let me explain: Your-Kind-of-Holiday sends clients to many places, with different holidays at different prices. There are villa holidays for adventurous people under thirty-five, treks to Turkey, and treks for singles to the Himalayas."" 

""What I’m trying to say is that all tickets and labels look similar, yellow with two red bands,"" Mrs. Franks laughed. ""So if you just followed others with the yellow-and-red label, you might think you could end up anywhere! But of course,"" she added kindly, ""that couldn’t happen."" 

""We're not supposed to be in Switzerland,"" Keith insisted. 

""Let’s see, shall we?"" Mrs. Franks unexpectedly turned and walked away, leaving them standing. The receptionist was no longer at the desk. They could hear typing. 

""She seems nice,"" Dawne whispered. Keith wasn’t listening. He tried to remember everything that had happened: handing the tickets to the girl, waiting, and then the girl leading them to the plane, and the pilot welcoming them aboard. 

""Nice to have some young people along,"" an elderly man said. ""Nottage is the name."" His wife was with him, both looking like they were in their eighties. They had slept well, she said, thanks to the lakeside air. 

""That’s nice,"" Dawne replied. Keith walked out of the reception area, and Dawne followed him. Outside the hotel, they didn’t say that there was an irony in what had happened. On their first holiday since their honeymoon, they had ended up in a package tour with elderly people when the whole point of the holiday was to escape the needs of the elderly. Uncle had said so himself when they tried to persuade him to join them."
CPE_48,"**Text: 'HE WAS A PEOPLE PERSON'**

American business leaders are looking to the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a model for good management. Eluned Price reports.

Most people in Britain know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and have a general idea of his achievements. However, America has only recently discovered him. The Wall Street Journal described Shackleton as ""an Antarctic explorer whose feats went largely unnoticed for most of the 20th century,"" which is an exaggeration. Now, Americans are enthusiastically learning about him. Biographies and stories about the voyage of the Endurance are being published quickly; the American Museum of Natural History is organizing a major exhibition, and Columbia Tristar is making a film about Shackleton's life.

Some American managers have also adopted Shackleton as a role model. They share stories of his actions with admiration and draw lessons in leadership and communication from his experiences. They even refer to each other as ""speaking Shackleton."" Shackleton, known for his determination and resourcefulness, has become a symbol for modern management consultants.

Jim MacGregor, managing partner of Abernathy MacGregor Frank in New York, has looked up to Shackleton for years. His firm focuses on communication during mergers, acquisitions, and corporate crises. For example, they handle situations like ""the plant exploded"" or ""half the workforce must be laid off."" While it may be hard to see how Shackleton's experience of surviving in extreme cold relates to managing a financial crisis, MacGregor believes Shackleton is a great model for management because of his leadership and communication skills. Shackleton had clear values and was at his best when he and his team had a lot at stake, including their lives.

One of Shackleton's most interesting decisions was to turn back when he was only 97 miles from the South Pole. This choice showed his commitment to his men's safety. In a crisis, people want to know who is in charge. While many managers today avoid responsibility, Shackleton was willing to take charge. His 1914 expedition became legendary when his ship, the Endurance, was trapped in ice for nine months and eventually sank. When the ship went down, Shackleton told his men, ""We should all eventually reach safety if you do your best and trust me."" 

From the accounts and diaries kept during the expedition, it is clear that Shackleton was always in control. ""Shackleton thought everything through, planned for every situation, kept his men informed, and asked for their opinions,"" says MacGregor. ""He was flexible, ready to change plans when necessary."" They have developed effective principles based on Shackleton's story, which clients can relate to without feeling criticized.

Shackleton believed that an explorer needs optimism, endurance, and patience. ""One of the hardest things to do in tough situations is to wait, especially in America, where there is a strong desire to fix things quickly,"" says MacGregor. ""If you invest in bonds and guess wrong about interest rates, you should hold on and wait to get your money back. Selling too soon would mean a big loss. Also, don't hesitate to change your plans if they aren't working. If a new product isn't successful, don't keep selling it.""

Shackleton led by example. On the way back from the Endurance, he noticed Hurley, the expedition photographer, without gloves. He insisted Hurley wear his gloves, saying he would throw them overboard if he didn't. Someone else remembered Shackleton doing something similar with a biscuit when they were near starvation on a previous expedition: ""He said he would leave it in the snow. Millions of pounds couldn't have bought that biscuit.""

As Caroline Alexander, author of *Endurance*, the human account of that expedition, says: ""The public's interest in heroic efforts is growing. Shackleton highlights the lack of heroism in today's world. He stands out as a true embodiment of the ideals we long for today."""
CAE_15,"**Simplified Text: 'Finding Food in Madagascar'**

In the forests of Madagascar, there is a unique primate called the aye-aye. Its feeding habits are similar to those of a woodpecker. Both the aye-aye and the woodpecker search for insect larvae by digging into wood. The woodpecker uses its beak to chisel into the wood and its long tongue to pull out the insects. In contrast, the aye-aye uses its sharp front teeth to gnaw into the wood and its long, thin third finger to reach inside and scoop out the insects.

Although the aye-aye's unusual feeding method was first described over a hundred years ago, scientists have only recently learned how it finds the insects hidden in the wood. Dr. Carl Erickson from Duke University studied the hunting skills of two male aye-ayes named Nosferatu and Poe, a female named Samantha, and her baby, Annabelle.

Dr. Erickson first wanted to see if the aye-ayes could find insects by looking for signs, like holes in the wood where insects might have entered to lay eggs. He gave the aye-ayes logs with narrow holes. Some holes led to food, while others were empty. The aye-ayes went directly to the logs with food, showing they did not need to rely on visual signs. They might have been using their sense of smell or hearing, but further tests showed they did not need these senses either. They could find food even when the smell was blocked and when the insects were dead and silent.

So, how did the aye-ayes find the insects? Dr. Erickson found that they would gnaw into both empty and food-filled cavities. It seems they can sense the hollow spaces. When looking for food, an aye-aye taps the wood with its long finger and moves its large ears forward to listen closely. Dr. Erickson believes the aye-aye uses echo-location, listening for sounds that indicate a hollow area below. It can also hear insects moving when disturbed by the tapping.

The idea that the aye-aye fills the role of woodpeckers in Madagascar's forests is interesting. However, there are birds like the Sickle-billed and Nuthatch Vangas that also search for insects in wood, so the woodpecker role may not be empty. The aye-aye can be seen as a mix of a woodpecker and an echo-locating bat, but it also acts like a squirrel. Its front teeth grow continuously like a squirrel's, and it has been seen in the wild gnawing through nut shells and using its long finger to get the nut meat inside."
CAE_19,"**Text: 'Ordinary People, Ordinary Lives'**

Many of us have photos of our grandparents, but how many of us truly understand their lives and who they were when they were young? The few diaries we find often leave us wanting more, and family stories are often only partially remembered. What will our grandchildren know about us? We often plan to write down our stories but never seem to do it. We might leave behind videos instead of photos, but those images are still flat and lack depth.

Hannah Renier has found a solution: she writes autobiographies for other people, creating a hardcover book of at least 20,000 words, complete with illustrations if desired. Her focus is not on famous individuals, but on everyday people. The idea came to her when she spoke with her family and realized how much of her past was fading away. ""When I started, I didn't take it as seriously as I do now, after meeting people who have interesting stories to share,"" she explains. ""Many say they are doing it for their children or for future generations, but they also gain a lot from the experience themselves. They enjoy it.""

The promise of confidentiality helps her subjects feel free to share openly. A 62-year-old man, who has experienced both success and failure in his life, said, ""I felt confident to be honest. I was surprised by what came out. Some memories were painful, like my divorce, and that hurt is still there."" He wrote his story for his family, hoping they could learn from it, but he hasn’t let his adult children read it yet. ""There are things that might hurt them, and I prefer they read it after I'm gone,"" he said.

He also recognized patterns from his childhood that led him to repeat mistakes in his life. Ms. Renier has noticed similar patterns in others. ""It's surprising how many people are influenced by their parents,"" she says. ""The messages they received as children can affect them for their entire lives. They often find themselves repeating the same behaviors, whether by marrying people their parents liked or rebelling against them.""

Many people express regrets about unresolved issues with their parents, even decades later. ""If someone had problems in their youth, they often carry those into middle age,"" she notes. They may live their lives trying to impress a parent who never acknowledged them, and some even seek permission to express their frustrations.

As a recorder rather than an interrogator, Ms. Renier maintains a respectful distance. ""This is not for public sharing, and I'm not here to pry. Sometimes people share something and then hesitate, saying, 'I'm not sure if that should be included.' I include it anyway, and they can choose to remove it later. But generally, people want to be honest, flaws and all.""

""This isn't vanity publishing; it's not about people saying, 'Look at my interesting life.' Things are changing rapidly, and we are losing touch with our past. This work helps provide a connection to our roots. People want a sense of immortality.""

Each book involves up to 30 hours of recorded interviews, which Ms. Renier uses to write the life story, organizing the events and adding her interpretation. Modern technology allows her to create everything except the binding, which features gold lettering. Clients can choose the color of the cover and the title. The final product is tailored for a private audience and is not a sensationalized account. Ms. Renier organizes the material thoughtfully and writes well, ensuring the final content reflects the subject's life accurately. Each book is priced at nearly £3,000, with additional copies available for £25 each. She receives about ten inquiries a week, but the high cost, due to the time required, discourages many potential clients. ""I thought it would be a more affordable product,"" she admits. ""But the people I've worked with tend to be well-off, often readers of Harpers & Queen, a magazine where I advertise. They are the kind of people who would have had their portraits painted for future generations."""

The Museum of Classical Archaeology is one of the few places in the world that has a collection of casts of Greek and Roman sculptures, with over six hundred pieces. It is important to note that none of the sculptures are original; they are all replicas made from the originals, mostly created in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Museum is located in a specially designed gallery with great natural light. There are many benefits to having plaster casts: sculptures that were originally displayed together but are now in different museums across Europe can be seen together as they were meant to be. Most of the famous Greek and Roman sculptures can be viewed in just one afternoon.

These photographs provide a detailed record of the landscape, showing both the natural environment and the impact of human activity from prehistoric times to today. There is a small display in the entrance hall, and the knowledgeable library staff can assist with inquiries. The photographs cannot be borrowed, but copies can usually be purchased, made to order, and typically take about a month to prepare.

**E. Cambridge Medieval Brass Rubbing Centre**  
The Cambridge Brass Rubbing Centre, the second oldest and longest-running center of its kind in the world, is a unique tourist attraction. Visitors can enjoy creating wall hangings by rubbing over one of more than a hundred different brass plates from the tombs of medieval knights and ladies. By making resin copies, known as facsimiles, the center preserves the originals while making brass rubbing accessible to everyone. The brass plates, which served as memorials to tomb statues, spread from Germany across medieval Europe and Scandinavia. Many beautiful brasses were destroyed during various revolutions, but most of the remaining examples are found in Britain, with the widest range available at the Cambridge Centre."

**A. The Theatre Director**  
I have had a unique personal life, but I have enjoyed 35 years of being around small children. This morning, I fed my baby, and that is what being a father means to me. I feel very lucky with my children. We share a love for opera, theatre, books, and music, which has created a strong bond, especially now that they are mostly grown up and I see them more as a friend than a father. I do not believe in physical punishment. I have slapped my children in anger before, but I do not support it. I may not have been the most attentive father, but I have always tried to be available for them. I am here if they need me, but I believe they should reach out to me. If I start asking them why they haven’t contacted me, it creates unnecessary guilt. My parents did that to me, and I would never do that to my children.

**B. The Advertising Executive**  
I was quite young, around 25, when my children were born, and I found the responsibilities challenging. It made me feel older quickly, but it also kept me young, which I appreciate. As they became teenagers, they introduced me to music, youth culture, and fashion, which helped me stay connected in my work. I missed some important moments, like their first concerts and sports days, and I feel sad about that. However, now I can take them on holidays to the south of France, and they enjoy spending time with my friends and attending parties and advertising events without feeling out of place. I think it helps that my job is seen as exciting.

**C. The Politician**  
My first child was born just as I was about to be elected to the Greater London Council, and I had more children soon after. My wife and I promised to make time for them, but as my political career grew, finding time became difficult. I only accept weekend meetings and public events if my children can come with me. This way, they can see what I do when I am not with them, and they do not feel like I am disappearing. I have noticed more politicians bringing their children to work, which shows we are becoming more aware of the importance of including our children in our lives.

**D. The Writer**  
My first marriage ended when my daughters, Kate and Bonnie, were young, which made me think more about fatherhood. I worked hard to stay connected with them. My ex-wife and I even tried living next to each other for a while, so they could visit easily, but I think it confused them. Kate has said in interviews that I was always there for her, but I wonder if I was a good father. I was around a lot, but I treated my children like adults too soon. Kate recently said we were too lenient. I wish I had set more rules and structure. I still worry about my older daughters just as much as my youngest. In that way, your children always stay with you.

**E. The TV Presenter**  
I was ready for children. I was 30, had met my wife, and we had a nice home, so we thought, ""Why not have a child instead of just buying new furniture?"" Having my daughter, Betty, has helped me understand who I am. Creating a child feels very special, but it also makes you just one of many parents. It can be frustrating at times, but any irritation disappears with just one look at her. A baby's smile is incredibly powerful; it can melt anyone's heart."

CAE_46,"**Text: 'Science Defying Gravity'**

Journalist Tom Mumford joins students who are using weightlessness to test their ideas. From the outside, the aircraft looked like any other. The pilot informed the young passengers that it was a Boeing KC-135 refueling tanker, built in 1964 and based on the Boeing 707. However, the 13 students from Europe and America who boarded were in for an extraordinary experience. Inside, the plane resembled a long white tunnel with few windows, lit by lights along the padded walls. Most seats were removed, leaving only a few at the back where the nervous students sat, feeling anxious. 

For a year, they had competed with other students to earn a spot on this flight, which was organized by the European Space Agency. The challenge was to propose creative experiments to be conducted in weightless conditions. Those with the best ideas were selected for this unique flight, which could be compared to an incredible roller-coaster ride. 

For the next two hours, the Boeing would fly in a way that mimicked a large bird soaring upwards before diving back down. The goal was to create a brief moment of weightlessness at the top of each curve. When the pilot cut the engines at 3,000 meters, the aircraft would rise higher due to its own speed before gravity pulled it back down. During the few silent seconds between rising and falling, everything inside the aircraft would become weightless, allowing the students to feel as if they were closer to the moon than to Earth.

The flight took off smoothly, but any thoughts of a regular passenger flight vanished when the pilot put the Boeing into a steep climb for about 20 seconds. The engines roared, blood rushed from our heads, and bodies were thrown around the cabin. Then, the engines stopped, and we quickly transitioned to weightlessness. For 20 seconds, we floated in silence, as if the floor had turned into a trampoline. One step could send us soaring towards the ceiling. We drifted aimlessly; directions like left or right lost their meaning. Only gravity kept us grounded and allowed us to understand movement.

After ten seconds of freefall, the pilot pulled the aircraft out of its dive. The return of gravity was not as sudden as its loss, but it still caused some students to land hard. After completing the first curve, some students felt uneasy about the 29 more to come. Thirty curves provided ten minutes of 'space time' for experiments. The Dutch students studied the movements of Leonardo, their robotic cat, to learn how cats always land on their feet. At the right moment, they released their device, which floated upside down, and one student managed to turn it right side up using a remote control. 

The next curve almost ended badly when another student landed on the device during a less controlled return to gravity. Nearby, a German team from the University of Aachen examined how the quality of metal joints is affected by the lack of gravity, with plans for future space stations. Another group from Utah State University explored creating solar sails from thin liquid films hardened by ultraviolet sunlight. They hoped that once perfected, satellites could use solar sails to harness the sun's energy, similar to how a yacht uses wind.

After two hours of flying between heaven and Earth, breakfast felt unsteady, but the main feeling was excitement, not sickness. This feeling would last a long time. ""It was an unforgettable experience,"" said one student. ""I already wanted to be an astronaut, but now I want it even more."""
CAE_3,"**Text: My Connection to New Zealand**

**JONATHON PORRITT TALKS TO DANNY DANZIGER**

Jonathon Porritt is the author of *Seeing Green - The Politics of Ecology*. 

I had a strange time in my life when I didn’t experience any summers. I traveled to New Zealand every summer, which was actually winter there, so I had nine consecutive winters. I enjoyed this because I like winter. My parents had the idea to buy a small piece of land for my siblings and me to take care of. My mother said, “If you can plant trees on it, then you can have it.” The goal was for us to always have a connection to New Zealand, which is special because my father grew up there. They found a plot of land about 20 miles north of Auckland in a place called Rangitoupuni. The land was not very good, but it was suitable for planting trees. I have always been passionate about land. I spent a year in Australia working on sheep farms and doing various farming jobs, so the idea of planting trees excited me, and I was eager to start. My family became enthusiastic as we progressed. I began planting in 1968, and by the end of 1972, the three of us had planted the entire 70 acres.

In New Zealand in 1968, it was one of those rainy winters. It rained a lot, almost every day we were planting. It seems odd to remember it as a happy time since I was often wet and cold. Each morning was a challenge: getting ready for planting while coming out of the Land Rover, warm and dry, into the rain, with my jacket still damp from the day before, and my boots soaked. My mind would wander, allowing for many thoughts and reflections about life.

In that first year, I worked with an experienced tree-planter, which was very helpful since I had never planted trees seriously before. I wore a planting bag around my neck, filling it with as many trees as I could. When the bag was full, it was heavy, but as it got lighter, planting became easier. The hardest part was keeping the lines straight. You decide how far apart to plant the trees, then set up three poles in a straight line to guide you. Once you were in line, you just planted down the line, turned around, and came back.

I enjoy hard physical work, and it kept me fit. After a while, planting trees became almost automatic. You develop a rhythm and use the fewest spade strokes needed to dig a hole. This rhythm is common in many farming jobs; you train your body to perform a series of standard moves, making the task much easier. You create a regular process: taking a tree from the bag, digging a hole, placing it in the ground, stamping it down, and moving on. 

Mentally, it was interesting. My mind would wander, leading to many thoughts about nature and our place in it. These reflections have influenced my life significantly. I have returned to New Zealand four times since then and watched the trees grow, which has been very rewarding. I feel a connection to what happens to them. I always worry when I read news about strong winds or droughts in New Zealand. Such headlines make me anxious. Fortunately, everything turned out well, and those trees are now 20 years old and healthy.

I should add that I took a break from teaching and returned to New Zealand in 1984 for three months, alone. I wrote my first book, *Seeing Green*, there. There is a simple cabin on the tree farm with just a bed, a table, and a chair. In the mornings, I wrote; in the afternoons, I pruned the trees; and in the evenings, I did research. My connection to that area remains strong. It is the place I feel most connected to in terms of the bond between people and the earth."
CAE_10,"**Text: 'CARING FOR BADGER CUBS'**

""What now?"" was my first thought when one of my helpers brought me a cardboard box. My husband Derek and I have run an open farm in Somerset for six years, known for caring for orphaned animals. The noise from the box—a mix of a cackle and a bark—was unfamiliar, so I looked inside and found three small grey badger cubs, each about eight inches long. Their soft coats were covered in fleas, and their milky eyes looked up at me from their tiny black-and-white striped heads. I had never seen badger cubs before. Most are born between mid-January and mid-March and live underground, so if they are orphaned, they often die from hunger without being found. These three were brought to us by builders who accidentally disturbed their home while working. Their mother was found dead, with her babies still trying to suckle. Although the cubs were healthy, they were cold and whimpering. After removing the fleas, I took them into the farmhouse kitchen and placed them beside the stove for warmth. There were two females, named Primrose and Bluebell, and a male named Willow. At first, I fed them with a syringe, but I had to wipe each cub with a warm cloth to mimic their mother’s licking, which helped them go to the bathroom. For the first few days, I fed them every four hours. Within a week, they were drinking from a bottle and moving around, though a bit unsteadily. They were happy together, with a heated pad as a substitute for their mother.

However, three weeks later, I noticed that Willow seemed tired, even though he was still eating normally. This was a warning sign. I should have acted quickly, but I didn’t realize how serious it was. The next morning, I found him dead. The vet's examination showed that Willow had died from a lung infection. When bottle-feeding animals, it’s important not to let them drink too quickly, as liquid can enter the lungs. In Willow's case, this caused an infection that would have been hard to treat, even with antibiotics, because he was so small. Feeling sad about my loss, I continued to care for the other two cubs. Then, six days later, a local farmer, who had heard about our cubs, came to see me. He had found another male cub, abandoned by its mother. He knew she wouldn’t return because the area had been disturbed, and the cub was cold and hungry. We named him Willow II. At six weeks old, he was about two weeks younger than the females, and I soon learned why his mother had left him. He was very difficult to feed. I had to keep moving the bottle’s teat around and squeezing it to get him to drink. After ten minutes, he would finally latch on as if he hadn’t eaten all day. By the end of April, the females were eating creamed rice and anything else I offered. Willow II was happy to stop using the bottle but struggled to eat without making a mess. Eventually, I gave him a sausage, which he slowly learned to chew and eat. After a week of sausages, he was ready for more variety. At nearly five months old, they were all eating cereals for breakfast, a meat and vegetable meal for lunch, and fruit, nuts, cheese, hard-boiled eggs, and sunflower seeds in the evening. Badgers usually eat 60% earthworms, along with beetles, baby rabbits, mice, and even plant roots. My badgers were better off than others that year; the summer was very hot, making it hard to find earthworms.

By August, my badgers had started to become nocturnal, going for walks at dusk or late at night. We often walked through the cider orchard, where the tall grass made it easy for them to chase each other. They would get excited, fluff up their fur, and chase their tails. We, as their human companions, joined in the fun. I learned to avoid their playful nips, but Derek, who joined us less often, sometimes got caught and had colorful reactions to it. During two of these late-night walks, I saw other badgers in our field. They were likely searching for food because they had to expand their territory. Badgers are territorial and can be aggressive towards others that enter their space. We were warned that they might come into our badger pen and harm the cubs, so we covered the gate with sheet metal to keep it secure. The local press took pictures of me walking the badgers, and the response was so positive that we started a campaign to build a sett for the badgers on our farm. With help from others, we designed a new home for them. Our son Daniel drew the plans, and we built a sett with tunnels, an enclosure, and a badger gate that matched their walking route. It had three chambers, one larger than the others, with a glass side so people could see inside from a darkened area. As the sett took shape, the badgers explored it before their walks. Eventually, they became more interested in the tunnels and bedding than in walking. The building costs were higher than we expected, but a local bus company called Badgerline helped fund part of it, and local businesses donated materials. Everyone wanted to see the badgers have a proper home.

One evening, they finally moved in. After watching them for a while, we left them to settle. Half an hour later, I returned to check on them and saw three badgers curled up in their chambers, sound asleep. Nowadays, I don’t walk with them as often, especially since they don’t wake up until midnight. We see Primrose occasionally, as she has joined a nearby sett, but Bluebell and Willow II still come to greet me before running off into the night. This is their territory now, a place they know well and a home they have happily accepted."
CAE_67,"**Text: In Search of True North - The Man Behind Halley's Comet**

Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, wants to follow in the footsteps of Sir Edmund Halley, who studied compass variations. Anjana Ahuja reports.

Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is famous for the comet named after him. However, during his time, one of his most important achievements was charting the ""variations of the compass"" using calculations from his sea voyages on the warship Paramore. These variations, now called ""declination,"" refer to the angle between magnetic north and true geographical north. Understanding this was crucial for sailors to correct their compasses and navigate accurately.

Halley, one of only two men in England paid for scientific research at that time, set out for the Cape Verde Islands to chart declination in the North and South Atlantic. His first trip was cut short due to crew issues, but he later sailed to Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, Newfoundland, and back to England. From these journeys, Halley published a chart in 1701 showing compass variations in the Western and Southern Oceans. More advanced charts based on his work were essential for sailors for over a century until changes in the Earth's magnetic field made them less accurate.

Dr. Clark plans to celebrate the 300th anniversary of Halley's journey by retracing the Paramore's route. He needs to raise £70,000 before starting, with support from Sir Vivian Fuchs, who led the first cross-Antarctica expedition. Dr. Clark became interested in Halley during his two years at Halley Station in Antarctica, where he read about Halley's life. ""Halley led a remarkable life,"" Dr. Clark says. ""He was a respected scientist and led expeditions. He was not only an astronomer but also researched geophysics. While he was Astronomer Royal, he mapped stars and pursued other interests.""

During this time, Halley invented a diving bell and advised Sir Isaac Newton on his work, Principia Mathematica, which is foundational to classical physics. Dr. Clark believes that recreating Halley's voyage will give him the recognition he deserves. His expedition, called ""In the Wake of the Paramore,"" will also have scientific value. It will involve making measurements similar to Halley's but with more accurate instruments. These measurements are necessary because the Earth's magnetic field is constantly changing. The data collected will help improve the existing model of the Earth's magnetic field, known as the international geomagnetic reference field.

""It is common to measure the size but not the direction of the magnetic field,"" Dr. Clark explains. ""You need to know true north to measure the direction. On our expedition, we can use global positioning satellites to find that."" The British Geological Survey and the United States Navy will provide instruments. A Danish satellite will also be taking similar measurements globally. Dr. Clark hopes his measurements will fill in any gaps in the satellite's coverage of the Atlantic Ocean, and having ground-based measurements will be useful for comparison.

Halley's Atlantic journey was significant as it was the first scientific expedition at sea, and he was the first civilian appointed as a naval captain to pursue his interest in declination. Does Dr. Clark have the qualifications to succeed in his voyage? He has spent two years in Antarctica and worked in the geomagnetic group at the British Geological Survey. He has already sailed the 13,000 kilometers from Rio de Janeiro to England. He plans to complete the expedition in four stages with different crews.

Does he share Halley's obsessive nature? ""I am willing to give up my life for eight months to do this, so some might think I'm obsessed. But I wouldn't want to sail across the Atlantic again without a good reason. Halley and his fascinating life have given me a real sense of purpose."""
CAE_27,"**Text: 'POWER DRESSING'**

Every summer, the peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show off their beautiful tail feathers to the hens. This behavior raises a question that puzzled Charles Darwin: how could such extravagant features evolve in a competitive natural world? Darwin believed that living beings evolved through natural selection, where the strongest and best adapted survive and reproduce. However, he found it hard to explain why peacocks, with their large tails that could hinder them, were successful. He introduced the idea of 'sexual selection,' suggesting that females are attracted to beauty for its own sake.

Darwin's friend, Alfred Russel Wallace, had a different view. He thought that if peahens preferred males with the most impressive tails, there must be a deeper reason behind it. He believed that the tail was not just for show but indicated some hidden quality that helped the males survive.

Now, a century later, researchers like Marion Petrie are studying peafowl at Whipsnade to answer two main questions: Do peahens really prefer males with the most extravagant tails? And do these males have any real advantages, or is it just about appearance? Observations show that hens do seem to prefer males with more eye spots on their tails, which are linked to tail length. However, it is still unclear if these attractive males are better in other ways.

William Hamilton from Oxford University suggested that showy male birds might be healthier and free from parasites, and their bright feathers could signal this. While there is evidence for this in other species, Petrie and her team have not yet been able to test this idea with the peacocks at Whipsnade. This year, they are comparing the offspring of attractive and unattractive males to see if the attractive ones produce healthier and faster-growing young. If so, it would support Wallace's idea that female choice is practical.

Additionally, there is a concept called 'Fisher's Runaway,' proposed by mathematician R A Fisher. It suggests that if a female chooses a male with a slightly better tail, their sons will inherit that trait, and their daughters will prefer long tails. Over generations, this could lead to increasingly long tails, supporting Darwin's idea that females might eventually select for beauty alone."
CAE_66,"**THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS**

Tom Cunliffe believes that the best boat design should blend traditional and modern elements. He applied this idea in his own boat, 'The Westerman'. This week, the Summer Boat Show in London showcases many impressive yachts filled with new technology. Most of these boats are influenced by a major change in hull design that happened 25 years ago. In contrast, my boat rests quietly in a tidal creek on the south coast. Although it was designed last year, it looks like it is 100 years old, which might make you think its owner is a romantic. Perhaps I am, but I’m not sure. 

This boat benefits from the charm of classic design, but modern technology has made the process easier. However, it is important to note that advanced technology often separates sailors from the true challenges of life at sea. These challenges are often what they wanted to experience by going sailing in the first place. I am not saying that sailors should face every hardship. I believe it is essential for my boats to have a coal stove for warmth and comfortable sleeping areas. But why go sailing if every sail operates automatically? Dealing with a flapping sail is part of being a sailor. 

Why should we give up common sense and move our steering positions from the safe back of the boat to a less secure spot near the front? Unfortunately, this change creates a cabin that resembles an ocean liner, with a bed larger than one at home. For me, a boat should always feel like a boat, not a house on the water. When I bought my previous boat, Hirta, to sail around Britain for a TV race series, the previous owner noted that it had all the comforts but no luxuries. Over time, I learned how true this was. Hirta had heavy sails, no running water, little electricity, no fridge, no central heating, no winches, and no electronics, especially for navigation. Yet, she was the easiest and most forgiving boat I have ever sailed.

However, classic boats require a lot of maintenance, which can be challenging. After injuring my back, I realized I could no longer care for Hirta. I looked for a younger boat but found none that met my needs, so I decided to build a new one from scratch. The Westerman has never let me down. Although designer Nigel Irens and his assistant Ed Burnett use computer design programs, Irens first sketched this boat on a paper napkin before moving to the computer. After creating a basic design, he carved a model, just like boat builders did in the past. We reviewed the initial design and made adjustments using the computer. The final version was nearly perfect.

The completed boat has crossed the North Atlantic and won four out of her first six races. She has a timeless look, sails beautifully, and her interior, made from reclaimed pitch pine, creates a peaceful atmosphere. This may be because she was designed solely as a sailing boat, without considering any furniture. This traditional approach works well. In her calm presence, she proves that you don’t need to follow trends to find happiness and that sometimes it is wise to learn from history. Built with wood treated to resist water, she has all the advantages of a fiberglass boat while still looking, feeling, and sailing like a true vessel."
CAE_44,"**RETREAT, RELAX, RECHARGE**

Health farms and country house hotels with spa facilities are experiencing a surge in popularity. We asked five journalists to explore some of these locations.

**A. HENLOW GRANGE**  
I was excited to spend six days at Henlow Grange because I was tired and needed to unwind. My room in the large 18th-century house was extremely comfortable, and I felt relaxed immediately. On the first day, I did nothing but sleep. Starting on the second day, I participated in body conditioning and various classes like yoga and stretch and tone. The instructors were highly skilled, and I was amazed at how flexible I became throughout the week. They offer a wide range of treatments, including aromatherapy, seaweed baths, manicures, and pedicures. The facial, lasting an hour, truly rejuvenated me. The staff in the treatment rooms were exceptionally friendly and professional. The atmosphere was vibrant and enthusiastic. Henlow plans to renovate this year, adding a half-size Olympic swimming pool and a Light Diet Room. Bicycles are available for riding around the grounds. If you prefer a quieter day and the weather is nice, you can read a magazine or take a peaceful walk in the garden. During my stay, my mood and appetite improved. I left feeling wonderful and energized, which lasted a long time. I definitely want to return. This is the ideal getaway for a stressed working woman. Save Room 5 for me!

**B. SHRUBLAND HALL**  
The peaceful atmosphere of this stately home was clear as soon as I entered the reception area. The Hall features a beautifully decorated library, a lovely conservatory, and plenty of space, allowing you to avoid conversation if you wish. Upon arrival, everyone receives a medical check-up, including weight and blood pressure assessments. We were all referred to as patients, which felt a bit odd since I am healthy. However, I appreciated that a shoulder issue found during the check-up was quickly addressed by the fitness instructor, and we worked on it in group workshops and individual sessions. Each guest follows a specific diet. I lost weight without fasting, but I was still hungry enough to get a bad headache on the second day. My daily menu included grapefruit and honey for breakfast, salads for lunch, and a mix of exotic fruit, yogurt, and hot broth for dinner. If you’re not on a light diet, you can eat in the main dining hall, where the food is delicious and well-presented. You receive a massage or water therapy every other day, and additional treatments are reasonably priced.  
*Liz Gregory*

**C. CAREYS MANOR**  
Careys is not a health farm and does not claim to be one. It is a charming old manor with cozy log fires and a spacious lounge. If you are counting calories, you might want to skip the gourmet food, which features rich sauces and delightful desserts created by the French chef. Fortunately, the hotel has a fully-equipped gym and a soft-water pool, allowing me to work off some of the tempting dishes. (You can choose a 'health-conscious' diet if you want to lose weight.) There is a spa bath, steam room, Swiss shower, sauna, and treatment rooms. A major attraction is the sports injury clinic, where I received expert advice on an old shoulder injury. The physiotherapist suggested good posture, exercises, and massage. Careys is both comfortable and luxurious, relaxed yet elegant. If you want to explore, the surrounding countryside is beautiful.  
*Beverly D'Silva*

**D. CLIVEDEN**  
Cliveden is a grand country home and a five-star hotel that treats guests like royalty. It offers health and beauty treatments, a well-equipped gym, saunas, a swimming pool, tennis, horse riding, and more. The estate features stunning woodland walks and gardens across 376 acres. Waldo's, a highly-acclaimed restaurant, serves dishes that are simply delightful. It took me half an hour to read the dinner menu because of the many choices. The meal was fantastic, especially the sticky-toffee pudding with banana ice cream. I went to bed feeling very happy! The next morning, I spent a few hours in the gym to burn off some calories before my next meal. In the Pavilion, I enjoyed a facial with gentle heat and essential oils, followed by an aromatherapy massage. I thought about the other journalists' reports on fitness assessments and beauty treatments. Cliveden offers all these options if you wish to use them before indulging at Waldo's.  
*Kay Letch*

**E. SPRINGS HYDRO**  
The best and worst thing about Springs Hydro is the carrot cake. It is the best because it is the most delicious I have ever tasted, but the worst because it contains 360 calories, which can be a setback if you want to lose weight. You have been warned! The second best thing is the amazing aromatherapy massage. I chose a relaxing oil blend and fell asleep twice during the treatment, returning to my room for the best night’s sleep I’ve had in years. The facilities are modern and well-organized, with luxurious bedrooms. There are many therapists and beauty rooms, making it easy to schedule appointments. A variety of treatments are available, from manicures and pedicures to deep-cleansing facials and body treatments. The guests are a diverse group, including football teams, mothers and daughters, friends, and singles. Ideally, I would take a break here about once a month.

CAE_22,"**NATURAL TALENTS**

In the seven million years since humans and chimpanzees separated, we have not developed significant differences; genetically, we are still over 98% similar to chimps. This suggests that the traits that make us human are a recent development in our evolutionary history. Our ability to create art and other unique human traits likely come from just a small number of our genes. This is a heavy responsibility for such a limited set of genes. 

Recent studies of animal behavior have shown that many traits once thought to be unique to humans are now seen as differences in degree rather than kind. For instance, both humans and wild chimpanzees use tools—chimpanzees use sticks to eat and as weapons, while sea otters use rocks to crack open clams. Monkeys also have a basic form of language, using different sounds to warn of predators like leopards, eagles, and snakes. This means that aside from art, there are few absolute differences between humans and animals.

However, if human art comes from a unique genetic trait, it is curious that our ancestors did not create art for almost 6.9 million years after separating from chimps. The earliest forms of art may have been wood carvings or body painting, but these materials do not last over time. The first clear evidence of human art appears around 35,000 years ago with cave paintings, statues, necklaces, and musical instruments.

If we argue that our recent artistic explosion sets us apart, we must consider how our art differs from that of animals. Three common claims are made: human art is non-utilitarian, it is created for aesthetic pleasure, and it is learned rather than instinctive. 

First, as Oscar Wilde said, ""All art is quite useless."" A biologist might interpret this to mean that human art does not help us survive or pass on our genes, unlike most animal behaviors. While some human art serves a purpose in communication, it is not the same as passing on genes. In contrast, birdsong has clear functions, such as defending territory or attracting mates, which help transmit genes. By this measure, human art does seem different.

The second claim is that human art is motivated by aesthetic pleasure, which also seems reasonable. We cannot ask birds if they enjoy their songs, but they mainly sing during mating season, suggesting they do not sing just for beauty. Again, this makes human art appear unique.

The third claim is that human art is learned rather than instinctive. Each human culture has its own art styles that are learned. For example, songs in Tokyo and Paris are easily distinguishable. However, these differences are not genetic. People from different cultures can learn each other's songs. In contrast, some birds are born with the ability to sing their species' specific song, even if they have never heard it before.

The role of learning in human art is evident in how quickly our art styles change. For instance, geese have made the same sounds for 2,000 years, but human art evolves rapidly. Even casual museum visitors can tell that a twentieth-century painting is more recent than the Mona Lisa. Art experts can often identify the time and artist of a painting they have not seen before. However, even experts might confuse two mid-twentieth-century artists named Congo and Betsy, who were actually chimpanzees. Congo created up to 33 paintings in one day, seemingly for his own enjoyment, and became upset when his pencil was taken away. Congo and Betsy had a show of their paintings in 1957 in London, and many of their works sold—something many human artists cannot claim.

These chimpanzee paintings challenge the distinctions between human art and animal behavior. Like human art, the ape paintings did not serve practical purposes; they were created for the satisfaction of the painter. One might argue that human art is different because most human artists intend to communicate through their work, while the apes did not care to share their paintings with other apes. However, this argument is not entirely convincing, as some famous human art was also created for personal satisfaction rather than communication."
CAE_39,"**Text: An Amazing Adventure**

The Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last unexplored places on Earth and also one of the most dangerous. Charles Blackmore crossed it and lived to tell the story. There are very few big adventures left and very few heroes. Children's stories used to be full of brave explorers with sunburnt skin and eyes squinting to see far away on their journeys into the unknown. Nowadays, such characters are rare in fiction and even rarer in real life. That was my belief until I met Charles Blackmore.

Blackmore's great adventure was leading a team across the Taklamakan Desert, which means ""once entered, you never come out."" Local people call it the Desert of Death. He shared the dangers and excitement of that incredible journey in the comfort of his family home. His team included four Britons (one was the medical officer), an American photographer, four Chinese experts, 30 camels, and six camel handlers. It turned out that the camel handlers had never worked with camels before; they were long-distance truck drivers. This misunderstanding could have endangered everyone’s lives and the success of the expedition.

This diverse group set out to cross 1,200 kilometers of one of the world's harshest deserts, and Charles Blackmore wrote a captivating account of their journey. At that time, he was about to leave the Army after 14 happy years. He started the expedition for fun, to find purpose in his life, and to discover who he really was outside the Army. ""I had always thought I would spend my whole life in the Army. I had been offered a promotion, but suddenly I wanted to see who Charles Blackmore really was. It was a big risk. My wife, Tina, was very worried that I wouldn’t return since no one had ever completed that route; we went into it without knowing what to expect. In the end, it took 59 days to cross from west to east, and the desert was surprisingly good to us.""

Anyone reading his remarkable account will be surprised by the word ""good."" The team faced terrible hardships: dysentery, extreme temperatures, severe thirst, and losing part of their precious water supply. ""But,"" Blackmore explains, ""when we were at our limits and the camels had gone without water for seven days, we found some. We didn’t experience the desert's famous sandstorms, and we never faced the freezing cold that could have stopped us completely. That doesn’t mean we weren’t constantly facing challenges. The fine sand got into everything, especially blisters and wounds. Climbing the high dunes was torture for us and for the heavily loaded camels, which often rolled over onto us.""

""What pushed me forward more than anything was the need to survive. We had no backup plan. Our budget and time didn’t allow for one. No aircraft ever flew over us. Once we entered the sandhills, we were completely on our own. I knew I had the mental strength for the trip, but I was very scared about my physical ability. I remember the first day — we sat at the edge of the desert, and it was so hot that it was hard to breathe. I thought, 'We have to start now!' At that moment, I was very scared.""

If it was tough at the beginning, how did they feel at the end? ""After walking for 1,000 kilometers, you’re not going to quit. You’ve endured so much; you have come so far. We were very thin but also very strong despite our exhaustion. My body was fit, and my legs felt powerful. I could walk over anything.""

Midway through the book, Blackmore describes lying in the desert, looking up at a full moon and thinking of his family. How aware was he of the struggle it must have been for them? ""Inside me, there’s someone trying to find peace. When I have doubts about myself now, I think back to the image of the desert and remember that we managed to complete that journey. I feel prouder of that expedition than of anything else I’ve done. Yet, when I think of my life’s achievements, I think of my family and the happiness we share — by that measure, the desert doesn’t compare.""

Has Charles Blackmore found peace? ""I long for the challenge — for the open spaces — the excitement of it all. We were motivated by a sense of purpose. Now, I find it hard to fit into the sameness of modern life."""

Susan Harr decides to unplug her gadgets and enjoy manual work. Many people love technology because it provides us with amazing devices that make life easier and give us more free time. However, this reliance on technology has made us forget how to appreciate simple tasks. For example, after a frustrating experience with a broken word processor that cost a lot to fix, Susan began to question whether gadgets are really worth the trouble.

She started to let go of some household technology as it broke down. This made her think about what ""time"" technology actually gives us. Does it just allow us to do more things that require even more gadgets? Susan feels that marketing tricks us into believing we need these devices. When her broken gadget started making strange noises, she left it outside, feeling relieved to be free from the noise and distraction of machines.

While there are some gadgets she values, like her washing machine, she found joy in giving up others. For instance, after feeling that they were spending too much time in front of the television, she returned their rented color TV and switched to a small black-and-white one. This change encouraged them to spend more time walking their dog, reading, talking, and enjoying hobbies. Susan took up sewing by hand after her old sewing machine became a plant table. 

People often think they cannot live without technology, but Susan believes that life was not always so dependent on it. Computers do many tasks for us, but she finds that sewing by hand is enjoyable and relaxing. She can listen to the radio or talk with family while sewing, and she feels good about being productive. 

Sewing by hand gives her a sense of satisfaction and allows her to slow down. She no longer feels the need to rush from one task to another. Doing the dishes has also become a pleasant activity where she can daydream. Now, she looks around her home and wonders if they really need all their gadgets, like the freezer or microwave. She realizes they could save a lot of money by living without some of these electric devices."

Charles Hurst is a cabinet-maker who creates beautifully crafted furniture. Joanna Watt meets him in his workshop, located under a railway arch in East London. When I arrive, he greets me quickly with a handshake and says, ""Well, fire away then!"" It’s hard to tell if he is really in a hurry or just acting tough. Looking around the workshop, I see that he is indeed busy, with many unfinished pieces of furniture and wooden planks in various natural colors.

Hurst has been a cabinet-maker for ten years and has a great reputation. His order book is always full for months ahead, even though he doesn’t advertise himself. People know that if they want a good cupboard, table, bookcase, or kitchen units, Hurst is the right person to contact. While it’s not hard to find a furniture-maker, it is more difficult to find one who focuses on making well-crafted furniture with clean, simple designs. Hurst says, ""There are few real cabinet-makers now. Many call themselves furniture-makers.""

As a craftsman with high standards, Hurst often feels disappointed by modern furniture. He is shocked by what some furniture-makers produce and saddened by what people accept. His desire for perfection is a big part of his success, along with his talent. Hurst is confident about his skills. He states, ""I have a huge natural ability. I have always been good at making things."" Towards the end of our conversation, he becomes more modest, which makes me question how serious he is about his confidence.

Hurst is self-taught. When I ask how he learned his craft, he replies, ""I asked the right questions and picked it all up."" Most of his work comes from private clients, and some return to him multiple times. He enjoys doing complete projects for their homes. However, he admits that not all client relationships are easy. He finds it frustrating when clients don’t know what they want until it’s too late, but he appreciates clients who have clear expectations.

Although Hurst has reasons to be proud, he also acknowledges others' talents. He says, ""There are people far better than me. I can admire other people."" He notes that he wasn’t trained at Parnham, a top furniture design college. He criticizes craftsmen who try to be artists and take too long to make one piece. He also dislikes degree shows where students showcase their work while trying to make fashion statements, which he finds pretentious. He believes furniture should be practical and useful.

Despite his confidence and direct manner, Hurst is not pretentious. As I leave, he reminds me, ""After all, I am only making furniture,"" showing a humble attitude towards his work."
CAE_49,"**Three Theories About Sleep**

People spend about one-third of their lives sleeping. This suggests that sleep is very important. However, scientists do not fully agree on why we need to sleep. There are three main theories.

The first and most popular theory says that sleep is mainly for our physical health. It suggests that while we sleep, our bodies work to repair any damage from the day and to help us feel better.

The second theory focuses on learning. It claims that sleep helps us process the information we learn during the day. According to this theory, without sleep, we would not be able to learn effectively.

The third theory is about energy. It states that we need to sleep to recharge our energy, so we are ready for the next day."
CAE_31,"**ECCENTRICS**

An eccentric is someone whose behavior is unusual and does not follow the accepted norms of society. This raises the question, ""What is normal?"" Most of us have our own quirks and peculiarities. It could be a love for entering newspaper contests, a habit of collecting beer mats, or a tendency to write angry letters to the press about various topics. Eccentricity is a way of expressing our individuality. 

Inside us, there is often a struggle between two opposing forces. One is called individualism, which encourages us to be unique, and the other is conformity, which pushes us to fit in. For many, the desire to be accepted and liked by others is stronger than the desire to stand out and be different. 

People with unusual hobbies or strong opinions often come together. They form clubs, hold meetings, and organize events to share their interests or concerns. The key idea here is 'common.' They seek others who understand what their friends and family might see as odd. Being part of a group, even a small one, can be comforting.

Most of us feel a tension between individualism and conformity. While we may follow the crowd, we often resist the idea that we are doing so. We feel a need to show our individuality, like when a man at a bar declares, ""I say what I think,"" or when a newcomer insists, ""You must take me as I am."" 

At any moment, we can choose to embrace our individuality. Many people succeed in their careers by doing just that. For instance, Bob Dylan, the American singer, has said, ""When you feel strongly about what you are doing and pursue it with determination, you will surprise many people."" However, this assertion of individuality is not the same as eccentricity, especially in the beginning. 

When a pop singer wears strange clothes for attention, or a socialite makes shocking comments to be noticed, that is not eccentricity. But if they continue these behaviors until they become part of who they are, then they may be considered eccentric. The key aspect of eccentricity is its naturalness. Eccentrics do not try to be odd; they simply are. 

A true eccentric is not focused on what others think. They act according to their true selves. This sets eccentrics apart from enthusiasts, pranksters, clever criminals, attention-seekers, and recluses. These individuals are aware of society and often react to it. Some want to impress others, while others want to escape from society. In contrast, eccentrics live their lives freely, regardless of societal expectations."
CAE_58,"**Natural Books**

We asked four well-known naturalists to share the wildlife book that has influenced them the most.

**A. Geoffrey Lean**  
Choosing the author was easy for me. As an environmental journalist, I have had the chance to meet many important figures in this field. Among them, Barbara Ward stands out. She has been central to environmental issues in Europe after the war. She combined her experiences from various environmental movements into a powerful philosophy. As a young journalist, I found that she helped me understand these complex topics better than anyone else. Choosing her book was more difficult. It could have been *Only One Earth* or *Progress for a Small Planet*, but I believe her most important work is *The Home of Man*. Although its title seems old-fashioned, it focuses on the rapid growth of cities and addresses major themes she cared about. It is a passionate call for what we now call ""sustainable human development."" I have read many books since, but none compare to it.

**B. Linda Bennett**  
When I read *Signals for Survival* by Niko Tinbergen, I can hear the calls of herring gulls and remember the smell of guano in the sun. This book wonderfully explains the fascinating world of animal communication through words and pictures. After reading it, watching a gull colony transforms from chaos to a well-organized social structure. You can see which birds are partners and recognize families later in the season. Niko Tinbergen was a distinguished behaviorist who wanted to share his findings with everyone. His collaboration with talented wildlife artist Eric Ennion made this book special and interesting for anyone who loves wildlife. Ennion's paintings, created from years of observing birds, show how one gull can be aggressive while another is calm. This is the work of a true naturalist.

**C. Lee Durrell**  
The book that has influenced me the most is *My Family and Other Animals* by Gerald Durrell. This book not only led me to a wonderful husband and a career in conservation but also defined my love for the natural world. I was studying animal sounds in Madagascar when I first read it. After two years of challenges, opening this book made my world brighter. It beautifully connects animals, people, joy, and beauty—a small version of a world worth saving. Many believe humans are the worst because of the harm we have caused to other species. However, I remember Gerald as a boy in this book, viewing all living beings as a family, regardless of their nature. This is a concept we all need to understand.

**D. Bruce Pearson**  
I discovered *The Shell Bird Book* by James Fisher in my school library shortly after it was published in 1966. I was immediately attracted to it, especially the 48 colorful bird illustrations by Eric Ennion. These images caught my attention. I already had other bird books and had spent holidays learning to identify birds. They inspired me to start sketching what I saw. However, *The Shell Bird Book* offered much more. Along with the beautiful illustrations, it included chapters on bird migration, the history of birds in Britain, and even a chapter on birds in music, literature, and art. The wide range of information and exciting images encouraged me to appreciate birds and nature more broadly. The book showed me that my emotional and creative connection to nature is just as important as a scientific one. Since art was my stronger subject, I began to see new possibilities for myself."
CAE_37,"**Text: DO REVIEWS SELL BOOKS?**

We asked five leading British publishers about how book reviews affect sales. Here is what they said.

**Publisher A**  
Reviews are very important for publishers; they are the first thing we look at in newspapers. A study by the Book Marketing Council showed that many people said they bought a book because of reviews, more than any other reason like ads or recommendations from friends. Authors feel differently about reviews. Both authors and publishers are upset when there are no reviews, but publishers are usually more accepting of bad reviews. They believe that any mention in the press can help sales, as readers will want to form their own opinions. Publishers enjoy reviews that match their own views of a book since they often read it first.

**Publisher B**  
Publishers and newspapers both care about book reviews, but they have different needs. Newspapers want to entertain their readers, while publishers want their books to be reviewed positively. Book reviews today are more varied and less exclusive than they were 40 years ago. However, there is still a tendency to overlook paperbacks, which most people read. Weekly summaries of books are often not enough, and original paperbacks rarely get serious attention. Still, publishers need reviews because they are a cost-effective way to promote a book and its author. A good review from a trusted source can boost sales, especially if there are multiple positive reviews. Fame helps get books into readers' hands.

**Publisher C**  
Reviews are essential for literary publishing; without them, we would struggle. Our books are usually not by well-known authors, and we rarely advertise, so we rely on literary editors to give our books space. Good reviews are much more valuable than ads because readers trust them. Publishers often say they care more about the size of the review than its content. The impact of reviews on sales is complex. Good reviews can launch a book and a career, but they need to be supported by other factors like word-of-mouth recommendations and effective marketing.

**Publisher D**  
I wish I understood the relationship between publishing and reviewing in Britain! In the U.S., a single review in the New York Times can make or break a book. Here, bookshops often ignore reviews. Sometimes, it takes many years of great reviews for a good writer to gain readers. Interestingly, some poorly reviewed books become bestsellers. The situation is unpredictable, but non-fiction reviews often focus more on the reviewer’s knowledge than on the book itself.

**Publisher E**  
All publishers and writers hope for great reviews. But do they actually sell books? I once published a biography that received excellent reviews, but it didn’t sell well because people felt they could just read the reviews instead of buying the book. Does the reviewer’s name matter? Thirty years ago, if certain reviewers praised a book, people paid attention. Today, it can also be the unexpected reviewer or the creativity of the review that encourages buyers to visit the bookstore."
CAE_2,"**Text: WEATHERVANE MAKER**

The craft of making weathervanes is very old, dating back to ancient Egypt. Today, Graham Smith runs a workshop where he continues this tradition. He is one of the few people in the country who makes weathervanes by hand. Graham creates unique designs based on what his customers want. He says, ""This way, I can make a special item just for them."" Many of his customers are women looking for unique gifts for their husbands, often reflecting their interests in work or hobbies.

Graham's work is different from the traditional cockerel design, which is the most common type of weathervane. The first weathervane he made was a witch on a broomstick, which surprised his wife. Friends liked it and asked him to make weathervanes for them. He realized there were endless possibilities for designs. 

Graham decided to focus on making weathervanes. He had trained as a precision engineer and worked in that field for 15 years. Then, he and his wife, Liz, switched roles: she became the main breadwinner while he took care of their children and built his business. This change happened five years ago, and he has no regrets. He enjoys the artistic side of his work, saying, ""This is exciting and creative.""

Graham has created over 100 original designs. He pays close attention to detail and always gets customer approval on the design before he starts cutting. He also keeps traditional designs available because they are still popular. ""People like handmade items,"" he notes. ""They want something a bit different.""

Graham does not plan to expand his business because he wants to keep it a rural craft. He feels he has found his niche in the market. ""People appreciate the uniqueness, and I love transforming a simple shape into something that looks lifelike,"" he explains. 

For centuries, weathervanes have helped communities understand the weather by showing changes in wind direction. Nowadays, as more people move to the countryside, they want to add special touches to their homes, which has helped crafts like his. Graham is now busier than ever, sending weathervanes to customers around the world, especially in America and Denmark. He says, ""The price depends on how detailed the design is."" His latest request was for a curly-coated dog. No matter the occasion, Graham can create a unique gift."
CAE_68,"**Text: 'Beginner Takes All'**

Before it was even published, *The Horse Whisperer* was the most talked-about book of the year. This first novel by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans made him a lot of money. Here, he shares his inspiration and success.

The beginning of the year was tough for Nicholas Evans, who worked as a screenwriter, producer, and wanted to be a director. Things started badly when a film project he had been working on, called *Life and Limb*, fell apart suddenly. He felt disappointed and worried because it had been two years since he earned any money, and that film was his only hope to keep the bank manager calm.

A sensible person in Evans' situation would have found a job. He could have returned to his previous work in television or started a new television project. Instead, he made a choice that many, including himself, thought was crazy. He bought a ticket to America and spent three months researching his first novel. Although he acted on impulse, the idea for the story had been in his mind for a while. It was inspired by a farrier he met while visiting a friend in Dartmoor. The farrier told him about a gentle horse that suddenly became aggressive for no reason. Its owners were desperate until they heard about a gypsy who could calm the horse just by talking to it. These people were called ""horse whisperers."" 

Evans became fascinated and began to research the topic, initially planning to write a screenplay since he was a filmmaker. However, after feeling disillusioned with the film industry, he decided to write the story as a book. Throughout the spring, he traveled across the US, visiting ranches and learning about horses and the people who work with them. ""It was a strange time,"" he recalls. ""I was observing people, but I felt very alone and thought my life was falling apart. I had tried for ten years to succeed as a filmmaker, and now I was in debt and worried about how to support my family.""

By the end of August, after returning home and writing the first half of the book, he felt the pressure from the bank manager. He needed to know if it was worth continuing. He bravely showed the manuscript to a friend who was a literary agent. The agent read it and said it was ""fine."" When asked for an estimate, he suggested Evans might receive $30,000 as an advance for the book. Evans had a specific amount in mind to pay off some debts, and it was more than that. He had spent seven months on *The Horse Whisperer*, with at least two more months of work ahead. The $30,000 figure was challenging. He was also advised to write a 12-page summary of the rest of the book.

In October, he sent the first two hundred pages of the novel, along with the summary, to seven UK publishers just before they left for the famous Frankfurt Book Fair. Within days, his agent called to say he had turned down the first offer of $75,000. ""What?"" Evans replied. The agent felt something big was about to happen.

What followed became a significant moment in publishing history. Within a week of competitive bidding, the novel was sold to Transworld Publications in the UK for £550,000 and to Delacorte in the US for $3.15 million, both record amounts for a first novel. ""We couldn't believe it; we were in shock. We hadn't even sent the manuscript to New York, and we still don't know how it got there,"" Evans said. They also didn't send it to Hollywood, but soon major studios were competing for the film rights. ""My UK agent wisely involved an agent in the US, and when he called to say, 'I think we can get $3 million outright,' we laughed in disbelief."" 

As they agreed to this amount, the studios each wanted to present their case to Evans. One night in October, he sat in his study while four prominent filmmakers called one after another, eager to pay $3 million for an unfinished novel. Evans shared this story with me over coffee on his porch overlooking his garden. He mentioned that he had turned down an offer to write the screenplay for *The Horse Whisperer*. ""It's been like a fairy tale so far. I don't want to ruin it. Writing at that level is very challenging, and I don't want to become just an employee of these people I like who have paid me so much. I would hate to write a draft and then hear, 'Thanks, Nick, but now we’ll bring in someone else.'""

He said he would stay involved but from a distance. The success of his novel led to new support for *Life and Limb*, but he was unsure if he wanted to make it anymore. ""I think it would be foolish not to write another novel,"" he said."

Bobby Fischer is facing challenges as he tries to return to chess. Chess has become more of a young person's game. After being away for 20 years, Fischer is back and playing against his old rival, Boris Spassky. He won the first game, which was impressive, but he is not the same player he was in 1972. Now, at 49 years old, he is out of practice and not in great shape. Spassky is even older. 

Chess has changed a lot in the last 20 years. Fischer helped make chess popular, leading to a new level of professionalism in the game. Today, winning is the main goal for chess players. In international chess, a player’s nerves and stamina are just as important as their intelligence. The pressure in chess has always been high, with a chess clock ensuring players make their moves in time. If they don’t, they lose immediately. Now, games can last longer, and many are played without breaks, increasing the pressure on players. 

In the last 30 years, each new world champion has been younger than the last. Currently, eight of the ten highest-ranked players are under 30. The way chess is played has also changed. Much preparation happens off the board, not just in psychological battles. Players must prepare seriously before matches, especially with the rise of computer databases that can store millions of chess games. In recent matches, players have used teams of assistants to find weaknesses in their opponents’ strategies. 

The opening moves of a game are now analyzed in great detail, and being well-prepared can be crucial. Today, there are more top players than ever before, with many grandmasters competing for modest prizes. Success in chess requires both physical and mental effort. A single game can last up to eight hours, and players must stay focused. A moment of distraction can lead to losing the game. The chess clock adds to the stress, especially during the final moments when players have only seconds to make their moves. 

In these intense moments, players must act quickly, showing skills that any athlete would admire. The game becomes a fierce battle where nerves and determination determine the winner. For top players, losing is very painful, while winning brings great satisfaction and a chance to recover from the stress. However, one win is not enough to win a tournament; players must be ready for the next challenge. Most chess tournaments last 9-11 days, with games played every day, and there are competitions throughout the year. World championship matches are even tougher. 

For example, the 1984 match between Anatoli Karpov and Gary Kasparov in Moscow had to be stopped after several months due to exhaustion, with Karpov losing about 10 kg. Can Fischer overcome these challenges? He once said, ""All I want to do is play chess."" This makes his departure from chess in 1972 seem even more puzzling. However, it also made him a legend. If he has returned for money, he is in a good position, as both he and Spassky will earn millions from their match. But if Fischer believes he can prove he is still the best player, the outcome could be very disappointing for him."

Imogen Edwards-Jones interviews some new British talents, from poets to pop stars, who are rising to fame.

**A** Nick Grosso, in his early 30s, has written three well-received plays. He is now turning his first play, *Peaches*, into a movie script. ""It's low budget, but we don't know how low,"" he says. ""It won't be over £30 million, but it could be as little as £30."" Remarkably, before writing *Peaches*, Nick had never seen or read a play. ""When I wrote it, I never thought it would be performed,"" he shares. ""It's set in a car, which I wouldn't do now because I understand the challenges."" He left school at 16 but returned a year later. After completing his A-levels, he joined the Young People's Theatre. ""I realized I wanted to write for actors. I wanted my work to be heard, not just read, because of its rhythm and rhyme,"" he explains. ""For the first time, I was around people who thought like me. It was a very enjoyable and stimulating environment.""

**B** Comedian Simon Pegg, 28, has made significant progress in his career since studying drama at Bristol University. He is currently writing a TV comedy series and has just completed a demanding tour with comedy star Steve Coogan. He has always worked hard, even during his time at Bristol, where he practiced his comedy in clubs. ""University was very theoretical,"" Simon recalls. ""It made me realize I didn't want to be a traditional actor; I was always more interested in comedy. People think comedy is the hardest job, but it really isn't. If you have courage and good material, making people laugh is wonderful."" He has performed with the comedy group Funny Business, but his collaboration with Steve Coogan has been the most successful. ""He saw my show, and since I was a big fan of his, he probably noticed I was imitating him,"" Simon admits.

**C** Ciaran McMenamin, 24, gained public attention as the lead in the series *The Young Person's Guide To Becoming A Rock Star*. The response was very positive, and his career has quickly taken off. ""It's been a great opportunity for me,"" he smiles. ""Now I can choose what I want to do, which is what I've always wanted."" This is a comfortable position, especially since he has just graduated. Looking back at his early career, it's clear that recognition was always likely. Encouraged by his mother, he moved from school plays to the Ulster Youth Theatre, where he spent four years. ""I was basically using acting to avoid homework,"" Ciaran laughs. ""But then I decided I wanted to pursue it seriously because I had a talent and passion for it."" Now, he is waiting for the praise to come in, but when asked about fame, he becomes thoughtful. ""At 18, you think you'll love the photos and interviews, but you soon realize that's not why you act. It's about earning respect for good work.""

**D** Neil Taylor, 25, is the lead singer of the pop band Matrix, which has just signed a three-album deal with Domino Records. Neil and his bandmate Rick Brown are expected to be successful when their single, *Chimera*, is released soon. ""The record company's idea of good sales is different from mine,"" he says. ""They want a hit, but for me, if two people buy it, I'll be happy."" Unlike many new pop stars, Neil has worked hard for his success. He left school at 16 and has been trying to enter the music industry ever since. ""It's funny how things happen,"" he says. ""I had been performing at student gigs for eight years and was starting to feel discouraged. Just when I was about to give up, I met Rick Brown, who had connections at Domino, and we formed Matrix. It couldn't have come at a better time. There were moments when I felt very down, and I was in some terrible bands, but hopefully, it will all be worth it.""

**E** Poet and author Stephen Richards is 27 years old and has received more awards and honors than many people twice his age. He is well-known in the poetry community, where he has been touring and giving readings several times a week for the past six years. His first novel, *Hidden*, will be published in March. ""It's a story about obsessive love. It was a strong idea that I couldn't express as a poem."" Stephen loved creative writing in school but became disillusioned with education later. ""I chose not to go to university, but I became bored stuffing envelopes at a theater and decided to change that."" After university, he published his first work, a children's book, in 1992. ""I don't think my parents expected me to be a writer; they thought I would just be a reader because that's all I did as a child."" With his poetry receiving much praise, moving into novels is a bold step. ""Poetry has a structure, and there's less chance of making a big mistake,"" he explains. ""A novel can be any length, so there are more opportunities for poor writing. My main goal is to avoid falling into a routine where I produce work without caring about its quality."""

A. Isabel, the main character in this quirky novel, thinks she looks good in jeans but rarely wears them because she doesn't want to associate with the wrong people. She is a 31-year-old art student who loves historical romance novels and is looking for the right partner. She worries that her knobbly knees might hurt her chances. However, her hope helps her and others in the story. The author writes with great energy, using a style similar to early silent films, with chapter titles like ""Our Hero Feels Inspired.""

B. This story celebrates the rise and near-fall of a local radio station in America. It is told from the perspective of a smart, shy child named Francis With. Francis works at WLT (With Lettuce and Tomato) Radio, a station created by Roy and Ray Soderbjerg to promote their sandwich shop. The station broadcasts a mix of singers, preachers, soap-opera stars, and announcers. The small-town setting allows the author to use dry humor and simple writing, taking readers back to the gentler times of the 1940s and 1950s, filled with dime stores, old cars, and radios.

C. In the author's world, it is normal for a second husband to talk with his wife's first husband. When professor Richard Vaisey falls for a beautiful Russian poet, he shares his feelings with his wife's ex-husband. The poet writes bad poetry, which bothers Richard, and she is also trying to get his help for her wrongly imprisoned brother. However, the way the author resolves these issues is even more interesting. He moves the story forward with a strong sense of humor and carefully examines relationships, making it a fun and clever read.

D. In 1960s London, two sets of best friends—two women and two men—become connected for 25 years through life and death. At the beginning of this long novel, James Hudson, a mysterious American businessman, is starting a newspaper, which his friend Richard Blake is editing. The newspaper launch is important, but so is the fact that the woman they both loved (and one of them married) was killed years ago. The story includes murder, ambition, love, and jealousy, all written well. This book allows readers to really get to know the characters and become deeply involved in their lives.

E. This touching and funny story, written by a top American author, follows Ian Bedloe, who feels guilty about a past mistake. To make up for it, he becomes a 'father' to his brother's three orphaned children. At 40, he is slowly becoming an eccentric bachelor while dealing with everyday life. The story explores many emotions and highlights the special bond Ian forms with the youngest child, Daphne. It is a warm book that perfectly balances sadness and humor."
CAE_53,"**Volunteer Tourism**

Four academic writers discuss international voluntary work. 

A. It is difficult to say that volunteer tourists make a significant direct contribution to development. While they may help build homes or schools, they often pay a large fee to participate in this work. This money, if given directly to a local community, could pay for more labor than the individual volunteer could provide. This is particularly true for gap year volunteers, who usually have little technical skill or professional experience. Therefore, many studies raise the question of whether gap year volunteering is mainly driven by a desire to help others or if young people are more interested in gaining experience that will benefit their careers. However, these projects may help develop individuals who will act ethically in favor of those who are less fortunate in their future careers.

B. Volunteering can lead to better international understanding, improved conflict resolution skills, active participation in global issues through civic organizations, and the growth of international social networks among everyday people. In this case, the overall benefits for both volunteers and host communities can contribute to the greater good. However, if volunteering is mostly done by wealthy individuals from richer parts of the world, it may provide them with a broader perspective and career advantages, but it will not significantly help those who lack access to international volunteer opportunities. Volunteers may continue to benefit personally while using host organizations and communities to advance their own goals.

C. At its worst, international volunteering can be seen as a form of imperialism or self-serving charity, where wealthy Westerners seek personal development. At its best, it can provide benefits to both volunteers and the organizations they work with, allowing for the exchange of skills, knowledge, and cultural experiences in developing communities. Most importantly, volunteering can raise awareness and foster a lifelong commitment to addressing issues of inequality, poverty, injustice, and unsustainable development.

D. Volunteer tourism aligns with the growing trend of personal strategies to help others. These limited strategies, focused on making a small difference, can seem positive in a climate that is often anti-political. The personal aspect appears beneficial as it avoids large government and business involvement. However, it also overlooks the need for representative government and reduces development to individual acts of charity, which often do not address the deeper issues faced by poor, rural communities. While skepticism about volunteering is often misplaced, volunteer tourism can sometimes be seen as simple charity. However, when it is promoted as sustainable development and when gap-year companies market their programs as such, it reflects a decline in the understanding of development issues. The politics of volunteer tourism can indicate a retreat from recognizing global inequalities and the poverty experienced by many in developing countries."
CAE_55,"**Text: Sound the Alarm**

Stuart Harris reports that many people listen to the radio in the morning and need something to help them get out of bed. This is why clock radios are popular. But how do you choose a good one? A panel, including myself, inventor Tom Granger, and broadcaster Paul Bridges, tested five models currently available.

One model has a 'dual alarm function' that I thought would let you wake up with a buzzer, snooze, and then wake up again. However, the instructions say to use it for setting two different wake-up times: one for weekdays and one for weekends. But who really plans their life like that? This model costs about the same as another we tested, but it includes a cassette player, which is a nice feature. You can listen to your favorite tapes to fall asleep and wake up to a quiet morning. We all agreed the radio quality was excellent, but it was quite large—about the size of a rugby ball. Paul Bridges mentioned that any clock radio he buys must leave enough space on his bedside table for his keys, wallet, glasses, and phone. He also said he always books a wake-up call just in case the alarm fails.

This model was voted the best overall. Paul Bridges said he was 'in love with it,' even though the clock he tested kept getting stuck at 16:00. I found the digital display attractive, with grey numbers on a soft green background. The wide snooze button is easy to tap even with your eyes closed. However, the smooth buttons made me want to touch them like piano keys, which led to confusion when I finally looked at the instruction booklet. The clock has a backup battery, so you don’t have to reset it if someone accidentally unplugs it. Everyone liked this feature, but we all found it tricky to set up. Still, once we figured it out, we felt quite sophisticated.

Tom Granger described another model, which has a built-in lamp, as 'unbelievably tacky.' He had to pull the light out of its socket to make it work, which made him question the quality of the rest of the clock. He read the instructions twice before getting it to work, as the clock kept jumping from 12:00 to 02:00. The lamp was difficult to position; it only lit up the clock, which was already illuminated. Paul Bridges found the lamp idea amusing but agreed that tuning the radio was hard. The buzzer sounded like an alarm on a submarine, making me want to throw it across the room. Interestingly, this model is the third most popular on the market. Aimed at young people, it has bright colors and a fun strap, appealing to the child in both Tom Granger and me. Tom said he would choose this one because it stands out more than the others. It was also the only model we could set up without reading the instructions, thanks to its traditional controls. Unfortunately, the alarm has a funny 20-minute error margin; the manual says it may sound about 10 minutes earlier or later than set. Paul Bridges laughed at this, calling the model 'terribly fiddly' and 'completely useless.'

The simplest and cheapest model we tested scored points with Tom Granger because it was 'very standard and took up little space,' and it had old-fashioned dial tuning. He said it was easier to set up. With modern push-button tuning, you can never be sure if you pressed the buttons correctly, which makes you doubt if it will work. However, he acknowledged that manufacturers had to improve radio quality because of button-tuning. I thought the tuning was a bit rough, as did Paul Bridges, but we agreed the radio quality was good. The buzzer on this model worked well; it got me out of bed in just two beeps!"
CAE_50,"**Hedgehogs**

A hedgehog is a small mammal known for the sharp spines that cover its body. Hedgehogs are found in many parts of the world, but none are native to America or Australia. All hedgehog species can roll into a tight ball when threatened, with their spines pointing outward. The effectiveness of this defense depends on how many spines the hedgehog has. Some desert hedgehogs have adapted to their environment and have fewer spines, making them more likely to run away from danger instead of rolling up, using their ball-rolling ability only as a last option.

Hedgehogs are mainly active at night and sleep during most of the day, often hiding under bushes or in burrows. Although all hedgehogs can hibernate, not all do; some will remain awake throughout the year if conditions are suitable."
CAE_25,"**Text: Great Sportswomen on a Winning Streak**

Excelling in any sport is challenging, even for men, but women often face even greater difficulties. Training and competing leave little time for a normal life, requiring many sacrifices. Despite these challenges, women are overcoming prejudice and setting new records. Here, we highlight some remarkable British sportswomen who are achieving their goals.

A. **Jill, 27, Skier**  
""It's an amazing feeling to soar through the air and land smoothly, but it can be frightening. Sometimes I feel unwell or the weather is bad, making it hard to see, but I push through. Having a career outside of skiing is tough because we train for ten months each year. I have to give up much of my social life and time with friends, but it was my choice. There are six men and three women on the British team, and we all compete on the same courses and receive equal treatment—it's a young sport.""

B. **Caroline, 22, Cyclist**  
""Two years ago, I borrowed a bike to join a charity race and surprisingly won because I cycled faster than everyone else, even though I had never cycled before! I earn a good salary as a professional cyclist, and there are many opportunities for endorsements. However, I worry that people might think I succeeded because of my looks rather than my skills. So, I focus on cycling instead of making money. I train for at least four hours daily on the bike, along with stretching, swimming, and running. My boyfriend is also a cyclist, so he understands the commitment required.""

C. **Annabel, 26, Rower**  
""Rowing is difficult for girls to start because few schools offer it. Most girls begin at 19 or 20, making it harder to compete internationally. Additionally, coaches often change frequently, leading to a lack of stability in the women's team. Despite these challenges, I enjoy it and love staying fit, plus there’s a good social aspect.""

D. **Ffyona, 24, Long-Distance Walker**  
""When I was 13, I dreamed of walking around the world, not realizing how vast it was! I found Britain too confining and safe. I was very determined and disliked being controlled. Each walk has been unique. My walk across Australia was the most painful experience, covering 50 miles a day with little sleep and many blisters. But I set a record! I had to, as my sponsorship money would run out after 95 days. Some men believe women are more likely to fail, making them hesitant to sponsor us.""

E. **Lisa, 26, Saloon Car Racer**  
""Some men have big egos when driving, which is evident on the roads. When I perform well, they often ignore me. Being a woman has its challenges; men often think they must beat me, leading to many tough moments. You need to be competitive and assertive. It's hard to earn money, and what I do make goes back into racing. Women have been racing since the 1920s and have often been seen as unusual. It's encouraging to see more women joining the sport each year. For me, the thrill of saloon car racing lies in striving for perfection and achieving the perfect lap.""

F. **Alison, 28, Triathlete**  
""I wake up at 5:30 three mornings a week to swim. I need Tuesday and Thursday mornings to catch up on sleep. In the evenings, I cycle or run. Yes, I sometimes fall asleep at my desk! There’s a lot of nervousness before races, and I really push myself—if I don’t, I feel bad. I’ve often wondered why I do this. The answers are: a) I feel happier when I stay fit, b) I would be lazy if I didn’t push myself, and c) racing is very social. Men and women usually compete together, but when events are covered in the media, 90% of the focus is on the men's events, with only 10% mentioning the women's results. The prize money is also less for women. However, we have now established an International Triathlon Women's Commission to address these issues."""
CAE_34,"**Simplified Text:**

Richard Cork remembers the day he met Picasso when he was 78 years old. Even from a distance, he could easily recognize Picasso, who was having lunch at an outdoor restaurant in Cannes. At that time, I was an 18-year-old student traveling around Europe and Morocco in an old van. I had run out of money and found a job painting boats by the waterfront. However, I spent a lot of time drawing and was lucky to have my sketchbook with me when I saw Picasso.

Picasso was known to be a private person who usually stayed away from others to work. So, I was surprised to see him sitting at a table with his wife, Jacqueline, and some friends. Without my friend's encouragement, I would not have had the courage to approach him for his signature. To my surprise, he agreed. He wrote his name at the top of the page and then added a lively drawing below it. Although Picasso's art was often abstract, it usually connected to real things, so his lines might have represented a cloud, the sea, or the shape of Cannes harbor.

I thanked him and started a nervous conversation. Since Picasso's English was not very good and my French was worse, an American woman at the table helped translate. She kept calling him ""the Maestro,"" which made it hard for me to speak. Still, I managed to tell Picasso how much I loved art and admired his work. After a while, I went back to my boat and proudly showed my friend what I had. But he noticed that Picasso was still having lunch and said, ""Is that all? Why don’t you go back and take advantage of this opportunity? He probably wouldn’t mind if you drew his portrait.""

With my sketchbook in hand, I returned to Picasso's table. I thought it was best not to ask if I could draw him, as he might say no. Instead, I stood by the table, set my pad against a screen, took out a crayon, and began to draw. When Picasso saw me, he smiled playfully and made it hard for me to draw by acting silly—rolling his eyes, sticking out his tongue, and making funny shapes with his hands. His playful behavior felt like a challenge, and I didn’t want to give up. Despite his antics, I felt he was testing my determination.

Eventually, Picasso settled down and allowed me to study him closely. He looked strong and alert, wearing a blue-and-white striped shirt. He seemed much younger than his age, with bright, dark eyes that were full of life. I was amazed by how youthful he looked, with very few wrinkles on his face. His eyes were captivating, and I tried to capture their intensity in my drawing. Even though he was surrounded by friends, he seemed distant and absorbed in his own thoughts. 

When the American woman told me that Picasso wanted to see my portrait, I felt shy and said it wasn’t good enough. However, Picasso insisted, and when I showed him my sketch, he nodded approvingly. Then, to my surprise, he said it was his turn to draw. I quickly gave him my crayon, and he made a few quick strokes on the paper. In seconds, he drew a face that was very different from my careful work. He had moved one of my eyes onto my nose and captured my smile with a single, lively line. I looked like a character from one of his playful artworks.

I thanked Picasso and asked if he would sign my drawing. The American woman explained that he said I already had his signature. So, there were limits to his generosity! Still, I feel very lucky to have met Picasso and to have received his attention. It meant a lot to me."
CAE_12,"**Text: Shopping Strategies**

Have you ever gone into a store and ended up buying more than you planned? This text explains the techniques that shops use to encourage you to spend more money.

**A. Freshness Appeal**  
Supermarkets know that customers value fresh food. To create this impression, they often place fruits and vegetables at the entrance or display house plants. They might also have a bakery that fills the store with the smell of fresh bread. The colors in the store, like green, are chosen to suggest freshness, even though most items sold, like frozen foods and cleaning products, do not fit this image.

**B. Smart Product Placement**  
The arrangement of products in a store is crucial for sales. Supermarkets use technology to find out which areas attract the most shoppers. They place high-profit items in these spots. Products at eye level are especially sought after by manufacturers. Special bins with discounts attract bargain hunters, and items that go well together, like desserts next to ice cream, are often placed near each other.

**C. Spreading Essentials**  
Supermarkets often place low-cost essentials like bread and sugar far from the entrance. This way, shoppers pass by more expensive items on their way. Stores may also put popular products at the back, hoping that loyal customers will search for them and encounter other tempting items along the way.

**D. Less is More**  
Chain stores have changed how they display their products. For example, the Next chain has moved away from a crowded display style to a more boutique-like approach, showcasing fewer items to create a sense of exclusivity. Their success comes from both good design and appealing clothing.

**E. Total Costs Matter**  
Shoppers tend to focus more on the total cost of their shopping rather than the price of individual items. Supermarkets mix low-cost staples with higher-priced items, so not everything is cheap. They often sell some items at a loss to attract customers, known as ""loss leaders."" They also get discounts from manufacturers by buying in bulk or promoting certain products.

**F. Price Tags**  
In chain stores, customers usually buy fewer items and pay more attention to prices. For example, pricing a blouse at £14.99 instead of £15 can make a difference. This strategy also helps reduce theft, as employees must ring up sales to give change.

**G. Effective Lighting**  
Both supermarkets and chain stores carefully consider lighting. Chain stores aim for natural light to show the true colors of clothing, while supermarkets use special lighting to highlight fresh foods.

**H. Store Layout**  
Many chain stores use different carpet patterns to guide shoppers. One pattern shows the main paths, while another marks sales areas. This design encourages shoppers to explore, although some may hesitate to leave the main paths. For example, Marks and Spencer use wood or marble for main routes to lead shoppers to more inviting carpet in sales areas.

**I. In-Store Advertising**  
As you enter a supermarket, large colorful images of delicious food catch your eye, especially if you are hungry. In the U.S., some supermarkets are testing ""video trolleys"" that display ads while you shop. These trolleys use sensors to show relevant ads as you pass certain products, aiming to increase impulse purchases by about 30%."
CAE_26,"**Text: Sea, Ice & Rock**

Chris Bonnington, aged 58, is famous for climbing Mount Everest in 1985. He has also created new climbing routes in Britain and the Alps and has written several books, such as *Quest for Adventure* and *Everest the Hard Way*. Robin Knox-Johnston, who is 53, started his career at sea in the Merchant Navy. In 1968-1969, he became the first person to sail around the world alone in his yacht, Sunhaili. He also set a record for crossing the Atlantic Ocean, taking just 10 days to sail from New York to the Lizard in England. 

Chris and Robin worked together to sail and climb in Greenland, documenting their journey in their new book, *Sea, Ice and Rock*. In 1979, while I was working on *Quest for Adventure*, I called Robin for an interview. He invited me to join him for a sailing trip. I could teach him some climbing skills, and he could teach me the basics of sailing. It was my first experience on a yacht. We sailed for a while and then anchored. Robin's wife and daughter stayed on the boat while we paddled to shore to practice climbing. The route was challenging, but I was impressed by how steady Robin was in difficult conditions. 

When we reached a steep drop, I asked Robin if he had ever climbed before. He hadn’t, so I showed him how to do it. After I finished, he politely asked if he could descend using the ropes from his boat. He was used to using his arms, while I wanted him to use his legs. I was a bit worried, but he managed to lower himself safely. During that trip to Skye, Robin and I formed a strong friendship. His suggestion that we combine our skills for a trip to Greenland was a natural progression from our Skye adventure. 

I was very impressed by Robin as a leader. Normally, the captain makes all the decisions, but Robin consulted everyone first. Most of the time, people were hesitant to give advice, but it felt good to be part of the decision-making. To be honest, I found sailing quite challenging and boring. The moments of crisis were easier to handle because of the adrenaline rush, but spending days in the middle of the sea was tough for me. I prefer land and am not very handy. In contrast, Robin is a skilled sailor and enjoyed fixing the engine or repairing the toilet. I realized that Robin didn’t really need my help, which sometimes made me feel useless. 

The crew was also cramped, with six people on a 32-foot yacht meant for four. On a mountain expedition, you can get away from each other. When we arrived in Greenland and it was my turn to lead, I found it hard to take responsibility for Robin’s safety. There were many times when if Robin had fallen, he could have taken me down with him. I had to be very careful. I underestimated how difficult climbing the Cathedral, Greenland's highest mountain, would be. Robin is not a natural climber, which made his efforts even more impressive. 

The first time we tried to reach the top, we were active for 24 hours. On the way down, we were so tired that we almost fell asleep on steep slopes, 1,500 feet above the ground. Robin faced many challenges, but he completely trusted me and followed my lead. When it became too difficult and I realized we had to turn back, he accepted it. I knew Robin was also worried about the boat: whether it would make it through the ice and if it was still intact. However, he was eager to try climbing the mountain again. 

The only time we had a serious issue was on the yacht on the way home. We were taking turns keeping watch. I was supposed to wake up at 4 am for my shift, but Robin decided not to wake me, thinking he could handle it alone. The night before, I had almost fallen asleep. I felt he didn’t trust me, which made me feel insecure, and I expressed this to him. Robin quickly reassured me that I was misunderstanding the situation. While we enjoyed the trip to Skye, we truly got to know each other by the end of the Greenland expedition. I discovered that beneath his tough exterior, Robin was a kind and sensitive person."
CAE_8,"**A History of the Apple**

Apples have been part of human life for thousands of years, existing in many colors, shapes, and sizes. However, in the late twentieth century, we risk losing this rich heritage.

**Prehistoric Times (8,000 BC)**  
Humans have eaten apples since ancient times. In neolithic Britain, they discarded apple seeds. Around 10,000 years ago, they left apple remains near lakes in Switzerland and Italy. In these areas, early humans even stored dried apple halves for winter. These apples were wild crab apples, small and different from the apples we know today.

**Norman Influence (1000 AD)**  
The French learned advanced fruit-growing techniques from the Romans, which were further developed in monasteries. This knowledge, including cider-making, was brought to Britain. The dessert apple, Decio, was likely introduced by the Roman general, Etio. However, many Roman apple varieties did not thrive in Britain, and Norman varieties soon became more popular. British monks continued to experiment and create new apple varieties, which are the ancestors of most Western apples today.

**Medieval Favorites (1200)**  
During the thirteenth century, several apple types became common in Britain. The Old English Pearmain, noted in 1204 for its pear-like shape, was the main dessert apple until the eighteenth century. The Costard was a popular cooking apple sold in Oxford markets from 1296 until the late seventeenth century, giving rise to the term 'costermonger,' meaning a street seller of fruits and vegetables. However, the country faced challenges like droughts, the Black Death, and the Wars of the Roses, leading to fewer apples being produced and more being imported. This trend continued until the sixteenth century when King Henry VIII sent his chief fruit expert, Richard Harris, to France to learn about apple growing. Harris returned with many apple grafts, including the famous Pippins, and established the first modern orchard in Teynham, Kent.

**Settler Treasures (1750)**  
By the seventeenth century, apples were so popular in Britain that the first settlers to Canada, Australia, the US, South Africa, and New Zealand took apples and seeds with them, considering them valuable possessions. Captain Bligh of the Bounty brought apples to Australia, Jan van Riebeeck took them to South Africa, and the Pilgrim Fathers carried them to America. In North America, the well-known apple planter was John Chapman, or 'Johnny Appleseed.' Born in 1774, he planted apple nurseries from Pennsylvania to Indiana. Native Americans viewed him as a medicine man, and his love for apple trees and unique clothing inspired many folktales about him.

**Modern Delicious (1850)**  
Around this time, a Quaker farmer named Jesse Hiatt in Iowa discovered a new apple tree sprouting from a dead tree's roots. He named this apple 'Hawkey.' After presenting it at a fruit show, a judge tasted it and exclaimed, ""Delicious!"" In 1895, this apple was marketed as 'Delicious' and became one of the most widely grown apples globally.

**Granny Smith (1850)**  
Another famous apple, the Granny Smith, was found in Australia by Maria Anne Smith, the daughter of convicts. She was independent and worked as a midwife in Eastwood, New South Wales. Known as 'Granny Smith' for her role in managing the family farm, she discovered a small tree growing among discarded fruit in 1868. She transplanted it and soon harvested the first major crop of green apples, which became famous worldwide. When asked about the tree's origin, she remarked, ""It's just like God to make something useful out of what we think is rubbish,"" referring to both the apple and her own background.

**Uniformity Issues (1950)**  
Today, apples are grown worldwide, from northern India to Africa. However, most apples come from only a few commercial varieties, often chosen for their appearance or transportability rather than taste. This trend of uniformity is harming our taste and reducing genetic diversity. While amateur gardeners in the UK have preserved many old apple varieties, the US has lost most of its apples from a century ago. Fortunately, consumers are beginning to seek more variety. We cannot rely solely on amateur gardeners to preserve diversity in apples or other foods; we must advocate for a world that values and protects natural diversity for everyone's benefit."

CAE_30,"Text: Richard Nerurkar, a top long-distance runner from Britain, visits a high-altitude training camp in Kenya. Located ten miles south of the equator, a sunny mountain path leads from a quiet road in Nairobi. This path begins the journey up Mount Kenya, the country's highest peak. For the past three years, I have used Nanyuk as my base for winter training in Kenya's Central Highlands. However, I had never trained with Kenyan runners until my fourth winter trip. This time, I participated in my first race in Kenya and stayed at the national team training camp, where the best runners prepare for the World Cross-Country Team Championships. I was invited by the national team coach after finishing fifth in the World Championship 10,000 meters race, behind three Kenyans and a Moroccan. It was an opportunity I could not miss. Training at high altitude increases the number of red blood cells, which helps carry oxygen more effectively. This has contributed to the success of many Kenyan runners.

My first race in Africa was also significant because it was the first international cross-country race held on the continent, taking place in Nairobi. It was a humbling experience, as 41 runners finished ahead of me, with only three not being Kenyan. Despite this, I felt I had performed well. However, I believe that Kenyan success is not solely due to altitude. Kenyan runners have a straightforward approach to the sport. Their running style appears effortless, their diet is simple, and they enjoy competing. One important aspect of their success is their training methods, which I learned about during my time at the training camp.

The national team camp is located at St Mark's College, 6,200 feet up the southern slope of Mt Kenya, surrounded by beautiful fields and tropical plants. The facilities are basic, with athletes living among regular students in shared dormitories. Their daily routine includes three workouts: a relaxed morning run, interval training mid-morning, and a steady run in the late afternoon. Each day starts at six in the morning, with a briefing from the coaches. We were reminded to take it easy during the morning run because a tough workout awaited us. Each day, we covered about 40 kilometers, just short of a marathon distance. Sundays were different, with only one scheduled run of 20 kilometers, which was a welcome break from the usual routine.

Life at the camp was simple. A splash of water on the face and brushing teeth were enough for morning preparations. Breakfast included tea, bread, and boiled eggs in a small dining area. Lunch and dinner were similar, featuring ugali (a maize dish), stew, cabbage or spinach, and tea. After running, we would drive to bathe in streams fed by Mt Kenya's melting glaciers. By the end of my stay, I gained a deeper appreciation for Kenyan success. It cannot be explained by genetics, upbringing, or altitude alone. I began to think that the simplicity of life in the mountains, the hard training, and the passion for success might be the true reasons behind Kenya's dominance in distance running."
CAE_7,"**Simplified Text: 'The Challenges of Mass Marketing'**

Almost everyone knows that advertising is struggling. This issue is not just because of the recession; advertising started to decline in early 1989, before the recession really affected the economy. The problems with advertising are deeper and are happening all over the world. The sad truth is that advertising has not kept up with changes in the economy. Advertisers often think about large audiences and mass media, but as brands and media have increased, target markets have become smaller and more specific. Even campaigns for well-known brands should focus on smaller audiences, but they usually do not. This is a major reason why advertising is not working well.

Think about your own shopping habits. When you go to a supermarket, you might buy 30, 40, or even 50 items. Most of these items are not from advertised brands, and you may buy several of the same brand. In total, you probably only buy a few advertised brands from the thousands available in the store. Over a year, you are unlikely to buy more than a few hundred different brands. For durable goods, you might buy about a dozen a year. If you buy a new car, it is likely provided by your employer, and if not, you may only buy one every three years. You probably do not buy many clothes either, and most of them are not from advertised brands. Even when you consider all the different products and services, it is likely that you do not buy more than 400 different brands in a year. 

In comparison, there are about 32,500 branded goods and services that are advertised. If we ignore the 23,000 brands that spend less than £50,000 a year on advertising, we can focus on the 9,500 brands that are individually listed and analyzed. The average consumer buys only 400 of these 9,500 brands, and not all of these purchases are due to advertising. This means that about 4 percent of advertising is effective. 

When you watch TV, count how many commercials are for brands you buy or might buy in the future. Most people find that only about one in 16 commercials (6 percent) are relevant to them, meaning that the other 15 (94 percent) are likely wasted. Many people believe they are not influenced by advertising, but this is not true. The reality is that most people do not buy the brands they see advertised. 

There is always some waste in advertising because not every person who sees an ad will buy the product. People only remember a small number of ads and ignore the rest, so waste is unavoidable. However, this does not mean that advertising is not effective. Many ads have shown that they can work. Advertising needs to reach a large number of people to connect with the smaller group that will respond, as advertisers cannot know in advance who will be interested. 

Even with careful targeting, advertisers can reduce waste by reaching more people who will respond, but they can never know exactly who will. Unlike face-to-face selling, where a salesperson might succeed with every potential client, this is not possible with media advertising. If advertisers knew exactly who would respond, they would not need to use mass media at all; they could contact those individuals directly. 

Any advertiser who can gain one million new customers (about 2 percent of the adult population) is doing well. For popular products like soap powder, the top brands would be very happy with a million extra customers. Therefore, any advertising campaign that can attract 2 percent of the population would be considered very successful, and this is just a small part of the population. While mass media can be a cost-effective way to reach people, if advertising is to improve, it must focus more on specific audiences than ever before."

""Solar Survivor Charles Clover visits Britain's most eco-friendly home. Southwell, in Nottinghamshire, has some interesting features. The first is Southwell Minster, an ancient cathedral that is not well-known. It is admired by environmental writers for the 'green' men figures carved by medieval craftsmen in its thirteenth-century chapter house. The second feature is the 'autonomous house,' which is Britain's greenest home, designed and built by Robert and Brenda Vale. The Vales use rainwater for washing and drinking, recycle their sewage into compost for the garden, and heat their home using waste heat from electrical appliances and their own body heat, along with that of their three teenage children and two cats, Edison and Faraday.

You might not notice the traditional-looking house, which has a clay tile roof, located 300 yards from the Minster. It was designed to match the burnt-orange brick of the town's nineteenth-century buildings and received approval from planners, even though it is in a conservation area. When you ring the solar-powered doorbell, you will hear complete silence. The house is very well insulated, with special triple-glazed windows, so you cannot hear anything inside. Once you enter and take off your shoes (as Robert asks), you will feel a peaceful quietness. On a sunny summer day, the windows are closed, and the conservatory warms the air before it ventilates the house. Vale apologizes and moves around the house, opening clever ventilation shafts and windows. You need to create drafts because the house is designed to be draft-proof: even Edison and Faraday have their own small air-locked door.

The Vales, who teach architecture at Nottingham University, cared about the environment long before it became a political issue. They wrote a book on green architecture in the 1970s called The Autonomous House. They started by designing a building that produced no carbon dioxide. Then they decided to also do without mains water. They created composting toilets, installed rainwater tanks in the cellar, and used copper gutters to keep the drinking water clean, filtering it before use. Water from washing goes into the garden (the Vales do not have a dishwasher because they believe using strong detergents is wrong). Most of their choices reflect this idea. 'We wanted to show that it is possible to design a house that is much less harmful to the environment, without living in darkness,' says Robert. 'It would not be medieval.' The only medieval feature is the hall, which includes the fireplace and staircase, rising the full height of the building.

The Vales do not pay water bills. Last winter, the house used only nine units of electricity a day, costing about 70p, which is much less than what other four-bedroom houses use for heating. Soon, they will use even less electricity when they install £20,000 worth of solar water heating panels and equipment in the garden. The house will use mains electricity for cooking and appliances but will generate extra electricity. One day, there will even be enough to charge an electric car. The only heating is a small wood-burning stove in the hall, which the Vales say they only use in the coldest winter days. So, is it warm in winter? One night in February, when I visited, Robert was reading. He said it was too warm to light the fire. The temperature on the first floor was 18°C, which is lower than what is usually expected for living areas, but he said it felt comfortable because there are no drafts and no heat loss, as everything you touch is at the same temperature. How we feel temperature depends on these factors. An Edwardian woman in the early 1900s felt comfortable at 12.5°C because of her warm clothing. Robert suggests that people living in houses built before 1900 should go back to living like that. However, it is hard to imagine this idea becoming popular.

The secret of the house is that it is low-tech and simple, so there is little that can go wrong. Most materials were bought from a builder's merchant and installed by local craftsmen. This made the house affordable to build — it cost the same per square meter as low-cost rental housing. Not surprisingly, commercial building companies are resisting this idea."""
CAE_51,"**Text: The Camera and Its Truth**

Arthur Conan Doyle, the writer of the Sherlock Holmes stories, thought of himself as a rational and scientific person. However, in 1920, he saw photographs of fairies taken in a garden and believed they were real evidence of these tiny creatures. He published these photos with an article, accepting fairies as magical beings. It was not until 1939 that the two women who took the photos confessed they were fake. They had simply cut out pictures of fairies from a book and placed them among flowers. The photos are indeed beautiful, but the simplicity of the trick challenges a key idea about photography: that the camera cannot lie. In reality, it can, and always has been able to. Nowadays, we often use computer software to edit our digital images, and it is a misconception that photography ever had a time when it was completely honest. From the very beginning, when cameras started capturing images, those images were being changed."
CAE_11,"**Text: Blacksmiths**

Throughout history, iron has captured human imagination, and blacksmiths have often been seen as more than just skilled workers. Before the Industrial Revolution, blacksmiths held a status similar to that of doctors and astrologers because they were the only ones who made weapons, armor, and farming tools. They were also celebrated as artists. In the 18th century, blacksmiths created beautiful ironwork for St Paul's Cathedral, and the elegant metal designs in French and Belgian Art Nouveau architecture were crafted by talented blacksmiths.

However, by the late 1960s, the number of blacksmiths in Britain had greatly decreased, as heavy industry no longer needed their skills, and modern architects rarely used the beautiful wrought iron handrails. In the last ten years, there has been a revival of interest in decorative architecture and a more open approach to interior design. Still, much of the work produced seems clichéd, with manufacturers of gates and balconies promoting their products as ""classical"" or ""Victorian-style."" You can hardly enter a trendy design store without seeing rusty candlesticks with unnecessary decorations.

Fortunately, there are alternatives, and a series of events in the coming weeks aims to promote the blacksmithing craft. The first event, an exhibition of forged ironwork by members of the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA), opened last week at the Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey. Alan Dawson, the secretary of BABA, states, ""We could be at the start of a new Iron Age, as both the public and blacksmiths are now more aware of the craft."" Power tools have made it easier for blacksmiths to work with metal, allowing them to bend, split, twist, and weld with less effort. Dawson adds, ""These artists now have a material that lets them express themselves.""

About 250 pieces have been created for the exhibition, including bookends and a spiral staircase. Prices start at £90 and can go up to several thousand pounds. Most of the money will go to the individual makers, but a portion of each sale will be kept by the Association to promote good ironwork. Dawson's contributions include an eight-foot gate and a lamp with a hand-blown glass shade. He explains, ""My style comes from letting steel bend and flow into shape when it's hot. It's like drawing with metal in space.""

Many artists are fascinated by iron. Unlike most metals, which are soft when cold, iron and steel are tougher and more challenging to work with. Susan May, a trained jeweler, describes it as ""magical"" because it is very soft when hot but becomes hard and unyielding when it cools. Ann Catrin Evans creates mild steel door knockers and handles inspired by the dark castles often seen in horror films. One of her designs looks like a ball and chain, while another resembles a Celtic cross. She says, ""I love that steel is cold and hard, and it feels like it will last forever.""

No other metal has given people as much visual pleasure or a greater sense of security. It is likely that iron will continue to be used decoratively for the next thousand years, as long as we can avoid seeing any more rusty candlesticks."
CAE_14,"**Text: 'THE DAY I GAVE UP SMOKING'**

I thought everyone would be happy when I stopped smoking, but one of my colleagues was very angry. ""What do you mean?"" she shouted. ""If it was that easy, why didn't you stop years ago?"" I found it hard to explain how I went from being a heavy smoker to not smoking at all in just a few hours. It was a bit annoying, even for me. The stop-smoking session I attended was a mix of group therapy and hypnotherapy, and it happened two months and three weeks ago. I hadn’t planned to quit, and I didn’t really want to. I felt pressured by anti-smoking groups, which I still resent. Also, I had low blood pressure and a healthy family. I didn’t cough or feel sick, and I seemed to recover from colds faster than friends who lived healthier lives.

On that ordinary Thursday afternoon, I went to a session of The Easy Way to Stop Smoking to write an article about others trying to quit. I said, ""I won’t be trying to stop; it wouldn’t be fair."" I was there to write, not to quit, so I thought it wouldn’t be right to expect the method to work for me. I enjoyed smoking; it gave me real pleasure. The counsellor seemed to understand me. We were encouraged to smoke as much as we wanted, and the room was so full of smoke that we had to open the windows. I noticed that when I was told to smoke, I didn’t want to, and neither did the others.

What happened was that the messages about stopping made sense to me. Just as smoking had become a challenge against opposition, the idea of quitting started to feel appealing. The thought of not being a smoker made me feel strong. It was a personal feeling. Could I also achieve other things? In many ways, it was easy. The physical cravings for nicotine, which felt like hunger, faded after a minute or two and lasted only four or five days. I thought my work would be the hardest part without cigarettes, but it wasn’t a problem at all. I had believed I wouldn’t be able to meet deadlines without nicotine and that I would fail to write a story. Surprisingly, the hardest part was doing simple things at home on weekend mornings, and it still is. I’ve come to realize that smoking helped me deal with boredom; having a cigarette was an activity in itself. Yes, I do miss smoking, but not too much. Every new experience as a non-smoker is something I have to get used to—eating out, waiting for a flight, checking into a hotel, or during a theatre break. These are all moments when I would have previously smoked."
CAE_63,"Text: 'Dorothy who? The only British woman scientist to win the Nobel Prize should be well-known in her own country, says Georgina Ferry, but she is not. For the past four years, I have been asking friends and acquaintances about Dorothy Hodgkin. It’s simple: when I tell them I am writing her biography, if they respond positively, they have passed the test. Why should people in Britain know about Dorothy Hodgkin? The fact that she is the only British woman scientist to win a Nobel Prize should be enough. Anyone with the same achievement in literature would be famous. Hodgkin, who died in 1994, was an extraordinary person, as complex as the crystals she studied. Her life reflects significant changes of the 20th century, including the progress of women's education and the globalization of science.

When I started my research, I wanted to read some scientific biographies. One of Hodgkin's friends suggested a new biography of Linus Pauling. Pauling was a close friend of Hodgkin, worked in the same field, and campaigned against nuclear weapons. I went to the main bookshop in my university town, only to find that there were no biographies of Pauling available. I now realize I was naive to think Pauling would be interesting to British readers, even though he was a highly influential chemist and a Nobel Prize winner in both chemistry and peace. Even scientists have questioned the value of scientific biographies. Peter Medawar, another Nobel laureate, once said that the lives of scientists are often dull. If scientists believe this, it is not surprising that publishers and booksellers do too. 

Treating scientists differently from others in biographies shows the 'two cultures' mentality, the idea that there is a big gap between the arts and sciences, which still exists in the literary world. Only a few great scientists make it into biography sections of bookshops. It is not true that scientists lead less interesting lives than artists, writers, actors, or politicians. Some scientists are very careful about their public image. A leading geneticist told me he was happy to discuss his work but did not want to be quoted or photographed, as he did not want to seem 'self-promoting'. This avoidance of personal stories gives a false impression of science and may discourage young people from pursuing it.

Fortunately, things are changing. Contemporary scientists now often appear in public in ways other than just scientific interviews. For example, Professor Richard Dawkins presents awards on a TV quiz, and geneticist Steve Jones advertises cars on television. These activities may raise eyebrows in laboratories, but they help make scientists more relatable than many academic papers do. The publishing world is also changing. Scientific biographies used to be dull and overly serious. The personal lives of scientists—like marriage and children—were often ignored. This changed with Richard Feynman's book, Surely You're Joking, Mr Feynman?, which is both funny and touching. Recently, even famous scientists like Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, Albert Einstein, and Marie Curie have been shown with their flaws. 

Dorothy Hodgkin was dedicated to her scientific work. She solved the structures of penicillin and vitamin B12, winning the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 1964, and also worked on insulin in 1969. She achieved what others thought was impossible. However, she also raised three children and was married to a husband who was often away due to his job as a historian. Her personal life may not be directly related to her work, but we can learn from how she balanced different parts of her life. There is much in her life that is interesting, but it would be unfair to say this does not include her scientific work. Scientific inquiry was her passion, as it must be for any successful scientist. Communicating this passion is the biggest challenge for a scientific biographer. Most readers do not have enough basic scientific knowledge to understand complex ideas without much explanation. Understanding scientific concepts is not harder than reading Shakespeare or learning a new language; it just requires effort. It is unfortunate that educated people, who would feel embarrassed not to recognize a famous literary or artistic figure, remain unaware of the rich legacy of scientists like Dorothy Hodgkin.'"
CAE_56,"**Text: Margaret and Her Water-Finding Skills**

Margaret Wilkins is known for her unique ability to find water underground. She uses a forked hazel stick to detect water, which has made her popular among farmers whose wells have dried up. Along with her husband, she runs a well-drilling business that uses modern technology like drilling rigs and air-compressed hammers. However, when it comes to finding water, she relies on her hazel stick. The couple has a success rate of over 90%.

This skill, called dowsing, allows people to locate water, minerals, and lost items underground. There are various theories about how dowsing works, ranging from physical explanations like magnetism to spiritual beliefs. One of the more believable theories suggests that everything on Earth vibrates, and water vibrates more than other materials. Some dowsers claim they can sense these vibrations, while others say they can smell water, as smell is a very strong sense.

In recent years, due to droughts, Margaret has been very busy, sometimes having a waiting list of almost six weeks. Most of her clients are farmers with dry wells. She explains, ""We usually see customers only once because wells last a long time."" Other clients include owners of remote cottages or barns, where installing water pipes is too expensive, and developers of golf courses who need water for their facilities.

Margaret typically looks for water between 50 and 70 meters deep. She emphasizes the importance of drilling in safe areas to avoid contamination from waste. The water she finds is usually in cracks in solid rock, and as long as it is brought up directly, it should be clean. However, she notes that Cornwall has many minerals, so they must be cautious about iron in the water. 

Another important factor is electricity for the pump, which can be costly to run over long distances. Therefore, it is best if the well is close to existing power sources. Once these considerations are made, Margaret begins her search for water. For large areas like golf courses, she starts with a map and a pendulum. She holds the pendulum still and moves it over the map; it swings when she is above a water source.

After identifying potential areas on the map, Margaret walks over the fields with her hazel stick, which is forked and equal in size on both sides. ""When I am above water, I feel a strange sensation; I sway slightly. When that feeling goes away, I use the stick to find the exact spot to drill."" She holds the two forks of the stick and gently pulls them apart to create tension. ""When water is directly below, the straight part of the stick rises. It is crucial to drill exactly where the stick indicates. If we drill even a little off, we might miss the water completely.""

Margaret's husband also dowse the same area. Usually, they agree on where to drill, but if they disagree, they will keep searching until they find a consensus. Margaret's skills are not just a local tradition; they have intrigued anthropologists and writers for a long time. She describes her ability as an ""intuitive perception of the environment,"" which is the best way to explain how she finds water so accurately. If she did not have this special skill, it would be hard for her family to sustain their well-drilling business year after year."

Have you ever thought about living someone else's life for a day? It might be exciting to try something completely different. We arranged this for four people - here’s what happened.

**A. Amanda's Story**

I had never been to a place like the restaurant where my friend Cindy works. It was dark, loud, and full of people. It was very different from my quiet hometown, and I felt nervous! Being a mother is busy, but waitressing was a whole new challenge. I had only fifteen minutes to learn how to carry drinks on a tray. The other waitresses made it look easy, but when I tried, the drinks slipped off and spilled everywhere. I felt embarrassed, but the other waitresses laughed and said it happens to everyone.

By 11:30 am, there was a long line of customers waiting to get in, and I started to feel anxious. I was worried about remembering orders, but thankfully, everything was done with technology. After a few hours, my feet hurt, and I struggled to hear customers over the loud music. I often had to say 'Pardon?' which was embarrassing. By the end of my shift at 5 pm, I was completely worn out and just wanted to soak my feet. One waitress told me it had been a 'quiet' day, and I was shocked! I never realized how tiring waitressing could be. I always thought it was an easy job, but you really need to be friendly and calm, especially when it gets busy. I’m quite shy, and I don’t think I could handle a Saturday night rush. The pay wasn’t great either. I must have been a bad waitress because even the rich customers didn’t tip me! I was very happy to return to my children; it felt much easier than waitressing!

**B. Cindy's Story**

I was nervous about being a mother for a day, but I was also excited. I had heard that Amanda's daughters were a handful, but I thought I could manage. After Amanda left for the restaurant, I had to get the girls dressed and fed. After dropping Sophie at school and Katie at nursery, I thought I would have some quiet time. I was wrong! Amanda reminded me I still had to clean the house and do laundry.

At 1 pm, I picked up Katie, rushed through the supermarket, and took her home for lunch. But when I brought Sophie home, things got chaotic. They turned the couch into a trampoline and screamed loudly while playing! I thought they would tire out soon, but I was mistaken. I thought I had good energy, but they outlasted me! After a lot of convincing, I finally got them to bed by 8 pm, but then the fun continued! They kept asking for glasses of water, just to come downstairs and watch TV. I realized it was exhausting to negotiate with them all evening. I never knew how tiring it could be to take care of two small children. There’s no time to think about yourself, and the responsibility is huge. Still, I really enjoyed the day.

**C. Rosemary's Story**

On the farm, I usually wake up at 5:30 am, so sleeping in until 7 was a treat! I was unsure how to dress for school. I hoped I wouldn’t stand out among the 400 students at assembly. Then, I helped with a math class where children worked in small groups, which was different from my school days. I also assisted with a nature project about snails. By lunchtime, I was tired and looking forward to a break, but teachers only get about five minutes to eat. There was so much to do before the next classes.

I attended a staff meeting and ended up helping with athletics trials. After lunch, we had a silent reading lesson, which was nice, and then a French lesson where the kids wanted to practice with me, showing how rusty my French was! Finally, we had Physical Education, and by then, I was exhausted, but the children had endless energy. The hardest part was speaking in front of the class, even for just two minutes. Teachers may have more holidays, but I think I prefer farming!

**D. Hilary's Story**

I arrived at White House Farm at 8:30 am, only to find out that Rosemary had been up for three hours! Rosemary’s farm is large, with many cows and sheep. She also makes ice cream and yogurt, which are sold in shops and restaurants. I spent most of the morning in the ice cream shop, filling containers with milk and making ice cream. It was hard not to taste everything!

At lunchtime, I checked on the sheep and helped one that had fallen over. If they are left too long, they could die, so they need daily checks. After feeding the calves, I started milking, which took two and a half hours. Rosemary does this twice a day, every day of the year! I found the day lonely and missed being around children; animals don’t talk back! The hardest part of farming is that you can’t take time off. The cows need to be milked twice a day, making it hard to plan vacations. Farming seems romantic, but the reality is very different. The income is unstable, and I wouldn’t want to rely on the weather."
CAE_6,"Text: 'A trumpet isn't just for Christmas... It is interesting how many musicians, even famous ones, come from families without music. Hakan Hardenberger, the only son of non-musical parents in a rural area of southern Sweden, has, at the age of 30, become a unique trumpet player in the world today. His recordings are constantly introducing new music, including concertos by lesser-known composers from the baroque and classical periods, as well as new compositions. When you meet him, he appears youthful and energetic, reflecting the lively sound of the trumpet. Recently, he performed the Hummel Trumpet Concerto in one of London's top concert halls, a piece he often plays, and a television feature was made about his work, filmed in both London and Sweden.

Born near Malmo, his musical journey began with a Christmas gift when he was just eight years old. His father, who did not play music but enjoyed Louis Armstrong's music, decided to give his son a real trumpet instead of a toy. The gift was a success, and the boy played continuously. His mother reached out to the second trumpet player in the Malmo Symphony Orchestra, who agreed to give her son lessons. Bo Nilsson, a rising musician, quickly recognized Hardenberger's natural talent. Hardenberger is grateful to have had such a dedicated teacher from the beginning, one who was passionate about the trumpet and sought out players worldwide, always looking for new mouthpieces.

Hardenberger distinguishes himself from his teacher by acknowledging the trumpet's limitations. He explains, 'The trumpet is a simple instrument, and you can't create a perfect one. There will always be flaws. Also, no two mouthpieces are exactly alike. It's important to understand these imperfections and learn to work with them.' From the start, Hardenberger had a knack for finding the right balance and forming a connection with the instrument. He notes that even as a child, his unique sound was already recognizable, 'the first thing I developed.' Unlike the renowned British trumpet player John Wallace, who came from a brass band background and later played in orchestras, Hardenberger has always seen himself as a solo artist. He admired the French trumpeter Maurice Andre, who also avoided orchestras, and collected his records. His parents supported his ambition to pursue a career in trumpet playing.

At 15, it was time to decide where he would study. Although Bo Nilsson suggested America, it was considered too far and risky, so at 16, he went to Paris to study with Pierre Thibaud. Thibaud reinforced Hardenberger's belief against joining an orchestra, saying, 'Playing in an orchestra is like digging in the garden.' He was aware that he played better than many of his peers, but it was only after entering his first competition at 17 that he realized he had a special ability to connect with the audience. Thibaud encouraged him to participate for experience. Hardenberger prepared only for the first round but advanced to the second. Fortunately, he was familiar with most pieces in that round too, but in the final, he faced a concerto that intimidated him. He did not win first prize, but he enjoyed the performance, realizing that even though he felt he 'played poorly,' people were still listening.

Hardenberger's honest view of his work may seem arrogant, but that is a misunderstanding. He thoughtfully avoids analyzing what makes his communication special, saying, 'You risk losing it by trying to explain. The power of music is that it can always touch people.'"
CAE_33,"**Text:**

**A.** The story of Tristan Smith, a citizen in the made-up republic of Efica, is a remarkable tale about human power, history, and humor. The author skillfully creates a world with its own history, traditions, and customs. The book is also known for its humor and the author's unique perspective, combined with deep psychological insight, making it a challenging but rewarding read.

**B.** Harriet is a composed, middle-class woman with an architect husband and her own business. Normally, she would not have met Sheila, a traditional working-class woman who cares for her aging father and has raised her grandson, Leo, since he was three. Their lives change dramatically when Leo violently attacks Harriet's son, Joe, in the street. After the court case, both boys refuse to discuss what happened. Leo, who had always been a good student and never fought before, cannot explain his actions, while Joe, although physically recovering, becomes withdrawn. Harriet is deeply affected by her son's situation, and caring for him takes over her life. Sheila feels so guilty that she asks to meet Harriet, leading to an unexpected friendship. The author excels at showing how people respond to major changes in their lives and captures the mother's feeling that she can never do enough for her son.

**C.** This book, shortlisted for the Booker Prize, tells the story of one of the most isolated Scottish Orkney islands and its people over a long, quiet history. The narrative is set against important moments in Scottish history, vividly imagined through the daydreams of the young character, Throfinn Ragnarson. He suddenly disappears in the story but returns after World War II, having learned to appreciate the simple lives of his ancestors.

**D.** After his recent success, the author has written a sequel that carries the same gentle irony and sharp observations of family life that made the first book popular. Fifteen years after her daughter's death, Aurora Greenway approaches her seventies with her lively friend, Rosie Sunlap. Aurora's way of living remains a mix of vanity, charm, and reluctant kindness, while Rosie supports her in her enjoyable manipulation of friends and suitors. By the end of the book, Aurora must face the passage of time and the arrival of a new generation. The author skillfully reveals the sadness that lies beneath the ordinary aspects of life, focusing more on the shadows than the bright moments.

**E.** Six very different people are brought together by millionaire Logan Urquhart to sail around the South Pacific islands on his yacht, the Ardent Spirit. The author uses beautiful descriptive language to explore the personal journeys of self-discovery that each sailor experiences, returning home with renewed spirits after their time adrift on ""the desert cities of waves."" The author employs striking images to express themes of memory and awareness, which are both isolating and enlightening."

Rebecca Cripps meets five women who share their different jobs, discussing the good and bad aspects, as well as their typical workdays.

**A. THE BRAIN SURGEON**  
**Name:** Anne  
**Age:** 34  

**ANNE'S DAY**  
""I wake up at 6:30 am, go to the gym at 7:00 am, and arrive at work by 8:00 am. I start surgeries at 8:30 am. I perform surgeries all day on Mondays and Wednesdays, and sometimes on Friday afternoons. Most brain surgeries last about three hours, but some can take all day. Occasionally, I work for ten hours straight without a break. Deciding when to operate can be stressful. While I don’t feel stressed during surgery, I sometimes worry about the next day’s tasks. Brain surgery is often a last option for patients, but when it succeeds, it is incredibly rewarding, making up for the times it doesn’t. From 10:00 am to 1:00 pm, I run an out-patients' clinic where I explain the surgeries to patients. I enjoy this and find it easy to talk to them. If they become upset, I try to comfort them, but time constraints can make this hard. I usually leave work between 6:00 pm and 8:00 pm. Some nights and weekends, I am on call and carry my bleeper. During holidays, I often worry about my patients and dream about operating at night. I find it hard to relax.""

**B. THE SENIOR DESIGNER**  
**Name:** Marita  
**Age:** 31  

**MARITA'S DAY**  
""I wake up at 7:45 am, leave home by 8:20 am, and take the train to work, arriving at 9:15 am. On Mondays at 10:30 am, we have a meeting to discuss our projects and any issues. I work in a team of three senior designers, a partner, and a junior designer. My work is mostly production, with about ten to fifteen percent being design. I receive a brief from the client, and if they have clear ideas, I spend three to four weeks designing and developing the project. After that, I present my ideas to the client. Once they approve, we create budgets and I start hiring photographers and illustrators. I also coordinate with printers to ensure everything is done on time. Managing multiple projects can be very stressful, and deadlines are always tight. Lunch is at 1:00 pm for an hour, and we often go to a pub. If I get good feedback from a client, it feels great, but it’s disappointing when a project I worked hard on gets rejected. I usually get home by 7:30 pm, but it can be as late as 8:30 pm or later. I find it hard to relax after a busy day.""

**C. THE CHAUFFEUR**  
**Name:** Linda  
**Age:** 42  

**LINDA'S DAY**  
""I usually wake up around 7:00 am, but on two or three mornings a week, I have to get up between 4:30 am and 5:00 am for long-haul flights. At 10:30 or 11:00 am, I might go for a bike ride or swim. Since chauffeuring is a sitting job, I need to watch my diet and exercise. I usually have a big breakfast and snack throughout the day. People often ask for my recommendations for restaurants or shops, so I need to know the area well. Many jobs are pre-booked, allowing me to plan my routes. Not all passengers are polite; some can be rude, but most are well-behaved, and I have good relationships with my regular clients. Sometimes I hear private conversations in the car and have to focus on driving. I work seven days a week, up to fifteen hours a day, so I must be careful not to get too tired. I try to go to bed by 11:00 pm.""

**D. THE LANDSCAPE GARDENER**  
**Name:** Tracy  
**Age:** 27  

**TRACY'S DAY**  
""I wake up around 7:00 am, leave home at 7:30 am, and start my first job. My assistant and I mainly maintain gardens we designed. We do some commercial work, but most is in private gardens, spending about an hour and a half at each location. Around 11:00 am, we take a break at a local café for a big breakfast. In summer, I may work until 10:00 pm, and in winter until 4:30 pm. I run the business from home, so when I return, I check messages and return calls. If someone wants a new garden, I usually set up a consultation in the evening. We focus on using old materials to create gardens that look historic. Sometimes clients have specific ideas that are not great, but it’s very satisfying to see a garden we designed bloom. I find it hard to relax in the evenings because I can hear the business phone ringing. I sleep well because my job is physically demanding, leaving me exhausted at the end of the day.""

**E. THE CIVIL ENGINEER**  
**Name:** Zena  
**Age:** 27  

**ZENA'S DAY**  
""I arrive at the construction site by 8:30 am. As the assistant resident engineer, I oversee the building of bridges and a retaining wall. I check that contractors are following the schedule and safety rules while minimizing environmental impact. I help coordinate the site professionals and solve problems. The contractors start at 6:00 am, so my first task is to find out what happened since I left the night before. The rest of my day depends on what I learn from the clerk of works. I usually have paperwork to review or design questions to answer. Lunch is typically from 2:00 pm to 2:30 pm, but I often eat on the go. Since we monitor the contractors' work, it can create tension, so we need to maintain a good relationship. I see the duty resident engineer once a day, but if something urgent arises, I act immediately. I usually leave the site around 6:00 pm and am on call all the time."""
CAE_40,"**Careers: Six People Discuss Their Typical Working Day**

**A. Credit Card Executive**  
I wake up at 6 am to reach the office by 7:30 am. I oversee customer development programs for our credit card users. My job includes launching and managing the Membership Rewards scheme in major European markets. I maintain contact with current card users, attract new ones, and build partnerships with companies. I spend the first 45 minutes organizing my day and then respond to emails. I handle advertising for the membership program across Europe, meeting with marketing staff and advertising agencies to create strategies and plan future projects. I have meetings throughout the day, but I keep my door open for anyone who has questions. I travel to different markets in Europe once or twice a week to address any issues. When I’m in London, I usually leave work between 6:30 pm and 7:00 pm.

**B. Record Company Executive**  
I arrive at work by 10:00 am and start by reviewing the mail, which includes ten to twenty demo tapes, letters from producers, concert information, and invoices from musicians and studios. The phone starts ringing around 10:30 am with calls from producers and publishers, and I have meetings throughout the day to discuss campaigns or projects for artists. I listen to demo tapes carefully, knowing that they represent people's hard work, and I try to provide constructive feedback. Once I sign a band, we begin working on their first album, selecting songs, producers, and additional musicians. I communicate my vision for the album to the marketing team. I also manage budgets and expenses. I leave work by 7:00 pm at the earliest, and most evenings I attend concerts, sometimes seeing up to five new bands in one night. I often don’t get home until 1:00 am, when I listen to a record to relax.

**C. Sales Director**  
I wake up at 8:00 am and drive to work, arriving by 9:30 am. I check the mail and my schedule to see if we have any client meetings that day. I enjoy showing customers around the showroom and love making sales, knowing the furniture will go to a good home. We sell antiques priced between £1,000 and £6,000, sourcing them from auctions, private clients, and overseas. Many items need restoration, so I work closely with our full-time restorer and other specialists. I read the Antiques Trade Gazette while drinking coffee to stay updated on the industry and often visit the Victoria and Albert Museum to compare furniture. I handle accounts once a month and do tax returns every three months. I leave work at 5:30 pm and it usually takes me about an hour to unwind.

**D. Air Traffic Controller**  
I work on a set shift schedule. On early shifts, I leave home at 6:00 am. I start my shift at 7:00 am, taking over one of the control positions in the tower. We have a rotating schedule, working for about an hour and a half at one station, then taking a half-hour break before switching to another station. The air traffic controllers, a supervisor, and the watch manager work closely together to manage aircraft movements. In winter, we handle about 1,000 movements a day, and even more in summer. Night shifts are quieter, allowing me to read about new air traffic regulations between 12:00 am and 4:00 am. This job is quite stressful, and I take sick days if I feel unwell. I hope to become a watch manager and eventually the general manager of the airport.

**E. Shop Manager**  
If I have an early shift, I leave home by 8:00 am. My first task is to start the electronic point-of-sale system. I ensure someone is watching the register and coordinate lunch breaks for staff. In the morning, I assist customers in finding and ordering books. I enjoy helping customers, although it can be frustrating when they come in with reviews and expect me to gather many books quickly. From 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm on weekdays, publishers' representatives visit, and I discuss upcoming titles with them. I need to estimate how many copies of a new title we might sell. When we want to feature a new title, I ensure it arrives on time. My early shift ends at 5:45 pm. On two days a week, I work a late shift, closing the computer system, locking up, and then going home.

**F. Financial Analyst**  
I listen to the news at 7:00 am, then get up and take a taxi to work, arriving by 8:45 am. I contact freelance reporters to learn about events in my region. I assess financial risks for multinational companies operating abroad, warning clients about potential issues. I provide three services: an online executive preview, a security forecast, and a travel information security guide. From 9:15 am to 9:30 am, I meet with editors to discuss the stories I will follow. My first executive preview must be online by 10:00 am, and my second by 11:00 am, so I work quickly to gather information. I type the stories, send them to my editor for approval, and make any necessary changes. I travel to Africa about three times a year to report on events and stay updated. I usually leave work around 6:00 pm, and it can be hard to relax afterward; I often find myself awake until 1:00 am."

A. **What Makes a Good Leader?**  
A good leader inspires others and helps create change. Leadership is not about physical traits like height or just intelligence. According to Pat Dixon, author of *Making the Difference: Women and Men in the Workplace*, leadership is about ""making things happen through people who are as enthusiastic and interested as you are."" Enthusiasm is essential, and a good leader should communicate clearly and confidently. Dixon emphasizes the importance of saying ""I believe"" instead of ""I think.""

B. John van Maurik, who directs a Leadership in Management course, states that most people have more potential for leadership than they realize. Becoming a leader involves recognizing and developing your hidden talents. In a way, we are all born leaders; we just need the right environment to grow. While it is easy to see leadership in famous figures like Emmeline Pankhurst or Mahatma Gandhi, it can be harder to see it in our own workplaces. However, leadership is now seen as a key part of effective management.

C. Think about the best and worst boss you have had. They might have been equally good at setting goals and meeting deadlines. But how did they achieve these goals? The best leader motivated you and provided support, while the worst made you feel unimportant and withheld information. When things went wrong, the first leader took responsibility, while the second blamed you. The first was a good leader; the second was a poor manager.

D. Leaders and managers are different. Managers prefer to work within set limits, while leaders create new possibilities. Micheal Shea, author of *Leadership Rules*, writes that a good manager can keep a company running smoothly, but a good leader can change a discouraged organization, whether it’s a business, a sports team, or a country.

E. Whether you are the boss or a middle manager, improving your leadership skills can be beneficial. Here are some lessons to learn:  
- Leadership works best when you choose to lead. Discover your passions and act on them when you feel inspired.  
- Start seeing yourself as a leader. Your ability to lead is a strong part of who you are.  
- Collaboration is important, but sometimes strong leadership is necessary. Try different leadership styles. If you usually negotiate, take the lead instead and see how it changes the outcome.  
- Set goals and strive to exceed them. Identify areas in your job where being a leader can improve your effectiveness and career opportunities.

F.  
- Leadership does not happen by itself. It develops through taking the lead, taking risks, and learning from mistakes. Learn to delegate, motivate, organize, and provide feedback.  
- Don’t assume your leadership style will be accepted right away. It might even push people away. Keep improving your communication skills. You don’t need to be liked, but your ideas and achievements should be respected.  
- Be visible and approachable to those who matter. Remember, you don’t have to lead all the time. Understand when your leadership is essential and how you can help others become leaders too."
CAE_64,"**Text: Films on Video - Reviews by Film Critic Nick James**

**A. Abyss**  
Before ""Titanic,"" director James Cameron created a tense Cold War thriller about oil rig workers and navy experts trying to save a nuclear submarine trapped deep underwater. The humor and modest bravery of foreman Bud and his team remind us of similar heroes in Howard Hawks' films. The production design and special effects are outstanding, but the dialogue and character development feel weak. Despite the skill in filmmaking, the story is basic B-movie material.

**B. The Thin Red Line**  
This video release of the James Jones novel about the Guadalcanal battle, directed by Andrew Marton, contrasts with Terrence Malick's recent film. While Malick's version is mystical and poetic, Marton's is a more traditional war movie, often closer to the book. He focuses on one soldier and his tough relationship with his sergeant. Malick's film is richer and more complex, but Marton's version has its strong moments, especially the harsh flashback where the soldier dreams of his wife.

**C. On Guard**  
This film, loosely based on Paul Feval's 1875 novel, is a fun swashbuckler that stands out among musketeer stories. Fabrice Luchini plays a cunning villain, while Vincent Perez is an energetic hero, even if his role is short. Daniel Auteuil, though a bit too serious for a light-hearted film, also shines as an acrobat-turned-swordsman. The filmmakers use costume-drama clichés with such charm and wit that it doesn't matter.

**D. Character**  
Set in early 1900s Rotterdam, this film tells a dark story but feels overly detailed, making it look like a museum piece. Jan Decleir plays the grim bailiff Dreverhaven, who is harsh when evicting tenants. His troubled relationship with his son is central to the plot, but the filmmakers focus too much on the period details, neglecting the story's darker themes.

**E. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly**  
This newly remastered video release highlights director Leone's skill, especially in sound editing, where every sound is clear. The storytelling is harsh, and whenever it slows down, Morricone's powerful music brings excitement. Morally, there is little difference between the good (Clint Eastwood), the bad (Lee van Cleef), and the ugly (Ell Wallach), as they all act unscrupulously in the post-Civil War West.

**F. The Longest Day**  
Promoted as featuring ""forty-eight international stars,"" this three-hour war epic by Darryl Zanuck has four directors and 23,000 extras, making it feel overdone. The early scenes, where battle-hardened veterans wait for news of the invasion, drag on for both the audience and the soldiers. While it is an impressive logistical achievement, it is best experienced on the big screen. Watching it on video diminishes the experience."

**BOOK A** *Compelling Evidence* by Steve Martin is indeed compelling. The story follows a lawyer who is trying to start a new practice after leaving a powerful law firm. He ends up defending his boss's wife, who is on trial for her husband's murder. The trial scenes are exciting, with the outcome uncertain until the very end, and there is an unexpected twist in the final pages. This is a strong debut in a crowded genre.

**BOOK B** *Curtains for the Cardinal* begins dramatically, introducing Sigismondo, a troubleshooter for the Italian Renaissance aristocracy. He gets caught up in a mix of politics, church intrigue, and murder, but we are confident he will uncover the guilty parties. The plot is complex, and the book is a bit lengthy, but it is still very enjoyable.

**BOOK C** *File Under: Deceased* introduces a new detective, Leah Hunter, a tax inspector. She finds herself in a unique position to investigate when a strange man collapses at her feet. Despite facing criticism and the disapproval of a local detective sergeant, Leah is brave and resourceful, making her a strong character.

**BOOK D** *Double Deuce* by Robert B. Parker features Spenser, a private investigator, who helps his friend Hawk clear drug dealers from a troubled area in Boston. The dialogue is quick and engaging, and while there are fewer deaths than usual, the story includes more philosophical elements. It is high-quality entertainment, as expected from Parker.

**BOOK E** *False Prophet* by Faye Kellermann features detectives Pete Decker and Marge Dunn, who investigate a burglary at the home of a famous film star's daughter. The author's easy writing style and keen observation of human behavior make this an entertaining mystery.

**BOOK F** *Blood Red, Snow White* is written by husband and wife team Diane Henry and Nicholas Horrock. It features another lawyer and a female client, but the action takes place outside the courtroom, and the lawyer becomes a victim as the plot unfolds. The story combines romance, money, and violence to create an engaging suspense novel.

**BOOK G** *Dead for a Ducat* by Simon Shaw presents actor Philip Fletcher as the intended victim. A funny group of characters comes together to film a story about Robin Hood, but Philip feels this is not the right direction for his career. Simon Shaw usually entertains, but this time, the shift from black comedy to farce does not meet his usual high standards.

**BOOK H** *Fall Down Easy* is Lawrence Gough's best book in a while. Canadian police are on the hunt for a clever bank robber who targets female bank tellers. The slow build-up of tension and the portrayal of the intelligent, troubled robber elevate this story above the average detective novel."
CAE_57,"Text: ""I might be too old for this adventure, but here I go! At 34, Tim Pozzi has left a good job to go backpacking. He thinks about why he and others his age have decided to take this step. This summer, I quit my job and decided to rent out my flat to travel in South East Asia for a year. You might think I'm lucky, but I'm 34 years old and feeling nervous. It's not like I haven't traveled before. After university, I spent two years backpacking in North and South America, and when I returned, I promised myself I would do it again someday. But then life happened: I fell in love, started a career, bought a flat, and got used to earning a salary. Gradually, I realized I was sacrificing my own happiness for my salary. When I handed in my resignation, it felt like I was taking control of my life again. I have no ties now. Many of my friends are married with children, and while they wouldn’t trade places with me, they envy my freedom. I'm no longer in a relationship and don’t have strong career goals. I feel I should make the most of this freedom, even for my friends' sake! 

Why am I so nervous? First, I need to make all the arrangements. How could I let someone else live in my home? How do I organize the rental? And I also need to decide where to go. I tend to procrastinate and am already behind my planned schedule. I thought, 'I might as well enjoy the summer in England,' and then, 'Why not wait for the start of the football season?' Letting go of emotional ties makes it harder. I’m delaying because I wonder if I can still handle backpacking. Will I adjust to a simpler way of life? Will I feel out of place among younger backpackers? Maybe not. I've noticed that more Britons in their late twenties and thirties want to break free from their lives and travel abroad. Jennifer Cox from Lonely Planet says that more people are realizing that adventure is available to them: 'People who used to say ""I wish I had that opportunity"" now understand they can have it whenever they want. They just need to be brave, organized, and confident enough to do it.'

For Danny, a 30-year-old accountant, and his girlfriend Tammy, a 28-year-old teacher, this trip is a chance to enjoy life before settling down. They bought a round-the-world ticket for a year. 'I'm willing to give up job security for this trip,' says Danny. 'There’s always a worry that I won’t move up in my career and will return to the same position, but I think it’s a risk worth taking. When I left the office, I threw my calculator into the river as a symbolic act of defiance!' For Matt, who just left the Army, his year of travel was a time of change. 'In the military, there’s a strict way of doing things. I needed to change this mindset to live well as a civilian.'

While there are many reasons for traveling at my age, some common factors exist. 'Today, we have a more flexible workforce,' says Angela Baron from the Institute of Personnel Development. 'More people work on short-term contracts, so if your contract ends, you have nothing to lose.' Larger companies are even allowing career breaks. 'If you’ve invested time and money in training someone, it’s good to know they’ll return instead of going to a competitor.' Dan Hiscocks, managing director of Travellerseye, a company that shares stories of 'ordinary' travelers, says that more thirty-somethings are reevaluating their lives. 'If you’re not happy with your job—and many aren’t—it’s no longer just about sticking it out. People now know that opportunities exist and that a job isn’t permanent. Travel allows you to reflect and think about your life.'

Is giving in to wanderlust just another sign of my generation's struggle with adulthood? Jennifer Cox disagrees. 'It shows a better-educated, more stable society where we care less about paying bills and more about living a balanced life. We’re taking the time to ask, ""Is this what I want?"" Ben, a 32-year-old picture researcher going to Central America for a year, doesn’t think he’s running away. 'It’s more about running towards something. I want to pursue things for myself.' But he also feels some anxiety. 'I’ll miss my comfortable routine—going to the office every day, saying ""hi"" to everyone, and having my morning coffee.' I share Ben's concerns about leaving behind a structured life with few challenges, and I’m not sure I would be making this journey if I hadn’t found my boss so unbearable. As Jennifer Cox points out, 'This is quite common. There’s often a trigger, like a breakup or job loss, that pushes people to travel.' 

It may have taken a push to get me moving, but I’m now looking forward to the next 12 months with growing excitement. No matter what happens, I’ll take pride in having embraced life. I believe I speak for all of us older backpackers."""
CAE_42,"**Text: 'Transforming the Home Office'**

Georgina McGuiness took a long break from journalism and felt disconnected from the technological changes. In this piece, she shares how she turned her home into an effective workplace.

The Christmas before last, I turned 37 and realized that if I wanted to restart my journalism career, I needed to act fast. I felt like my skills were outdated, stuck in the 1980s when typewriters were the norm. I worried that no one would trust me with a computer in a newsroom. Many job ads required experience in desktop publishing, which I lacked. I thought I would have a better chance of hosting a seminar on nuclear physics than learning to design a page on a computer. I was known as the family technophobe; even basic calculators confused me, and I still struggled with the video timer.

I knew I had to change quickly. I thought leaving home before my children would be difficult, but then I entered a local newspaper competition and surprisingly won a computer package. We received a laptop for my husband and a personal computer for the family. We jumped into this new world, and terms like cyberspace, Internet, and surfing became part of our daily language. We started chatting online with people from around the globe. The children, already familiar with computers from school, abandoned the television, while I set up a small office in the kitchen with a phone, fax machine, CD-ROM, and modem to connect to the Internet. This setup allowed me to work from home while still taking the kids to school.

At first, I was nervous about using the computer, fearing I would lose my work with one wrong click. However, I learned the basic skills I needed. It turned out to be logical and straightforward. With persistence, I improved daily. I recently began freelancing for a magazine, writing about two articles a month, and I feel proud to balance both work and family life.

How has the computer helped me? In school, my desk was always a chaotic mess, and I often lost important notes. The computer has made me more organized, especially with office tasks. Spreadsheets help me track income and expenses, and ready-made invoices and letterheads save me time. As a journalist, being online allows me to research stories, seek information on forums, and discuss working from home with others worldwide.

However, working from home has its downsides. I can feel isolated without face-to-face contact. There are distractions, like household chores, and when the kids are home, we sometimes argue over computer time. Yet, many people are buying multi-media PCs not just for education and entertainment but also for convenience, avoiding the daily commute to the city.

As we move into the next century, what defines home workers? A report called PC Usage in UK Homes describes the typical computer user as 38 years old and well-educated. Most own a personal computer, and many have a CD-ROM, laser printer, and modem. Considering this, I feel I am ahead of the game. Who knows, one day I might be emailing a column to a newspaper in Melbourne or even publishing my own magazine from home. It seems that the possibilities in cyberspace are endless."
CAE_59,"**The Tartan Museum**

The modern buildings of Scotland's national museum stand out in historic Edinburgh. But are the exhibits inside just as impressive? Sally Varlow visited the museum before it opened.

You can't miss the new Museum of Scotland, located at the corner of Chambers Street in Edinburgh. It features a large yellow sandstone tower and unique, wedge-shaped buildings topped with a hanging garden. Last winter, the building received mixed reviews, with some calling it a ""masterpiece"" and others expressing doubt. Now, as the inside prepares for opening, the exhibitions may face similar opinions.

The museum tells the story of the nation and has a timeline to help visitors understand the displays. However, it does not let national pride overshadow its valuable treasures, like Mary Queen of Scots' jewels and silver from Holyrood chapel. The main question is whether people will find the museum interesting enough to return. Dr. David Clarke, the head of exhibitions, believes that a visit should be enjoyable and accessible to everyone, not just experts.

Clarke prefers to show real objects rather than imaginative recreations of the past, as he believes the public deserves the truth. This means that what visitors see is based on expert knowledge. The challenge is whether the stories of these objects can be told effectively through explanation panels, captions, and multimedia displays, with only about 30 computers available in the museum.

Just days before the opening, it is still hard to tell how successful the exhibits will be. However, some aspects are clear. The museum features a series of interconnected galleries with pale walls designed to resemble large stone blocks, and natural light pours in through narrow windows and roof lights. There is space for visitors to reflect on each item.

Thanks to a Junior board made up of children aged 9 to 12 from across Scotland, the museum includes a Discovery Centre. The children wanted a way to interact with the displays. Although they didn't get that, they did create a hands-on center for kids in what was supposed to be a temporary exhibition space. As a result, the Twentieth Century gallery on the top floor is the only temporary exhibit, featuring items chosen by Scottish people that have significantly impacted life in Scotland during that time. Suggestions included an electric guitar, televisions, thermos flasks, and favorite toys. While this idea is fun, it may not address more serious topics.

Dr. Clarke believes that ""objects open windows on the past more vividly than anything else."" As for the modern architecture, it works well from the inside and the top, but its location may still be a question."
CAE_54,"**Simplified Text: 'The End of Print May Take Some Time' by Peter Preston**

Transition is a nice word that means moving from one place to another. Change can be scary for some people, but transition suggests a smooth journey from the present to the future. However, the transition of newspapers to the online world is uncertain and uncomfortable. Many believe it will happen eventually because print newspaper sales are falling while visits to their websites are increasing. For example, the print sales of The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian have dropped by 8% to 10% each year, while their website traffic continues to grow.

But not everything fits this pattern. A recent survey by the World Association of Newspapers showed that global newspaper circulation actually increased by 1.1% last year, reaching 512 million copies a day. While sales in Western countries have decreased, Asia has compensated for this decline. News and current affairs magazines, which are expected to struggle in the digital age, reported a 5.4% increase in sales.

The situation is similar for books. Sales of e-readers like Kindle are rising significantly. However, when booksellers looked at the value of physical books sold in the last six months, they found it was only down by 0.4%. This suggests that both digital and print formats can coexist.

The idea that young people are completely abandoning newspapers is exaggerated. The latest National Readership Survey shows that nearly 5 million people aged 15 to 35 still read major national newspapers. Different countries in Europe have different trends. In Britain, there has been a 10.8% drop in newspaper sales, but in Germany, the decline is only 7%, and in France, it is just 3.1%.

These varying trends indicate that the situation is more complex than some people think. In the past, analysts believed that rising online advertising would support the shift to digital newspapers. However, digital ad revenues are now falling, and many US newspapers have started charging for online access. The best way to attract paying readers seems to be offering both print and digital access together. Print newspapers still play an important role in selling online subscriptions, as their advertising rates are much higher than those for online ads.

Maintaining both a website and a print edition is challenging and costly for newspaper companies. However, print newspapers still have strong recognition, while being noticed online is much harder."
CAE_32,"**Photographing People**

People are the most fascinating subjects for photography. A photo that includes a person is usually more interesting than one without. However, photographing people can be challenging. Besides technical skills, photographers must pay attention to actions, gestures, and expressions. The presence of a camera can sometimes make people act differently.

**A. Grouping People**  
When taking group photos, avoid straight lines. Have people stand at different angles and distances, and if possible, at different heights. You can also have some people sit or kneel in front so that all faces are visible.

**B. Posing for Pictures**  
People often feel stiff in front of a camera. Help your subject relax by suggesting comfortable positions, like folding their hands or putting them in their pockets.

**C. The Right Approach**  
Do not pretend you are not taking a picture when it is obvious. This can create tension. Most people will agree to have their photo taken, even if they hesitate at first. They may feel self-conscious, so you might need to guide them. A photo can be less effective if the subject looks away from the camera.

**D. Eye Contact**  
A photo is more powerful if the subject looks at the viewer. Ask your subject to look into the lens, and remind them just before you take the shot. You can also say something funny to capture a genuine reaction.

**E. Candid Concentration**  
Instead of direct eye contact, your subject can focus on something in the picture. This can make them feel more comfortable, and it gives the impression that you are observing them without being noticed. Candid shots can be very engaging, and the subject's expression is crucial.

**F. Expressions and Gestures**  
Expressions and gestures reveal a lot about a person. For example, a laughing child can make viewers smile, while a sad face can evoke sympathy. Look for common expressions like shrugs, winks, or smiles; they communicate feelings instantly.

**G. Situation Interest**  
While close-up shots of a person can be striking, the background can add context and interest. When including a background, avoid irrelevant details and ensure the subject stands out. A wide-angle lens can help make the subject appear larger compared to the background.

**H. Interaction**  
Capturing moments where people are interacting—like talking, laughing, or working together—can lead to great photos. Look for connections between people, such as eye contact or physical gestures, to show their relationship.

**I. People and Places**  
Many photos of people are taken during trips. To improve these pictures, use a standard or wide-angle lens and step back to include the background, like a building or landscape. Position your subjects close to the camera while ensuring the background is visible. An elevated camera position can help achieve this balance.

**J. To Pose or Not to Pose?**  
Decide why you want to take the picture. If it’s to remember someone you met briefly, a clear posed photo is best. However, family pictures can become boring if they are all formal poses. Candid shots of events are often more lively and memorable, capturing genuine moments that will be cherished in the future."
CAE_65,"**Text: Under Sarah's Spell**

Sarah Janson is a trompe-l'oeil artist, which means her paintings create an illusion of reality. In this interview with Joanna Watt, we learn more about her unique perspective on art.

Not many artists choose not to sign their work, but Sarah does. She believes that the artwork itself is what matters, not the artist. She is very modest and almost makes it seem like her paintings create themselves. This attitude makes for an interesting interview. At first, she is shy about being photographed, but after a while, she becomes more comfortable, and the conversation turns enjoyable and funny.

Sarah has been a trompe-l'oeil artist for sixteen years. She trained for two years in drawing at art school, earned a degree in graphic illustration, and worked at a publishing house. However, she found that illustration did not fulfill her, so she joined a specialist decorator named Jim Smart. He encouraged her to try trompe-l'oeil, and she discovered her passion for it. She left to start her own career, unsure of where it would lead but feeling optimistic.

Her keen observation skills and attention to detail, developed through her illustration work, are crucial for her trompe-l'oeil art. She often gets asked where to learn this technique, but she believes it cannot be taught; it comes from life experience and careful observation. Sarah insists she is still learning and believes that if you think you have mastered something, you should stop trying.

She is honest about her weaknesses, such as her inability to paint bread realistically. When she received a large commission for a ceiling at Lulworth Castle, she struggled with the measurements and questioned her abilities. This self-doubt leads her to speak about her work in a detached way, as if it is separate from her.

Despite her modesty, Sarah's trompe-l'oeil art is exceptional. She has completed many significant projects for both businesses and private clients. Much of her work is inspired by architecture. For example, she created a trompe-l'oeil dining room based on a Venetian palace and a painting that tricks the viewer into thinking they can enter two more rooms.

However, trompe-l'oeil art has a challenge: once the viewer understands the trick, they may lose interest. Sarah knows this and believes that her art must do two things: first, it should draw people in and trick them, and second, it must engage their imagination. She also thinks that the art should be personal to the client. She enjoys working closely with her clients, as their ideas help shape her work. Many of her clients become friends because she spends so much time with them during the creative process.

Sarah appreciates her clients, especially those who allow her creative freedom. They seem happy with her work, which keeps her busy, even though she tends to downplay her talent. She repeats that she does not like to boast about herself, saying she is reserved, just like her art. She believes that loud things can become boring, but her work is anything but boring. It deserves more recognition, and the interviewer is willing to promote her talent, even if it makes her uncomfortable."
CAE_61,"**Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success**

Daniel Goleman explores the essential 'people skills' needed to succeed in your career.

A. The rules for work are changing. We are now evaluated not only by our intelligence or training but also by how well we manage ourselves and interact with others. This new standard is increasingly used to decide who gets hired or promoted. It helps identify who is likely to excel and who may not. These skills are important for our future job prospects and are different from what we learned in school. Doing well on tests is not as important anymore. The focus is now on social skills and personal qualities, such as initiative, empathy, adaptability, and persuasiveness—collectively known as emotional intelligence.

B. In a time when job security is uncertain, personal qualities are becoming more important in the workplace. For years, these qualities were referred to by various names, such as 'character' or 'soft skills.' Now, we have a clearer understanding of these abilities, which we call 'emotional intelligence.' This is defined as the ability to understand and manage our own feelings and those of others, using emotions to guide our thoughts and actions. In the workplace, emotional intelligence includes self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills. Some people think it just means 'being nice,' but it can also mean being direct and honest when necessary. It does not mean expressing feelings without control; rather, it involves managing emotions so that they are expressed appropriately, allowing people to work together effectively.

C. More businesses recognize that promoting emotional intelligence is vital for management. The more complex the job, the more important emotional intelligence becomes. A lack of these skills can limit a person's ability to use their technical knowledge. While some people have succeeded despite lacking emotional intelligence, as work becomes more collaborative, companies that foster teamwork gain a competitive advantage. In today's workplace, where teamwork and customer focus are emphasized, emotional intelligence is essential for success in every job worldwide.

D. Unlike IQ, which changes little, emotional intelligence can grow throughout our lives as we learn from experiences. Studies show that most people become better at managing their emotions, motivating themselves, and developing empathy and social skills over time. This growth in emotional intelligence is often called maturity. We can learn these skills and add them to our toolkit for success, especially in a time when job stability is uncertain. Emotional intelligence is not a guaranteed solution for struggling organizations, but ignoring the human element can hinder overall effectiveness."
CAE_52,"Text: 'Should the media profit from content they do not own? Digital cameras and camera phones have made it easier to capture important news events, but social media has changed the way we share photographs. With news often breaking on social networks, some journalists are now using these platforms for images as events unfold. However, some reporters have shared user-generated content (UGC) without asking for permission. Although there is guidance stating that images on social media can be used without permission in special cases or when there is strong public interest, the question of whether this is ethical remains debated. Research shows that about one in ten people would film or photograph a news event, indicating that UGC will play a significant role in the future of media. To maintain a good relationship with the public, the media must ensure that individuals are fairly compensated for their work and that permission is always obtained.'"
CAE_28,"**Text: Ancient Chinese Medicine in the West**

Acupuncture is a practice that is over two thousand years old. It is part of traditional Chinese medicine, which also includes herbal remedies, massage, diet, and exercise. While acupuncture can treat many health issues, it is most often used in the West for pain relief. Some general practitioners, midwives, and physiotherapists use it regularly to help patients with pain.

**A. What is it?**  
Traditional Chinese medicine views health as a balance of energy in the mind, body, and spirit. This energy, called Qi (pronounced ""chee""), flows through the body along pathways known as meridians. There are twelve main meridians, each connected to an internal organ, and many smaller ones that deliver Qi to every cell. When the flow of Qi is blocked or weak, it can lead to illness or weakness. During a visit to an acupuncturist, they will check for imbalances in your Qi by feeling your pulse, looking at your tongue, and assessing your overall health. They will ask about your medical history, current health, mental state, and your eating and sleeping habits. Acupuncturists use fine needles that are inserted into the skin. They may also use heat from burning herbs or apply pressure to specific points to help Qi flow.

**B. Acupuncture Points**  
The acupuncture points are linked to the meridians and may not be near the area of pain. Many people report feeling a mild ache or tingling when the needle is gently moved. This can be done by hand or with a machine that provides electrical stimulation. Acupuncturists believe this sensation indicates that the needle has reached the Qi in a meridian. There are over three hundred acupuncture points on the main meridians, with many more used less frequently.

**C. Scientific Understanding**  
Even without accepting traditional Chinese medicine, many doctors in the West recognize that acupuncture can help relieve pain. Scientific studies suggest that stimulating certain nerves can block pain signals from reaching the brain. Some researchers believe that acupuncture points release natural pain-relieving chemicals called endorphins.

**D. Types of Pain Treated**  
Many people with long-term pain turn to acupuncture as a last option. Commonly treated conditions include back pain, sports injuries, arthritis, headaches, and pain after surgery. Acupuncturists also claim to help with menstrual pain, facial nerve pain, and pain in terminally ill patients.

**E. Modern Use of Acupuncture**  
Although acupuncture has been practiced in China for over 2,000 years, its use as an alternative to anesthesia during surgery began in the 1950s. This development helped convince some doctors outside China of its effectiveness. Today, acupuncture is used in various surgeries in China, from tonsillectomies to heart surgery. Needles may be used alone, with electrical stimulation, or alongside medications. While some patients report little to no pain, experiences can vary. Acupuncturists argue that acupuncture has fewer side effects than traditional anesthesia, such as nausea, and allows for quicker recovery.

**F. Effectiveness of Acupuncture**  
Clinical trials on acupuncture can be challenging, but studies show that 50 to 80 percent of people find it effective for chronic pain. Acupuncturists generally report similar success rates. They acknowledge that it may not work for everyone and that individual responses can differ. Traditional acupuncturists suggest that patients may need six to seven visits to feel significant relief, but some improvement can be noticed after just two or three sessions.

**G. A Different Perspective on Pain**  
Western and Chinese medicine have different views on pain. Acupuncturists take a holistic approach, looking at the whole person rather than just specific symptoms. They spend time diagnosing the problem and identifying underlying issues with the Qi. They also consider external factors that may affect pain, such as weather conditions and the nature of the pain (sharp, dull, throbbing, etc.). This comprehensive approach is not typically used by most medical doctors.

**H. Traditional vs. Modern Practices**  
Some medical professionals have training in traditional acupuncture, while others, including many general practitioners, prefer scientific explanations. Traditional acupuncturists believe that applying traditional Chinese medicine is essential for achieving deep healing, which can be hard to measure in studies. It is important to choose a qualified acupuncturist, who should refer you to a medical doctor for further investigation if needed."

P.D. James is a well-known crime writer whose gentle appearance hides a clever and imaginative mind. Her full name is Phyllis Dorothy James, and she has a calm presence that makes it easy to picture her as a headmistress of a girls' school. However, she is actually quite shy. She admits that her main character, Adam Dalgliesh, the detective in her books, is based on herself, or how she might have been if she were a man. Dalgliesh likes to solve crimes alone, just like P.D. James prefers to write in private. She feels she can write anywhere as long as she has complete privacy.

Although she is modest about her success, P.D. James is one of the most famous crime writers in Britain, with 12 popular detective novels read by millions worldwide. She admires her friend Ruth Rendell, especially her psychological novels written under the name Barbara Vine. P.D. James enjoys reading books by women authors like Iris Murdoch, Anita Brookner, and Penelope Lively, but she also appreciates male writers like Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh, whom she believes were the best novelists of their time.

P.D. James found success later in life. She was 42 when her first crime novel, *Cover Her Face*, was published. Born in Oxford, she grew up in Cambridge after her family moved there when she was 11. She met her husband, who was a university student, in Cambridge. She chose this city as the setting for her book *An Unsuitable Job For A Woman*.

Her life has had its challenges. Her husband, Connor Bantry White, returned from World War II very ill. P.D. James had to work long hours to support him and their two young daughters, Clare and Jane. Although she had many ideas for stories, she struggled to find time to write. Thankfully, her husband’s parents helped care for the children during those tough years.

While working full-time in administration for the National Health Service, she used her strong organizational skills. At one point, she managed five psychiatric outpatient clinics. She then spent 11 years at the Home Office, first in the Police Department and later in the Criminal Law section, focusing on juvenile crime. While working in forensic science, she became used to seeing dead bodies, but her interest was not in death itself. Instead, she was drawn to the structure of writing a crime novel. She has always loved reading detective stories and knew she wanted to be a writer.

P.D. James did not want to write about her own life experiences. She saw writing detective stories as a great way to learn how to be a serious novelist while keeping her own life separate. Over time, she realized that it was possible to follow the traditional rules of a detective story and still create a meaningful novel about people. She believes that writing detective stories helps bring order to chaos. Solving a crime shows the value of life, even if that life is difficult. She notes that nobody truly enjoys violence."

**The Pen is Mightier than the Psychoanalyst**

The study of handwriting to understand a person's character is becoming more popular. In some countries, if you apply for a job, you will likely be asked to provide a sample of your handwriting. This handwriting sample can significantly influence whether you are considered suitable for the job. Handwriting analysis, known as graphology, is recognized as a real science in many places. Researchers believe it can help identify certain health issues, like heart disease and cancer, and can show psychological states and emotional problems. 

More companies are using handwriting analysis for job guidance and as a supplement to interviews. Many large companies now hire graphologists to examine the handwriting of job candidates. However, many doctors and psychiatrists are skeptical about the usefulness of graphology. Patricia Marne, a professional graphologist with over 20 years of experience, argues that it should be taken more seriously. She believes handwriting can reveal psychological traits and some medical conditions. 

Marne states, ""Handwriting is a strong indicator of social class and intelligence. It can also help assess mental abilities, whether someone should focus on arts or sciences, and whether they have a deceitful or honest character."" She claims graphology can be especially helpful in identifying possible criminal behavior: ""Criminals often have disturbed handwriting, which is usually poorly shaped. Many come from difficult backgrounds and have emotional issues, which can show in childish handwriting and repeated letters.""

Marne explains that she can determine if people are honest, manipulative, or reliable. For example, young male offenders often have very tall letters, suggesting they live in a fantasy world. Graphologists can also predict if someone is about to become violent, if they are under extreme stress, or if they have psychopathic traits. Handwriting can even indicate potential suicides. 

She adds that heart and lung problems can also be reflected in handwriting. ""You cannot diagnose someone from just one sample unless the writing is clearly shaky or disturbed. However, if handwriting changes over time or becomes disjointed, or if a signature changes suddenly, it could mean something serious has happened."" A significant emotional upset can also cause a temporary change in a person's signature.

Marne believes handwriting can reveal other psychological traits. For instance, people whose letters connect in 'threads' may be clever but deceitful. Those who write mostly in capital letters may be hiding their true selves. Light pressure in writing shows sensitivity and low energy. Original handwriting, which differs from standard styles, indicates confidence and creativity. Disconnected writing often suggests loneliness. Very small signatures can show insecurity, while circles over the letter 'i' indicate a desire for attention. Heavy crossing of the letter 't' can suggest intolerance and a condescending attitude.

Marne states that it takes six years of study and experience to analyze handwriting accurately, along with empathy and intuition. She believes more research is needed to establish graphology as a scientific field. She thinks this will happen soon, saying, ""It is actually more accurate than psychoanalysis because it reveals a person's entire history, including emotional crises, without needing to ask questions that might lead to false answers.""

Despite these interesting claims, there is little solid evidence to support them. Some psychiatrists criticize graphology, arguing that handwriting is influenced by education, artistic skills, and the type of writing taught, and that it has no deeper meaning."

Is your office working well? Fresh air and good chairs are important for a happy and healthy workplace, according to a new survey. We visited four different offices to see how healthy and happy they are as work environments. Our expert panel included a building health consultant, an ergonomist who studies working conditions, and an occupational psychologist. Here are their opinions.

**Office A: Advertising Agency**  
*Building Health Consultant:* This office is very simple; it has no central heating or mechanical ventilation, and the windows open directly onto the street. It’s surprising that this space works, but the small, active team seems happy. They adjust to the seasons by opening doors and roof panels or using electric heaters, much like they do at home. This may be the reason: the seven-person team has created a comfortable, home-like work environment without outside rules.  
*Ergonomist:* The furniture here is mismatched and creates poor working postures. The chairs are old, most are not adjustable, and many are broken. However, the staff have a varied work schedule that they control, which includes office work, client meetings, and presentations. This variety helps reduce fatigue, boredom, and muscle problems.  
*Occupational Psychologist:* The staff enjoy the variety of work and the flexible office space. They feel the office is ""just the right size""—small enough to know what colleagues are doing, but large enough to focus on personal tasks. I found the office attractive and fun, showing both efficiency and creativity.

**Office B: News Service**  
*Building Health Consultant:* This office may not be very exciting, but it is comfortable and the staff do not dislike it. The air quality and maintenance are good, helped by a No Smoking policy.  
*Ergonomist:* I was not surprised to find that the company had hired an ergonomist. The chairs are excellent, and the lighting and computer equipment are good. The space is adequate, but the layout could be better. However, the environment feels impersonal and dull, with grey, bare walls.  
*Occupational Psychologist:* The walls are mostly bare, except for year planners and a poster about maternity rights. Most staff have been there for at least five years, and relationships are good. The office could improve if the desks were arranged to make sharing information easier. Success stories or project updates could be displayed on the walls.

**Office C: Bank**  
*Building Health Consultant:* This office gets mixed reactions from its workers. It feels like being in a glass case, where people can see and be seen. Despite a mix of smokers and non-smokers in a small space, the air does not feel stale. Even standing close to a smoker, I could not smell the cigarette.  
*Ergonomist:* The office is very standard and uninspiring. The desks are just adequate, and not all chairs meet the needs of computer users. Many computer screens are on low desk units, which is not suitable for modern equipment.  
*Occupational Psychologist:* The staff support each other well and have good technology. Many communication awards are displayed. The wood paneling and brown carpet create a somewhat serious atmosphere, but the office is busy.

**Office D: Newspaper**  
*Building Health Consultant:* There is not much good to say about this building. The air conditioning is poor, causing big temperature changes. The space is cluttered, and most people have too little desk space. The office is very dusty, with many places for dust to collect. The roof also gathers dust, which falls on those below.  
*Ergonomist:* The furniture looks more suitable for a workshop than a modern office. Many chairs are not helpful for keyboard users, especially those shorter than 1.75 m. Most chairs are old, lack proper adjustments, and have armrests that make it hard to get close to the desk.  
*Occupational Psychologist:* The old brown chairs, dirty carpets, and dust everywhere show a need for improvement. The office needs cleaning, and individual achievements should be recognized more. The air conditioning must be fixed immediately, especially with so many smokers. When we visited, there were few conversations; everyone seemed stressed and focused on deadlines. The company should encourage teamwork."
CAE_38,"**Chewing Gum Culture**

Chewing gum is popular and enjoyed by many people in America, with around 12 million sticks chewed every day. This ancient practice has turned into a big business. Each stick of gum has fewer than ten calories, but it is considered food and must meet the standards set by the American Food and Drug Administration.

Today’s chewing gum is mostly made from synthetic materials, including pine resins and softeners that help keep the flavor and improve the texture. However, this was not always the case. The ancient Greeks chewed a resin from the mastic tree, which grows mainly in Greece and Turkey. Women in Greece used mastic gum to clean their teeth and freshen their breath. American colonists learned from the Native Americans in New England and chewed resin from spruce trees. In the early 1800s, lumps of spruce for chewing were sold in the eastern United States, marking the beginning of commercial chewing gum in the country.

Modern chewing gum began in the late 1860s with the discovery of chicle, a milky substance from the sapodilla tree found in Central America. Gum made from chicle was smoother and more enjoyable to chew, leading to the growth of a new industry. However, attempts to grow sapodilla trees commercially have not been successful. As the demand for chewing gum increased, synthetic alternatives were created.

Today, the few remaining chicle gatherers, known as chicleros, struggle to make a living. They trek for miles to collect sapodilla sap in very humid conditions. Their work environment is dangerous, with poisonous snakes and many insects, including a fly that lays eggs in their ears and noses. Despite these risks, experienced chicleros climb trees to collect the sap, which they carry back to a camp where it is boiled and made into bricks. Life at the camp is tough, with a boring diet mainly of maize and local alcohol made from sugar cane. 

Even though the work is hard, chicleros worry about their jobs. Not long ago, the United States imported 7,000 tonnes of chicle each year from Central America, but last year only 200 tonnes were collected in Mexico's Yucatan peninsula. As chewing gum sales have increased, manufacturers have turned to synthetic materials to lower costs and meet demand.

Gum producers are also finding creative ways to market their products. They claim that chewing gum helps people relax, boosts energy, and reduces stress. During both world wars, soldiers were often given gum. One of the main benefits of chewing gum is that it can help reduce tooth decay. When we eat, plaque acid forms, but our saliva helps neutralize this acid and provides important minerals. Gum manufacturers say that chewing for 20 minutes can increase saliva flow.

Research continues on new textures and flavors for gum. Glycerine and other vegetable oils are now used to create the gum base. Most new flavors are artificial, but some still require natural ingredients. Additionally, a large area of land in America is dedicated to growing mint, which is used in the two most popular chewing gums in the world."

**A. INDIA - GHANERAO HOTEL, RAJASTHAN**  
Ghanerao Hotel is located at the edge of the Aravalli Hills in a small village known for its craftsmen. It combines the calmness of an English country house with Indian culture. The Ghanerao family has lived here for 400 years, and now Sajjan Singh and his wife welcome guests into their home. The facilities are basic, with hot water provided in buckets, but this simplicity adds to the hotel's charm.

**B. NEW ZEALAND - HERMITAGE HOTEL, MOUNT COOK**  
One of my favorite hotels is the Hermitage Hotel on New Zealand's South Island, which I discovered while climbing. After being flown close to the top of a glacier and climbing to the peak, we had to walk down. To my surprise, we found this hotel at the bottom, set in stunning, wild countryside. Arriving tired and finding such luxury, with a pianist playing Cole Porter, was an unforgettable experience.

**C. MAURITIUS - PARADIS HOTEL**  
On the southwest coast of Mauritius, the Paradis Hotel is located on a quiet peninsula. The road to the hotel winds along the coast, passing empty beaches where only fishermen are present. Although the hotel is large and offers many free water sports, you can easily find solitude along nine kilometers of private beach. Swim a little way out into the Indian Ocean, and the hotel becomes hidden behind palm trees. In the evening, when everyone has left, you can enjoy the peaceful beach as the sky darkens.

**D. ST LUCIA - LADERA HOTEL**  
The Ladera Hotel in St Lucia has one of the most stunning views in the Caribbean. It is quiet and located at 1,000 feet above sea level, with open rooms that look out between the twin peaks of the Pitons to the Caribbean Sea. The hotel features colonial-style furniture made of mahogany and greenheart wood, and has four-poster beds with muslin netting.

**E. TURKEY - THE SPLENDID HOTEL, ISTANBUL**  
The Splendid Hotel, located on Buyukada in the Princes Islands, is an ideal escape from the noise of Istanbul. The islands are just an hour away by boat and are very picturesque. There are no cars, only horse-drawn carriages and beautiful wooden buildings from the 1920s. The Splendid Hotel, made entirely of wood and painted white with red domes, is modeled after a historic hotel on the French Riviera. Although it is a bit worn down now, it still retains its charm.

**F. FRANCE - CHATEAU D'ETOGES, EPERNAY**  
In the small village of Etoges, in the Champagne region, there is a lovely seventeenth-century chateau surrounded by a moat with two swans. This chateau, which was recently a family home, has 20 unique rooms, some with four-poster beds, and one even has a billiard table. They offer special weekend rates for two nights, including breakfast and dinner, along with complimentary champagne from their own brand.

**G. KENYA - THE FAIRVIEW HOTEL, NAIROBI**  
The Fairview Hotel is a rare find in Africa—a comfortable hotel that avoids flashy luxury. It is a popular stop for travelers recovering from safaris and planning their next adventure. Guests often arrive, see the beautiful gardens and inviting rooms, and decide to stay for a week. There are even apartments for those who want to stay for several months. The hotel is set on Nairobi Hill, away from the busy city center, making it a perfect place to enjoy the stunning African sunset while sipping beer and looking forward to a hearty dinner.

**H. ITALY - HOTEL SPLENDIDO, PORTOFINO**  
The Hotel Splendido was first signed into by the Duke of Windsor, and since then, many famous people have visited, including Lauren Bacall and Humphrey Bogart. Today, you might meet a billionaire or a rubber-tyre heiress. This former monastery turned villa and now hotel is still splendid, offering a touch of glamour for any weekend getaway. The restaurant serves simple yet delicious food, and the hotel features beautiful Persian rugs and homemade pasta."
CAE_47,"Text: 'Sue Brown is a hotel inspector. Christopher Middleton observed her during an inspection. Just one minute into the annual check, things are already going wrong for the Globe Hotel, although the staff are unaware of it. The receptionist is busy giving room rates over the phone to a potential guest and does not notice Sue and Christopher. ""She hasn't even acknowledged us,"" Sue whispers. ""Very poor."" This is a common mistake during the arrival phase, one Sue has seen many times in her 11 years as an inspector. ""But this isn't just any three-star hotel,"" she argues. ""It has three red stars, and I expect better."" Having red stars means the Globe is among the top 130 hotels out of 4,000 in the guide published by her organization. However, even before the cold welcome, there is an uncomfortable atmosphere. Access from the car park is through an unmanned door with a buzzer, leading to a long, empty corridor to the hotel entrance. ""Again, not what I expected,"" Sue comments. Could it get worse? Yes. ""We have no record of your booking,"" the receptionist says in a cheerful voice. It turns out that out of the hotel's 15 rooms, 12 are empty that night. One room is on the top floor, but it does not meet Sue's standards: it is stuffy, and there is a large hole in the wall behind the wardrobe. When she started her career, she earned a reputation for being tough. ""I was known as the Woman in Black,"" she remembers, ""which was funny because I never wore black. And I was never that tough."" The next morning, after paying her bill, she reveals her identity to the hotel’s general manager, Robin Greaves. His face shows fear. Before she says anything else, he apologizes for a bad smell in the main lounge. ""We think there's a blocked drain,"" he sighs. ""The whole floor might need to be replaced."" Sue kindly suggests that he should also tell his staff to be more careful about showing guests to the room. ""It might be better to guide them to the other lounge,"" she advises. Greaves nods sadly and takes notes. He has only been at the Globe for five months and struggles to believe Sue when she says her feedback is for the hotel's benefit in the long run. However, not everything is negative. Emma, the assistant manager, and Trudy, the young waitress, receive praise for sharing information about the hotel's 400-year history. Dinner also meets the standards to keep the hotel's two-rosette food rating, encouraging Greaves to ask, ""What do we need to do to get three rosettes?"" Sue's advice includes, ""Don't serve a collapsing pudding."" Greaves' brief excitement fades. Sue's job is to express the complaints that many customers do not have the courage to voice. ""Sometimes it can be very sensitive. I remember a woman complained that I got her son fired. All I could say was the truth: he served me apple pie with his fingers."" She receives letters with false claims about everything from being arrogant to asking for bribes. ""You get used to it, but it still hurts,"" she says. Sue must not only share her findings verbally with the hotel manager but also send a full written report. After all, they pay for her services (there is an annual fee to be included in the guide). However, being recognized with red stars makes it worthwhile. It is good for Greaves to hear that Sue will not recommend taking away the Globe's red stars. The bad news is that another inspector will return in the next two months to ensure everything is fixed. ""Good,"" Greaves smiles, though not convincingly. ""We'll look forward to that."""

Doug Scott, a mountaineer, shares his experiences of climbing the highest peaks on each continent, known as the Seven Summits. He began this journey later in life and will describe each mountain in the order he climbed them.

**A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)**  
While resting in a snow cave below the summit, Doug and his climbing partner, Dougal Haston, discussed sleeping bags. Doug found this odd since they were alone. He thought it might be due to low oxygen levels and even started talking to his feet, which were getting cold. They were not just worried about surviving but also about how well they could survive. Over the next two days, Doug reflected on their time on the summit ridge and felt confident climbing with Dougal. He focused on finding a better rhythm to reach the summit.

**B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)**  
This mountain is known for being very dangerous. In April 1976, Doug and Dougal arrived at the Kahiltna Glacier and spent four days carrying equipment and food. After the first day, they realized how challenging their climb would be. They followed a route established in 1967 but decided to take a new path to the summit. They climbed with all their gear on their backs, which was a first for this area. After a tough climb, they finally reached the summit and celebrated their success.

**C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m)**  
In September 1976, Doug and his friend Paul Braithwaite flew to Nairobi to climb Mt. Kenya. However, they ended up climbing Kilimanjaro instead. They got lost in the jungles at the base, which was serious because water was hard to find. On the second day, they found a rock pool, which was a relief. They tried to climb a steep ice wall but decided to take a safer route to the summit.

**D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)**  
In January 1992, Doug and his wife, Sharu, arrived at Punta del Inca and met a fellow climber, Phil Erscheler. Phil invited them to join his group climbing a less crowded route. After waiting for bad weather to pass, they set off. The Polish Glacier was icy and challenging, so they chose to join the standard route, where many climbers were. They faced strong winds as they reached the summit and camped outside a refuge. At base camp, they met climbers from the Jakarta Mountaineering Club, who encouraged Doug to consider climbing all Seven Summits.

**E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)**  
Doug learned that climbing Vinson Massif could be funded by guiding others. In November 1992, his team traveled to the South Pole. During this time, the sun never sets, and the atmosphere is refreshing. On December 7, they set out for the summit. Despite strong winds and freezing temperatures, they all reached the top within eight hours, although visibility was poor due to a storm.

**F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)**  
In the summer of 1994, Doug's team gathered in St Petersburg and traveled to Terskol, near Elbrus. After acclimatizing, they took a cable car to 3,900m and then walked to a refuge at 4,200m. Two days later, they faced strong winds while climbing. They thought they had reached the summit but discovered there was still more to climb. They returned to the refuge and descended the volcano the next day.

**G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)**  
On the expedition to Carstensz, Doug aimed to create a new route and spend time with the local Dani people. They were warned about potential dangers from bandits but decided to proceed. On May 12, they began climbing. The weather improved, and two team members moved ahead while Doug and another member climbed more slowly. They reached the summit by 11 am, and Doug received a warm welcome for completing his seventh summit. Mission accomplished!"

Style influences many aspects of our lives today, from clothing to home decor and accessories. Jo Foley shares the latest trends for fashion enthusiasts this year.

**Ned Ingham: Dress Designer**  
Ned Ingham creates beautiful, romantic wedding dresses. He advises people to steer clear of traditional, stiff designs and frilly styles, opting instead for simpler looks. Ingham has been designing wedding dresses since he was a child. At 16, he attended fashion school, where he learned how to cut and make clothes. However, you don’t need to be a bride to wear an Ingham dress; he also designs elegant evening dresses in modern colors and fabrics. For those who prefer classic styles, he offers a timeless navy-blue summer suit, a staple in women's wardrobes throughout the 20th century, but he gives it a fresh twist.

**Sally Quail: Jeweller**  
Sally Quail, who previously worked for an art dealer, has no formal training in jewellery design. She began designing her own engagement ring when she couldn’t find one she liked. This led her to start her own design business in 1990. Now, her jewellery is popular among many celebrities. Her signature style features large semi-precious stones set in gold, creating stunning necklaces, bracelets, and rings inspired by 18th-century designs. Recently, she has started using diamonds, saying, ""I reached that moment in every woman's life when she wants a diamond.""

**Lily Grimson: Handbag Designer**  
Just four years after entering the competitive fashion industry, Lily Grimson has had two of her designs chosen for a major exhibition, despite only taking an introductory art and design course. Her handbags are always noticed, as they are handmade in the UK. A Grimson handbag is more than just a bag; it exudes glamour, whether made from fine calfskin or luxurious silk. The combination of style and quality makes her bags unique.

**Peter Little: Hairdresser**  
For over 20 years, Peter Little has styled the hair of many famous people. He believes most women want hair that looks natural and is easy to manage at home. His unique approach ensures that clients don’t look like they just left a salon. However, this casual style comes at a price—£250 for the first appointment, with a three-month waiting list. Leveraging his celebrity status, Peter has created his own line of hairdryers and styling tools, allowing those who can’t visit his salon to achieve their desired looks at home.

**Penny Pratt: Florist**  
Penny Pratt runs a small flower shop and works as a consultant for a large supermarket chain, providing floral ideas for top restaurants. Remarkably, she has no formal qualifications in floristry and left her teaching job ten years ago to pursue a new path. Her modern and simple floral arrangements have won numerous design awards, helping her establish her own London Flower School. She has also enjoyed successful lecture tours in Japan and the USA. Penny believes that flower arrangements today should be simple yet striking, with fewer leaves, which can be too large. For wedding bouquets, she emphasizes that all flowers should be of the same type."
FCE_19,"**Text: Five-Star Luxury and Modern Technology**

The new five-star Merrion Hotel in Dublin combines luxury with the latest technology. It was created by transforming four large 18th-century houses, a project that took nearly two years and involved extensive research into what customers want. This approach allowed for the installation of advanced technology that benefits both staff and guests.

General Manager Peter MacCann expects his staff to know guests by name, but he uses a computer system to track guests' preferences. This system, which cost £250,000 to set up, helps the hotel provide a special experience for returning guests. For instance, if a guest requests specific music CDs during their first stay, those same CDs will be ready for them on their next visit. This is possible because of the guest-history feature that records individual preferences.

Room temperature is another common concern for hotel guests. The Merrion has a high-tech system that allows guests to adjust the temperature within three degrees of the standard 18°C. Additionally, the front desk can change the temperature in any room between 14°C and 25°C.

The hotel caters especially to business travelers, who make up about 65% of its clientele. To meet their needs, the hotel has equipped each room with three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that also works as a photocopier and printer, and video-conferencing capabilities. The hotel has also prepared for future technological advancements by installing extra cables and renting televisions, which can be easily replaced with newer models. DVD recorders can also be upgraded as needed.

Despite all this technology, MacCann emphasizes that they want guests to feel comfortable, not overwhelmed. The hotel has 145 spacious and well-furnished rooms that are inviting and cozy. Guests can also enjoy a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a lovely garden.

The food at the Merrion is of high quality, with Chef Patrick Guilbaud, who has two Michelin stars, running the restaurant. Moving his restaurant to the hotel has allowed him to create a modern kitchen and improve parking facilities. For the hotel, having a renowned restaurant adds value without financial risk. With the help of technology and a skilled staff, the Merrion Hotel is poised for success."

Artist Susan Shepherd is well-known for her flower paintings, which are inspired by the large garden around her house. This garden is filled with her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wildly and spread throughout the garden. The two long flower borders along the paved path that runs from east to west are full of color, shape, and structure. Much of this beauty comes from the previous owners, who were passionate gardeners and left behind plants that Susan loves. She also kept the gardener, Danny. ""In fact, it was really his garden,"" she says. ""We got along well. At first, he would say, 'Oh, it's not worth it' about some of the things I wanted to add, but when I told him I wanted to paint them, he understood my vision.""

Susan prefers to paint detailed studies of individual plants instead of the entire garden, although she sometimes paints groups of plants in their natural setting. More often, she picks the flowers and takes them to her studio. ""I don't set everything up at once,"" she explains. ""I take one flower out and paint it, which can take a few days, and then I bring in another one to add to the painting. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.""

Her busiest time is spring and early summer when the tulips bloom, followed by the poppies. ""They all bloom together, and you're so busy,"" she says. However, she also finds beauty in the gradual decay of flowers. For example, with tulips, ""you bring them in and put them in water, then leave them for a day, and they change shape. They open up and look amazing. At first, they seem dull, but they keep changing with twists and turns.""

Susan has always loved plants. ""I studied botany in school and used to collect wildflowers from the countryside,"" she says. ""I wasn't really interested in gardening back then; in fact, I didn't like garden flowers because they reminded me of fake ones sold in some shops. To me, only wildflowers were real. I was fascinated by how they could grow in tough places, like cracks in rocks or on cliffs.""

Today, her garden includes many plants from distant lands, but they thrive just as well in her garden as they do in their native places like China or the Himalayas. She has a relaxed attitude towards her garden, similar to a caring aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don't cause serious trouble. With two upcoming exhibitions to prepare for and plenty of inspiration right outside her door, finding time to work in the garden has been challenging. She now hires an extra gardener, but she knows that to stay connected to her art, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""

Many trees in the Brackham area were destroyed in the severe storms that March. The town lost two large lime trees from the old market square. The loss of these trees changed the look of the town center completely, upsetting many of its traditional residents. Normally, Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, the head of the local police, would have been among those upset. However, during the storm, when the wind knocked down the walnut tree in his garden, Pelham was too unwell to notice. A strong man, he was experiencing a serious illness for the first time in his life due to bronchitis. When he first felt a headache and tightness in his chest, his wife, Molly, urged him to see a doctor. Believing the police needed him, he ignored her advice and tried to keep working. This decision made him forgetful and irritable. It was only when his colleague, Sergeant Lloyd, took him to the doctor that he finally agreed to go. By then, he was too weak to argue. Soon after, she took him to the pharmacy for his antibiotics and then home to his wife, who sent him straight to bed.

On Thursday morning, when Molly told him that the walnut tree had fallen during the night, Pelham could hardly believe it. That evening, he weakly asked if the house was damaged, and felt relieved to hear it was not, before pulling the sheets over his head. It was not until Saturday, when the antibiotics worked, his fever went down, and he got up, that he realized the loss of the walnut tree had changed the living room's appearance forever. The Pelhams' large house was in a big garden. It had been expensive, but Pelham had no regrets about buying it. The green garden had given them a sense of privacy. Now, however, the storm had changed that. Before, the living room view included the beautiful walnut tree, which did not darken the room because there was also a window on the opposite wall. The tree created interesting patterns of light and shadow that hid the worn furniture they had brought from their old house. Without the tree, the room felt harshly bright, revealing the shabby furniture. The view from the window was not pleasant either. The tall house next door, which had been hidden by the tree, now loomed over them with its unattractive purple bricks and pipes. It had many upstairs windows, all seeming to watch the Pelhams' every move. 

“Doesn’t it look awful?” Pelham said weakly to his wife. But Molly, standing in the doorway, sounded more happy than upset. “I’ve been saying that since we moved here. We need to buy a new sofa, no matter the cost.”"
FCE_16,"**Text: Living in the Valley**

We had been living in our valley for sixteen months when we first understood the dangers that could come from the surrounding hills and threaten our survival. It was the year when the storms arrived early, even before November ended. Until then, we felt safe and protected in our valley below the hills. Soon, snow began to fall. Within a day, it was about 15 centimeters deep. It almost completely blocked our lane and made the path by the stream slippery and dangerous. However, in the hills, the snow was much deeper and lasted longer. Up there, the wind blew fiercely. In our valley, we only felt sudden gusts of wind; the trees swayed, but their branches stayed strong. Still, we knew we had reasons to worry. The snow and wind were annoying, but they did not really trouble us much. The real threat was the river, the Ryburn, which usually flowed gently. It reminded us of what could happen if the water from the hills was not controlled by a series of dams built many years ago.

Soon, the snow started to melt. Day after day, we watched dark clouds gather over the hills to the west. These grey clouds spread over the valleys, twisting and turning, warning us of what was coming. We had seen enough of the sky; now we began to watch the river, which was becoming fuller and wilder each day. The snow was washed away as more rain fell from the clouds, but high in the hills, the reservoir was filling up and getting close to a dangerous level. Then it happened – for the first time in years, the reservoir overflowed. It was like a mini Niagara Falls, as the water surged over the dam and poured into the stream below. The river seemed wild as the water rushed down towards its lower stretches. Just a couple of meters from our cottage, the stream looked furious beneath the bridge. It was much deeper than we had ever seen it so close to our home, crashing against its banks. For three days, we hoped it would stay below its wall. Luckily, our hopes were answered as the dam held, and the waters began to go down.

In the past, before the dam was built, the river had flooded nearby villages in such a rage. Now, the dam controls the river's flow, and usually, everything is fine. The large amount of water from the hills, caused by snow and heavy rain, stays behind the dam, with only occasional overflow. Because of this protection, we can enjoy the huge clouds over the valley and appreciate the great power of the river. Thanks to the dam, we feel that our home in the valley is still safe and secure."

Film critic Mark Adams reflects on his ten years of work for a newspaper called The Front Page. Writing film articles for The Front Page was my first real job. Before that, I had done some reviews—books for other newspapers, films for a magazine, and various tasks for the radio. This is how I met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, who also worked in radio and television. He hired me, but Tom was not mainly a journalist, or he would have been more careful in choosing his team. 

Initially, he wanted a group of critics to cover art forms that didn’t need special knowledge: books, TV, theatre, film, and radio. We would have a weekly lunch to discuss the artistic topics Tom wanted us to cover, and there would be guests to make it more enjoyable. At that time, it felt like a dream: a new newspaper, and I was part of the team. It seemed unlikely that a new paper could succeed in a crowded market. I even thought a millionaire was pretending to hire me. I lacked self-confidence. The first time I saw someone reading the newspaper on the London Underground, with one of my reviews, I felt embarrassed.

Tom's idea for a team of critics didn’t work out. It was a good plan, but we didn’t meet as intended, so we communicated by phone. It turned out that the public preferred to have a reviewer focus on one subject area, so I chose film. Without Tom's initial support, we might not have developed the current system, where I write a detailed weekly piece, usually about one film. This way of working suits me well. I wouldn’t want the typical film critic role, which requires reviewing every new film. That routine would quickly make me tired. I would dread sitting down on a Monday morning, thinking, ""What terrible film do I have to watch now?""—a thought often heard in screening rooms worldwide.

The freedom I have allows me to expand my arguments or, in a dull week, to create something interesting from little. But what is my role in the public eye? I believe people choose films based on stars, publicity, or the director. There is also loyalty to certain types of films. It is rare for someone who dislikes westerns to buy a ticket for one after reading a review, or for a romantic film lover to skip a love story because of a review. So, if a film review isn’t really a guide for consumers, what is it? I don’t feel I must be ""right"" about a movie. I also don’t think there should be a set number of ""great"" or ""bad"" films each year. My job is to present an argument. I’m not a judge, and I don’t want to be one."

Why would a schoolgirl want to swim 1500 meters, cycle 40 kilometers, and then run 10 kilometers? Because ""it's fun."" 

**Wanted:** A sports-loving training partner for a triathlete, preferably female. This is a chance to work with a potential Olympic champion. You should really enjoy distance running (regular 15 km sessions), distance swimming (training in cold rivers is helpful), and distance cycling (enjoying 100 km rides is a plus). You must be able to do all three activities without resting.

The triathlon is becoming one of the most popular Olympic sports. It has attracted large crowds who are both fascinated and shocked by athletes who swim 1500 meters, cycle 40 kilometers, and then run 10 kilometers without stopping. It may be exciting for the spectators, but why do triathletes push their bodies so hard? What makes a talented 17-year-old, who does well in school, give up so much for this challenging sport?

Melanie Sears has not yet learned the usual phrases about personal satisfaction and mental challenges that most athletes use when asked similar questions. ""You swim 1500 meters, then run out of the water and jump on your bike, still wet. Of course, then you get cold. After the 40 km bike ride, you have to run 10 km, which feels long when you are tired. But it's really fun, and it's all worth it in the end,"" she says.

Melanie entered her first triathlon at 14. ""I won the junior section, but I was the only junior competing. It felt so easy that I waved at my teammates as I went around."" Feeling confident, she entered the National Championships. Although she had the second fastest swim and the fastest run, she did not place well. ""I was following a man, and suddenly we reached the sea. We realized we had gone the wrong way. I ended up cycling 20 kilometers too far. I cried the whole time I was running."" But she did not give up and is determined to keep going. ""Sometimes I wish I could stop, because then the pain would end, but I am afraid that if I stop just once, I would want to stop again.""

Her determination impresses Steve Trew, the sport's coaching director. ""I just tested her fitness,"" he says, ""and she worked so hard on the running machine that it finally threw her off into a wall. She gave it her all, but while most people stop when they can't go further, she just kept going.""

Melanie was the top junior in this year's European Triathlon Championships, finishing 13th. ""I was almost as good as the top three in swimming and running, but much slower in cycling. That's why I'm working very hard on it."" She is trying to convince her parents, who will pay the £1,300 cost of her trip to New Zealand for this year's World Championships, to buy a £2,000 bike (it's a special deal, with £1,000 off) so she can try national 25 km and 100 km races later this year.

But there is a cost. Her intense training has made her a bit of a recluse. ""I don't have a social life,"" she says. ""I'm not a party person anyway. After two hours of hard swimming on Friday nights, I just want to sleep. But I call and write to the other girls on the team."" What do they talk about? Boys? Clothes? ""No, we talk about our times.""

Where will all this focus lead? Melanie has tried other events. She has attempted the triathlon ""sprint,"" where you only swim 750 meters, cycle 20 kilometers, and run 5 kilometers. She wants to enter even tougher events than the triathlon. ""The big problem is, I have no one my age to train with,"" she says. It's interesting, isn't it?"
FCE_70,"**Text: The Collectors**

Amanda Roy discusses her passion for collecting and why many people enjoy this hobby. Collecting is a popular activity, with one in three adults participating. It is a world filled with passion, envy, enthusiasm, and joy. However, if you decide to collect, remember: only collect items you truly love. 

Since ancient times, people have felt the need to collect. Early humans collected pebbles, which they wore as necklaces. These pebbles, admired for their shapes and colors, were among the first objects gathered for intellectual and spiritual reasons. Over the years, this desire to collect has not changed. Children still collect stones and seashells simply for their beauty.

I have been collecting for as long as I can remember, from flowers like tulips to pottery and paintings. My first collection was stones from my parents' garden. When I was six, I attended a school in a remote, cold area of England. When my parents visited, they took me to a local museum filled with fascinating objects collected by others. I was captivated by these items. 

Interestingly, many people share my interest in collecting. The reasons behind this passion are widely discussed. For some, collecting is the only part of their lives where they feel in control. For me, it is simply a joyful activity. 

One well-known collector was the Duc de Berry in France, who had a ""room of wonders"" filled with natural and artificial curiosities, like coconut shell cups and carved ivory beads. Another notable collector, Catherine the Great of Russia, owned over 4,000 paintings. However, you don’t need to be wealthy to start a collection. I have collected various items, from tulip bulbs to china cups, with great determination. 

I remember convincing another tulip collector to sell me a special bulb. I planted it and cared for it, but one year it disappeared—stolen by another collector. I also collected 350 American rag dolls, searching across the USA for different designs. Unfortunately, this collection was lost in a house fire. The next morning, I stood in my front hall, saddened by the loss of my furniture and collection.

What fascinates me is how collections change hands. A silver spoon that belonged to a king or a poet adds value to items traded in markets. As certain small objects become popular among collectors, their prices rise. For example, toys from the 1950s are now considered valuable, especially if kept in their original boxes. (I regret throwing away both the boxes and the toys!)"

I decide what objects and images to display. I also create interactive displays, workshops, and performances to help the public understand the exhibition.

I step in when there are disagreements, like whether a right turn is allowed at a certain junction. As they prepare for the test, I give them a simple route but challenge them to find alternative paths when roads are closed. This helps them think critically.

**Sarah - Marine Conservationist**  
I live by the coast and mostly work from home. My job involves answering phone calls, creating educational materials, and organizing training courses. Sometimes, I go to our main office, but I usually work along the coast. I collaborate with schools and study centers, running courses for coastal managers and decision-makers about marine life. I take them out to sea to help them understand the underwater environment better. This often changes their perspectives, as it is different from making decisions on a computer. I feel fortunate because conservation is my passion, but since I work for a charity, I constantly seek funding, which limits what I can achieve.

**Chris - Map and Atlas Publisher**  
My job is quite diverse. I ensure our publishing program meets market needs and maintain a stock of about 300 books. We have high standards for information and content. We receive many letters from readers about issues like international boundaries, which require careful responses. I discuss future projects and current sales with co-publishers. I work with a passionate team, which makes the job enjoyable. However, like many jobs, there is a lot of administration, which takes time away from more interesting tasks like product development and design."
FCE_10,"**Text: A Holiday in Ireland**

Every June, we went to Ireland. Since the four of us started going on holidays together, we spent the first two weeks of the month at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. It is a big house by the sea, not far from the village of Ardbeag. The English couple who own the house, the Malseeds, have made some additions to it, but they did so very carefully. Strafe found Glencorn for us. He saw an advertisement when the Malseeds were still advertising. One evening, he suggested it to us and read the details. The summer before, we had gone to a hotel recommended by friends, but it was not a good experience because the food was terrible. The four of us have been playing cards together for a long time: Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia, and me. They call me Milly, but my real name is Dorothy Milson. Dekko got his nickname at school; Dekko Deacon sounds nice, I guess. He and Strafe were schoolmates, which is why we call Strafe by his last name, like the teachers did. We are all about the same age and live close to where the Malseeds lived before moving from England to Ireland. We always think it’s a funny coincidence.

""How nice,"" Mrs. Malseed said, smiling to welcome us again this year. She seems to know when guests are arriving because she is usually waiting in the large hall that smells of flowers. ""Arthur, take the luggage up,"" she told the old porter. She named our rooms after flowers: Rose, Tulip, Lily, and Geranium. Instead of numbers, Mrs. Malseed painted flowers on the doors. In winter, when few guests come to Glencorn Lodge, she takes care of little details like that; her husband handles repairs and redecorating. ""Well, well, well,"" Mr. Malseed said as he entered the hall from the kitchen. ""A hundred thousand welcomes,"" he greeted us in the Irish way. He was smiling, and his dark brown eyes sparkled, making us feel special, not just another group of guests. Everyone smiled, and I could sense that our holiday had truly begun. Nothing had changed at Glencorn; everything was perfect.

Kitty from the dining room came out to greet us. ""You look younger every year, all four of you,"" she said, making everyone laugh again. Arthur led us to our rooms, carrying as much luggage as he could and returning for the rest. After dinner, we played cards for a while, but we didn’t play long because we were still tired from the journey. In the lounge, there was a man alone and a French couple. There were other guests at dinner, of course, because Glencorn Lodge is always full in June. From our table by the window, we could see some guests walking on the lawns and others taking the path down to the beach. In the morning, we would do the same: walk along the beach to Ardbeag and have coffee at the hotel there, returning in time for lunch. In the afternoon, we would drive somewhere. I knew this routine well because over the years, we had developed this pattern. Since we first came here, we had all fallen in love with the beautiful landscape in every season."
FCE_67,"**Text: Keeping Holiday-Makers Happy**

Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex, shares her experiences as a chalet girl in Val d'Isere, France. This is her second year in this role, where she cooks and cleans for visitors who come to ski and stay in wooden houses called chalets. Sarah graduated last summer from Oxford Brookes University with a degree in French and History of Art. She views being a chalet girl as a fun way to spend a year or two before starting a more permanent career. ""It's a great way to meet successful people,"" she says.

Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to work. She has her own breakfast before preparing breakfast for the guests, which includes porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants. After breakfast, around 9:30 a.m., she cleans up and either prepares afternoon tea or cleans the rooms, which she finds the least enjoyable part of her job. By 11 a.m., she is ready to ski, enjoying the slopes until about 4:30 p.m.

After skiing, Sarah returns to the chalet to prepare dinner. She takes a shower first but avoids sleeping, as she believes it would make her feel worse. Dinner, a three-course meal, is served at 8 p.m., and coffee is usually ready by 10 p.m. After dinner, she cleans the kitchen, as she dislikes coming back to a messy space the next morning. Sometimes she chats with the guests, but other times they prefer privacy. ""Good guests can make a week wonderful,"" she notes, recalling a fun breakfast experience.

Sarah lives in a chalet with friends, and they often go out around 11 p.m. They usually start at a place called Bananas, then might visit G Jay's and Dick's T-Bar. However, she avoids staying out too late on Saturdays because Sundays are her busiest days. ""It's a tough day,"" she admits, especially when she has to cook breakfast with a headache.

On Sundays, she starts work earlier, preparing breakfast for guests leaving by 7 a.m. Once they leave, she cleans quickly, clearing breakfast and changing beds. If she hasn't done the shopping on Saturday, she does it now. By around 3 p.m., after finishing the cleaning, she prepares tea for the new guests arriving around 4:30 p.m. Sometimes the new guests seem confused and have many questions, which Sarah finds amusing.

Between tea and dinner, she helps guests who need ski equipment by taking them to the ski shop and getting a ride back. Soon, it’s time for dinner again, and sometimes she enjoys a drink afterward, but if she is too tired, she prefers to go to bed early."
FCE_27,"Miss Rita Cohen, a small girl who looked much younger than Seymour's daughter, Marie, but claimed to be six years older, visited his factory one day. She wore overalls and large shoes, and her curly hair framed her pretty face. Seymour found it hard to believe that she was studying at the University of Pennsylvania, researching the leather industry in New Jersey for her Master's degree. A few times a year, someone would contact Seymour to ask if they could visit his factory. Sometimes, he would help students by answering their questions over the phone or giving them a short tour if they seemed serious. 

Rita was almost as small as the children from Marie's third-grade class, who had visited the factory years ago to learn how gloves were made. Seymour remembered how Marie loved to see the laying-off table, where workers shaped and pressed each glove using hot brass hands. Marie had called them 'pancake hands' because of their unusual shape. 

Seymour heard Rita ask, ""How many pieces come in a shipment?"" He replied, ""Between twenty and twenty-five thousand."" She took notes and asked, ""Do they come directly to your shipping department?"" He was pleased to see her interest in the details. ""They go to the tannery first. We buy the material, and they prepare it for us. My grandfather, father, and I all worked in the tannery here in town. Have you ever been inside a tannery?"" 

""Not yet,"" she said. 

""Well, you should visit one if you want to write about leather. I can arrange that for you. They are basic places. The technology has improved, but it’s still similar to what it was hundreds of years ago. It’s tough work. Tanning is one of the oldest industries; they’ve found six-thousand-year-old tanning artifacts in Turkey. The first clothing was just animal skins that were tanned by smoking them. It’s a fascinating subject. My father is a leather expert; you should talk to him. He can talk for two days about gloves. Glovemakers are passionate about their work. Have you ever seen anything being made, Miss Cohen?"" 

""I can't say I have,"" she replied. 

""Never seen anything manufactured?"" 

""I saw my mother bake a cake when I was a child."" 

He laughed; she made him smile. She was innocent and eager to learn. His daughter was much taller than Rita, but Rita reminded him of Marie with her bright intelligence and enthusiasm for learning. 

""I have an idea. We will take you through the entire glove-making process. Come on! We’re going to make you a pair of gloves, and you will watch them being made from start to finish. What size do you wear?"""

Chris Arnot interviews four people with jobs that many consider ideal to see if they are as great as they appear.

**A. Raquel Graham**  
Raquel Graham calls from a taxi on her way to the airport. She cannot meet tomorrow because her boss needs her in Los Angeles. As a personal assistant to a pop star, she often travels around the world unexpectedly. Raquel enjoys her job and has a good relationship with her boss, but there is one issue: she dislikes flying. ""On a nine-hour flight to California, I usually take sleeping pills to help me relax,"" she shares. Her worst experience was flying on Concorde, which felt too cramped with its small windows. When she is not traveling, she works in offices in Manchester and London, handling routine tasks like organizing schedules, attending meetings with lawyers and accountants, and planning travel. She did not apply for this job; a chance meeting with a pop group manager led to her working behind the scenes. She also took a secretarial course in the evenings. Five years later, she was in the right place when her boss needed a personal assistant.

**B. David Brown**  
David Brown has worked as an accountant and a golf caddy, which is someone who carries a golfer's bags. He prefers caddying because golf is his passion. However, there are downsides. He earns a small flat fee plus a percentage of the winnings, with average earnings between £25,000 and £35,000, much of which goes to travel and hotels. He started caddying for golfer Greg Norman at age 31. ""You're not just carrying bags; you're giving advice, using your knowledge, and reading the course,"" he explains. Recently, his accounting skills were recognized by European Tour Productions, which made him a statistical data administrator. He compiles and analyzes statistics from the caddies' cards, which are valuable to TV commentators, golf magazines, and the players.

**C. Martin Fern**  
Martin Fern is the editor of the ""Food and Drink"" section of a daily newspaper, and one of his easier tasks is tasting food at fine restaurants. What does he think about expensive restaurants? ""For those who can afford it, it's their choice,"" he says. ""I would rather spend £120 on a memorable meal than buy a microwave."" His cooking talent led to a friend offering him a food column in a Saturday Review. At that time, he was the creative director of an advertising agency, and it provided him with extra income. When he was 42, another newspaper offered him a full-time job, which meant a 50% pay cut. ""But it was a chance to turn my passion into a career,"" he says. He still cooks at home and tries to stay fit by cycling to the nearest tube station.

**D. Dick Prince**  
""I began writing children's stories about 20 years ago,"" says Dick Prince, a well-known children's author. ""Before that, I loved words and mostly wrote poetry. Then I had an idea for a story. Having been a farmer, I understood the issue of chickens being killed by a fox, so I wrote a story called *The Fox Busters*, which became my first published children's book."" Where do his ideas come from? ""It's not easy; I have to work hard on them,"" he explains. ""I usually write in the mornings, but I don't wake up at dawn. After lunch, I spend a couple of hours typing what I wrote in the morning, using an old portable typewriter instead of a laptop. I receive between 50 and 100 letters a week, which is the part of being a writer I enjoy the most. I try to respond to all of them, but I now have some secretarial help."""
FCE_66,"In the lumberyard by the lake, where trees were turned into boards for building, there was an old two-story brick building. Surrounding it were large piles of soft sawdust, creating golden mounds that extended to the blue lake. That afternoon, feeling bored, a group of boys followed Michael up the ladder to the roof of the old building. They sat with their legs hanging over the edge, looking out at the lake. Suddenly, Michael said, ""I dare you to jump down,"" and without thinking, he jumped off the roof, landing in the sawdust and rolling around while laughing. ""I dare you all!"" he shouted. ""You're all cowards,"" he teased, trying to encourage them to jump too. 

Still laughing, he watched as they hesitated on the roof, looking scared. One by one, they jumped down, getting up with smiles of relief. In the warm afternoon sun, they lay on the sawdust, telling jokes until one of them suggested, ""Let's go back up to the roof and jump down again."" Although they weren't very excited, they climbed back up and began jumping off in a determined way until only Michael was left. The others were down below, grinning and calling, ""Come on, Mike. What's wrong with you?"" 

Michael wanted to join them but stayed at the edge of the roof, nervously licking his lips and grinning foolishly, wondering why the jump had seemed easier the first time. For a while, they thought he was just joking, but then they noticed him clenching his fists. He was trying to count to ten before jumping, and when that didn't work, he took a deep breath and closed his eyes. Eventually, the boys started laughing at him; they were tired of waiting, and it was almost dinnertime. ""Come on, you're a coward! Do you think we're going to sit here all night?"" they shouted. When he still didn't move, they began to get up and walk away, still teasing him. 

""Who started this? What's wrong with you all?"" he called out. But he remained at the edge of the roof, staring unhappily at the ground. He stayed there alone for nearly an hour while the sun slowly set over the lake. His clothes were damp from nervous sweat. Finally, he closed his eyes, jumped off the roof, and landed heavily in the sawdust, lying there for a long time. The yard was quiet; the workers had gone home. As he lay there, he wondered why he had been unable to jump earlier. Eventually, he got up slowly and walked home, feeling ashamed and wanting to avoid everyone. He was so late for dinner that his stepmother said coldly, ""You should be able to get home in time for dinner by now. If you won't come home, you might as well stay out tonight."" She was a strong woman with fair skin, a hint of grey in her hair, and a patient smile. Speaking with controlled seriousness, she noticed Michael's gloomy expression, but he hardly heard her; he was still thinking about the grinning faces below and their laughter."
FCE_44,"**Careers Advice**

Are you unhappy in your job and unsure how to change it? Kitty Doherty offers some helpful advice. Many people looking to change jobs seek help from a careers adviser. You will need to write a brief history of yourself and take several tests called 'psychometrics'. After this, you will receive a summary of the results, along with suggested careers and any retraining you might need.

I decided to try Career Analysts, a large organization that provides career advice. Taking the careers test felt like being back in a science exam. I was in a group of about ten people, answering questions under time pressure. I had to remind myself that it wasn't about passing or failing. It was hard to see how the psychometric tests could accurately represent me. The tests included tasks like finding mistakes in lists of names and numbers and matching similar shapes.

After the tests, I had a long conversation with an adviser. Based on our discussion and the test results, he created a report with his observations and recommendations. I agreed with most of his conclusions, but I was a bit disappointed to learn that I had performed poorly in the scientific, technical, and practical tests. I’m sure many sick people are relieved I never became a nurse! However, it was comforting to hear that I had made the right choices regarding journalism.

Changing your career doesn’t always mean a complete shift. Last March, after losing her job as a marketing manager at a large insurance company, 25-year-old Donna Laney sought help from Career Analysts. She said, ""Losing my job was a great chance for me to step back and review my career. I wanted to reassess my skills and interests."" Some of the results surprised her. ""I didn’t realize I had a talent for design. But I had to weigh the cost of retraining in design against my financial responsibilities,"" she explained. Other suggestions included taking a year off to work in the Far East. Ultimately, she chose to use her existing skills and moved into a role that suited her better than insurance. She is now a Public Relations officer. Donna believes she could have reached this point without Career Analysts, but they helped her understand what she truly wanted to do. She has recommended the service to several friends, all of whom are satisfied.

Not everyone finds careers advice helpful. Amanda Margetts, a 24-year-old sales representative, said, ""I reached a point in my career where I felt lost. I thought a careers adviser might suggest something new. Although I received many ideas, I rejected them because they either meant a significant pay cut or required a lot of retraining. I didn’t learn anything new about myself."" She added, ""You have to share a lot of personal information with the adviser, and I felt that if I had told a friend the same things, they would have given me similar advice."""
FCE_22,"**Text: 'Fun at the Dentist's?**

If you visit W. Lloyd Jerome's dental office in Glasgow, you will notice bright, modern paintings on the walls and a stylish blue couch where patients sit while he examines their teeth. Jerome mentions, ""Fifty percent of people only visit the dentist when they are in pain instead of going for regular check-ups. This is often because they are scared."" To change this, he has worked to create a space where people feel comfortable. For example, he decided not to wear a white coat, as many people link it to pain. His belief is that dental visits should happen in a relaxed, interesting, and enjoyable atmosphere.

This idea may surprise many, as most people associate dental visits with discomfort or formal settings. Jerome states, ""If patients are relaxed, entertained, and treated well, they will forget their past negative experiences."" One of his innovative relaxation methods is using virtual-reality headsets. ""We were the first dental practice in Britain to use them, and they are very popular. During the initial check-up, the patient sits comfortably on the blue couch and watches a film about underwater wildlife while I check their teeth. Then, the headset switches to a special camera that gives the patient a visual tour of their mouth.""

Interestingly, most patients seem to enjoy this part of their dental visit. Another important aspect is that the office smells more like a perfume shop than a dentist's office. Today, it has a pleasant orange scent. Jerome explains, ""When people enter, I want them to realize through all their senses that this is not a typical dentist's visit. Smell is very important. The usual dental smell can make someone anxious if they are afraid of dentists."" I found the gentle scent in the office very nice.

Although Jerome is known as Glasgow's most stylish dentist, he emphasizes that he takes his work seriously. While relaxation techniques are important, the quality of treatment is the top priority. For instance, Jerome uses a special tool that sprays warm water on the teeth to clean them instead of scraping, which can feel strange at first, but is not painful if the patient is relaxed.

Five years ago, Jerome traveled to the United States to study dental techniques. ""One thing I learned is that making it easier for the patient also makes it easier for the dentist,"" he explains. He believes his patient-focused approach is the beginning of a shift towards a more relaxed style in British dentistry.

At that moment, a patient arrives. Jerome quickly goes over, offers him a cup of tea (herbal or regular), asks what video he would like to watch, and gently leads him to the chair. The patient seems to enjoy this luxurious treatment, and it is easy to see why. The office feels more like an elegant beauty salon than a typical dental practice."
FCE_39,"**Text: The Rise of Chocolate**

Chocolate, which originated in South America, is now a major global industry worth millions. In the UK, people spend over £230 million on chocolate during Easter, making it a peak time for chocolate sales, second only to Christmas. Although large-scale chocolate production started in the last century, the cacao plant was first grown by the Aztec, Toltec, and Mayan civilizations in Central America over three thousand years ago. The cacao tree is a tropical evergreen found in Africa, South and Central America, the West Indies, and Southeast Asia. Its fruit is the size of a melon and contains 20-40 seeds. When dried, these seeds become cacao beans, which are used to make chocolate. In English-speaking countries, they are often mistakenly called cocoa beans, a misspelling from the 17th century.

The Aztecs used cocoa beans as currency and made a drink called xocoatl, which means ""bitter water"" in their language, Nahuatl. This drink was flavored with spices and used in ceremonies and to welcome guests. The Spanish preferred it with cinnamon and sugar, but it took another century for the recipe to reach Europe. In the late 17th century, chocolate houses opened in major European cities where people gathered to enjoy chocolate drinks. Until the last century, these drinks were made by melting solid chocolate blocks in hot water. In 1826, CJ van Houten from the Netherlands invented chocolate powder by removing most of the cocoa butter from crushed beans. The modern chocolate bar began in 1847 when Fry and Sons in Bristol combined cocoa butter with chocolate liquor and sugar to create a solid bar. A Swiss company later added milk solids, leading to the creation of milk chocolate.

At the turn of the century, French companies dominated the British chocolate market. In 1879, Cadbury named their Birmingham factory Bournville, hoping to attract some French charm. However, Cadbury's Dairy Milk bar, originally called Dairymaid in 1905, became popular due to clever advertising that linked it to the health benefits of milk from the English countryside, making it a competitor to rich French brands. Currently, chocolate consumption in Britain has stabilized at about four bars per week, prompting manufacturers to find new ways to attract customers. One recent strategy is the ""extended line,"" where chocolate bars are transformed into ice cream, soft drinks, or desserts to appeal to chocolate lovers who want something new.

Meanwhile, cacao farmers are still struggling due to a drop in cocoa bean prices in the late 1980s. Many small-scale farmers went out of business. So, as you enjoy your next chocolate bar, consider the challenges faced by those who grow cacao."
FCE_18,"**THE SHELL ARTIST**

At 83 years old, Peter Cooke has become a master in his craft. He still has many interests, such as paper-making and feather-work, but for now, he focuses on creating delicate and unique objects from shells. ""Let me know if I am boring you,"" he says as he shows me his work in his apartment. There is a fine line between being boring and being passionate, but Cooke is clearly the latter, thanks to his charm and the beauty of his creations.

He points to some shell-covered ornaments above his fireplace. ""I won’t mind if people don’t buy them because I’ve grown so fond of them. I never intended to sell my work. About five years ago, some friends suggested I have an exhibition so people could see my art. They spoke to a gallery owner."" This led to an exhibition in London, where 70% of his pieces sold. His second exhibition opened yesterday. Given the high prices—around £2,000 for the ornaments—Cooke seems willing to part with them.

There are 86 pieces in the exhibition, with prices starting at £225 for a shell-flower in a crystal vase. Cooke says he has no control over the prices and is open about them. He believes no one else makes work like his, and the gallery owner told him, ""One day you will stop, and everyone will want your pieces because there won’t be any more.""

Cooke wishes he had started this work earlier, as he feels he could have created even more wonderful things. Although he still has many ideas, he feels physically limited compared to when he began. However, his work is far from the typical shell items found in seaside shops. ""I have a miniature mind,"" he says, which has led to boxes covered in thousands of tiny shells, shaded pictures made from shells, and baskets of incredibly realistic flowers.

He has developed his own methods and uses materials he finds. For example, he uses cardboard from laundered shirts for flower bases, a special glue from a sail-maker, and washing-up liquid to clean the shells. ""I have an idea of what I want to do, and it just happens,"" he explains, yet the detail and color in his work look very intentional.

Cooke's search for beautiful, tiny shells has taken him beyond his local beaches in Norfolk to places like France, Thailand, Mexico, South Africa, and the Philippines. He insists he only collects dead shells and defends himself against accusations of damaging the beaches. ""When I collect shells, I hear people stepping on them much faster than I can gather them. The remaining shells are broken by the sea. I would never collect shells with living creatures in them, but once they are empty, why shouldn’t I collect them?"" His argument is convincing, especially considering the beauty of his work often exceeds the sum of its parts."

Kira Langer is a 15-year-old girl who models and appears on magazine covers. When she is not working, she studies for her school exams. Jane Laidlaw shares more about her.

I arrived at the agency and was told by the receptionist that Kira would be late. I felt worried because I had read negative things about models, thinking they might be difficult or vain. I wondered how late she would be and if she would even show up. However, when Kira arrived, she was smiling and relaxed, accompanied by her mother. She wore a simple black dress and trainers, showing no signs of being spoiled. Kira's mother looked proud of her daughter, who had recently won a modeling competition.

Kira seemed a bit surprised by her sudden fame, which was unexpected. It was her older sister who encouraged her to enter the modeling competition. Kira initially said no, but her sister sent in some photos anyway. When she learned she was a finalist, she was at school. This achievement boosted her confidence, and she performed well, winning the competition. The Select model agency in London quickly offered her work.

Kira now has to balance her modeling career with her school life. Her friends and teachers are proud of her, but some classmates make rude comments about her success, saying she thinks too highly of herself. Kira finds this difficult, as she believes she has not changed much, except for becoming more confident. 

Being a busy model affects her social life. The agency can call her at any time for a job the next day, making it hard for her to make plans with friends. However, her friends understand and do not complain about her busy schedule.

Kira has the talent and support to have a successful career, even before finishing her school exams. As I was about to end the interview, I asked her what she would like to do if she were not a model. She paused and said, ""I would like to do what you're doing."""

Father and son start Gold Rush

Terence and Chris Madden have traveled from the cold north of Canada to the warm lands of Africa in search of valuable metals. The father and son team—one an explorer and the other a mineral expert—believe their mine on a Welsh mountain could hold up to 10,000 ounces of gold. After ten years of digging in the Welsh hills, they think they are very close to a gold vein worth five million dollars. ""As we dig, we are finding high levels of gold; now we just need to dig a bit more to reach where it is concentrated,"" said Terence, 68, from Liverpool.

The pair have dedicated their lives to finding gold. Their search began when Terence read about gold worth millions buried in the 'Dolgellau gold belt,' an area near the town of Dolgellau in Wales. While reading old mining journals and newspapers at the Welsh National Library in Aberystwyth, they chose the best area of land to explore. After clearing away plants and finding pieces of gold in the rocks, they spent ten years getting permission from landowners, taking soil samples, and removing old cars and trash. They dug out 150 tonnes of greenstone rock to create a tunnel and a 10-meter shaft.

Now, they are running low on money. Having spent their savings on this dream, they need to convince someone to invest £50,000 to dig a few more meters to reach the gold. Chris Madden says, ""Right now, this seems unlikely, but we have several people we can contact.""

As news spread through the valleys about their dig, the allure of gold began to attract the attention of local residents as well as other gold diggers. Dolgellau depends on tourism, and locals are cautiously optimistic. ""If they are right, it would bring more visitors here,"" said Peter Woolven, manager of the Royal Ship Hotel, ""but if they find gold, I hope millions of people don’t come and disturb the hillside.""

The Welsh gold industry has greatly declined since its peak in the late 1880s when thousands worked in many mines across the countryside. One of the last remaining mines, Clogau-St David's, which made wedding rings for the Queen and the Princess of Wales, closed a month ago. However, individual gold diggers are returning. George Hall, another prospector, plans to dig a tunnel deep into the hill on the other side of the ridge from the Maddens. ""Searching for gold is very emotional,"" said Hall, 70. ""It's adventurous and exciting, the thrill of uncovering hidden treasure. Maybe I will be lucky this time."""
FCE_31,"**Text: IN HOT WATER**

Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends much of her time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She teaches and researches marine geochemistry, which involves studying the chemical processes in the sea. Rachel is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she is not teaching, she descends into a small steel vehicle designed for underwater exploration, diving three kilometers down to study underwater volcanoes. 

Inside the vehicle, space is very limited, and she can touch the two pilots. They are accustomed to these cramped conditions, where they cannot stand or move freely, and must remain inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last up to 16 hours: three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours collecting rock and water samples, and three hours to return to the surface. If there is an emergency and they need to ascend quickly, they can activate a panic button. This releases a small escape vessel that rises rapidly to the surface, similar to a ping-pong ball in water. ""No one has tested it yet, but I doubt it would be a pleasant experience,"" she says.

Rachel recalls her first experience in the vehicle. It was on a ship's deck, and she entered with an instructor who explained the emergency procedures, including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack. They were assessing her reaction to being in such a confined space. Now, Rachel has completed six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian team to a site five days' sail west of the Canary Islands. There, on the ocean floor, is a vast area of underwater volcanoes, with their chimneys releasing black smoke. The Russian team was dropping off scientific equipment to study the impact of a multinational program that would create a hole 150 meters through a volcano.

When she is not at sea, Rachel works in her office at the Oceanography Centre in Southampton. ""Two-thirds of my salary comes from teaching, which I enjoy, but I do it to support my research on the 'black smokers,'"" she explains. This term refers to underwater volcanoes that emit water that looks like black smoke at a rate of one meter per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees Celsius.

Rachel describes a frightening moment during her first dive with an American team. They were towing equipment with a 50-meter rope when there was a sudden explosion. The shock waves hit their vehicle, and she thought, ""I'm going to die."" They exchanged worried glances, waiting in silence. When nothing further happened, they felt an incredible relief—they were still alive!

""Diving to the deepest part of the ocean is such an adventure. Every time I look out of the porthole and see those chimneys, I feel a sense of wonder. Here I am at the bottom of the sea, witnessing something no one else on this planet has ever seen. I studied the black smokers for three years for my PhD, and seeing them in person was an amazing experience."""
FCE_58,"Text: 'I was dirty, smelly, hungry, and a bit sunburned. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. My body was exhausted, and my mind was tired of dealing with foreign schedules, money, and languages. ""Never again,"" I said as I stepped back home. I repeated this the next year and the year after. All I needed was one train ticket, and since I was under twenty-five, I could travel anywhere in Europe for a whole month. Once you learn to sleep in a train corridor, regular beds feel different. Carrying all your belongings in a backpack makes you travel simply and can lead to wasteful habits, like burning socks that smell bad or throwing away finished books. However, this carefree attitude is part of the Inter-Rail spirit, where common sense can be set aside along with your paperback and socks. All it takes is one of those tickets in your hand. A system that allows young people to travel through multiple countries in a day is quite special. On my first trip, my friends and I didn’t realize the full potential of this train ticket; we thought it was just a cheap way to reach our campsite in southern France. But the idea of continuous travel was too appealing, as there was always another country just across the border, always a little further to go. And what did those extra miles cost us? Nothing. We were not completely uninterested in culture, but this was our first holiday without parents, like most other Inter-Railers, and we focused only on the sights we could easily access. It was a chance to escape guided tours and do something different. I took pride in the fact that sometimes all I wanted to see was the view from the train station. We were just trying to get by and enjoy ourselves. In this way, we were like many other Inter-Railers with whom we shared train corridors, food, money, and music. The thrill of travel comes from the sudden reality of a place that was just a name before. It feels like the city you arrive in didn’t exist until the train pulls into the station and you see it with your own tired eyes for the first time. Only by seeing Europe, watching the changing landscapes, and noticing different attitudes and lifestyles can you truly understand the continent. Everyone knows what is there, but it means nothing until you experience it yourself. This is why other people's holiday photos can be dull. While the train journey may not reveal new things about the world, it is a valuable personal experience. Europe is vast, and Inter-Rail offers the best chance to appreciate this, though it didn’t happen for us right away.'"
FCE_37,"Text: 'There is nothing more frustrating than arriving at an airport in another country and finding out that your luggage has been left behind. At best, you will have to wear the same clothes for hours or even days until the airline returns your bags. At worst, you might be in a different climate, far from home, and stuck in inappropriate clothing. Although airlines do not often share how many bags they lose, it is a reality that regular travelers will eventually be separated from their luggage. Even the best airlines make mistakes sometimes, and no airline can guarantee that your checked luggage will travel on the same flight, especially if your journey involves changing planes.

The system works like this: Airlines require passengers to check in early, which is meant to give enough time for luggage to be processed and loaded onto the plane. Minimum connecting times (MCTs) are the shortest time needed to switch between two flights, and these times are also extended to allow for baggage transfers. Normally, this system works well. However, extra security checks and air traffic issues can lead to flight delays, which can disrupt the baggage system. Human error or accidents, such as a destination label being torn off, can also cause problems. These issues can be more serious at large airports, known as 'hubs', because they handle many bags. 

For example, last year, London’s Heathrow airport served over 41 million passengers, with nine million changing planes. British Airways alone managed two million transfer passengers at Heathrow, most of whom had to transfer between Terminal 1 (for domestic and European flights) and Terminal 4 (for long-distance flights). Even efficient airports like Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Singapore, and Zurich can have their bad days. The risk of losing luggage when changing planes is higher at certain airports. In the United States, Miami airport is known for luggage going missing when transatlantic passengers connect to flights in Latin America.

To reduce the chance of losing your luggage, choose direct flights whenever possible and check in well before the official time. If you must change planes, try to fly with the same airline for all legs of your journey. Allow extra time for connections by taking an earlier flight to the transfer airport, and make sure to label your luggage inside and out with your home and holiday addresses, including your flight numbers. If your luggage still goes missing, contact the airline staff in the baggage area and fill out a property irregularity report (PIR) before leaving the airport.'"
FCE_2,"**The Kingfisher**

Wildlife photographer Charlie James is an expert on the kingfisher, a beautiful blue-green bird that lives near streams and rivers and feeds on fish. Old trees hang over the stream, providing shade to the shallow water. The main colors in this scene are soft greens, browns, and various shades of yellow from the sunlight, creating a peaceful atmosphere, much like the gentle sounds of water in the breeze. The kingfisher moves quickly and gracefully, like a flash of light, leaving a strong impression even after it disappears in an instant. 

Charlie James fell in love with kingfishers when he was young. His deep affection for this small bird is evident in his struggle to explain what attracts him to it. The kingfisher is part of many legends. In Greek mythology, it is a moon goddess transformed into a bird. Another story tells how the kingfisher flew so high that its upper body became the blue of the sky, while its underside was burned by the sun. There is some truth to this tale. Despite the various shades of blue in their feathers, kingfishers do not have blue pigment. Instead, the structure of their feathers scatters light, making them appear blue. This is why a kingfisher can look bright blue or rich emerald green depending on the angle of the light.

It is no surprise that many wildlife photographers are passionate about kingfishers. Their vibrant colors, combined with the fact that these birds are shy but can be observed from a distance, create a perfect opportunity for photographers. Charlie's first hideout was an old blanket he draped over himself while waiting near a kingfisher's favorite spot. The bird returned within minutes and sat just a meter away. However, it took him another four years to capture his first good photograph. During this time, the European kingfisher became a major part of his life. He spent as much time as possible by a stream rich with kingfishers, but school limited his time with the birds. He missed classes and considered himself an ""academic failure."" Nevertheless, his passion for this widespread kingfisher, the only one of its family that breeds in Europe, was noticed. At 16, he was hired as an advisor for a nature magazine, then became an assistant to the editor, and eventually worked as a freelance wildlife film cameraman.

Now, he dreams of making the ultimate kingfisher film: ""No speech, just beautiful images that convey everything,"" he says. ""I prefer a simple approach. I like to photograph parts of kingfisher wings..."" His voice trails off as he thinks about the colors of the bird he has spent more than half his life observing, which still fascinates him. His photographs express some of his feelings, but Charlie knows that there is much more to his connection with the kingfisher than his work can ever reveal."
FCE_68,"**Text: Conducting an Orchestra**

Giving directions to an orchestra is challenging. Anne Inglis speaks with five new conductors about their experiences.

**A. ANNE MANSON**  
Anne Manson, 30, asked to attend conductor Claudio Abbado's practice sessions in Vienna and ended up filling in for an absent assistant. She was later invited to help with another opera the following season. ""I had to lead the first orchestral rehearsal for Abbado. I wasn't nervous. I have always felt confident standing in front of an orchestra."" Manson, who is from America, works with a well-known opera company in London that focuses on modern works. She is also gaining recognition in other European countries, supported by the British Arts Council. Since that first experience, she has assisted Abbado on several more projects.

**B. ANDREW CONSTANTINE**  
Andrew Constantine, 31, believes the hardest part of being a conductor is finding the right opportunities. He won a major competition in 1991 after two unsuccessful attempts. Looking back, he feels lucky about the timing: ""If it had happened earlier, I would have been forgotten."" The competition gave him many performance opportunities and a chance to work as an assistant to a famous conductor. However, he struggles with being known for the competition: ""If in three years my name is still linked to the competition, I will be concerned."" Fortunately, orchestras like the English Chamber Orchestra, which hired him after the competition, are inviting him back. ""If this doesn't happen, my career could suffer.""

**C. WASFI KANI**  
Wasfi Kani, who founded Pimlico Opera, enjoys the long practice periods that come with opera productions. ""The music deserves four weeks of focus,"" she says. Kani began conducting seriously in her late twenties. After university, she worked in London's commercial center until Pimlico Opera became fully professional two years ago. Taking lessons with Sian Edwards was a turning point for her. ""I saw her conduct and realized she was my size. I had always learned from much larger conductors, which makes a big difference."" She appreciates the complexity of opera: ""There are many arguments, and you have to consider the personalities of the singers.""

**D. ROGER VIGNOLES**  
Roger Vignoles, 48, says, ""Conducting surprised me, but it fascinates me."" This career choice is not so unusual; he began as a resident musician at an opera house and worked with skilled conductors. Last year, he was asked to direct Handel's Agrippina from the piano at a festival, something he had never done before. ""It was easier than I expected. I knew the music well and what I wanted it to sound like. I did my best to achieve the performance I desired. Thankfully, people respect my skills as a musician. I benefit from all my experiences, both in musical style and performance. Now, I will accept any opportunity to discover what I enjoy.""

**E. WAYNE MARSHALL**  
In 1986, conductor Simon Rattle noticed a young assistant conductor during one of his productions and informed his agent about Wayne Marshall. Now 32, Marshall quickly found himself conducting a musical in London on short notice, a tough start. He even had to manage some relaxed professional musicians reading newspapers during the show: ""I was firm with them. I always kept a clear beat and aimed for the best result. Many orchestral musicians I’ve seen don’t seem to need guidance from a conductor. But I’m never afraid to express my needs. If people see you’re anxious, it only gets worse. I have never formally studied conducting, and no book teaches you how to conduct, but people have been supportive. I am determined and know what I like."""
FCE_23,"**Variations on a Theme**

If you are considering taking children to a theme park, there are many options in Britain. We asked five families to review some of the best parks.

**Fun Island - The Burns Family**  
Last year, we visited a large theme park in the US and thought Fun Island might be boring in comparison. However, we were pleasantly surprised. The park is designed for younger children, so our three-year-old felt included. The kids loved the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. There is a special dodgems ride for very young kids, which was a big hit. For older children, there are more thrilling rides, like Splash Out, where you end up in a pool! After five hours, Steve and I were ready to leave, but the children wanted to stay because they were having so much fun. Our only complaint is that the park could use more atmosphere, and the scenery was not very impressive. However, the staff were very helpful, and we found the park to be clean, well-organized, and focused on safety.

**Wonderland - The McMillan Family**  
None of us had been to a theme park before, so we were unsure what to expect. We thought Oscar might be too young, but he loved it. He enjoyed the Mountain Train and especially liked Little Land, which has small models of famous buildings that he could explore! The older children liked the ferris wheel and driving toy cars on a real road layout. We spent six hours there and appreciated the places to relax. The landscaping was beautiful, and the staff were friendly and helpful. There was something for everyone, including adults.

**Adventure World - The Jeffree Family**  
After seven hours, we felt there was still much to see. The children loved the Big Top Circus, which had an amazing trapeze act that kept us excited. We tried the Terror Line, and although the girls were scared and kept their eyes shut, they said they enjoyed it. Their favorite ride was Running River, where you think you will get wet, but you don’t. For younger children, Toy Land is a lot of fun. The children looked at the new ride, Fear Factor, but we were relieved when they found out they were too small to go on it! The park is so well designed that even waiting in line for rides is not boring. It is very clean, and the staff are wonderful. On one ride, I couldn’t sit with both girls, so a staff member kindly went with one of them.

**The Great Park - The Langridge Family**  
We arrived at one o'clock and were disappointed that the park closed at 5 p.m. This is a great theme park for younger children because the rides are not too scary. I am quite timid, but I still had fun. We all loved Exotic Travels, a boat ride that starts slowly and then becomes very exciting. We waited for half an hour for Lightning River, and it was over too quickly! I wouldn’t go on the Big Leap, but it looked fun if you are brave. If the children had been a bit older, they might have found it a little boring, but they were the right age and enjoyed it.

**Fantasy World - The Break-all Family**  
According to the park's advertising, there is 'No Limit to the Fun', and we certainly felt that was true. Europe's tallest roller-coaster, the Rocket, stands out in the park, and Ben thought it was the scariest ride, while Jennie said the Hanger, where you hang upside-down 30 meters above the ground, was even scarier! There are about a dozen main rides, which the older children went on several times. Sarah was too small for some rides but enjoyed the Long Slide. We found the staff's attitudes varied. Some were great with younger children, but the welcome was not always warm. You need a full day to enjoy Fantasy World. We wouldn’t have dared tell the kids we were leaving early."
FCE_60,"**Text: Running a Business in the Countryside**

Five women share their experiences of starting a business in the countryside.

A. **Christine Hogan** runs a computer-aided design business that earns over £200,000 a year and has four full-time employees. She says, ""My customers are friends. My husband and I moved from London to the countryside when our children were young, and I wanted a job I could do from home. I had experience with computers before marriage, so my husband suggested I start this business. It required a lot of money, and the beginning was tough. I was careful with spending and kept the bank manager informed. Working from home saves money, and I can work in the evenings if I choose. The business has stayed small, and most customers pick up their orders.""

B. **Maggy Sasanow** is a greetings card designer who works from home. She explains, ""I enjoy being independent. I studied art at university and wanted to work in a museum, but after marrying, we moved to the countryside where such jobs were not available. So, I started my own business and now create 50 different greetings cards that I sell to museums. I work in a large room upstairs. The downside of working from home is that there are always chores to do, like mowing the lawn. I rely on word of mouth for customers and do not advertise. People send me work from London because I am cheaper than other artists. Although I miss sharing ideas with others, the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.""

C. **Delia Turner** runs a curtain-making business that has faced ups and downs. She says, ""I started my business eight years ago when it was growing. My income increased from £24,000 to £80,000 in two years. I used to have six full-time employees, but I had to let them go due to an economic downturn, which was hard because jobs are scarce here. Now, I am back to making curtains at home with my husband’s help and using women who work from their homes. I must be ready to lower my prices when needed and explore new opportunities.""

D. **Tessa Strickland** manages her children's book publishing business from her farmhouse. She moved to the countryside three years ago for financial reasons and because she loves the area. She says, ""I enjoy working on my own schedule. Eighty percent of my income comes from deals with Australia, the Far East, and North America, so I often take calls at unusual hours. The challenge is having the discipline to close the office door. I publish children's books from various cultures, collaborating with authors and artists. I had all my professional experience in London, so I felt quite isolated at first.""

E. **Meg Rivers** runs a cakes-by-post business and a shop that earns £250,000 a year and employs six people, some part-time. She started ten years ago at home, driven by her interest in health. ""I began making fruit cakes with high-quality ingredients. Friends and family started requesting them, and soon I was sending cakes all over the country. Seven years ago, I rented a small building where everything is made. We have a baker, an assistant, and a professional cake decorator. I no longer bake myself, as I focus on the business side. My biggest challenge has been managing finances, as we did not have a lot of money to start."""
FCE_1,"**Meet the Amazing Watkins Family**

The Watkins family is special because they are all involved in music. The sons are composers and award-winning musicians, while their father makes musical instruments. 

John and Hetty Watkins, who are schoolteachers from South Wales, wanted to buy a cello for their ten-year-old son, Paul, but found it too expensive. John thought about making one himself. He discovered a local school for instrument making and took evening classes for three years. After trying to make violins and violas, he successfully made his first cello. Paul, now 28, remembers using that cello for many years. John has since retired from teaching to focus on making instruments, creating about twelve violins each year. One of his violins was sold to the famous American musician Jaime Laredo, which he considers a great achievement.

Paul and his younger brother, Huw, were encouraged to play music from a young age. Paul started with the piano and later switched to the cello, inspired by a cellist in his father's music group. Huw, now 22, is also making a name for himself as a pianist and composer. He appreciated the support from his parents and felt motivated by Paul’s success rather than pressured.

Paul has achieved significant success with the cello his father made. He won the string final of the BBC Young Musician of the Year competition and became the principal cellist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra at just 20 years old. Recently, he has started using a different cello, a Francesco Rugeri, which is on loan from the Royal Academy of Music. He jokes that his father's cello will improve with age, just like the Rugeri, which is already 304 years old.

Paul will soon perform on television, playing Elgar's Cello Concerto. However, he will miss watching himself because he has a concert at the Cheltenham Festival that same night. Huw will also be busy, as his String Quartet will premiere in London at the Wigmore Hall. Their parents, John and Hetty, will have to be very organized to keep up with all their sons' musical events in the coming weeks."
FCE_53,"**Looking After the Countryside: The National Trust**

The National Trust is an organization that aims to protect the British countryside. Gill Page visits the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and speaks with Gareth Roberts, a warden who works for the Trust to care for its beautiful areas.

According to Gareth, a National Trust Warden needs common sense and good people skills because they interact with farmers, visitors, conservationists, and construction companies regularly. Gareth grew up on the Lleyn Peninsula and worked on his parents' farm until he got married. About 80 people applied for the warden position, but Gareth's local knowledge and farming experience helped him get the job, even though he did not have formal training. 

Gareth finds it beneficial to still farm with his parents, as it allows him to relate to farmers and understand their challenges. His farming background also helps him handle the physical tasks of the job, such as building fences, planting trees, and constructing walls. Since joining the Trust, Gareth has learned more about nature conservation. He remembers collecting flowers, butterfly larvae, and birds' nests as a child and now realizes how farming has changed the countryside. He believes that farmers were just following government advice and that it is not their fault.

When Gareth started, farmers and conservationists often disagreed. However, they are now communicating and understanding each other's perspectives. Gareth believes they are close to finding common ground. His work involves conservation, allowing public access to Trust land, planting and maintaining trees, and working with tenant farmers. He aims to complete tasks efficiently and enjoys seeing projects finished, although he spends a lot of time on paperwork.

Gareth is passionate about his job and enjoys interacting with the public, although he finds some visitors' attitudes frustrating. He dislikes when people come in, make demands, and leave without appreciation. However, he believes that common sense is key to managing these situations.

If you have plenty of common sense and enjoy outdoor work, you might consider applying to be a warden like Gareth, but be aware that there may not be openings in the Lleyn Peninsula for a long time!"
FCE_55,"**The Netball Captain**

In our series about women in sports, Suzie Ellis met England's netball captain, Kendra Slowinski. Kendra is the captain of the England netball team. When I met her, she had just finished a typical day of teaching at a local school, followed by a training session in a supermarket car park. I asked her, ""Don't you get strange looks?"" She replied, ""I'm so focused on my movements and my feet that I don't notice much else. I might see cars slow down out of the corner of my eye, but that's it.""

Kendra said, ""My whole life now is about being at my best for the Championships."" She is following a strict schedule to be as fit as possible. This will be her fourth World Championships, which will be the largest ever, with 27 countries participating. ""We will have home support, which is very special,"" she said. ""It's important to improve the reputation of netball in this country. Playing at home means there will be more pressure than usual. The crowd will have expectations and will support us more. People expect us to start the tournament with a strong game.""

Their first match is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. Kendra mentioned, ""As far as I know, we have always beaten them, but they will be exciting to play against. They have a lot of talent."" The England team is currently ranked fourth in the world. However, Kendra noted that the World Championships will be challenging. ""You have to push yourself to play every day; there is no break between games like in a series. You can still win a series if you lose the first game, but the Championships are different because you only have one chance, and you must be ready to take it.""

In the fifteen years she has played at a high level, the sport has become tougher and faster. Players are more aggressive on the court. Kendra said, ""You don't train hard not to win. But once the game is over, we become different people. We are all friendlier after the match."" Netball is also using a more scientific approach to fitness testing. Kendra explained, ""It is essential that we think and train like world-class players. As captain, I believe it's important to have a strong mental attitude and lead by example. I see my role as supporting and encouraging the team.""

Kendra added, ""From the start of my netball career, everything has been carefully planned. I decided some time ago that this competition would be my last as a player."" She will likely coach young players in the future, but for now, she is focused on her final big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she may very well have a tear in her eye."
FCE_50,"**SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS**

How can parents support a child with exceptional musical talent? It can be challenging to know how to nurture their abilities. Some parents may not recognize their child's needs until frustration leads to difficult behavior. While most schools can help academically gifted children, those with musical talent often need special attention that regular schools may not provide, especially if music is seen as less important.

Children who are musically gifted, along with those whose talents are encouraged by their parents or teachers, may benefit from attending a specialist music school. In Britain, there are five such schools, which have been established relatively recently. These schools offer a supportive environment for children aged seven to eighteen to fully develop their musical skills under the guidance of professional musicians.

At specialist music schools, students spend a significant part of their day—between one third and one half—engaged in musical activities. This includes individual lessons (up to three hours a week for their main instruments), participation in orchestras and chamber groups, voice training, conducting, and music theory. They also practice in well-equipped private rooms, sometimes with a teacher. The remainder of their time is dedicated to a limited academic curriculum, focusing on essential subjects like English, math, basic sciences, and languages, although students can request to study more subjects.

All five British specialist music schools are independent, with smaller class sizes and a high teacher-to-student ratio. Most students are boarders, living at school full-time, which allows them to spend their formative years with peers who share similar goals and interests.

However, there are some drawbacks. The cost of attending these schools is high, ranging from £12,000 to £17,000 a year for boarders. Each school tries to provide scholarships and financial aid to help families of exceptionally talented children afford the fees. Additionally, not all parents want to send their children to boarding school, especially at a young age. Many directors of these schools have concerns about admitting children as young as seven into such a demanding environment. They emphasize that their goal is to develop well-rounded individuals.

It is important to note that separating musically gifted children from their peers at an early age can create stress. Some early signs of musical talent may fade during the teenage years, and the pressure to succeed can lead to feelings of failure. However, specialist schools closely monitor each student's progress and provide support when needed.

While many former students feel they gained a lot from the high-quality music education, some have concerns about the limited academic curriculum, which often takes a back seat to music. Many musically talented young people are also very intelligent and can handle academic challenges, so they may feel frustrated if their intellectual needs are not met.

For these reasons, it might be better to wait until a child is older and can make their own choices before pursuing a specialist education. Those who excel academically may thrive in a less specialized setting, such as a school with a strong music program or by combining regular schooling with music training at junior departments of music colleges. These colleges offer Saturday morning lessons with excellent teachers, along with orchestral and chamber music experiences. However, this option may not be feasible for families living far from London or other major cities."
FCE_25,"**Text: An Eye for Detail**

Artist Susan Shepherd is well-known for her flower paintings, which are inspired by the large garden around her house. This garden is filled with her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wildly and spread throughout the garden. The two long flower borders along the paved path that runs from east to west are beautifully arranged in terms of color, shape, and structure. This beauty is partly due to the previous owners, who were passionate gardeners and left behind plants that Susan loves. She also kept the gardener, Danny. ""In fact, it was really his garden,"" she says. ""We got along very well. At first, he would say, 'Oh, it's not worth it' about some of the things I wanted to add, but when I told him I wanted to paint them, he understood my vision.""

Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than painting the entire garden. Sometimes, she paints a group of plants together, but usually, she picks one flower and takes it to her studio. ""I don't set everything up at once,"" she explains. ""I take one flower out and paint it, which might take a few days, and then I bring in another one to add to the painting. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.""

Her busiest time is spring and early summer when the tulips bloom, followed by the poppies. ""They all come out together, and you're so busy,"" she says. However, she also finds beauty in the gradual decay of flowers. For example, with tulips, ""you bring them in and put them in water, then leave them for a day, and they each change into different shapes. They open up and look amazing. When you first put them in a vase, they seem dull, but they keep changing.""

Susan has always loved plants. ""I studied botany in school and used to collect wildflowers from the countryside,"" she says. ""I wasn't really interested in gardening back then; in fact, I didn't like garden flowers because they looked fake, like silk or plastic ones sold in florists' shops. To me, only wildflowers were real. I was fascinated by how they could grow in tough places, like cracks in rocks or on cliffs.""

Today, her garden includes many plants from distant lands, but they thrive just as well in her garden as they do in their native places like China or the Himalayas. She has a relaxed attitude towards her garden, similar to a loving aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don't cause serious trouble. With two upcoming exhibitions to prepare for and plenty of inspiration right outside her door, finding time to work in the garden has been challenging. She now hires an extra gardener, but she knows that to stay connected to her art, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""
FCE_34,"**Text: Keeping Holiday-Makers Happy**

Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex, shares her experiences as a chalet girl in Val d'Isère, France. This is her second year in this role, where she cooks and cleans for visitors who come to ski and stay in wooden houses called chalets. Sarah graduated last summer from Oxford Brookes University with a degree in French and History of Art. She views being a chalet girl as a fun way to spend a year or two before starting a more permanent career. ""It's a good way to meet successful people,"" she says.

Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to work. After having her own breakfast, she prepares breakfast for the guests, which includes porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants. By 9:30 a.m., after the guests have finished eating, she cleans up and either makes afternoon tea or cleans the rooms, which she finds the least enjoyable part of her job. By 11 a.m., she is ready to ski, enjoying the slopes until about 4:30 p.m.

After skiing, Sarah returns to the chalet to prepare dinner. She takes a shower first but avoids sleeping, as she believes it would make her feel worse. Dinner, which is a three-course meal, is served at 8 p.m., and coffee is usually ready by 10 p.m. After dinner, she cleans the kitchen, as she dislikes coming back to a messy space the next morning. Sometimes she chats with the guests, but other times they prefer privacy. ""Good guests can make a week enjoyable,"" she notes, recalling a fun breakfast experience.

Sarah lives in a chalet with friends, and they often go out around 11 p.m. They usually start their night at a place called Bananas, then might visit G Jay's and Dick's T-Bar. However, she avoids staying out too late on Saturdays because Sundays are her busiest days. ""It's a tough day,"" she admits, ""especially when I have to cook breakfast early.""

On Sundays, breakfast for guests must be ready by 7 a.m. After the guests leave, Sarah quickly cleans the chalet, stripping beds and preparing for the next group. If she hasn't done the shopping on Saturday, she does it now. By around 3 p.m., after finishing the cleaning, she prepares tea for the new guests, who usually arrive around 4:30 p.m. Sometimes they seem confused and have many questions, which Sarah finds amusing.

Between tea and dinner, she helps guests who need ski equipment and then gets a ride back to the chalet. Soon, it’s time for dinner again, and she may chat with friends, but sometimes she is too tired and goes to bed early."

Mandie Currie, a zookeeper, spent a day at the magazine Marie Claire. ""Choosing my outfit for Marie Claire was difficult because I usually wear a uniform at the zoo. I first went to a photo studio, then to press previews, all before lunch. The zoo is a calm place, and here I was rushing around when I could be quietly spending time with an animal. Some fashion team members seemed stressed, but my job is not very pressuring. At a fashion shoot in the afternoon, I found it funny to think that I would usually be cleaning cages or handling rats. I am interested in how magazines operate, but I really enjoy my job at the zoo, so I will stay there.""

Alice Cutler, a fashion assistant at Marie Claire, spent a day at London Zoo. ""I arrived at the zoo in my leather boots and dark blue trousers. The zoo gave me a green polo shirt to wear, which was good because I got very dirty. While I petted an elephant, I thought Mandie would be packing clothes. By five o'clock, I was dirty but had a fantastic day. When I retire from fashion, I could see myself working with elephants, maybe in Africa.""

Karen Hodson, a nurse at Hammersmith Hospital, worked with the television gardening show Ground Force. ""I was very excited to meet the team, and Alan Titchmarsh, the presenter, was very nice. I enjoyed being outside because I sometimes don’t see daylight due to my shifts. Even though it was hard work, it was a lot of fun. I thought I was strong, but I felt weak compared to the team. My idea of gardening did not include hard physical work or careful planning. I am more enthusiastic than effective at gardening, so I don’t plan to leave my nursing job.""

Charlie Dimmock, a landscape gardener on Ground Force, worked a shift at Hammersmith Hospital. ""I made beds and handed out medicine. I thought I would feel faint doing some tasks, but I was surprised that it didn’t bother me. The friendship among the nurses was great, and it felt very different from my usual male environment. I feel my job is less important than nursing. My day at the hospital was not pleasant, but it gave me a strong sense of satisfaction.""

Lucy Harvey, a personal trainer, spent a day with Ryanair as cabin crew. ""I changed into the uniform, and as soon as I put it on, I felt different—people looked up to me. Before the flight, our supervisor talked about safety and what to do if someone had a heart attack, which I knew from my fitness training. When passengers boarded the flight to Paris, I handed out magazines. Everyone stared at me, and I felt very self-conscious. On the return flight, we had 80 schoolchildren who wouldn’t sit still. I wished I was back in the gym with one sensible adult to manage them.""

Sonia McDermott, an air hostess with Ryanair, spent a day as a personal trainer in a gym. ""I was nervous about this swap because I don’t exercise. I was surprised by how much attention you give to one person. In my job, I meet 130 passengers four times a day. At lunch, I was surprised to see that some trainers didn’t eat very healthily, but they all drank a lot of water. I wouldn’t change my job for this, but it has inspired me to join a gym and try to be healthier."""

Five celebrities share their favorite memories of train journeys with Andrew Morgan.

**Andrea Thompson - Newsreader**  
I fell in love with the south of France a long time ago and try to visit as often as I can. There is a local train from Cannes that goes along the coast and crosses into Italy. It takes you past stunning seascapes. No matter the weather or the time of year, it is always beautiful. Out of the other window, you can see some of the best gardens and homes in France. It feels like you are peeking into the lives of the rich and famous. The passengers are always lively, with a mix of tourists and locals, all enjoying the breathtaking journey.

**Raj Patel - Explorer**  
I have had many great train journeys, but my favorite is the Nile Valley Express, which travels across the northern Sudan desert. When I was young in South Africa, I missed a family train trip from Cape Town to Kruger National Park because I was considered too young and troublesome. When I moved to England as a teenager, I still hadn’t traveled by train. London Waterloo was the first real station I saw, and its large glass dome amazed me.

**Betty Cooper - Novelist**  
I am grateful to one train in particular: the Blue Train, which took my husband and me on our honeymoon across France to catch a boat to Egypt. On the train, my husband gave me a pink dress, which I loved. Someone said that pink is good for the brain, and I have worn it ever since. The journey was lovely, traveling through France and then by boat up the Nile. It was the perfect way to relax after all the wedding planning.

**Martin Brown - Journalist**  
We were working on articles about a round-the-world trip and needed to cross a desert in Africa. There was no road, so we took the Desert Express. The schedule was unreliable; we were just given a day. We heard that the driver would often wait for days if he knew people were still coming. When the train arrived, many people rushed to get on, even traveling on the roof for free. At night, the train passed through some of the most beautiful landscapes I have ever seen. It felt like a dream, like traveling across the moon.

**Arisu Mezuki - Actress**  
Most people form their favorite memories of trains as children, but that’s not my case. I grew up in Singapore and Cyprus, where I saw very few trains. It wasn’t until I was a teenager that trains became important in my life. I made a film that featured a railway in Yorkshire. Most of the filming was on an old, unused part of the line, which volunteers had carefully maintained. That’s where my love for steam trains began. When we weren’t filming, we took every chance to ride the train, and when I returned last year, it felt like time had stood still. Everything was still there, even the gas lights on the station platform!"

Are you trying to get your story published? If you’re unsure where to send it, our expert Margaret Stubbs has some helpful advice. Many readers of this magazine ask, ""I have written a story or book. Who should I send it to?"" One important thing to know is that you need to research publishers and improve your writing skills. Turning your writing into something that can be sold requires a good understanding of the publishing world. 

No matter what type of writing you do, you should learn about the markets you want to reach. The best way to do this is by reading as much as you can about relevant topics. Visit your local library and check out nearby bookstores and newsagents. Reading widely will help you understand what kinds of writing publishers are currently accepting. 

As time goes on, you need to keep updating your knowledge because new publications are always coming out. Editors change jobs, and magazines can change their focus. Publishers are always looking for new writers, so you need to know what they want. 

If you’re unsure about what to write, let’s say you want to write short love stories. First, find out which magazines publish love stories, as this market is quite limited now. Get recent copies of those magazines and learn about the types of stories they buy and who their readers are. These readers have specific expectations, and the editor wants to meet those needs.

Writers often ask me, ""This story has been rejected three times. Am I wasting my time? Do I have a chance?"" As a former teacher, I don’t want to discourage anyone, but it’s likely that the work isn’t ready for publication. Many new writers are too eager to send out their work before they are prepared. If you have only written one story or article, it’s very unlikely to be published. This rarely happens. When you hear about someone’s success, they usually have been in publishing or journalism for years before achieving it.

When you finally send out your work for the first time, keep writing while you wait for a response. Write ten more stories, or even twenty. Each one will improve your skills, and you will start to see yourself as a writer, which will boost your confidence. Instead of giving up on your stories, work on improving them. I also recommend not sharing your work with others in the early stages. Remember, every successful writer has faced many rejections before finding success.

Do everything you can to advance your writing career. Look for a creative writing course nearby. If you can’t find one, consider joining a local writers' group to gain ideas and confidence from other aspiring writers. Think of yourself as a writer and practice writing every day if you can."

On the last day of a difficult year, I was leaning against a pillar in the Baltimore train station, waiting for the 10:10 train to Philadelphia. There were more people waiting than I had expected. The usual clean and bright atmosphere of the station felt lost. Elderly couples with matching luggage filled the benches, and groups of college students had left their bags scattered on the floor. A grey-haired man was walking around, talking to different strangers. He looked well-off: tanned skin, nice sweater, and a soft beige coat. He approached a woman sitting alone and asked her a question. Then he came over to a girl near me, who had long blond hair. I had thought about talking to her myself. The man asked, ""Are you traveling to Philadelphia?"" She replied, ""Well, I'm going north, but to Philadelphia?"" ""No, I'm going to New York, but I'll be..."" ""Thanks anyway,"" he said, moving to the next bench. Now he had my full attention. 

""Ma'am,"" I heard him ask an old lady, ""are you traveling to Philadelphia?"" When she said, ""Wilmington,"" he just moved on to a couple with matching luggage. I straightened up from my pillar and moved closer, pretending to look at the platform. I was going to Philadelphia. I understood why he didn’t ask me; he probably thought I looked unreliable. He glanced at me quickly and then went to the other end of the waiting area. He looked stressed now. ""Please!"" he said to a woman reading a book. ""Tell me you're going to Philadelphia!"" She looked up from her book. She was in her thirties, maybe thirty-five. ""Philadelphia?"" she said. ""Yes, I am."" ""Could I ask you a favor?"" I stood a few feet away, pretending to check my wrist, even though I didn’t have a watch. I could tell she was becoming cautious. The man must have noticed too, because he said, ""Nothing too difficult, I promise!"" 

They announced my train. People started moving toward Gate E, older couples pulling their wheeled bags behind them. I heard the man talking. ""My daughter's flying out this afternoon for a study year abroad from Philadelphia. I put her on a train this morning, stopped for groceries, and came home to find my wife upset. She hardly said 'hello' to me. My daughter forgot her passport. She called from the station in Philadelphia and didn’t know what to do."" The woman listened sympathetically. I would have stayed quiet to see where he was going with this. ""So I told her to stay put. Stay right there in the station, and I would get someone to bring her passport."" 

I thought it was strange. Why didn’t he go himself if it was such an emergency? ""Why don't you go yourself?"" the woman asked. ""I can't leave my wife alone for that long. She's in a wheelchair."" I thought that was a weak excuse. It seemed like too much bad luck for one family. I looked at them. The man was holding a packet, not a plain envelope, but a padded one, the size of a paperback book. Aha! Padded! So you couldn’t feel what was inside! From where I stood, it looked stapled shut too. Be careful, lady, I thought silently."

John Moore, the owner of a restaurant, shares his thoughts about his son Gary, who is a well-known TV chef. He believes everyone has a chance in life. Gary had his chance with cooking, while John had his chance to run a restaurant. When John learned about a restaurant for sale, he quickly went to see it. The place was in poor condition, but it was just what he needed. 

Starting this business reminded him of his childhood. He remembers feeling sad when his mother went to work in a factory and left him alone. This made him want to ensure his family had time together. His wife took care of their children and managed the finances while John ran the restaurant. They lived above the restaurant and always made it a point to have meals together. This focus on family has helped their children, Gary and Joe, grow up confident. From a young age, they would talk to the restaurant's regular customers, giving them a good start in life.

Gary was an energetic child. When he was about seven, he jumped into a corner bath, thinking it was a swimming pool, and knocked himself out. As he grew older, he had to earn pocket money. He started with small jobs and by age ten, he was working in the kitchen every weekend, which meant he always had money at school. He was disciplined and often woke up before his father. In a family business, everyone helps out, and John enjoyed seeing Gary contribute.

Although Gary was not very good in school, he excelled in the kitchen. By age 15, he was as skilled as the adult chefs and sometimes even managed the kitchen. He could prepare over a hundred meals, and John realized Gary would pursue a career in catering because of his talent. When Gary needed work experience for school, John sent him to a friend’s restaurant.

Recently, Gary started playing the drums and formed his own band. John wonders what will happen to Gary's cooking if his music career takes off. He advised Gary to focus on one goal, saying, ""If you chase two hares, you catch neither."" John also told him that if he wanted to achieve something in life, he needed to do it by age 30, or it might be too late.

At 17, Gary attended catering college. On his first day, while other students were just starting, Gary quickly chopped vegetables and sliced meats, finishing his tasks in under an hour. He even helped his classmates. Everyone is amazed at how successful Gary's TV cooking show has become, and John is very proud of him. He has always encouraged Gary to work hard for what he wants because nothing is given for free. Gary recognized the opportunity he had and took full advantage of it. 

As parents, we hope our children listen to us as they grow. John feels happy if Gary remembers even a small part of what he has taught him. The things Gary says and does show that he has listened at times."
FCE_7,"**Text: Finding a Flat in Dublin**

Finding a good flat in Dublin that you can afford is very difficult. The best way to find one is through personal connections. If you know someone who knows someone leaving a flat, that can help. But if, like Jo, you just arrived in Dublin, you have no connections and no one to tell you about available rooms. So, Jo had to stay in a hostel and search for a flat. For her, Dublin felt like a big unknown place. She felt nervous when she took the train to start her job there. She didn’t question why she was going; everyone at school expected her to leave. Who would want to stay in a small town? Everyone wanted to escape and experience life. Some of her classmates had moved to nearby towns like Ennis or Limerick, where family helped them settle in. But Jo was going to Dublin alone.

Jo's mother thought it would be good for her to stay in the hostel permanently. It was run by nuns, so her mother believed she would be safe. Her father hoped the hostel was warm, as they are often cold. Jo's sisters, who worked as waitresses, thought she was crazy for staying in a hostel for a week. But Jo didn’t know they were still talking about her while she answered an ad for a flat in Ringsend. The ad said, ""Own room, own television, share kitchen, bathroom."" It was close to her job at the post office and seemed too good to be true. Jo hoped it would be nice, that the people would like her, and that it wouldn’t be too expensive. There wasn’t a line for this flat because it was more about finding a ""Third Girl Wanted"" than just a flat to rent. The mention of ""own television"" made Jo wonder if it was too fancy for her, but the house looked normal—an ordinary red-brick building with a basement. The flat was upstairs, and as Jo climbed the stairs, a cheerful girl with a college scarf came down. 

""Desperate place,"" she said to Jo. ""They're both awful. Common as dirt."" 

""Oh,"" Jo replied and continued up. 

""Hello,"" said the girl with ""Nessa"" on her T-shirt. ""Did you see that stuck-up girl leaving? I can't stand her kind."" 

""What did she do?"" Jo asked. 

""She didn’t do anything. She just looked around, made a face, and giggled, saying, 'Is this all there is? Oh dear, oh dear,' in a posh voice. We wouldn’t want her here, would we, Pauline?"" 

Pauline, wearing a very colorful shirt, looked like a punk, which surprised Jo. She had seen punks on O'Connell Street but had never talked to one. 

""I'm Jo, I work at the post office and I called about the flat,"" she said. 

Nessa said they were about to have tea and brought out three mugs—one with ""Nessa,"" one with ""Pauline,"" and one labeled ""Other."" 

""We'll put your name on a mug if you come to stay,"" she said kindly."
FCE_43,"**Text: Behind the Dolphin's Smile**

People love dolphins. We enjoy watching them in seaside areas, movies, and TV shows. However, according to the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society, dolphins are in serious trouble. Mark Simmonds reports on the decline of these animals.

Dolphins are special to us. They are very intelligent, sensitive to human feelings, and inspire us with thoughts of freedom in the ocean. Our affection for them has been boosted by television shows. First, there was Flipper, and now we have Darwin from Seaquest. But these happy images hide the harsh reality of dolphins living in polluted and overfished oceans today.

The population of North Sea harbour porpoises, a type of dolphin, has decreased by up to 89,000. You might think that such beloved animals would be protected by laws and cared for in marine reserves. Unfortunately, this is not true, and the lack of protection could lead to a major wildlife disaster.

There are forty different types of dolphins worldwide. In northern Europe, the most common are the striped dolphin, the common dolphin, the bottlenose dolphin, and the smaller harbour porpoise. The striped and common dolphins usually live far out at sea and are rarely seen, so we know little about them. Bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises were once frequently seen near European coasts. Bottlenose dolphins are very social and used to be found along the Channel coast and in rivers like the Thames. Now, they can only be found in small numbers in places like the Moray Firth in Scotland and Cardigan Bay in Wales. The injuries on the few remaining dolphins show that they are under stress.

The complex behavior of dolphins makes it hard to understand why their numbers are decreasing. Overfishing is greatly reducing fish populations and threatening local fishing industries, which also endangers dolphins and porpoises. Porpoises need to find food quickly, and if fish are removed from one area, they may not survive long enough to find food elsewhere. They can also get caught in fishermen's nets, which they cannot see. Many modern fishing methods use large nets that are either left floating or pulled quickly through the water. Recently, hundreds of dead dolphins have washed up on the beaches of France and Cornwall, with injuries showing that they were caught in these nets.

Pollution in the sea can also harm dolphins. For example, pesticides can build up in their bodies because they dissolve in fat. Female dolphins produce milk that can contain high levels of these toxins, which can poison their young. There has been at least one case of a young dolphin dying from its mother’s contaminated milk.

Another serious threat to dolphins comes from human activity. Dolphins live in groups and rely on sound to understand their environment. Noise pollution from ships and oil drilling travels much better in water than in air, which may disturb dolphins in ways we do not fully understand."
FCE_51,"**Text: GETTING FIT**

Exercise is important for your mind, body, and spirit. It helps you stay balanced, especially when life feels chaotic. You might be tired of reading about fitness, but there are many good reasons to exercise, and very few reasons not to. 

Exercise improves your muscle tone and can quickly change your body shape. It makes your muscles stronger and helps you maintain good posture, which is how you hold your body when sitting or standing. It also helps prevent muscle imbalances that can lead to injuries. Additionally, exercise can improve specific areas like your thighs, stomach, and upper arms. It benefits your heart, lungs, and blood circulation.

You may have heard these benefits before, but here’s something new: exercise can help reduce feelings of depression and tiredness, and it can improve your sleep. It also helps manage stress and can relieve some medical conditions. 

If you’re not convinced yet, just remember that exercise is good for you. There are many types of exercise you can try, such as aerobics, jogging, or using weights. However, be careful not to overdo it, as training too hard can cause injuries. If you’re unsure about what’s best for you, it’s a good idea to talk to your doctor.

Good posture is essential for improving your body shape. If you slouch, it can make you look and feel less energetic. To improve your posture, imagine that a helium balloon is pulling the top of your head up towards the sky. This can help you lift your chest and breathe better, while also making your body look slimmer.

Stretching is also important. It improves flexibility and helps you move easily, which can prevent injuries. If you stretch four or five times a week, you will become more flexible and fit. Your exercise routine should include a warm-up, stretching, an energetic workout, and a cool-down period."
FCE_11,"**IN THEIR NATURAL HABITAT**

What keeps filmmakers Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman away from their homes for months? They are searching for the perfect shot. Among all the animals in the jungles and plains of East Africa, two of the hardest to find are Amanda and Owen. Currently, they are in the Ngorongoro Crater, which has experienced six months of almost continuous rain, leading to unexpected challenges. Newman mentioned that they had to buy an expensive piece of equipment so that if one of their vehicles gets stuck in the mud, Amanda can pull him back to safety. Their partnership has produced some of the best wildlife films on TV, including a well-received film about leopards. While this film was being shown, they were already back in the field, this time tracking the shy jackal.

Traveling filmmakers have been exploring the world to capture exotic wildlife on camera since television began. I spoke to Newman during one of his rare meetings with other people at a safari lodge. He said, ""We do have occasional arguments, but we get over them quickly."" Neither sees themselves as the leader, and they get along well because they view animals similarly. ""When we travel, we set up our tents each night. But this time, we have a more fixed camp. We usually make tea the night before and keep it warm in a vacuum flask."" Their daily meals consist of pre-packed food that is heated and served by whoever is available. ""It's common for us to be out for up to eight weeks, so meal preparation can be stressful,"" Newman explained. 

Although it can be tough, being in remote areas allows them to get close to the animals. Newman recalled filming a family of lions, where one lioness would often wander off. When she returned, she would greet all the pride members, and eventually, she included their vehicle in her greetings.

Newman first worked with Barrett in 1988 on a film called ""The Great Rift,"" and two years later, they teamed up to film Arctic foxes. Since then, they have learned to spend four months on location to gather enough material for each half-hour film. Before they can start filming, they must submit a script for approval. ""Amanda and I developed a strong working relationship from the beginning,"" Newman said, ""because we share the same ideas and vision. We aim to create a film that captures the true spirit of the place and its animals, and that resonates emotionally with viewers. I believe evoking an emotional response is more powerful than just appealing to logic."""

In our series about women in sports, Suzie Ellis met Kendra Slawinski, the captain of England's netball team. When I met her, she had just finished a typical day of teaching at a local school, followed by a training session in a supermarket car park. I was surprised by her training location. I asked her, ""Don't you get strange looks?"" She replied, ""I'm so focused on my movements and my feet that I don't notice much else. I might see cars slow down out of the corner of my eye, but that's it.""

Kendra explained, ""My life now is all about being my best for the Championships. I follow a strict schedule to reach maximum fitness."" This will be her fourth World Championships, and it is expected to be the largest yet, with 27 countries participating. ""Having home support is special,"" she said. ""It's important to improve the reputation of netball in this country. Playing at home means more pressure than usual. The crowd will have expectations and will support us. People want us to start the tournament with a strong performance.""

Their first game is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. Kendra noted, ""We have always beaten them, but they will be exciting to play against because they have a lot of talent."" The England team is currently ranked fourth in the world, but Kendra acknowledges that the Championships will be challenging. ""You have to push yourself every day; there’s no break between games like in a series. You can still win a series if you lose the first game, but the Championships are different. You only get one chance, and you must be ready to take it.""

In the fifteen years since she started playing at a high level, the sport has become tougher and faster. Players are more aggressive on the court. Kendra said, ""You don’t train hard to lose."" However, she added, ""Once the game is over, we become friends again.""

Netball is also using a more scientific approach to fitness testing. Kendra stated, ""It’s essential for us to think and train like world-class players. As captain, I believe it’s important to have a strong mindset and lead by example. I see my role as supporting and encouraging my teammates.""

Kendra mentioned, ""From the start of my netball career, everything has been carefully planned."" She decided that this competition would be her last as a player. She may coach young players in the future, but right now, she is focused on her final big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she is likely to have tears of joy, knowing her loyal supporters will be with her every step of the way."
FCE_63,"**Text: In Hot Water**

Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends a lot of time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She teaches and researches marine geochemistry, which means she studies the chemical processes in the sea. Rachel is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she is not teaching, she gets into a small steel vehicle designed for underwater exploration and dives three kilometres down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes.

Inside the vehicle, space is very limited. Rachel can reach out and touch the two pilots. They are used to the cramped conditions, where they cannot stand up or move around, and they must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last for 16 hours: three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours to collect rock and water samples, and three hours to return to the surface.

If there is an emergency and they need to get to the surface quickly, they can press a panic button. This releases a small escape vessel that rises quickly to the surface, similar to a ping-pong ball in water. No one has tested this escape method yet, but Rachel thinks it would not be a pleasant experience.

Rachel recalls her first dive. She climbed into the vehicle on a ship with an instructor, who explained the emergency procedures, including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack. They were assessing how she would react in such a small space. Now, Rachel has completed six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian crew to a site five days west of the Canary Islands. There, on the ocean floor, is a large area of underwater volcanoes that release black smoke. The Russian team was dropping off scientific equipment to study the effects of a multinational program that would create a hole 150 metres through a volcano.

When Rachel is not at sea, she works in her office at the Oceanography Centre in Southampton. Two-thirds of her salary comes from teaching, which she enjoys, but she also wants to continue her research on ""black smokers,"" another name for underwater volcanoes. These volcanoes release water that looks like black smoke at a rate of one metre per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees Celsius.

The only time Rachel felt scared was during her first dive with an American team. They were towing equipment when there was a sudden explosion. The shock waves hit their vehicle, and she thought she might die. They waited in silence, and when nothing happened, they were incredibly relieved to be alive.

Diving to the deepest part of the ocean is an adventure. Every time Rachel looks out of the porthole and sees the chimneys, she feels a sense of wonder. She realizes that she is at the bottom of the sea, and no one else on Earth has ever seen these sights. After studying black smokers for three years for her Ph.D., seeing them in person was an amazing experience."
FCE_56,"**Interview Tips**

First impressions are very important. Research shows that people form opinions about us within the first few minutes of meeting. They notice how we dress, our eye contact, our body language, and how we speak, including our speed, volume, and tone, as well as the words we use.

Mary Pearce studied to be a teacher. She worked hard to earn her degree and felt confident when she graduated. She applied for a job at a nearby primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher. On the day of the interview, she noticed a small hole in her jacket. She thought about changing but decided it would make her late, and she believes being on time is very important. Unfortunately, Mary did not get the job. A friend who teaches at the school told her that the Head Teacher said, ""If someone doesn't take the time to present her best image at an interview, what kind of teacher will she be?""

Simon Grant, a hotel manager, explains that interviewees who care about their appearance are more likely to care about their jobs. While people often say that what matters is inside, it is important to present yourself well in an interview.

Many people overlook the importance of a professional image. For instance, Janet Goodwood worked for ten years as an administrative assistant in a large accounting firm. When the office manager retired, she applied for the position but did not even get an interview. She thought it was a mistake and asked the Director of Personnel what happened. He told her she did not fit the image of an office manager and suggested she improve her wardrobe before applying again. Janet was shocked because she believed her work performance should matter more than her appearance.

Movement and gestures also affect an interviewer's first impression. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian found that only 7% of our message about feelings comes from the words we use, 38% from our voice, and a surprising 55% from our facial expressions. When our facial expressions and words send different messages, the listener will pay more attention to the non-verbal message. Therefore, it is important that your words match your body language. Mixed messages can confuse the interviewer.

It is also crucial not to seem too desperate for the job or overly eager to please. Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, applied for a promotion and her interview went so well that she was offered the job immediately. She was very happy but showed too much excitement. Once her boss sensed her enthusiasm, he offered her a lower salary than she expected. She believes she could have negotiated a better salary if she had controlled her excitement.

Finally, what we say and how we say it can greatly affect the success of an interview. David Artesio, a manager at an employment agency, suggests learning about the company before the interview. For example, the annual report can provide information about the company's activities. Mentioning an area that interests you during the interview can create a positive impression and show your interest in the company. Business consultant Marian Woodall advises having a few questions ready and avoiding long, confusing sentences. She states, ""Poor communicators talk in paragraphs. Successful communicators talk in short sentences and highlight key points."""

**The Farmer**  
Matt Froggatt was once an insurance agent in London, but now he runs a sheep farm. ""After 14 years in the business, I found that working in the City became boring—no one was enjoying it anymore. I had planned to stay for another five or ten years, but then I was unexpectedly made redundant. I didn’t receive a great severance package, but it was enough to start my farm. My big break came when I met the head chef of a local hotel with one of the best restaurants in the country. By supplying them, my reputation grew, and now I also sell meat through mail order. I’m happy to be out of the office, but it’s surprising how little has changed: I still work 80 to 90 hours a week and am still selling a product.""

**The Painter**  
Ron Able White was a manager in advertising, but now he makes a living as an artist. ""I started painting as a hobby, but I found it much more exciting than my job. Choosing to take redundancy and become an artist felt like the right choice. The career counselor I spoke to was very supportive. I think I was the first person to tell him, 'I don’t want to go back to my old job.' He was shocked because most people in their mid-forties need to find work quickly for financial reasons. My wife and I married young, and our children were independent, so we took a risk and moved to northern England, where we didn’t know anyone. We left our friends behind, but luckily, our friendships have lasted, and many visit us now.""

**The Hat Maker**  
Katherine Goodison worked as a company lawyer for five years before starting her own hat-making business from her flat in London. ""Being a lawyer was enjoyable and well-paid, but the hours were awful. I realized I didn’t want to become a senior partner, working even longer hours, so I decided to leave. Many people said I would get bored, but that has never happened. The key is to set deadlines. Since my business is fashion-related, I have collections and seasonal designs to manage, so I always have plenty to do and need to keep a strict schedule. I feel happier now and much less stressed. However, I miss the social interaction with colleagues. What I love about this job is that I am fully responsible for my work. If I do a poor job, I am the one who faces the consequences. When you work for a company, you care, but when your name is on the promotional materials, you care even more.""

**The Masseur**  
Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16 years before becoming a masseur at the Life Centre in London. ""I was in financial markets from the age of 22, making deals. I enjoyed the excitement, but I never found the work fulfilling. I almost lost my job in 1989, but I chose to resign and travel for a year. During that time, I tried to figure out what I wanted to do. I was interested in health, so I visited some of the best gyms in the world and spoke to the owners about how they started. I knew I needed qualifications to change careers, so I took various massage courses. Then, I got a part-time job at the Life Centre. I have no regrets. I used to feel out of control, but now I have peace of mind and control over my future, which is the best part."""
FCE_6,"**Text: 'Dedicated to Their Sports'**

Four young athletes share their experiences.

**A. Darius (Runner)**  
I have always been active in sports. I tried many, but I was best at football and athletics. When I was 14, I tried out for a professional football team, but I chose to focus on athletics instead. My proudest moment was competing for my country in the youth team and winning a medal. Unfortunately, it didn’t get much media attention, which was disappointing. I hoped to get some sponsorship because training can be expensive. I train at home all winter and then go to Florida for three weeks before the season starts. It’s fun there with great facilities and nightlife, but I have to be disciplined. If friends invite me out the night before training, I have to decline. I wish I didn’t have to, but dedication is important in this sport. My main goal is to compete in the next Olympics—that would be amazing.

**B. Gabriel (Surfer)**  
The surfing community is small, so I often see the same people at competitions. Professional surfers take it seriously, and the best waves are usually at dawn, so I have to skip late-night parties. I don’t mind too much, but I do enjoy sleeping in, which I often have to give up. However, it’s worth it because my dedication helped me win the National Championships last year. After a win, I always celebrate with a big night out, and if I win money, I treat myself to a nice getaway. The sacrifices pay off in the long run, as winning that championship led to me hosting a surfing series on TV. I guess I’m a bit of a celebrity now.

**C. Dieter (Yacht Racer)**  
Being on a boat with my teammates is always fun. We have a tradition of celebrating our wins in style. Some say we act a bit childish when we celebrate, but we don’t seek media attention. Sometimes, reporters seem more interested in our celebrations than our race results. I spend eight months a year away, so it’s nice to return home and hang out with friends from different backgrounds. You can’t focus on the sport all the time; it’s not healthy. I’m known in the sailing world, but I rarely get recognized in public. I wouldn’t want to be a celebrity. I do receive many letters from fans asking for signed pictures, and I make sure to reply to each one, even if it takes time.

**D. Tomas (Tennis Player)**  
It’s exciting to walk onto the court and feel the crowd’s support. At my last tournament, things got a bit hectic with fans crowding around. I enjoy being recognized by fans when I’m out shopping, but it has its downsides. My last girlfriend didn’t like it when I got too much attention from female fans. Tennis players travel a lot, and that’s part of why we broke up. It was tough, but sacrifices are necessary in any sport; you have to be serious and professional. I’m focused on my game now and plan to enjoy other aspects of life after I retire, which comes early in this sport."
FCE_33,"**Text: Young Shoppers**

Shopping at the supermarket with children can be very challenging for parents. One mother explains, ""They want everything they see. If it’s not the newest sugary cereal, it’s a Disney video or a comic book. Usually, they want all three. I can’t afford all this, and if I give in to their requests, I feel guilty for buying unhealthy food. I hate saying no all the time, and I get anxious before we even leave the house. I try to avoid taking them shopping, but then I worry that I’m not letting them learn how to make their own choices. It feels impossible.""

Research shows that children ask for something to buy every two minutes when they are in a supermarket. Over £150 million is spent each year on advertising aimed directly at children, mostly on television. This amount is expected to grow, and supermarkets are where this advertising is most effective. Children often do not understand why their parents say they cannot buy certain things, and arguments about the dangers of sugar are not convincing when compared to the appealing advertisements.

Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, ""Most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, but these ideas are not always correct. It is important for parents and children to talk about food, because if children only learn from TV ads, they get a very one-sided view. Parents feel frustrated because they are competing with the advertising industry and often have to disappoint their children.""

The Independent Television Commission, which oversees TV advertising, does not allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy products. However, Dibb notes, ""The main goal of advertising is to convince people to buy something. So even if they can’t say, 'Tell your mom to buy this,' that is still the effect.""

Shopping with children can be stressful for parents because they have to decide which requests to accept and which to deny. One mother says she is patient when discussing food with her children, but she still feels uneasy about how she handles their requests: ""My son notices advertisements but is critical of them. We talk a lot about different products and look at labels together. I’ve talked so much that he now thinks all ads are silly. We don’t have much conflict in the supermarket because the children don’t ask for things I don’t want to buy.""

Parents also admit they can be inconsistent in how they respond to their children’s requests. Mike, a father of a seven-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter, says, ""We refuse to buy sweets for him because we say they are bad for him, but we fill our cart with cream and chocolate for ourselves. It’s nice to buy treats, and it’s normal for children to want to share that. But I still get annoyed by their requests. It often depends on my mood. If I’m feeling good, I’m more likely to say yes. It’s hard to be consistent.""

Supermarkets could help reduce conflicts between parents and children by removing sweets from checkout areas or providing supervised play areas. Although parents might spend less if their children are not with them, the idea of shopping without their children’s demands could attract enough extra customers to make up for it."
FCE_20,"**Text: Five-Star Luxury and Modern Technology**

The new five-star Merrion Hotel in Dublin combines luxury with the latest technology. It was created by transforming four large 18th-century houses, a project that took nearly two years and involved extensive research into what customers want. This approach allowed for the installation of advanced technology that benefits both staff and guests.

General Manager Peter MacCann expects his staff to know guests by name, but he uses a computer system to track guests' preferences. This system, which cost £250,000 to set up, helps the hotel provide a special experience for returning guests. For instance, if a guest requests specific music CDs during their first stay, those same CDs will be ready for them on their next visit. This is made possible by a guest-history feature that records individual preferences.

Room temperature is another common concern for hotel guests. The Merrion has a high-tech system that allows guests to adjust the temperature in their rooms within a range of 14°C to 25°C. Guests can change the temperature themselves, or the front desk can adjust it for them.

The hotel also caters to business travelers, who make up about 65% of its clientele. Instead of a traditional business center, the hotel has equipped each room with three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that also works as a photocopier and printer, and video-conferencing capabilities. To keep up with rapid technological changes, the hotel has installed extra cables for future upgrades. Televisions are rented, allowing for easy replacement with newer models, and DVD recorders can also be updated.

Despite all this technology, MacCann emphasizes that the hotel aims to make guests feel comfortable, not overwhelmed. The 145 well-furnished bedrooms are designed to be cozy and inviting. The hotel also features a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a lovely garden.

The dining experience is a highlight, with food that must meet high standards. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, who previously ran a two-Michelin-star restaurant, has moved his restaurant to the Merrion. This change has allowed him to create a modern kitchen and improve parking facilities. For the hotel, having a renowned restaurant on-site is a significant advantage without financial risks. With its combination of technology and skilled staff, the Merrion Hotel is poised for success."
FCE_40,"**Text: Where I Get My Energy**

Emma Marsden asked six women who live life fully to share how they find their energy.

A. **Jeanette Kupfermann, Journalist and Author:** ""I get my energy from excitement. I need to be challenged and learn new things. Right now, I'm learning flamenco dancing, which is very energizing. If I'm bored, I feel drained. Being effective, even in small ways, gives me energy.""

B. **Linda Kelsey, Magazine Editor:** ""I have a lot of work, but I enjoy it. Work is not a chore for me. When I get enough sleep, I feel great. I know exercise boosts my energy, but I sometimes struggle to find the motivation. I do yoga once a week and try to work out at home. After exercising, I feel much better. I often feel low in the afternoon, so I think it's good to have a snack then.""

C. **Annie Nightingale, Disc Jockey:** ""I don’t rely on healthy eating for energy; I think it comes from being enthusiastic and positive. I dislike negative people. I believe we should enjoy life and set goals. I love my job, and the last two years have been exciting. I’m surrounded by lively young people, which energizes me. I enjoy taking photos and writing lyrics for fun, which helps me relax while traveling.""

D. **Floella Benjamin, Author and Children's TV Presenter:** ""My energy comes from doing things I love. I believe in being positive, especially when working with kids, who are full of energy. Communicating with others gives me a natural boost. I try to eat healthily and avoid smoking and drinking, but I don’t have a strict exercise routine. I get my energy from playing with kids.""

E. **Deborah Moggach, Author and Playwright:** ""I love creating gardens from wasteland. I once turned a concrete area into a garden, which was more energizing than any workout. Knowing that someone wants to read my writing also motivates me. I enjoy exploring nature, even if it means sneaking onto private land.""

F. **Katherine Monblot, Therapist:** ""It's important to have an interest in what you do. I like taking risks and get bored easily, which keeps me motivated. Doing things I don’t want to do drains my energy. I used to be part of many committees, but I found them exhausting. You have limited energy, so focus on what matters most to you."""
FCE_45,"**Text: ICE SKATING**

Ice skating has been around for thousands of years. Archaeologists have found skates made from animal bones, which were used until iron was introduced in Scandinavia around 200 AD. For the upper classes in Scandinavia, skating was an important skill. In the early 1900s, skating was seen as elegant, but at the 1924 Winter Olympics, 11-year-old Sonja Henie brought a more athletic style that made skating very popular. Today, skating combines art and athleticism, making it both beautiful and physically challenging.

For beginners, balance and control are crucial, and speed comes with practice. The way you position your body is key to maintaining balance. Keep your legs slightly bent and your knees relaxed to center your weight, leaning a bit forward. Relaxation is essential in skating. Start with your heels almost touching and your feet turned outward. As you push off with your back foot, make a small movement with your other foot. If you can maintain this for a while, you can gradually increase the length of your movements as you improve.

Learning how to fall is one of the first skills a skater should master. Even professional skaters fall sometimes. To fall safely, stay relaxed to reduce the impact when you hit the ice. To get up, use your hands to kneel and then stand up. Once you feel confident on the ice, you can try different styles like figure skating, freestyle, distance, speed, and pair skating. The best way to start is by learning figure skating and then basic freestyle.

With proper instruction available at most ice rinks, you can quickly learn the basic moves, and soon you will be able to do turns, jumps, and spins in freestyle. If you watch skilled skaters, you will notice how relaxed and fluid their movements are. To achieve this, it is important to follow a regular exercise routine. Skating with a stiff body can be dangerous, so warm-up exercises should focus on your legs, back, shoulders, and especially your ankles and knees. After skating, do the same exercises to prevent stiffness.

Skating helps improve balance, coordination, relaxation, and movement. It also boosts heart and lung health and strengthens the body. When combined with swimming or jogging, it creates an excellent fitness program for overall health."

If there is one thing that can make you cry with joy, it is seeing a talented child receive a medal. Julia Gregson spoke to three young stars and their mothers about the joys and challenges of their lives.

A. **Annika Reeder**, 15, won a gold medal in gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games. She wants to be a physiotherapist and compete in the next Olympics. ""The training is very hard right now. I don’t have time to watch TV, go out with friends, or do much besides gymnastics and school. I try to take it one day at a time. When I feel really tired, my coach sometimes gives me a day off, but usually, I just keep going. You can’t take too many days off, or you get stiff.""

B. **Annika's mother**: ""From a young age, Annika showed great talent. I’ve seen some parents push their children, but that doesn’t work. To perform at Annika’s level takes a lot of time and energy, and you have to want to do it yourself. People often say we, as parents, have sacrificed a lot, but they don’t see what the sport has given us. We love it and what it has done for Annika. Before gymnastics, she was a shy girl who hid behind me, but now she has met people from all over the world and gained confidence from her success.""

C. **Sarah Stokes** started show-jumping at age ten and has since won the British National Championship. ""It’s a good thing my parents enjoy show-jumping because they train me and take me everywhere in the horse box. The shows can last from one to five days. I never get tired of it—I love show-jumping; it’s exciting and fun. Even if my parents weren’t involved, I would still do it because I am very determined. I’m happy when they are proud of my wins, but I’m not doing it for them. This year, I want to qualify for the British young riders (under-18) team. My big dream is to win a gold medal at the Olympics.""

D. **Sarah's mother**: ""From the moment Sarah sat on a horse at age one, we knew she had found her passion. When she was five, she would wake up early to exercise her pony. To qualify for major shows, we travel all over England. To save money, we sleep in the living area of our horse box. Sarah is very organized. She is completely happy on a horse and knows what she is doing. Watching your child succeed at something they love is an amazing feeling.""

E. **Jane McShane**, 10, is the Under-14 Chess Champion in Britain. ""Tournaments are really friendly. I know everyone, and it’s fun. When I play, I don’t focus as much as I should. I just look around and don’t think too much. I’m not worried about becoming arrogant; I don’t talk about my success at school because I don’t like feeling embarrassed.""

F. **Jane's mother**: ""Jane played her first game when she was five. My father said, 'Let’s see if she likes it.' He had tried to teach me when I was young, but I found it boring. Jane loved it from the start. By the end of that day, she had memorized all the moves, and by age six, she was beating adults. Of course, I’m happy when she wins, but if she wanted to stop playing tomorrow, I wouldn’t stop her. I also don’t want to hold her back because she is exceptional. If she has this talent, I want her to reach her full potential."""
FCE_29,"Text: 

It's true - we are all getting taller. Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy. The teacher jokingly asked, ""What do you want to be? The flagpole on a ship?"" This was funny because Chris was already almost two metres tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is the tallest man in Britain. 

Every decade, the average height of people in Europe increases by about one centimetre. More tall people are being born, but this does not mean we are becoming a super race. Instead, we are returning to how our ancestors were. According to palaeontologist Professor Chris Stringer, we are becoming like Cro-Magnons, the people who lived 40,000 years ago. 

For most of human history, our ancestors had a varied diet. Women gathered fruits and herbs, while men hunted animals. One study found they ate from 85 different wild plants. However, about 9,000 years ago, agriculture began, which changed everything. Farmers took over many green areas, and now just three plants—wheat, rice, and maize—provide more than half of the calories we eat. This limited diet has harmed our health. 

In Ohio, scientists found that when healthy hunter-gatherers started farming corn, they became sickly and underweight. Tooth decay and diseases increased. Although corn was thought to be a blessing, some anthropologists see it as a public health problem. Still, agriculture spread because one piece of land could support many more people than hunting could. 

Today, many people are poorly nourished, but this issue is being addressed in wealthier countries. In Europe, the US, and Japan, diets are starting to reflect the variety of our ancestors' diets again. As a result, the average height of men is now 179 cm in the US, 180 cm in Holland, and 177 cm in Japan. This is a positive trend, but it comes with challenges. 

Even though people are getting taller, standard bed lengths have not changed since 1860, remaining at 190 cm. Legroom in planes and trains seems to have decreased, and clothing manufacturers are constantly adjusting their sizes. The question is: how tall can we get? 

According to Robert Fogel from the University, we might reach a height of 193 cm this century. However, scientists warn that while individuals may be growing taller due to better nutrition, as a species, we are actually getting smaller. During the last ice age, humans were slightly rounder and taller to keep warm. As the climate has warmed, we have become thinner and shorter, even when well-fed. If global warming continues, we may shrink even more. In other words, our growth could be affected by climate change."
FCE_57,"**Text: Studio Audiences**

What is it like to be in the audience when a television show is being filmed? Cosmo Landesman explored this question. Like technical problems, studio audiences are a common part of television, but many of us find them mysterious. When we see people getting excited on game shows, we often wonder: who are these people?

Studio audiences are often seen as the least important type of audience. Some people in the television industry even look down on them, comparing them to cattle. I used to think that studio audiences were just made up of silly people wanting a moment of fame. However, there is no typical studio audience. They come from various backgrounds, jobs, and income levels. Television shows try to attract different people for different programs.

Many of us who watch television at home don’t understand why anyone would want to be in a studio audience. Why would someone apply for tickets, travel far, and sit through hours of boredom just to watch what they could see at home? One idea is that people hope to be seen on television. I didn’t believe this until I spoke to Angela, who said, ""I came for a chance to be on TV."" Another reason people attend is out of curiosity to see behind the scenes. However, the most common reason I heard was simply, ""A friend gave me a ticket.""

Most of us have never been in a studio audience, yet we think we know what it’s like. You sit close to strangers while someone holds up signs that say APPLAUD or LAUGH, and you respond accordingly. This might be true for some shows, but not all. As one studio manager said, ""We believe a good show shouldn’t need these signs.""

Is there a real difference between being in a studio and watching at home? For Claire, being in a studio is ""more exciting,"" while Charlotte enjoyed the feeling of being part of live television. ""Last year, I saw my favorite comedian. When you watch him at home, you miss a lot."" What I missed was seeing live actors; from my seat, I could only see the back of someone’s head. The opening scenes were filmed far from where I sat, so I ended up watching the show on a studio monitor.

Going to a studio might not be the best way to watch television, but that’s not what matters. For most audience members, it was simply fun and a free night of entertainment."

**Bruce**  
I prefer landscapes that include human elements. When I travel, I am drawn to charming villages with old temples rather than empty deserts. At eight years old, I went to school in England and would ride my bike to the village of Lastingham on Saturdays. Cycling was a way to escape school. I enjoyed exploring the rugged hilltops, sheltered valleys, and old villages. Coming from Scotland, I found the landscape both familiar and different, and I still visit it today. I used to write about my adventures in a private diary, which was my first attempt at travel writing, a field in which I later became well-known.

**Sophia**  
There is a small railway that runs from Hythe to Dungeness, operated by enthusiasts. I always choose first class because it costs only a little more than the regular ticket. The scenery isn’t spectacular; the train travels across Romney Marsh with its sheep and alongside a canal. However, there is one part of the journey I always look forward to—when the train takes a detour through back gardens. For a few moments, we passengers get a glimpse into people’s lives as they make tea, wash dishes, or set up deckchairs. I see myself reflected in their eyes, a woman in a tiny train carriage looking into other homes. It’s the simplicity of the landscape that fascinates me—just fields, sheep, and a distant grey sea. This makes me look more closely, searching for something that opens my eyes.

**Matthew**  
The Hartland Peninsula is a beautiful and remote coastline. The beaches are hard to access and filled with rocks, so there are not many crowds. A few brave surfers come, but most visitors prefer to admire the sea’s beauty. This coast, facing the Atlantic, is known for shipwrecks. There are coastal walks that you can combine with trips into lovely damp valleys filled with oak trees, ferns, and wildflowers. We stay in simple self-catering accommodation with a family who owns property in the village of Southole.

**Annette**  
My favorite place in England is the Trough of Bowland, a wide-open moorland perfect for hiking. There are few residents and visitors, making it a quiet and remote area, which I enjoy. I found this place by chance when I was a student, and I have visited every year since, either alone, with my boyfriend, or now with my son. It has changed little since my first visit. Having a child makes these trips more special, but it also makes me sad that he is growing up in a city.

**James**  
I bought Glenthorne, my favorite house in Britain, to find peace and reconnect with my English roots. I grew up in what is now Sri Lanka, but at twelve, I went to school in Devon, in the west of England. I used to ride my bike around the moors and village streets. There was a story about a place we would never cycle past: if you went down the driveway, you would never return. That place was Glenthorne. It is my dream place—a magical, secluded, romantic house. Here, you can only hear the sea, the wind, and the birds."
FCE_42,"**Text: 'HAPPY HUNTING GROUND'**

We are 'animal people' who love all kinds of creatures. One afternoon, my daughter called me at work to say she had found a beautiful pine snake. She asked, ""Can we keep him?"" I replied, ""Yes, but only for one night."" We had prepared a special tank for such visitors, allowing us to admire them and look them up in our natural history book.

I got home late and quickly put a pot on to boil when I heard my sons screaming, ""Oh, Mother! Help! Do something!"" I rushed to their bedroom. The chaos involved Domino the cat and Bianca, the white mouse I had received as a Mother's Day gift. Domino was running around with the mouse in his mouth, trying to escape while avoiding the children’s flailing arms.

I jumped into the mess and tripped over something, landing on the floor. As I considered how to stop Domino, I noticed the snake had escaped. It was slithering off the table and onto the floor. I crouched down as the snake moved, while the kids and the cat continued to jump around in a loud, chaotic scene. The pot boiled over in the kitchen, and I quickly turned off the gas before returning to the chaos with renewed energy. 

This time, I managed to grab Domino by the tail and rescued the small, wet, and surprisingly unharmed mouse from his jaws. Interestingly, the same mouse was caught by Domino three more times in its life but eventually died of old age.

Feeling encouraged by my success with the cat, I examined the snake for any weak spots, but found none. I sat on the floor like a snake-charmer, rocking back and forth, but without a flute. Gradually, the snake relaxed and rested its head on its body, though its eyes still looked suspicious. I carefully slid my hands under the snake and stood up, walking to the end of the garden. There, I pointed the snake towards a tree, giving it the chance to live happily in the garden.

When I finally let go of the snake's head, expecting it to strike, it instead slid over my shoulders like a colorful shawl, seeming to settle in for the winter. We stood together in the fading light: four young children, their mother, and the snake. My eldest son, DJ, broke the silence with a scientific observation: ""You know what it is, Mum? You're nice and warm, and the shed isn't."" 

I had the children gently encourage the snake to move on. Slowly, it did, climbing up the wall and disappearing over the roof. As the last bit of its tail vanished, three-year-old Clay sighed and said what we were all thinking: ""Boy, that was one big snake!"""
FCE_59,"**Text: 'Write to Me!**

In our fast-paced world of phones and computers, the traditional practice of writing letters is in danger of disappearing. However, I believe that receiving a letter brings a joy that no other form of communication can match. There is excitement when a letter arrives, pleasure in seeing who sent it, and enjoyment in reading its contents.

Letter writing has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. It probably started with the little notes I wrote to my mother. She always made sure I wrote my own thank-you letters for Christmas and birthday gifts. It didn’t matter if they were short or messy, as long as they were letters.

When I left home at 18 to study medicine in London, I wrote to my parents every week, and they wrote back. My father occasionally wrote long, funny letters, which I loved. Most letters from home shared everyday events about my parents and their friends. We also made phone calls, but I remember the letters the most.

I also received letters from my boyfriends. Many of them had to work or study far away, so we kept in touch through letters. Surprisingly, writing letters seemed to strengthen our relationships. I found it easier to express my feelings in writing than in conversation.

I enjoy the letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. While short notes are nice, it’s even better to receive a full year’s worth of news! I especially love getting letters in airmail envelopes with beautiful stamps. I have friends who write to me from different countries, like Mangala in Sri Lanka, and I have penfriends in Australia and Vancouver. There’s also a lady from France who writes to me. If we hadn’t met in a restaurant on the way home from a holiday, I would never have had her address to write to her. Thankfully, she replied, and now we have a regular correspondence. I can practice my French with her since she doesn’t speak English. We have visited her home twice, and she has stayed with us.

My biggest success in letter writing happened this summer when my family and I visited my American penfriend in Texas. We had been writing to each other for 29 years but had never met. Everyone was surprised that our correspondence lasted so long, and the local newspaper even featured our story on the front page.

I am happy that my children are continuing this tradition. Like my mother, I make sure they write their own thank-you letters. My daughter writes me little letters, just as I did for my mother. She and my son have their own penfriends in Texas, organized by my penfriend. I strongly encourage everyone not to let letter writing become a lost art.'"

**Careless Tourists Damage Ancient Rock Art**

Many ancient pictures carved into rocks at a famous tourist site in France are being slowly destroyed. Scientists worry that the 36,000 drawings on rocks in Mont Bego in the French Alps are being damaged so quickly that they may not last for future generations. The mountain is thought to have been a place for prayer and worship, and it has drawings that are 4,000 years old. These include images of cows, fields, and various gods and goddesses. However, as more people visit the site, the pictures are being harmed by careless graffiti.

Jean Clottes, the chairman of the International Committee on Rock Art, says, ""People think that because the pictures have been there for so long, they will always be there. But if the damage continues at this rate, there will be nothing left in 50 years."" He has seen tourists stepping on the drawings, which wears away the rock and damages the artwork. Some visitors even take pieces of the rock as souvenirs. ""When people can't take a good photograph, they rub the drawings to make them clearer,"" he explains. ""The drawings are naturally polished by the weather, and if the sun is shining and visitors can't see them well, they rub and scrape them to make them look newer.""

Other researchers have noticed that some people come with long sticks to scratch their own drawings or names into the rocks. Experts disagree on the best way to protect the drawings. Henry de Lumley, director of the Museum of Natural History in Paris, believes the only way to save the site is to make the whole mountain a ""no-go"" area, allowing the public to visit only on guided tours. He warns that if this is not done, the site will be completely destroyed, and important research will be affected.

Clottes disagrees with de Lumley's strict plan, saying it is too extreme and will likely upset local residents. He points out that the site was declared a historic monument by the Ministry of Culture, and we must do everything possible to protect it. David Lavergne, a regional architect, also prefers not to close the site. He believes that while it is important for people to see the site, it is hard to stop visitors from causing damage because the area is so large. He suggests that they may need to charge a fee to help pay for guards, as there is no government funding available.

In Nice, Annie Echassoux, who has researched the site, is worried that as the mountain becomes easier to access—since tourists can now avoid a long walk by using vehicles—the damage will increase quickly. She believes the best solution is to close off parts of the area and provide guides. ""You can't say the plan can't happen because there is no money,"" she says. ""That is not acceptable. Money must be provided because the Ministry of Culture has classified this area as a historic site. If we do not take action, we will be responsible for losing the drawings for future generations."""

Shopping at the supermarket with children can be very challenging for parents. One mother explains, ""They want everything they see. If it’s not the newest sugary cereal, it’s a Disney video or a comic book. Usually, they want all three. I can’t afford all this, and if I give in to their requests, I feel guilty for buying unhealthy food. I hate saying no all the time, and I get anxious before we even leave the house. I try to avoid taking them shopping, but then I worry that I’m not letting them learn how to make their own choices. It feels impossible.""

Research shows that children ask for something to buy every two minutes when they are in a supermarket. Over £150 million is spent each year on advertising aimed directly at children, mostly on television. This amount is expected to grow, and supermarkets are where this advertising is most effective. Children often do not understand why their parents say they cannot buy certain things, and arguments about the dangers of sugar are not convincing when compared to the appealing advertisements.

Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, ""Most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, but these ideas are not always correct. It’s important for parents and children to talk about food, because if children only learn from TV ads, they get a very one-sided view. Parents feel frustrated because they are competing with the advertising industry and often have to disappoint their children.""

The Independent Television Commission, which oversees TV advertising, does not allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy products. However, Dibb notes, ""The goal of advertising is to persuade people to buy things. So even if they can’t say, 'Tell your mom to buy this,' that is still the effect.""

Shopping with children can be stressful for parents because they have to decide which requests to accept and which to deny. One mother says she is patient when discussing food with her children, but she still feels uneasy about how she handles their requests: ""My son notices advertisements but is critical of them. We talk a lot about different products and look at labels together. I’ve talked so much that he now thinks all ads are silly. We don’t have much conflict in the supermarket anymore because the children don’t ask for things I don’t want to buy.""

Parents also admit they can be inconsistent in how they respond to their children’s requests. Mike, a father of a seven-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter, says, ""We refuse to buy him sweets because we say they are bad for him, but we are buying double cream and chocolate for ourselves. It’s nice to buy treats, and it’s normal for children to want to share that. But I still get annoyed by their requests. It often depends on my mood. If I’m feeling good, I’m more likely to say yes. It’s hard to be consistent.""

Supermarkets could help reduce conflicts between parents and children by removing sweets from checkout areas or providing supervised play areas. Although parents might spend less if their children are not with them, the idea of shopping without their children’s demands could attract more customers, making up for any loss in sales."
FCE_65,"**Text: Climbing Walls**

In the past, climbers went to mountains to climb. Now, people can enjoy climbing in many places, both indoors and outdoors. The audience watches closely as French climber Francois Lombard hangs upside down by just two fingers on a climbing wall. He is competing in the World Cup Climbing Championships at Birmingham's National Indoor Arena. This arena is better known for the TV show Gladiators, but both events share one important thing: The Wall. The ability to hold these events is thanks to new technology that is developing quickly.

Before the mid-1960s, climbers practiced on natural cliffs where there were good climbing spots. In winter, they had to deal with cold weather, go for walks, or climb on snow and ice in Scotland. As climbing became more popular, it was important for climbers to stay fit. Since they couldn’t use cliffs for much of the year, they started using brick edges or stone buildings to train. This helped them keep their fingers strong and avoid boredom.

Soon, many sports centers began to build climbing walls specifically for training, using bricks with special edges. One of the first climbing walls was built by Don Robinson, a physical education teacher, in a corridor at Leeds University in the mid-1960s. He created a wall with natural rock set in concrete. Throughout the 1970s, many similar climbing walls were built in sports halls, but they had some problems. These walls were only vertical, while real cliffs have features like overhangs and slanted rocks. Once built, the walls couldn’t be changed, and climbers would eventually get bored with the same routes.

In 1985, a Frenchman named Francois Savigny invented a new material that could be shaped like the holds found on cliffs. These holds could be attached to any wall and removed when climbers wanted a change. French manufacturers also started to create climbing panels on steel frames. Unlike heavy concrete, steel frames could be built anywhere as free-standing structures. This system of interchangeable holds provided climbers with many new options."
FCE_61,"Text: 'Do you want to be an actor? If you tell someone about your desire to become an actor, they will likely mention that it is a risky career. Acting is indeed risky because there are more actors than available roles. When you decide to pursue acting, some friends may think you are making a mistake, while others may support you. Everyone will have different opinions, but ultimately, it is a personal choice, and you are responsible for your own path and dreams. There are no easy shortcuts to success in acting; there are no exams to pass, and completing training does not guarantee a job. Success depends on both luck and talent. However, there is always a need for new actors, and the profession can offer excitement, glamour, and sometimes financial rewards.

Many people ask what talent is. I believe talent is a mix of natural ability and imagination, with imagination being the hardest to measure. It also involves courage and confidence in your work. The desire to act can be hard to explain. In theater, the important moment is the connection between the actor and the audience. This connection is what motivates actors to perform.

When you ask successful actors how they achieved their success, they often do not have a clear answer. They understand their skills and techniques but do not take their success for granted, as they know their career can change quickly. Disappointment is a major challenge for actors. One month you might be unemployed, doing other jobs, and the next month you could be auditioning for a role. However, even if you really want the job, you might not get it. Because of this, actors often avoid discussing their chances of success. They find ways to cope with the stress of competition and the fear of rejection, which is always a possibility from the moment they start auditioning. By putting yourself out there, you are saying you are ready and hopefully talented enough for the role. Ultimately, if you do not care about your career, others may not care about you either.'"

It's true - we are all getting taller. Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy. The teacher jokingly asked, ""What do you want to be? The flagpole on a ship?"" This was funny because Chris was already almost two metres tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is the tallest man in Britain. 

Every decade, the average height of people in Europe increases by about one centimetre. More tall people are being born, but this does not mean we are becoming a super race. Instead, we are returning to how our ancestors were. According to palaeontologist Professor Chris Stringer, we are becoming like Cro-Magnons, the people who lived 40,000 years ago. 

For most of human history, our ancestors had a varied diet. Women gathered fruits and herbs, while men hunted animals. One study found they ate from 85 different wild plants. However, about 9,000 years ago, agriculture began, which changed everything. Farmers took over many green areas, and now just three plants—wheat, rice, and maize—provide more than half of the calories we eat. This limited diet has harmed our health. 

In Ohio, scientists found that when healthy hunter-gatherers started farming corn, they became sickly and underweight. Tooth decay and diseases increased. Although corn was thought to be a blessing, some anthropologists see it as a public health problem. Still, agriculture spread because one piece of land could support many more people than hunting could. 

Today, many people are poorly nourished, but wealthier nations are starting to improve their diets. In Europe, the US, and Japan, diets are becoming more like those of our ancestors. As a result, the average height of men is now 179 cm in the US, 180 cm in Holland, and 177 cm in Japan. This is a positive change, but it comes with challenges. 

Even though people are getting taller, standard bed lengths have not changed since 1860, remaining at 190 cm. Legroom in planes and trains seems to have decreased, and clothing manufacturers must constantly adjust their sizes. The question is: how tall can we get? 

According to Robert Fogel from the University, we might reach a height of 193 cm this century. However, scientists warn that while individuals may be growing taller due to better nutrition, as a species, we are actually getting smaller. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, humans were slightly rounder and taller to keep warm. As the climate has warmed, we have become thinner and shorter, even when well-fed. If global warming continues, we may shrink even more. In other words, our growth could be affected by climate change."

FCE_5,"**Text: A Successful Game**

Two brothers have discovered that their childhood game is great for business. Dave and Norm Lagasse, bearded brothers in their forties, are at their simple home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA, enjoying their childhood memories. In front of them is a wooden board with round plastic pieces. They are playing pichenotte, an ancient game they believe is unique. Their grandfather, Lucien Rajotte, a grocer from Quebec, Canada, brought the game to the USA and taught it to his family. Soon, every weekend and holiday, the family played together, and as Dave says, ""having the best time ever."" 

Eventually, the family moved to New Mexico, but they kept playing with Grandpa's pichenotte board, which he had made from old wooden crates. When visitors came over, they were often intrigued because the game was unknown in the southern USA. Three years ago, Dave noticed how worn the pichenotte board had become and decided to make a new one. It turned out beautifully. A relative wanted one, then a friend asked for another. Curious about the interest, the brothers took one of Dave's new boards to a sports bar in Santa Fe. ""People started to watch,"" says Dave, ""and said, 'No way I'm playing that silly game.' But soon they couldn't get up from the table!""

When people asked about the game's origins, Dave researched it. He found that its roots were likely in India, where a similar game called 'carroms' exists. This game evolved into 'squails,' played in British pubs, and British immigrants brought it to Canada. Pichenotte is the French-Canadian version that developed in Quebec. 

Pichenotte can be played by two to four people and is a game of skill. Each player has 12 pieces or 'pucks' that they flick across a wheel-like board using their finger. Scoring 20 points is achieved by flicking a puck into a small hole, while three rings around the hole are worth 15, 10, and 5 points. There are also eight small posts that act as obstacles. The game usually lasts about two minutes.

Seeing the game's popularity at the Santa Fe bar, the Lagasses made more boards and took them to markets and craft fairs. Crowds gathered, money was exchanged, and the game's popularity increased. Championships began, and a trophy called the 'Lord Pichenotte Cup' was created. As word spread, the boards sold quickly, leading the brothers to start a full-time pichenotte business. They set up a workshop in their garage and have produced over 450 boards. Made of birchwood and mahogany, each board weighs 12kg and is 1cm thick. Norm explains, ""They're very durable, as they have to withstand a lot of use."" They sell for $595 each on the brothers' website.

Currently, there are no professional pichenotte players or TV coverage, but the brothers believe that one day their garage will be home to a luxury car instead of tools and wood. Until then, they enjoy spending their free time playing the game they hope will bring them success."
FCE_41,"**WELCOME TO THE MODEL VILLAGE**

When you first enter the Model Village, it is hard to believe that just a few years ago, this area was an empty, overgrown piece of land. For a long time, it was seen as useless. However, through careful planning and hard work by one man, with the support of his wife, this land has been transformed into the beautiful site you see today. 

During the construction of the village, many tons of soil and clay were moved to change the flat land into a sculpted landscape. While machines like bulldozers helped with this transformation, a lot of manual labor was also involved. Once the land was shaped, about 1,000 tons of topsoil were added to create lawns, flower beds, and rockeries. Hundreds of trees and shrubs were planted, carefully chosen to thrive in the salty air near the sea and to withstand strong winter winds. Most plants came from local garden centers, but some were imported from as far away as Canada and New Zealand.

The entire village was designed by Colin Sims, who spent nine years creating over 100 models after the village opened in 1972. These models are made from various materials—stone, concrete, specially treated wood, and plastics—to endure different weather conditions. Initially, Colin sought help from experts to learn how to choose materials that would last, but he quickly became skilled himself. 

You will notice that a consistent scale has been maintained, and great attention has been given to even the smallest details of the models. This was achieved through patience and the development of unique building techniques. The Model Village has become a popular attraction, known for its high-quality craftsmanship and upkeep. The methods used to create these realistic models have inspired other model villages in England and have even been included in college courses on modeling.

All the buildings in the village represent traditional British architectural styles and are not based on any specific location. One of the most impressive structures is the Manor House, a typical 13th-century stone building with a brick tower and stone walls, reflecting the style of manor houses found in the West Country. As you explore the village, you will also see the Castle, St Mary's Church, a zoo, and a mini-golf course, which is the latest addition.

We kindly ask you to stay on the paths during your visit and not to touch any of the models, as any damage can lead to hours of repair work for us. Photography is allowed only from the pathways. Dogs are welcome on a short lead.

To enhance your experience, you will find buttons in front of some working models. Pressing these will make the models operate. At the end of your visit, we would appreciate any feedback you may have. We are always planning new models, and your ideas can help us create a more diverse and interesting display. We also want to know if there are any models that you think do not meet the high standards of the village. We are constantly updating and replacing models, and we need your input on which ones need attention.

We hope you enjoy your visit and look forward to seeing you again. Please tell your friends about us!"

Every week, British tabloid newspapers publish pictures that invade people's privacy and violate the editors' code of practice. While some pop stars do pose for paparazzi sometimes, this is not common. More often, serious harm is done to public figures when their private moments are shown on the front page. However, very few people report these issues to the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), which was created to handle such problems. Rarely are these pictures in the public interest. For example, do private photos of pop stars help solve crimes? How did a picture of a famous actress on a hotel balcony protect public health and safety? The actress has complained about long-lens photos before, and since she was in a hotel—a place where, according to the code of practice, people expect privacy—she had a valid reason to complain, but she did not take action. It is a scandal that the PCC did not start an investigation. It should also look into the recent shocking story about a pop star's love life. Like the actress, the pop star has not made a formal complaint. Shouldn't the PCC take action on this and other disgraceful incidents? 

At first glance, this seems like a good idea. It could lead to many decisions against newspapers, which would be reported by their competitors and shown on TV and radio. The public would not support such actions, and editors would have to stop publishing this kind of material. Photographers would also be affected, as they would no longer be able to afford to hide behind trees waiting to take pictures of unsuspecting celebrities. If the PCC decided to act as a 'police officer', which it technically could, there would be several challenges. How would it decide whether to start an investigation? Should it contact the victim and encourage them to complain? And if the person still refused to act, should the PCC proceed anyway? Additionally, celebrities and royals might expect that any story about them would be investigated, and they could be upset if it wasn’t. 

Moreover, the task is too large. How could the PCC realistically monitor all of the British press: national, regional, and magazines? There is also the issue of embarrassment to consider. No matter how much someone's privacy has been violated, would they really want the added embarrassment of an investigation? Most likely, they just want to move on with their lives. Of course, some may have other reasons for staying quiet. A more damaging story might exist that they have kept from the press, and they know that complaining could make it public. In other words, even the PCC might become a problem. 

One British comedian faced issues with the press when he and his wife were secretly photographed on their honeymoon in the Caribbean. He did not complain then, nor did he when he and his family were photographed again during a holiday. His reason was fear that the newspaper, News of the World, would publish the pictures again with a new story about his 'anger', claiming they thought it was just a joke and that, as a comedian, he would have a sense of humor about it. This fear is understandable. People believe they will become targets again if they challenge the tabloids. It is difficult to find an easy solution to this serious problem."

Many college graduates receive advice about starting their first job. This article focuses on moving to a second job. We are not discussing those who are looking for a temporary job while searching for a permanent one, or those who leave a job they dislike within a few weeks. Instead, we will talk about those of you who are ready to take a significant step in your career. You have gained some experience and skills and have a clearer idea of your career goals. 

What kind of job should you seek? It largely depends on your long-term goals. You should consider whether you want to specialize in a certain area, aim for higher responsibilities, or explore a broader field. Whatever you choose, it is important to select your second job carefully. You should plan to stay in this job for two to three years, as it will be closely examined by future employers when you apply for your next position. This job should demonstrate that you have thought seriously about your career. Most importantly, it should help you grow, develop your skills, and increase your responsibilities. 

If you feel the urge to travel, now might be a good time to do so. You can take temporary work when you return and then find your second job. Future employers will appreciate that you have satisfied your desire to travel and are less likely to leave again soon.

Confident people often seem like they were born that way, but many will say it is a skill they learned. Nina Hathway talks to five people about how they became confident.

**A. Jenny**  
When I finished school, I was very shy and thought I would always be that way. At twenty-five, I helped at my daughter's school. I was nervous but did well, and someone suggested I take a university course. On my first day, I was very anxious, but my confidence grew over time. Working at the school changed my life and helped me in many ways.

**B. Michaela**  
Four years ago, my father got sick, and I had to run the family business. I was scared and became too aggressive. I thought that was how confident people acted, but I learned that true confidence comes from believing in yourself. If work gets too hard, I don’t feel guilty about leaving some tasks for the next day. When I face challenges, I remind myself that I have nothing to lose. Fear can make you feel unconfident, so I often talk to myself to calm those fears.

**C. Lisa**  
People see me as confident, but I often feel scared inside. I learned to appear confident because it is important in my job in TV. Interviewing people showed me that many of us feel nervous in important situations, but we feel better when talking to friendly people. My mother once told me that everyone is too busy worrying about their own appearance to notice me. I remember this advice often. I also believe that facing your fears helps build confidence. I was very nervous during my driving test, but I passed, and that made me feel braver.

**D. Barbara**  
I feel confident because I enjoy my work, and I have built this confidence over time. If you keep working and learn from mistakes, you will feel more confident next time. I work hard and am liked at my restaurant, but not everyone will like you, and that’s okay. You need to accept yourself and not try to be what others want. My company offers training courses, which have helped my self-esteem. Setting small goals helps too, as it shows you are achieving something instead of trying to do everything at once and feeling overwhelmed.

**E. Kim**  
After college, I worked as a secretary and often sat in meetings without speaking up, even when I disagreed. Eventually, I found the courage to share my thoughts. When I started working in politics, I had never spoken in public and was very nervous. I told myself that many people do this every day, so I could too. Writing down my points helped me feel more secure, like a comfort blanket. I believe everyone feels a bit nervous when speaking in public. The key to confidence is to keep telling yourself, 'Nothing is impossible.'"
FCE_47,"**Text: Visit to Malaysia**

Paul Forster attends a kite-flying festival and spends a nervous night in the forest. Adnan Ali smiled widely when I gave him his torn kite. ""You should keep it,"" he said, ""it's a tradition - if the line breaks, the finders keep it... and I have many more."" He pointed to a stack of beautifully decorated kites at his feet. All were exactly 120 cm wide and long, made of tissue paper and split bamboo. We sat in the shade of the whispering conifer trees behind the Beach of the Seven Lagoons in Kelantan, looking out at Malaysia's largest kite festival. 

In the center of the beach, ten platforms held up the kites, while tense competitors waited with their kite lines for the countdown. When the whistle blew, the crowd cheered, and the kites shot into the sky like rockets. Over 500 men and boys had signed up for the competition, which lasts five days each year. Each participant entered four different designs, judged on decoration, stability, and flying ability. ""Flying kites isn't hard,"" Adnan said, ""but making them requires real skill. Come visit me at home, and I'll show you how."" This was one of five invitations I received that day, and I decided to accept.

At his house, I enjoyed cold milky tea and fish crackers in a large, polished room. As night fell, he invited me to return the next day to help rebuild his kite, but I couldn't. Instead, I explored the southern part of the state, driving towards Kuala Lumpur, through granite mountains covered in lush rainforest. I took a wrong turn, and the smooth road ended at a river. A small boat was waiting to take people across. Nearby, a sign caught my attention. It pointed up a path into the forest and read: ""Jelawang Jungle 3 km."" Before starting, it would have been helpful to know that most of this distance was steep and slippery. 

When I reached the track, I found a man named Baba waiting with a flask of tea. He managed a tented kitchen and several bamboo huts. I decided to stay there, trying not to think about the insects crawling under my thin foam mattress. The night was completely dark, filled with various sounds. A nearby waterfall roared, and many creatures moved and squeaked. In the morning, I enjoyed a stunning view of five ranges of green mountains. In the afternoon, it rained. First, the wind blew, then lightning struck the treetops. Moments later, I was soaked. Sliding downhill, I wondered how the giant butterflies avoided the heavy rain. I also worried about my car being washed away (it sometimes happens) and the risk of drowning if I opened my mouth. Luckily, my car was still there, muddy, at the bottom of the track.

In Kota Bahru, the capital of Kelantan, everyone asked me questions: ""Where are you from?"" ""How old are you?"" But their curiosity was friendly. While Kelantan is famous for its kites, I remember it more for the kindness of its people."

A. Melanie, 22, dancer: I’m a shopping addict! I can’t spend enough money. When I have cash, I go shopping and it makes me happy. I find it hard to walk past sale signs. My boyfriend is the same, so we often go shopping together. We’re an addicted couple!

B. Brenda, 40, office manager: I’m a reluctant shopper. My husband does most of the food shopping because he cooks and knows what he likes. I don’t spend much time shopping for clothes. I take my 6-year-old son and 14-year-old daughter shopping, but I don’t enjoy it because we all have different tastes. I don’t often spend money on myself, so when I do, I feel guilty and usually tell my husband I spent less than I really did. The real price always seems shocking.

C. Juliet, 28, personnel manager: I only shop for essentials. I dislike shopping and only go when I have to. When I do, I know exactly what I want and won’t settle for anything else. I find shopping tiring and would rather be doing something else.

D. Anita, 35, TV producer: I like to look around sometimes, but I usually know what I want and where to find it. I don’t waste time and try to get in and out quickly. However, I do have some items in my wardrobe that I regret buying, so maybe I’m a careful shopper who sometimes makes mistakes!

E. Lizzie, 41, secretary: I really don’t enjoy shopping. I dislike shopping for clothes because I can never find what I want or anyone to help me. The shops are too noisy and messy, and I find it a nightmare. Luckily, I don’t have to shop for clothes often since most of my clothes are given to me. For food shopping, I go to the local supermarket once a week and do it quickly.

F. Lisa, 22, actress: I’m probably a happy shopper. Sometimes I go out with my girlfriends just to look around, and we often end up buying things. I don’t usually have a specific item in mind, but if something catches my eye, I’ll buy it.

G. Suki, 26, art gallery assistant: I’m a careful shopper. I enjoy shopping, but I don’t buy much. I usually know what I want and don’t go overboard. Sometimes I shop to feel better, but then I often feel worse because I’ve spent too much!

H. Ann-Marie, 29, nursery worker: I love shopping, but only on certain days and never on Saturdays because it’s too busy. I consider myself a careful shopper. I always have a good idea of what I want and don’t rush into buying things. I check other shops to find better deals, which takes me a long time!

I. Linda, 32, restaurant manager: I’m an unwilling shopper. Maybe because I work in the city center, shopping has lost its appeal for me. When I have to shop, I go reluctantly and don’t bother trying things on because it’s too much trouble. The clothes I buy don’t always fit, but I don’t mind too much. I’d rather make a few mistakes than put in a lot of effort!'"

The Gallery now features a beautiful still life by the Dutch painter Jan van Os from the 18th century. This large painting (89.1 cm x 71 cm) depicts flowers and fruit in bright colors on wood. It is one of the first paintings of this kind in the Gallery. The artwork is signed and dated 1777 and 1778. It is common for such paintings to have two dates, as the artist waited for specific flowers to bloom in different seasons. This painting was generously donated to the Gallery by Miss Violet Churchman in memory of her sister, Ida Nancy. It is currently displayed in Room 25.

**Special Exhibition**

The exhibition titled ""Painting in Spain during the Late 18th Century"" opened in the Sunley Room on March 15. The Gallery has recently acquired works by three Spanish painters from this period: Paret, Melendez, and Francisco Bayeu, who are the main focus of the exhibition. They are joined by Francisco's brother Ramon, Antonio Gonzalez, and two Italian artists who worked in Spain during this time: Corrado Giaquinto and Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. The exhibition will be open until May 31.

A group of children aged ten to fifteen spends their Saturdays learning how to cook. Their weekly lessons are very popular, and there is a waiting list of 30 children who want to join. Parents pay £280 for the course, where children can have fun and learn to make delicious food. 

Bill, who is ten years old, says, ""I love my mum's cooking, and now I can do it better than her. The teachers make us laugh, especially when we sit down to eat the food we've made."" 

Flora, who is twelve, has some trouble with onions. She says, ""I love cooking. I made a meal for ten friends, and they really enjoyed it. My mum suggested I find a hobby instead of doing nothing on weekends. I liked staying at home, so I wasn't very excited at first. But I'm really glad I decided to come."" 

Their teacher, Philippe, says, ""It's a lot of fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, even if the kitchen isn't always tidy when they cook! As adults, we keep learning more about food. If parents get their children interested in cooking when they are young, they will have the skills to cook for themselves when they leave home."""

3. Individual stamps to arrange in your own special book.

The Stamp Collectors' Club has about 70,000 members, and you can join for just £5 for two years. If a group joins together, you can get a discount. This is a great value! When you join, you will receive a Starter Pack at no extra cost. This pack includes 100 stamps to start your collection and a nice box to keep them in. You will also get a helpful 4-page guide with tips on how to grow your collection and useful addresses for shops that sell stamps.

Every two months, you will receive the club magazine, which has competitions and quizzes, and allows you to exchange stamps with members worldwide. Why not start an adventure that will bring you years of enjoyment? You will spend many happy hours looking at the variety of stamps in your collection or searching for unique ones that are waiting to be found.

PET_21,"**MONEY**

What is money? The pound, the dollar, and the franc are similar to a gram or a kilometre. The key difference is that you can trade money for goods or services. For example, a five-pound note can buy a book, a large bag of sweets, or a few cinema tickets. However, the note itself is just a piece of paper that costs very little to produce.

Thousands of years ago, people did not have money as we understand it today. There were no banks or shops. Back then, Mr. Green, a farmer, traded the corn he grew for Mr. Hive's honey. This was a direct exchange between two people, each having something the other wanted. Over time, most societies created their own forms of currency to facilitate trade. Eventually, different currencies began to connect, which is why today everyone uses a national currency."
PET_46,"**Text: Write a Winning Story!**

You have a chance to win £1,000 in this year's Fiction Prize and have your story published in Keep Writing magazine. Ten other winners will receive £100 each. We are looking for people who can write good stories. The judges include novelist Mary Littlejohn, television reporter Michael Brown, and Susan Hitchins, the editor of Keep Writing. They want interesting and original stories. Last year, detective fiction was very popular, but the winner wrote a love story.

You can write about anything, but here are some tips to help you:

1. **Write About What You Know**: This is important advice for every writer. Last year, many stories were about love, family, and friendship problems. Try to make ordinary situations interesting so that readers want to keep reading.

2. **Get Your Facts Right**: Make sure your descriptions and information are accurate. Don’t write about something unless you are sure about it.

3. **Hold the Reader's Attention**: Start your story in an interesting way and end it with a surprise. A weak ending can ruin a good story. Develop your plot carefully and think of something unusual for the ending.

4. **Think About the Characters**: Make your characters feel real by using descriptive language. 

Your story must be your own work, between 2,000 and 2,500 words, typed, double-spaced, and printed on one side of each page. We cannot accept stories sent by fax or email, even if you are close to the deadline. You must include the application form with your story. Unfortunately, we cannot return your story or discuss our decisions. 

You should not have had any fiction published in any magazine or book in this country, as per a new rule. Your story must not have been published in any form, including on radio or TV, anywhere in the world. 

You need to pay a fee of £5 to the Writers' Association. Make your cheque payable to Keep Writing and send it with your application form and story to us. The closing date is 30 July, and we will inform the winner within one month. If you win, you must agree to have your story published in our magazine."
PET_3,"**THE FIRST WOMAN SCIENTIST**

Hypatia was born in Alexandria, Egypt, in 370 A.D. For many centuries, she was the only woman scientist recognized in history. Her father was the director of Alexandria University, and he ensured that she received the best education possible. This was rare, as most women at that time had limited opportunities to study. After studying in Athens and Rome, Hypatia returned to Alexandria and began teaching mathematics. She quickly became well-known for her understanding of new ideas. Although we do not have copies of her books, we know she wrote several important mathematical works. Hypatia was also interested in technology and invented various scientific tools to assist her work. During her time, many rulers feared science, and those involved in it were often in danger. In March 415, Hypatia was attacked in the street and killed."

PET_27,"**Text: Grass**

Grass is one of the most successful plants in the world. There are over 9,000 types of grasses, and they can be found in every part of the earth. Grass is unique because it can grow in very cold places like the Arctic and Antarctic. Grasslands are home to many animals, from small insects and birds to large animals like cows and lions. All these animals rely on grass in some way.

One interesting fact about grass is that it grows back quickly after being cut or damaged. Unlike many other plants, new grass leaves grow from below the ground, not from the top. This ability allows many animals to live together in one area. When they eat all the grass in one spot, new grass starts to grow again, providing a fresh meal for them."

Since childhood, she has enjoyed drawing clothes and creating designs. However, she never told her parents, who run a supermarket, about her dream to make fashion her career. She believed they wanted her to pursue a more traditional job, so she studied management at university. After graduating, she moved to London and worked at an advertising agency. Although she attended many industry events, she couldn't afford the designer clothes she admired. To solve this, she began making skirts and tops for herself. When her friends noticed her creations, they asked her to make clothes for them too. She then found a small shop in London that agreed to sell her designs on a sale-or-return basis. Her clothes were very popular, and nothing was returned. This success motivated her to leave her advertising job, take out a £20,000 loan, and start her own womenswear brand. Her parents were supportive of her decision, which made her very happy. Now, her clothes are sold in over 70 stores, and her business earns more than £500,000. Her designs are featured in fashion magazines, she creates outfits for pop stars, and she recently gained recognition by winning this award. Kal feels grateful for her journey, saying, 'What I do is my hobby - and I get paid for it! But remember, I've worked hard for this.'"

Mark Ottaway took a train journey on The Ghan from Darwin in northern Australia to Adelaide in the south. The Ghan travels across Australia, from the warm northern coast through vast deserts to the cooler Southern Ocean. It is often called the ""famous Ghan,"" but it is mostly known for being late.

The idea of a train link between Darwin and Adelaide started in the 1920s with a line that reached Alice Springs, but flooding often made it hard for trains to run. A new line was finished just before my trip. The railway was built for speeds up to 115 kph, but The Ghan is not a fast train. It has few stops, and most passengers are on holiday. Unlike luxury trains like the Orient Express, The Ghan does not focus on luxury, but the food on board is very good. The railway was originally made to transport goods, not passengers. It was believed that sending goods from Europe to southern Australia through Darwin and the train would save time and money compared to shipping around the continent.

It is rare to complete a transcontinental railway, and The Ghan claims to be the first north-south railway in the world. While waiting to board, I noticed that everyone was excited about the journey. Many of my fellow travelers were Australian pensioners who were eager to get on the train. Our first stop was Katherine, where we waited for four hours. Some passengers got off to take a boat trip in the gorge. I stayed on the train until Alice Springs, where I joined a two-day trip to Uluru (Ayers Rock) with a small group and a guide. Climbing the rock is not encouraged now, and few people do it. Our group walked around the rock and enjoyed the beautiful sunset.

From Alice Springs, there are two trains a week going south, so many passengers stop their journey there. The view from the train after Alice Springs is not very interesting; it is mostly flat land with cattle. However, on the third day at dawn, we reached the foothills near the Southern Ocean. My journey ended, and although the train did not meet all the promises made in advertisements, it took me to some of the most amazing sights in Australia."
PET_31,"**Text: Climbing to the Top of Britain**

Every year, thousands of people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland. Because it is located in the north, the weather can be very cold. Climber Keith Hewitt shares his experience of climbing Ben Nevis for the first time.

It was February, and it was my first big winter climb. We chose a route up the north face of the mountain to Tower Ridge. This climb is about six hundred metres high, making it one of the longest in Britain. We planned to camp for three days in the 'Carries', which are large bowl-shaped areas cut into the mountain halfway up. We carried tents, sleeping bags, and metal spikes for our boots. These spikes are necessary because the snow can be so hard that it feels like walking on ice. Even though some members of our group were very experienced, we packed a lot of safety equipment, including lights to signal for help, hard hats, and extra clothing. 

Although the weather forecast was good, with no strong winds, there was still a sense of nervousness when we started our climb. Climbing Ben Nevis in winter is always difficult. The path quickly became steep, and my legs felt heavy. As the weakest member of the group, I needed to take more breaks. The others sometimes paused to let me catch up, but as soon as I arrived, they would start again. I promised myself that I would train better before my next climb.

After climbing 200 metres, we reached the start of Tower Ridge, the path that would take us to the top of Ben Nevis. It is only a metre and a half wide, and the mountain drops hundreds of metres on both sides. We knew we had to stay calm and focus on each step as we moved slowly along it. After seven hours of climbing, we finally reached the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and the island of Skye, which is 48 kilometres away. Unfortunately, we were not so lucky, as a mist had come down.

Getting back down to camp can be just as challenging as going up. You need to be able to read a map well; a wrong turn could lead to dangerous slopes in winter. I was glad we decided to take turns reading the map. That first time, I could only say I truly enjoyed the experience once I was safe in the tent. But at least I made it to the top."
PET_58,"**Text: Anna's New School**

This week has been very exciting because we have moved into our new school building! It is a wonderful place. The builders used wood for the entire structure, just like in our old school, but this one is also designed to be environmentally friendly. The school took many months to build, and we watched the process. It was thrilling to see the builders clear the land, even though it meant some beautiful open space was lost. The noise from the construction was quite loud, and sometimes the builders had to stop because of heavy rain. We started to worry that the building would never be finished.

Now, we have five large classrooms, much bigger than those in our old school, which was very old. We share one room with people from the town for meetings. There is also a nursery, a lovely dining room, and big changing rooms that we are excited to use once our new sports field is ready.

When you enter the school, you will notice that there are no heaters! Instead, the warmth comes from everyone inside—the children, teachers, and computers. The building is designed to keep the heat and sound inside, so when we sing in our classrooms, it feels like we are in a concert hall!

Another interesting feature is that the school roof has a tree on it! The builders placed it there after finishing the roof because it is a tradition in Austria, where the roof was made. The electricity for lights and computers comes from a wind turbine on a hill behind the school. We visited it with our teacher yesterday, and it spins very fast. It is so large that it can be seen from far away! We took some pictures to share on our website.

Even though we are already using the school, some parts are still being completed. For example, we are currently preparing a play for our parents, but we have to go back to our old school hall to perform it. The new hall will be ready by next year. We are very happy with our new school, and our teachers say we will learn much faster now that we are here!"

On Saturday afternoon, I accidentally left my handbag on the bus. Inside were my cheque book, address book, and purse, which had about £50 in cash and some credit cards. When I realized my mistake, it was too late. I felt lost: I am 72 years old, far from home, and quite worried. I stood by the road and cried. A young man saw me and asked what was wrong. I told him what happened, and he gave me some money for my bus fare home. When I explained the situation to the bus driver, he told me I could keep the fare. I got home safely, and soon after, the phone rang. It was the manager of CityBus, the company that owned the bus. He said they had found my handbag and offered to bring it back to me. I was amazed to get my handbag back with everything inside untouched. I want to thank everyone who helped me that day for their kindness and honesty.

PET_60,"**Text: Sharks**

Sharks are among the most intimidating animals in our oceans. They are well adapted for hunting underwater because they have excellent vision and can sense movement through special lines on their bodies. This makes sharks very dangerous to smaller sea animals that they eat. 

While sharks share some similarities with other fish, their bodies are quite different. For instance, most sharks must keep swimming constantly to breathe and survive, which means they hardly ever sleep. Additionally, if sharks are flipped onto their backs, they can become completely still. This is a useful method for researchers who need to study sharks, as it helps them learn more about these intriguing animals."

My name is Nathalie. Last year, I became one of the youngest foreign students to join the Kirov ballet school in St Petersburg, Russia. On my first day, I felt nervous because I didn’t know anyone. Everyone came over to ask me questions in Russian. I tried to respond in Russian, and they switched to English, so we could communicate. Now, six months later, everyone is very friendly, my Russian has improved a lot, and I understand my teachers well.

For the first two weeks after I arrived, my mother stayed with me, and when she left, I felt a bit sad. I even called home late one night to talk to her because I was feeling lonely. The classes in Russia are much harder than those in my ballet school in England, and I eat a lot to keep my energy up. This gives me confidence to meet the school’s high standards.

In the evenings, I like to watch my favorite movies on my computer, but sometimes I fall asleep before they finish. Now that I have settled in, I feel at home here. I enjoy walking around the city and visiting different shops, even in December when it was very cold. I bought a fur hat because it was minus 10°C, but the locals said it was mild for that time of year! At least my room is warm and cozy.

PET_55,"**THE ICEHOTEL**

For many years, the Arctic was a popular summer destination to experience the land of the midnight sun. However, in winter, the few people living there enjoyed the snow and ice alone. By the late 1980s, it was decided that the dark and cold winter could be seen as a positive thing. In the winter of 1990, French artist Jannot Derit was invited to open an exhibition in a specially built igloo (a structure made of snow) in the small town of Jukkasjarvi, located on the frozen Torne River. This building, called Arctic Hall, attracted many visitors to the area. One night, a group of foreign guests thought it would be fun to sleep in Arctic Hall. The next morning, they were very happy with their experience, and the idea of an ice hotel was created. Today, it is famous worldwide.

As winter begins, a team of snow builders, architects, and artists from around the world come to Jukkasjarvi to construct the hotel for that year. As each section is finished, it opens to visitors and overnight guests, while other parts are still being built. The first section is completed in December, and each week after that, a new section opens until January 7th, when the hotel is fully completed. Since the ICEHOTEL is built outdoors using natural winter materials, the completion date depends on the weather, so plans can sometimes change.

In spring, as the weather warms up, the hotel melts. Inside the hotel, the temperature is never colder than -5 to -8 degrees Celsius, no matter how cold it is outside. Guests receive winter clothing, such as warm overalls, hats, and gloves, as part of their stay. It is also a good idea for guests to bring sweaters, scarves, and plenty of woollen socks, and to choose shoes that are larger than usual to fit thick socks. If you plan to visit the hotel, you can buy warm sweaters, woollen socks, and more on the ICEHOTEL website. You can order these items and any necessary equipment when you book your visit, and they will be delivered to your room when you check in.

The hotel is located in the village of Jukkasjarvi, 200 km above the Arctic Circle, but only 15 km from Kiruna airport and 17 km from Kiruna train station. Bus transport can be arranged from the airport or train station to the ICEHOTEL."

A report by Dave Worthington

Homestyle, a new furniture store, had to close shortly after it opened at midnight last Thursday. Up to 6,000 people rushed to the store. There were many special offers, like a leather sofa for £45 (only until 3 am) and a bed for £30 (only between 3 am and 8 am). The store's regular hours will be from 9 am to 9 pm every day, but Homestyle had planned to stay open for the first 24 hours. However, it had to close within half an hour of opening.

A police officer at the scene said: ""We knew a large crowd was expected, but people were not patient. The store quickly became full, and the managers wisely decided to close the doors. The people outside got angry because they thought everything would be sold before they could get in, and they refused to wait quietly until there was space. Another issue was that there was a long line of cars trying to reach the parking lot. I couldn't believe that many people left their cars in the middle of the road and walked the last few meters to the store, which blocked the road completely.""

One customer, Jenny Smith, who got into the store, said: ""I waited in line for three hours, but I didn't have time to buy what I wanted. The staff were very calm and explained what was happening. They had no choice, as it wasn't safe. I will come back when they reopen, but I don't want to wait in line again."""

PET_34,"**Text: Free-diving in the Caribbean**

Tanya Streeter holds four world records in free-diving, a sport where competitors dive to great depths on just one breath of air. In 2003, she made history by becoming the first person to dive 120 meters into the ocean while holding her breath and return to the surface without assistance. Although she had previously dived deeper, she used a balloon to help her come back up then. This time, she held her breath for over three and a half minutes, making her the only woman in any sport to break a man's world record.

A team of fourteen safety divers monitored her dive at various depths. After several serious accidents involving other divers, some people argue that free-diving is too dangerous, but Tanya disagrees. She believes that safety is the most important factor, followed closely by training. Most free-divers focus on one or two types of events, but Tanya maintains a consistent training schedule. Two-thirds of her training is done in the gym, while the rest is split between the pool and the ocean. She uses an exercise bike to improve her heart fitness but avoids running to protect her knees. Instead, she finds that fast walking is an effective way to build her fitness.

When preparing for practice dives, Tanya usually travels away from home. She aims to complete fourteen dives over four weeks, taking a rest day between each dive to avoid fatigue, which could jeopardize her preparation. When not training for an event, she often makes public appearances to promote sports products and supports environmental organizations through research projects and films.

Growing up on the Caribbean island of Grand Cayman, Tanya spent her childhood swimming and exploring rock pools to observe sea life. She feels that her life now reflects her childhood dreams. Being well-known in some countries, she believes people listen to her when she discusses environmental issues. Looking to the future, Tanya, now in her thirties, plans to continue breaking her own world records. Since she started free-diving at twenty-five, she emphasizes that she does not intend to retire from the sport for many years."
PET_12,"**CARTOON FILMS**

Cartoon films have very few restrictions. If you can draw something, you can animate it for the cinema. The introduction of innovative ideas and advanced computer technology has made cartoons exciting for audiences of all ages. By the late 1970s, the film industry believed that cartoons were only for children. However, shortly after, a few directors introduced original concepts. They demonstrated that it was possible to create films that both adults and children could enjoy together. Nevertheless, not every cartoon film succeeded. For instance, *The Black Cauldron* did not do well, primarily because it was too scary for children and too simplistic for adults. Directors learned from this experience, and film companies began to earn significant profits again."

I had only acted in school plays, but I loved the book since I was eleven. My grandmother used to say I was just like Polly Finnegan, and I always dreamed of playing her. I took a year off to travel before starting university. While I was in Chile, my mother emailed me about plans to adapt the book into a TV drama. I knew I had to audition for the role. She was surprised at first but sent my photo to the director and convinced him to meet me. I flew back and got the role. Filming started a week into the term, so I got permission from the university to be away for three weeks. Once I returned, I woke up at 6:00 am to catch up on the essays I had missed. I didn’t tell my university friends, but they found out and thought it was exciting. It was an incredible experience, and I feel very lucky. After university, I definitely want to pursue acting as a career. I’m not from an acting family, although my grandfather was an opera singer. I have auditioned for other TV roles but haven’t received any offers yet. I’m not sure how I managed everything because I also had a busy social life. When filming ended, I felt a bit lost. Since then, I have acted in two college plays. Unfortunately, I haven’t been home much, and now that my first year at university is over, I’m going to Greece for the summer with friends."""

**Day 8:** You will arrive in Oporto with plenty of time for sightseeing and last-minute shopping before your flight back to London Heathrow."
PET_30,"**HONEY**

Honey is a sweet liquid created by bees. It is made up of water and sugars. To make just half a kilo of honey, bees can travel up to seventy-five thousand kilometers and visit over two million flowers. The color and taste of honey vary depending on the type of flower the bees visit. There are more than three hundred different types of honey. Generally, lighter-colored honey has a milder flavor compared to darker honey. 

In ancient times, honey was the primary sweetener because sugar was very rare. The ancient Egyptians valued honey highly and even used it as a form of payment. Today, honey is produced and consumed all over the world. Research indicates that honey can help reduce tiredness and enhance athletic performance. Additionally, honey is not only a food; it can also be used to soothe sore throats and is included in many skin and hair-care products."
PET_7,"**Text: Norwich**

Norwich is the capital of East Anglia, a region in Britain, and has been inhabited for over two thousand years. It started as a small village by the River Wensum. By the time of the Norman invasion in 1066, it had become one of England's largest towns. Norwich has two cathedrals and a mosque, making it a significant center for different religions. The first cathedral was built in 1095 and recently celebrated its 900th anniversary. In 1994, Norwich celebrated the 800th anniversary of receiving a Royal Charter, which allowed it to be called a city and to govern itself.

Today, Norwich is smaller than cities like London or Manchester, with a population of about 150,000. However, in the 16th century, it was the second city of England. For the next 300 years, it continued to grow and prosper, becoming known for having as many churches as there are weeks in a year and as many pubs as there are days in a year. Nowadays, there are fewer churches and pubs, but in 1964, the University of East Anglia was established in Norwich. With a growing student population and its role as a modern commercial center (it is the largest center for insurance services outside London), Norwich now offers a variety of entertainment options, including theatres, cinemas, nightclubs, busy cafes, excellent restaurants, and several arts and leisure centers. The city also has a football team known as 'The Canaries', whose colors are green and yellow, though the reason for the name is unclear.

One of the city's recent developments is a modern shopping center called 'The Castle Mall'. For over two years, the people of Norwich dealt with a large hole in the city as builders worked on the main car park. They moved nearly a million tons of earth to create a city center park on the roof of the Mall, complete with beautiful water features and many trees. The local community is happy that the old open market remains in the city center, next to the new development. Both areas continue to thrive, showing that Norwich has successfully combined the best of the old and the new."
PET_43,"**The Albuquerque Balloon Festival**

Every autumn, the sky above Albuquerque, a city in the southwestern United States, fills with bright colors. This is the Albuquerque Balloon Festival, a nine-day event held every year. The first festival took place in 1972 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of a local radio station. It started with about twelve hot-air balloons taking off from a parking lot in the city. Since then, the festival has grown significantly. This year, at least a thousand balloons from over a third of the countries in the world are expected to participate at its current location outside the city.

**What to See**

The pilots communicate with each other via radio and light up their balloon burners at the same time. This event is called a ""balloon glow,"" which is a great opportunity for taking beautiful photographs. To see these ""glows,"" you should arrive just after nightfall or before 5:30 AM, as the balloons rise into the dark sky. During the day, you can walk among the balloons and talk to the pilots as they prepare for take-off. The balloons come in various sizes and colors, some shaped like animals or cartoon characters, and even popular products like soft drinks and fast food. Children will enjoy it.

In the afternoon, you can experience a balloon flight over the desert by booking a ride with one of the many companies that offer this service. Another option is to take the cable car from the desert floor to the top of the nearby mountains, which is the longest ride of its kind, and enjoy a stunning view of the festival.

There are many other attractions for visitors of all ages, including balloon races and fireworks on the opening night and the last three nights of the festival.

**The Albuquerque Box**

This is a local wind pattern that creates ideal conditions for balloonists. The Sandia Mountains shield the balloons from strong winds and create gentler wind currents at different heights. This allows skilled pilots to control the direction of their balloons by rising or descending.

**Practical Advice**

Buy your tickets in advance online to avoid long waits at the festival site. Wear several layers of thin clothing, as it can be cool at night and in the early morning, but during the day, sunglasses and sunscreen are necessary. Bring a flashlight for nighttime events and, of course, your camera. If you use film instead of digital photography, make sure to bring high-speed film for evening and nighttime photos."

Since it opened, the Eden Project in the south-west of England has become one of the UK's most popular tourist spots. At first glance, the large 'biospheres' on this old industrial site look like something from a science-fiction film. Each biosphere represents a different climate zone, demonstrating the important connection between people and plants. It is surprising to see how many everyday products come from plants, such as wood, rubber, fruit, rice, sugar, coffee, and chocolate. Over 135,000 different types of plants are grown here. No matter how cold it is outside, computer-controlled heaters maintain the right temperature for the plants. In the Rainforest Zone, the air is always humid due to a large waterfall. Another zone mimics the environment of the Mediterranean, California, and South Africa, and there are plans to create a desert zone soon."

Some people have expressed dissatisfaction with this year's collection, New Writing 3, but I find it hard to understand why. After all, 500 pages of high-quality original writing for £6.99 is quite impressive, isn't it? The majority of the book consists of fiction, including both parts of novels and complete short stories. There are enjoyable contributions from well-known authors like Candia McWilliam and Rose Tremain. Interestingly, many lesser-known writers seem to focus on food in their writing. I recommend you avoid reading Jane Harris's ""Those Nails"" right after a meal, as it contains some very disturbing scenes that might upset you! 

The collection also features excellent work from nineteen poets, including R. S. Thomas and John Burnside. Additionally, there are excerpts from novels that are still being written by Jim Crace and Jane Rogers. Lastly, there is a small amount of non-fiction, which includes a humorous article by Alan Rusbridger about certain newspapers, and a remarkable piece by Ursula Owen about her own life. Overall, this is an outstanding collection, and I am eager to see what next year's edition will bring."

""The best age to start learning the violin is between three and six,"" says Margaret Porter, a violinist and music teacher. ""This is when children are discovering the world."" Margaret, who lives in London, usually teaches children who are three or four years old, but she has made exceptions for enthusiastic five-year-olds. When she began teaching in 1972, her first class was made up of her children's five-year-old friends.

Margaret's students have group lessons with about twelve pupils in each group, and each lesson lasts one hour, held every two weeks. Additionally, each student has one individual lesson with her each week. Parents are also required to attend the classes, as it is important for them to be involved in their child's learning.

From the beginning, students learn to play by ear and do not start reading music until they have been playing for several years. For a long time, there is a noticeable difference between their playing and their ability to read music. Margaret explains that her teaching method is not designed to create expert violinists. She often advises students who excel to leave and pursue more traditional methods of learning the violin."
PET_56,"**Moonshine**

The band Moonshine released their third CD last week. ""Here Again"" is a follow-up to ""The Waves."" There have been some changes since the last CD: Tom Wilcott is now playing bass guitar, replacing Simon McVee, who left the band last year. Tom Simpson has joined as the new drummer. 

From the first song, which is a dance tune, it is clear that the band is shifting away from slow songs. The second song is also a dance track and is even louder and heavier. Most of the later songs are in the band's usual slow style. These two dance tracks may surprise many fans, but either could easily become a hit single because they are excellent. 

Singer Rob Letchford showcases his talent by hitting every note perfectly. Fans should be thankful he recorded these songs before experiencing throat issues, which led the band to cancel their upcoming tour. (Anyone who has bought tickets need not worry, as all concerts will be rescheduled once Rob has recovered.)

On this CD, Moonshine demonstrates their ability to create great music in various styles, from the familiar slow songs to upbeat tracks that make you want to dance. However, I felt that they placed their best songs at the beginning, and the last few tracks were not quite as strong. Despite this, ""Here Again"" is sure to be a big hit and will bring more success to the band."

San Francisco is located on the northern California coast. The first Europeans to find this area were led by a Spanish explorer named Gaspar de Portola, who saw it for the first time in 1769. Interestingly, San Francisco Bay, which is a beautiful natural harbor, was discovered by land instead of by sea. 

In 1849, many people came to San Francisco hoping to find gold. However, it was not the gold seekers who became wealthy. The richest individuals were those who owned banks and law firms, and they built large houses on a hill known as Nob Hill. 

Today, tourists visit San Francisco to see famous sites like Chinatown and the Golden Gate Bridge. Many also take a short boat trip to Alcatraz Island to visit the old prison."

He also shares personal stories, including his own flaws—like often falling asleep in church or admiring pretty girls. He talks about his home life, including arguments with his wife and how they reconciled, as well as his concerns about her health. In addition to reading, he enjoyed music, theatre, card games, and lively parties with good food. Pepys was a busy man with many important roles; he served as a Member of Parliament and was the President of the Royal Society. He is also remembered for his contributions to the British Navy."
PET_33,"**The History of Shoes**

In the past, shoes were not designed for comfort or style. Early shoes were likely made from animal skins, which people wrapped around their ankles to keep warm. Today, we still use leather, but materials like silk, plastic, and cotton are also common, depending on current trends. It was only about 150 years ago that people started wearing different shoes for each foot. Before that, shoes were straight and could be worn on either foot. All shoes were handmade, but now, while some shoemakers still use traditional methods, most shoes are produced by machines in large factories. The invention of sewing machines allowed the shoe industry to make many more shoes at lower prices for a larger number of customers."

When I hurt my back, I had to stop running for a while. I wanted to help more women get involved in running, to show them how enjoyable it can be and to help them feel confident enough to start. I decided to create a running club for women in my community because I was frustrated with how some race organizers think. They often say there are not enough women in running, but they also use this as a reason not to provide separate changing rooms.

I put up posters, and 40 women of different ages and fitness levels joined. Most of them were interested in losing weight, but I don't think they had considered running before. If they did, they imagined it as painful training. They didn't realize that running could be fun, with chatting and smiling while enjoying beautiful places, like by a river. 

At first, they could only run for one minute, but now they can run for thirty minutes. They have also learned about healthy eating and staying fit from other runners. I wanted to support women's running, and it has been a joy to see their progress, almost as much as they have enjoyed it themselves."
PET_40,"**THE HISTORY OF THE IDITAROD - THE LAST GREAT RACE ON EARTH**

In the 1880s, gold was found in Alaska, the northernmost state in the USA. Many people moved there hoping to become rich. New towns were quickly built, including one called Iditarod, which means 'far, distant place'. In 1909, Iditarod grew so fast that it briefly became the largest city in Alaska.

During the summer, supplies could be brought to these towns by boat. However, in winter, the rivers and ocean froze, making it impossible to reach them. To solve this, a winter trail was created in 1910 for dog teams pulling sleds. They delivered mail, food, and clothes to gold miners. This trail was known as the Iditarod Trail. It took about three weeks for a team of dogs to travel across Alaska, stopping at 'roadhouses' where drivers could rest and eat.

The trail was used every winter until the 1920s when airplanes replaced dog teams and boats as the main transport. However, in 1925, the dogs became famous again when a disease called diphtheria struck the city of Nome. The medicine needed to cure it was in Anchorage, far away. At that time, airplanes were new, and it was uncertain if they could fly in the cold. The only skilled pilot, Carl Eielson, was away on a trip. So, it was decided to use dog teams to transport the medicine instead.

The journey was over 1,000 kilometers, mostly along the Iditarod Trail. Twenty teams completed the trip in just six days. Leonhard Seppala, a Norwegian who had come to Alaska for gold, traveled the first 400 kilometers with his dog Togo, who skillfully navigated through the snow. The last part of the journey was led by Gunnar Kaasen, who had 21 years of experience with dog teams. His lead dog was Saito. At one point, Balto, another dog, refused to go further, preventing the team from falling into icy water. Thanks to their efforts, the diphtheria outbreak was stopped, and Balto became a hero.

Today, a dog sled race is held every year from Anchorage to Nome, following the route of that famous journey in 1925. This race is called the Iditarod and is known as 'The Last Great Race on Earth'."

Despite this, around 6,000 tourists visit each year to experience one of Europe’s most unique hotels. In this hotel, everything—from the rooms to the bar—is made of ice. Guests can even have their weddings there. However, placing hot drinks on the ice bar is not a good idea! The bedrooms are kept at about -4°C, but guests receive special sleeping bags to keep warm. If needed, suitable outdoor clothing can also be provided. The hotel lasts for only six months because it melts in the summer, and it is rebuilt each winter. Constructing the hotel requires 10,000 tonnes of ice and 30,000 tonnes of snow."

In 1988, Maria Mutola was the only girl on a boys' football team in Mozambique. ""We won,"" she said. ""At first, no one thought it was a problem that I was a girl. But then the team we beat complained."" This story was published in a local newspaper, and Jose Craveirinha, who supported African athletes, learned about Maria. He went to meet her and saw her playing football outside the club. He quickly realized she was very fast. 

""He talked to me about athletics,"" Maria recalled. ""I didn’t understand what he meant. The only sport I knew was football. Then he bought me running shoes and took me to train. It was very hard work, and my legs hurt a lot."" Jose spoke to her parents and convinced them that she could be successful, which would help improve their lives. They agreed to let him take her to train.

In 1991, Maria accepted an invitation to train in the United States. She had previously refused because she was worried about missing her family. Her background was different from the girls she met in the US. She said, ""They were good athletes, but while I worried about my parents having enough to eat, they worried about dresses and make-up. They knew little about me and even less about my problems. But I knew I was lucky to be there. The trainers were excellent, and I learned a lot.""

People have kept animals in zoos for over 3,000 years, starting with a large zoo in China called the Gardens of Intelligence. In the past, animals were trained to perform for visitors, but this practice has stopped. Now, the main purpose of zoos is to allow people to see animals in their natural behaviors. Most cities today have a zoo or wildlife park.

However, opinions about zoos vary. Supporters believe that zoos help us learn about nature and allow us to see wild animals up close, which would not be possible otherwise. On the other hand, some people oppose zoos, arguing that it is wrong to confine animals in cages. They also point out that poorly managed zoos can have dirty conditions and provide unsuitable food for the animals."

By Katie Atkins, aged 14  

I play the trumpet in my school jazz band. Last month, we participated in a jazz competition with bands from local high schools, and our band won! Each band had its own costumes, from black school uniforms like ours to brightly-colored T-shirts. We may not have looked like professional adult bands, but we were all experienced in competitions, so the quality of our playing was impressive, especially considering our age. Musicians from each band even created new tunes right on stage. It was thrilling to watch, but even more exciting when my band performed!  

Our school has a fantastic jazz band, but not everyone who wants to join gets accepted—only about half of the applicants. However, anyone eager to play can attend jazz practice before school, and we often spend time together after school, listening to jazz and learning about it. We also go on trips to jazz summer camps across the country; I have attended a few and learned a lot.  

Adults are often surprised that young people are interested in jazz. My music teacher believes this is because pop music may not be challenging enough for serious musicians like me. I find jazz exciting because it feels both new and old at the same time—you can create your own music while also feeling connected to its history, performing on stage like the great jazz artists before you. My school is fortunate to have excellent teachers and supportive parents. Without their help, we wouldn't progress in our music!"

In Marrakesh, Morocco, it can rain anytime from November to March. However, rain is rare, and when it does occur, the city's water pipes often cannot handle the sudden influx, causing the streets to flood. Despite the recent dry winters, the local people appreciate the rain when it arrives. The parks and gardens in Marrakesh thrive not because of rain, but due to a system of underground channels created in the 11th century that brings water from the mountains throughout the year. Areas that receive water in this way are called oases. 

Traveling south from Marrakesh, one reaches Skoura, where every piece of land is divided into small plots by water channels for growing food. The snow-covered Atlas Mountains in winter provide a beautiful backdrop."

Eight-eighteen News is a news agency for young people aged 8 to 18. We gather news and write reports, stories, and articles. These are sent to major newspapers, magazines, television, radio, and websites for publication. You can read or listen to the news stories and articles by our members on the Eight-eighteen website.

We have three centers across the country where young people can meet others and participate in projects, and we plan to open more centers soon. Since our agency began in 1994, originally called 'Young News', over 2,500 young people have joined. Sophie is one of them. She says, ""I first learned about Eight-eighteen when they interviewed me for an article about young people's views on hip hop music. I was in a room with young journalists and was impressed by the opportunities they had. Age didn’t matter; they were trusted to work on stories independently. I started attending the Eight-eighteen center in my city, received training, and was a member until I turned 18. Eight-eighteen helped me achieve more than I expected. With the skills I gained, I got a job at 19 and am now the youngest employee at a major news website, checking articles before they are published.""

**Get Involved at Every Level**

When you join Eight-eighteen, you will receive training and participate in monthly meetings to decide who will write each news story. Eight-eighteen promotes skill-sharing among members. 'Peer trainers' are experienced members aged 12 and older who train new members in basic journalism skills. As they gain more experience, some members present sessions to young people and adults outside of Eight-eighteen, often at youth clubs and summer camps. These young trainers are always supported by older staff during these events.

Eight-eighteen News holds training sessions for new members three times a year. Our next training for new members will be in February. If you or someone you know is interested in joining, please call Director Den Ley at 01622 657874 for more information. The Eight-eighteen program is suitable for children with reading and writing skills at all levels. Membership is free, and there is no test to join."
PET_28,"**Antarctica Sightseeing Flights Website**

Welcome to our website! Here, you will find all the information you need before booking a flight. During the short summer in Antarctica, we offer sightseeing flights from Sydney, Australia, on a Boeing 747. The exact flight dates for next year are not confirmed yet, but if you book now, your deposit can be transferred if we need to change the date.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**How long is the flight?**  
The average flight lasts 12 hours. About four hours into the journey, we usually see the first sea ice and icebergs. We spend four hours flying over Antarctica and the rest of the time returning home. During the flight, experts who have worked in Antarctica will give talks about the environment and history, and they will answer your questions. There is a camera next to the pilot that is connected to the video system on board, allowing you to see the view from the pilot's perspective from take-off to landing.

**Will I get a seat next to a window?**  
All passengers receive two boarding passes. At the halfway point of the flight, you will be asked to move to the seat indicated on your second boarding pass. Business and first-class passengers will have a window seat for half of the flight and a seat next to a window for the other half. Economy passengers will have either a window seat or a seat next to a window for half of the flight and an end-of-row seat for the other half. While we are over Antarctica, we encourage passengers to get up and move around the plane so everyone can enjoy the views. The pilot flies in long 'figure 8s' over interesting sights to ensure everyone can see well from both sides of the plane.

**What happens if the weather is bad?**  
We have 17 different approved flight plans. On the morning of the flight, our captain checks the satellite cloud images and chooses the direction that offers the best views.

**Will I see penguins and other wildlife?**  
Most Antarctic wildlife lives at sea level, which is over 3,000 meters below the plane, so we cannot see them clearly. We do not land in Antarctica for environmental reasons. If you want to see Antarctic wildlife, you would need to join a boat tour.

**Can I take photographs?**  
Absolutely! All cameras are welcome. We even offer some fun photo opportunities on board where you can try on Antarctic cold weather clothing."
PET_35,"**Text: Little Chefs**

A group of children aged ten to fifteen spends their Saturdays learning how to cook. Their weekly lessons are very popular, and there is a waiting list of 30 children who want to join. Parents pay £280 for the course, where children can have fun and learn to make delicious food. 

Bill, who is ten years old, says, ""I love my mum's cooking, and now I can do it even better than her. The teachers make us laugh, especially when we sit down to eat the food we've made."" 

Flora, who is twelve, has some trouble with onions. She says, ""I love cooking. I made a meal for ten friends, and they really enjoyed it. My mum suggested I find a hobby instead of doing nothing on weekends. I liked staying at home, so I wasn't very interested at first. But now, I'm really glad I decided to come."" 

Their teacher, Philippe, says, ""It's a lot of fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, even if the kitchen isn't always tidy when they cook! As adults, we keep learning more about food. If parents get their children interested in cooking when they are young, they will have the skills to cook for themselves when they leave home."""
PET_5,"**Winter Driving**

Winter can be dangerous because it is hard to predict what will happen, and accidents can happen easily. Fog may appear suddenly over a hill. Ice can be hidden under melting snow, ready to cause you to lose control. A car coming towards you might slide unexpectedly across the road.

**Rule Number One** for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly. Sudden movements can make it hard to control your car. When you turn the wheel, brake, or speed up, do it gently and slowly. Imagine you have a full cup of hot coffee next to you; drive carefully so you don’t spill it.

**Rule Number Two** is to be aware of potential dangers. The more ice there is, the further ahead you should look. Test how long it takes to stop by braking gently. Remember, you might be driving faster than you think. Generally, allow double your normal stopping distance on wet roads, three times that on snow, and even more on ice. Try to keep control of your car at all times to avoid problems."
PET_41,"**Craigie Aitchison**

Craigie Aitchison was a painter from Scotland. He moved to London with the plan to study law, but instead, he went to art school. He found the traditional drawing classes challenging, but he continued to paint. In his late twenties, the Italian government funded his art studies, and he became interested in early Italian artists, which is reflected in some of his artwork. He loved the greens and browns of the Italian countryside and the bright light there, and he wanted to capture this light in his paintings. This inspired him to layer colors from light to dark, although he admits he is never certain about the outcome. He explains, ""It's a secret - because I don't know myself. I don't start by painting yellow, knowing I'm going to put anything on top.""

Like many talented artists, Aitchison makes it seem easy. He says, ""Anyone can do the colors - you can buy them. I just pay attention to what colors are next to each other."" Unlike some artists, he does not create sketches before starting a painting because he fears that if he does, he might lose interest and not complete the painting. Instead, Aitchison often changes his paintings multiple times before they are finished. This is why he prefers to work with models who do not ask to see their portraits while he is painting. He states, ""If I feel they're worried and want to look at the painting, I can't do it.""

Since moving to London, Aitchison has not felt connected to the Scottish art scene. He claims he is not interested in following any artistic tradition; he simply paints in his own way. Nevertheless, his work continues to inspire young British artists."
PET_38,"**Text: 'Rock Band'**

Two years ago, our 14-year-old son, Ben, asked us for a drum set for his birthday. At first, we were against it because of the noise. Ben argued, ""It's better than watching TV or playing video games in my free time, and it will keep me out of trouble."" Eventually, we agreed. We said, ""Okay, but you must think about the rest of the family and the neighbors when you play.""

That was just the start. Since drums are hard to move, Ben's band members began coming to our house with their guitars and other equipment. Now, for several hours each week, our house shakes with their music and singing. At least Ben's hobby has been good for our health: whenever they practice, my husband and I go for a long walk. I must admit that, even though their music can sound a bit strange, they are a friendly and polite group of young men.

I cannot judge their musical talent; after all, I didn't expect my parents to like the same music I did when I was a teenager. They do perform regularly in local clubs for young people. Our main concern is that they might not spend enough time on their schoolwork because of their music, but this hasn't happened yet. I always remind Ben how important his studies are. One thing is clear: Ben was right; playing music has kept him out of trouble and he is never bored."
PET_17,"**Text: Atlantic College**

Last week, I visited Atlantic College, a great private school in Wales. It offers students valuable experiences outside the classroom, along with the chance to prepare for their exams. The students, aged 16 to 18 and from various countries, study in the mornings. In the afternoons, they participate in helpful activities, such as working on a farm, assisting people with learning difficulties, or checking rivers for pollution.

One of the best aspects of Atlantic College is its diverse student body, which comes from different social backgrounds and countries. Since the tuition fees are £20,000 for two years, financial aid is available. About 25% of the students are British, many of whom can only attend because they receive government support.

Barbara Molenkamp, a student from the Netherlands, said, ""I really admire the college for promoting international understanding among young people. You learn to live with and respect others, even those you may not like. During the summer holidays, my mother noticed I argued much less with my sister.""

In conclusion, Atlantic College provides an excellent education through effective methods."
PET_47,"Text: 'Being an Older Student

At 32, I have just completed my first year at university. Along with attending lectures regularly, I have learned to read books quickly and write long essays. I decided to return to university after being away from school for fourteen years. As a secretary, I earned a decent salary, but I felt bored in a job that required little thought. I became increasingly unhappy with the idea of being stuck in that position. I envied the students at the local university, who seemed happy, carefree, and full of hope, and I wanted to be part of that experience.

Now that I am a student, I find it challenging to connect with younger classmates. They often mistake me for a lecturer and ask me questions I cannot answer. I also feel distant from the lecturers because, even though we are the same age, I know much less than they do. However, I appreciate this chance to study because I understand that a qualification is necessary for a rewarding job, which is very important to me. Unlike most eighteen-year-olds, I prefer spending my weekends with my books rather than going out to parties. Additionally, I enjoy the typical student benefits, such as long holidays and discounts for theatre and cinema.

I often worry about what I will do after university, but I hope that continuing my education at this stage in my life has been a wise decision.'"
PET_48,"**Text: Henry Ford**

Henry Ford was born in Michigan in 1863, but he did not enjoy farming. At the age of fifteen, he started working as a mechanic. In 1893, he created his first car. After driving it for 1,500 kilometers, he sold it and made two larger cars. In 1903, he founded the Ford Motor Company. By using strong yet lightweight steel, he produced affordable cars for everyday people. In 1908, he introduced the first Ford Model 'T', which cost $825. Soon, he was selling 100 cars each day. By 1927, the Ford Motor Company was valued at $700 million. Early Ford cars were simple and inexpensive, but this simplicity sometimes meant fewer options. Henry Ford famously said about the Model T, ""You can have any color you like, as long as it's black."""

Rebecca Stevens was the first woman to climb Mount Everest. Before this achievement, she worked as a journalist and lived in a small apartment in south London. In 1993, Rebecca decided to leave her job and family to travel to Asia with other climbers. She discovered that life on Everest is very challenging. ""You have to carry everything on your back,"" she said, ""so you can only bring what you really need. You can't wash on the mountain, and in the end, I didn't even take a toothbrush. I usually like to stay clean, but there is no water, only snow. Water is very heavy, so you only take enough to drink!""

When Rebecca reached the summit of Mount Everest on May 17, 1993, it was the happiest moment of her life. Suddenly, she became famous. She has since written a book about her journey, and people often invite her to speak about it. She also has a new job on a science program on television.

Canada Geese are large birds with blue and white feathers. When autumn comes, they must fly south to find warmer weather. The winters in Canada are very cold, and the birds cannot survive if they stay there. Last spring, Bill Lishman discovered sixteen young Canada Geese on his farm. They had lost their parents. Bill thought, ""These young birds will not know how to migrate in the autumn."" 

Bill owned a small plane and decided to teach the geese to follow him. Throughout the summer, he took short flights in his plane, and the young geese followed him. When autumn arrived and the weather turned cold, Bill flew to Virginia in the United States, which is 600 miles south of his home in Canada. The geese followed him all the way.

After reaching Virginia, Bill left the geese there and returned home. This spring, he waited for the birds to come back, but they did not arrive. So, Bill flew back to Virginia to find them. He searched for two weeks but could not locate them. When he returned home, he was surprised to find the geese waiting for him. They had managed to find their way home on their own!"

When Esther finished school at sixteen, her aunt Flory gave her £500 for her birthday. While most of Esther's friends chose to go to college, Esther decided to use her aunt's money to start her own business. She bought fruit, sugar, and glass jars to make jam. She sold the jam for £1 a jar to her friends and quickly earned back her aunt's £500.

At first, Esther's parents were not supportive of her jam-making. They wanted her to study and hoped she would become a teacher or a doctor. However, Esther ignored their advice and continued making jam. After a few months, she began selling it at the local market. She also started making orange juice, which she sold to a school where a friend worked.

After two years, her business grew significantly, and her parents were proud of her. She produced various types of food and sold them to shops and supermarkets. She became so busy that she needed to hire some employees to help her."

Corryvale Farm is located in the west of England. Stephen and Jenny Blackler raise cows and chickens and sell milk and eggs. However, most of their income comes from Jenny's sheep. She has 50 sheep, and each sheep produces enough wool for six sweaters. Every six months, Stephen shears the wool from the sheep to keep them comfortable.

Five years ago, Jenny tried to sell sweaters made from the wool at country markets, but it was summer and too hot for people to buy sweaters. Instead, she made socks, which became very popular because they were affordable, durable, and easy to clean. This is how Jenny's business began. Initially, she made the socks at home, but soon she had so many customers that she needed to send the wool to a factory, where machines now produce all the socks.

The socks come in six colors and five sizes for all ages, with different types for walkers, athletes, and skiers. Jenny is especially busy during Christmas because Corryvale socks are a popular gift. In her office, she has many letters from satisfied customers from around the world."

Most house burglaries occur between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m., according to the police. Inspector Ian Saunders informed our newspaper that the number of burglaries has increased by over 30% compared to last year. He mentioned that 67% of burglaries happen when people leave their homes and forget to lock doors or windows. He also noted that burglaries at night are rare because families are usually at home then. However, winter afternoons are ideal for burglars since it gets dark, making it harder to see them. Many houses are often empty during this time because people are still at work.

Inspector Saunders suggested that it is wise to leave lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when going on holiday, as this can deter burglars. He also encouraged neighbors to keep an eye on each other's homes when someone is away and to call the police if they notice anything suspicious. ""We will also provide advice on how to secure your home,"" Inspector Saunders said. ""This assistance is free of charge."""

KET_44,"**The History of Farming**

Before farming began, people searched forests for edible plants and fruits. This required constant movement to find food. However, around 12,000 years ago in the Middle East, people started to cultivate crops. These individuals became the first farmers. Farming allowed people to settle in one location, leading to the growth of larger villages. As a result, some villagers could take on other jobs, such as making clothes, since farmers provided food for everyone. Unfortunately, farming could be challenging during bad weather, which sometimes left people without enough food. Today, farmers produce more food, which can travel thousands of kilometers to reach our homes."

Watching films is the most popular leisure activity for many Indians, with ten million people visiting cinemas daily. 

Bollywood films often focus on romantic love stories, and they include a lot of singing and dancing. These films are also popular outside of India. Last year, Bollywood earned over $500 million by selling films to other countries. Indian actors produce more films each year than American actors in Hollywood, but they earn less money. This is why most Bollywood films have a production cost of about $2 million, while Hollywood films usually cost at least $5 million to make.

Most Bollywood actors are young and work hard, but their careers are often short. Amitabh Bachchan, who is considered by some to be India's greatest actor, is an exception. He has starred in more than 140 films over a career that has lasted almost 40 years."

There are many types of parrots, but all have strong beaks and feet that help them climb and hold food. The largest parrots can live for up to 80 years. They are quite noisy, but they are intelligent and can be taught to talk easily. Some zoos have parrot shows where you can watch the birds perform tricks they have learned."
KET_25,"Text: 'HOWARD BONNIER Bray is a lovely village located about fifty kilometers west of London. A young Englishman named Howard Bonnier opened a restaurant called The Palace there around three and a half months ago. Not many people in Britain know Mr. Bonnier yet, but he is already quite well-known in France. This is because he has written for French magazines about many of the best restaurants in that country. He is only 29 years old. When Howard was a teenager, he often visited restaurants with his parents. He enjoyed this so much that he chose not to spend his money on clothes and CDs; instead, he traveled to France to dine in good restaurants. He also collected many French and English cookbooks - he claims to have over two hundred and fifty! So why did he choose to open a restaurant? Simply because he loves cooking. Has it been easy? He says starting a restaurant is costly and cooking for fifty people is much harder than cooking for family, but he believes he has made the right choice.'"
KET_34,"**Text: John Pickering**

In a small town in central England, John Pickering mows the grass and waters the flowers in a park. Last week, however, he was in Tokyo, where millions of Japanese people watched him on television because he is currently the top singer in Japan. A few months ago, John traveled to Japan to perform in dance clubs in Osaka and Nagoya. A disc jockey heard his music and played it on his radio show. Many young people called the station, asking to hear his songs again. 

John, who goes by the name Jon Otis when he sings in Japan, plans to continue working in the park in England. He is unsure how much money he will make from his music. ""I must keep my job in the park,"" he says. ""I still have to pay my bills!"" The other gardeners do not know about his fame in Japan; they have never heard him sing. John's wife, Denise, who works in a hospital, says, ""This will not change how we live. I only know John Pickering, not Jon Otis!"""

KET_26,"**Text: Line Dancing**

Many people in Britain have taken up a new hobby: line dancing. In nearly every town, there are clubs and classes for this enjoyable activity. 

""Line dancing is simple to learn. If you can walk, you can do it!"" says Fiona Lever, a teacher. ""You don’t need a partner because you dance in groups. It’s a great way to meet new friends. In my classes, there are people of all ages. The boys enjoy it because they can make a lot of noise with their feet while dancing!""

When did line dancing start? Most people believe it began around fifteen years ago when American country music became popular in Britain."
KET_8,"**The Rhino**

There are five types of rhinos in the world today. The Black and White Rhinos live in the open fields of Africa, while the other types live in forests in Asia. All rhinos have large, heavy bodies. Their skin is tough, and they have very little hair. A rhino stands on four short legs, and each foot has three toes. They usually walk slowly, but they can run at speeds of up to 50 kilometers per hour. Rhinos are generally quiet and calm animals, and they eat grass and other plants. A baby rhino weighs about 40 kilos at birth and stays inside its mother for around fifteen months. An adult rhino can weigh over 200 kilos and may live for up to 50 years."
KET_4,"**The History of the London Police**

Today, there are police officers everywhere, but in 1700, London had no police force. A few elderly men patrolled the streets at night, but they were not paid much. Around 300 years ago, London was growing larger. The city was very dirty, and many people lived in poverty. There were many thieves who stole money in the streets, causing people to stay at home as much as possible.

In 1750, Henry Fielding began to pay a group of individuals to catch thieves. They were similar to police officers and were known as the 'Bow Street Runners' because they worked near Bow Street. Fifty years later, there were 120 Bow Street Runners, but London had expanded significantly and needed more police.

In 1829, the first Metropolitan Police Force was established with 3,000 officers. Most of the officers patrolled on foot, while a few rode horses. Until 1920, all police officers in London were men. Today, London police officers are well paid, and those who still ride horses earn even higher salaries than their colleagues."

KET_7,"Text: 'Experience the Edinburgh Festival! Each year, many people visit Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland, to enjoy the Edinburgh Festival. For three weeks in August and September, the city is filled with performers and artists from around the globe. They gather in Edinburgh for the largest arts festival in Britain. During this time, the streets are vibrant with music and dance from morning until night. You can even watch artists create paintings on the streets. A highlight of the Festival is the 'Fringe', where students perform comedy shows in small venues and cafes. Many tourists come to the Festival to watch new films, plays, and listen to music from well-known musicians. This year, there are over five hundred performances featuring actors from more than forty countries. Tickets for these shows are quite affordable, and it is often easier to see your favorite star in Edinburgh than in London. So, plan to visit Edinburgh next summer, but remember that finding a room can be challenging, so consider booking your hotel now!'"
KET_43,"**ICE FISHING**

If you drive north from Toronto for three hours, you will reach Lake Nipissing. In winter, the lake freezes, and many Canadian fishermen go there every weekend. They build small wooden houses on the ice and paint them in bright colors. Inside these houses, they try to catch fish that swim beneath the ice. 

Bob Marvisch has been coming here for twenty-five years during this season. ""You need clothes that are light but warm: two pairs of socks, gloves, several thin sweaters, and a snow suit on top,"" he explains. ""Catching fish is easy. First, you break the ice and make a small round hole. Then, you take a fishing line, put some bread on it, and lower it through the hole into the water. You pull the line up when the fish eat the bread. The fish are usually between ten and twenty centimeters long. Some people enjoy eating them, but after I catch three or four, I prefer to have chocolate or another snack! Today, I caught twenty-five! It's a fun sport, and you can meet nice people here!"""

KET_11,"**Text: Madame Tussaud's Museum**

One well-known tourist attraction in London is Madame Tussaud's museum. Visitors can see wax figures of famous individuals here. Madame Tussaud was born in France in 1761. Her uncle, who was a doctor, created wax figures and opened a museum in Paris. Marie assisted him with this work. In 1789, during the French Revolution, Marie was imprisoned. While in prison, she had to create wax models of famous people who had died, including Queen Marie Antoinette. In 1795, Marie married Francois Tussaud, and in 1802, she moved to London with her wax figures. She opened a museum there, and her figures can still be seen today."
KET_14,"**BICYCLES**

Bicycles are an affordable and environmentally friendly mode of transportation. The first bicycle was created around 150 years ago. Initially, bicycles were costly, and only wealthy individuals could afford them. These early models looked quite different from modern bicycles. As prices decreased, more people began to purchase bicycles for commuting and leisure. 

Today, cars are more commonly used than bicycles because they are faster and keep you dry in the rain. However, some individuals still choose to ride bicycles to work. They argue that there are too many cars in city centers, making parking difficult."
KET_63,"**Text: The Elephant Show by Daniel Allsop, age 14**

Last summer, I went to Thailand for a beach holiday with my family. One day, we visited a park near our hotel. The park had beautiful flower gardens, but we were excited about the elephant show. We went to a large area with seats on three sides. Three elephants entered with their keepers and stood in front of a big piece of white card. Each elephant received a paintbrush and began to paint on its own card. Occasionally, the keepers gave each elephant a new brush filled with paint and took away the old one. Slowly, following their keepers' directions, the elephants created pictures on the cards. I couldn't believe my eyes! One picture showed a river, another a tree, and the third a bunch of flowers. When the keepers displayed the paintings, everyone wanted to buy one. We also gave the elephants the bananas we had brought for lunch. Twenty years ago, elephants worked in the forest. Now, they do not work there anymore, but the smartest elephants live in special centers where visitors can watch them."
KET_56,"**Text: Big Cats**

There are many types of cats, each varying in size, appearance, and behavior. Tigers are the largest cats, measuring up to 3.7 meters from head to tail. While most cats avoid water, tigers often enjoy lying in pools when it is hot. Lions are unique as they live in large family groups. These lions often cooperate to hunt for food. They typically inhabit flat, open areas where they can see far and track other animals easily. All cats require good eyesight to catch smaller prey, and they must also be fast and strong."

KET_20,"**THE OSTRICH**

The ostrich is the largest bird in the world, weighing over 90 kilograms as an adult. Most wild ostriches are found in southern Africa, but their numbers are low. Like all birds, ostriches have wings, but they cannot fly. They use their wings to help them turn while running. Ostriches can run very fast, reaching speeds of 65 to 90 kilometers per hour, making it hard for predators to catch them. Baby ostriches are about the same size as chickens and take around 3 years to grow into adults. They eat plants and can survive for many days without water."
KET_40,"Text: 'Victoria Jamieson, a 23-year-old snowboarder from Britain, began snowboarding at the age of 20. Recently, we interviewed her at a snowboarding competition in Switzerland. When we asked why she chose this sport, she said, ""I have always enjoyed sports, especially skiing, so snowboarding felt like a natural choice. It’s easy to learn, and you can become quite skilled in just a few months."" 

We inquired about her practice routine. She explained, ""In winter, I snowboard in the mountains every day from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. I also enjoy running and biking. I truly love all of it! Competing and being in the mountains is wonderful. However, free-riding—doing what you want outside of competitions—is the best part for me."" 

When we asked about learning to snowboard, she emphasized, ""You can learn quickly, but taking lessons is essential. Having the right clothing is also important to stay dry, especially since beginners often fall a lot!""'"

KET_64,"**Text: Mount Kilimanjaro**

Mount Kilimanjaro is the tallest mountain in Africa. Many people, from a seven-year-old child to an 87-year-old man, have successfully climbed it. There are several routes to the summit. The Marangu route, which is five kilometers long, is considered the easiest and takes about five days to complete. It is very popular among tourists. However, only half of those who attempt to reach the summit succeed. This is often due to sudden changes in weather. At the start of the climb, it can be hot and rainy, but at the summit, climbers encounter ice and snow, with temperatures possibly dropping below 20 degrees Celsius. Therefore, climbers should bring both sunglasses and warm clothing!"
KET_29,"**Text: Otters**

Otters are fascinating animals that many people have not seen. They inhabit areas near rivers and build their homes using small pieces of wood. Typically, otters emerge from their homes at night. They are excellent swimmers, capable of reaching speeds over 10 kilometers per hour. Their thick brown fur keeps them warm while they are in the water. Otters can close their ears and nostrils, allowing them to remain submerged for several minutes. 

Twenty years ago, otters were scarce in Great Britain due to pollution in the rivers, which led to the decline of fish and insects, their primary food sources. However, the situation has improved significantly, and now there is plenty of food available for them because the rivers have become clean again."

KET_59,"**Text: Buildings**

People have always created buildings. We need houses to stay warm and dry, and we build stadiums to watch football matches and concerts. Other buildings, like museums, are used to display beautiful items. Many individuals collaborate on a building project. The architect decides how the building will look and creates drawings to share their ideas. Engineers ensure the building is strong and safe. Then, workers carefully construct it. 

The Sydney Opera House is a well-known modern building with a stunning roof. However, it is beautiful from all angles, not just the top. Another famous roof is on the Olympic Stadium in Munich. This unique building resembles a tent made of glass."

Gail Rollins is one of the best runners in Edinburgh. This summer, she plans to compete in the 10,000 metres and possibly the 5,000 metres at the European Championships. In the past, Gail was known for finishing second in major competitions. However, she always smiled and laughed, which made her popular in her hometown. Everything changed in 2004 when she participated in her first half-marathon, a long road race. She won with an impressive time, the fastest of any British woman that year.

Gail's manager and husband, Mike Rollins, used to race when he was younger, but he had to stop due to an injury to his right leg. He can still run a little and sometimes trains with Gail, but it’s not enjoyable for him when she runs ahead and he cannot keep up. Gail trains hard; she does a long run in the morning and fast runs in the afternoon, but she always takes Sundays off from running. Mike says, ""I am with her all the time. Sometimes I ask, 'Are you sure you should be eating that?' It's usually cakes, but she can eat almost anything."""
KET_52,"**Text: Piano Players - Their Early Years**

**Ivan Petrov**  
Ivan was born on a farm in Russia. From the age of twelve to eighteen, he studied in Poland. His first music teacher could not play the piano but taught him and his sister songs from operas. His mother started teaching him the piano when he was six years old. At ten, he decided he wanted to write music and began working on his first song.

**Oleg Gagarin**  
Oleg was the youngest of five children. When he was four, his father, who enjoyed playing the piano, taught him some traditional Russian music. At six, he began taking lessons from a piano teacher in his city. Oleg quickly started winning prizes for his piano playing. At fourteen, he attended a music college in Austria for two years before returning to Russia.

**Josef Heptmann**  
Josef's father was German and taught music in Poland, where Josef was born. The family moved to Germany when Josef was two, and he began playing the piano a year later.

Bill Prince-Smith was a farmer, teacher, and dentist before he became a children's book writer at the age of 60. Now, thirteen years later, he has written over 80 books. Every day, he goes to his office to write. In the evening, he shares his work with his wife, who tells him what she thinks. ""She lets me know when she doesn't like something,"" says Bill. His ten grandchildren, who live far away, also read his stories and give their opinions.

Through this feedback, Bill has learned what young children enjoy reading. He writes about life in his village and the nearby farms. His favorite book is his fifth one, *The Sheepdog*, which tells the story of a farmer and his helpful dog. ""I have always loved animals,"" Bill says, ""and dogs are very smart; they learn quickly."" 

Last year, *The Sheepdog* was made into a film with real animals and actors. The filmmakers used advanced technology to make it seem like the animals were talking. Bill was very happy with the film. ""Sometimes filmmakers change the story, but they didn't change mine, and I love the film."""
KET_35,"**POSTCARDS**

Today, many people enjoy sending postcards to their friends and family. These postcards usually feature images of beaches, mountains, or castles, and you can write a message on the back. Many individuals send postcards while on holiday because they are inexpensive, and the images are often more appealing than personal photos. The first postcard was sent at the end of the 19th century, and it displayed a picture of a seaside town. Over time, postcards began to show images related to current events, such as accidents or visits from important figures. People appreciated these postcards because newspapers at that time did not include pictures."
KET_5,"**Text: Dinosaurs**

Dinosaurs are creatures that no one has ever seen because the last ones died around 60 million years ago, long before humans existed. The exact reason for their extinction is still unknown. Birds are the closest living relatives of dinosaurs. 

Dinosaurs were not all the same; there were over 5,000 different types. Some were very small, while others were enormous. The largest dinosaurs were bigger than any other land animals that have ever lived. For instance, the Brontosaurus was about twenty meters long and primarily ate plants. The Tyrannosaurus Rex was smaller but much stronger, with sharp teeth for eating meat. It could also run quickly due to its long back legs."
KET_41,"**Bears**

Bears can be dangerous animals. Adult bears are very strong and can potentially harm a person. They are skilled climbers and can run quickly. However, their eyesight is poor, and like many animals, they rely on their sense of smell to find food. There are seven species of bears. The largest is the polar bear, which can grow to nearly three meters tall. There are two types of black bears: one inhabits the forests of North America, while the other is found in Southeast Asia. Interestingly, not all black bears are actually black; they can also be dark brown or reddish-brown. The beloved panda bear, known for its black and white fur, originates from China. Unfortunately, there are not many pandas left in the wild today due to challenges in finding food."

Crocodiles are found in tropical regions around the world, such as Africa, South America, and Northern Australia. They primarily inhabit slow-moving waters but can swim quickly and move fast on land. It is common to see crocodiles in large groups. Their diet includes a variety of prey, such as fish, birds, and small animals, and they can also attack larger animals or even humans. There are over ten species of crocodiles, all equipped with very sharp teeth. Although they frequently lose teeth, they quickly grow new ones. Typically, crocodiles measure about 3.5 meters in length, although some can be much larger. They have a long lifespan, with the oldest recorded crocodile in a zoo living to be 66 years old."

In 1783, two French brothers created the first balloon that could carry people into the sky. One hundred and twenty years later, in 1903, the Wright brothers invented the first powered airplane and successfully flew it in the United States. In 1918, the US Post Office started the first airmail service. Over the next thirty years, airplanes underwent significant changes. By the 1950s, airplanes became much faster due to the introduction of jet engines. In 1976, Concorde was developed in the UK and France. It is the fastest passenger airplane in the world, capable of flying at 2,500 kilometers per hour, allowing the journey from London to New York to take only four hours. Today, millions of people travel by airplane, making it hard to imagine a world without them."
KET_47,"**The Globe Theatre**

Visiting the theatre in London 400 years ago was quite different from today. The building was round and had no roof, so people would get cold and wet if it rained. The queen enjoyed going to the Globe Theatre, located by the River Thames, to watch the plays of William Shakespeare. At that time, all the actors were men. Visitors would eat, chat with friends, walk around during the performance, and some even threw things at the actors! Today, you can still visit the Globe Theatre. A new theatre has been built in the same location by the river. You can enjoy a Shakespeare play there or learn about life in the seventeenth century."
