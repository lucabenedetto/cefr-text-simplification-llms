**Garbage and Costs**
Charging families for each bag of garbage they throw away sounds good for the environment and makes sense for money. But it may not be true. In many places, garbage collection is free. Families pay for this service through local taxes. A family that throws away a lot of garbage pays the same as a couple that throws away a little. But garbage disposal costs money. The more garbage people throw away, the more trucks and workers are needed. 
If garbage disposal is free, people will throw away too much garbage. A solution is to make families pay for the garbage they throw away. This can make them recycle more. Some American towns have started charging families for their garbage. They sell stickers that families put on their garbage bags. Only bags with these stickers are picked up.
In one town, Charlottesville, Virginia, families paid 80 cents for each sticker. This seemed like a good idea. But the study showed that the costs of the program were higher than the money made from stickers. The number of garbage bags did go down by 37%. But many people just put more garbage in each bag instead of buying more stickers. 
The weight of garbage collected only went down by 14%. In other towns without a charging system, the weight of garbage also went down a little. Some people even dumped their garbage illegally instead of paying for it. This illegal dumping might be a big part of the reason for less garbage collected.
One good thing was that recycling went up by 15%. This means people chose to recycle instead of paying to throw away their garbage. But many people were already recycling before the new charges.
A later study showed that charging for garbage does reduce the amount of garbage, but not by much. If prices go up by 10%, the amount of garbage only goes down by 0.3%. This is not a big change. To throw away much less garbage, people would need to buy less of everything. A small charge for garbage is not likely to change much.
In richer towns, people throw away more garbage than in poorer towns. They also have less time to recycle. So, charging families for garbage may not be a bad idea. But the effects of these policies can be complicated. Sometimes, it is hard to understand what will happen."

Theodore Zeldin talks about how work can change. Do you feel respected and appreciated at your job? Success is not enough anymore. Many people feel their work is not valued. Even famous people can feel unhappy. Loving your job used to be special, but now you should think about how your job affects you as a person. This is important. If your job makes you boring or too busy to think or be creative, then money and status will not make you happy.
I want to find out how work can help us feel fulfilled. Work should not just be about making money; it should help us live better lives and meet new people. But changing work will not end unemployment. Many educated people want jobs that are interesting and helpful.
Even jobs that used to be good, like being a doctor or an architect, can be stressful. Many workers feel unhappy and do not connect with their companies. In Britain, only 8% of workers feel their values match their company’s values.
I am studying different jobs to see how they affect people. I want to understand happiness, love, friendship, and respect. I am looking for better ways to earn a living. We need to think about who we are as people, not just about money.
Many hotel workers are very smart but have low pay and long hours. Hotels could be more than just places to sleep. They could be places where people from different countries meet and share experiences. Hotel workers could help guests learn about the city and each other. 
But hotels often focus only on making money. It is time to think about work in a new way. Work is about relationships. Many people want to feel independent at work. They should be able to choose their jobs and coworkers. 
Good communication is important, but it is not the same as real conversation. Real conversation helps us understand each other better and creates respect. When we have these conversations, we can change the world little by little. 
**Questions:**
1. Who is Theodore Zeldin?
2. What does Zeldin think about success at work?
3. Why is it important to think about how work affects us?
4. What do many hotel workers want?
5. How can hotels be better places for people?"
CPE_24,C2,"Broadcasting**
Broadcasting means sending information, like words and pictures, to many people. The word ""broadcast"" comes from farming. It means to spread seeds widely. This idea is about growing and sharing things with many people.
When television was first made, it was thought of as a way to send information from one place to many homes. This was because of how society was changing. People wanted to get news and entertainment easily. 
In the 1930s, some people in Britain tried to make two-way television, like a video phone. They wanted to talk to each other using TV. Many people were excited and wrote about it in magazines. But big companies took control and made rules for TV. This made it hard for regular people to use their ideas.
In the USA, TV was mostly watched in public places, not at home. People went to see TV shows together. In Britain and Germany, many people also watched TV in public. 
As time went on, more people could buy TVs for their homes. This was because they had more money to spend. Families wanted to have fun and enjoy different shows at home. 
Broadcasting became a way for governments to share important news with everyone. It helped create a sense of community in the country. 
Today, broadcasting is changing again. New technology is making it different from before. The way we think about broadcasting might change too."

**Clutter**  
Sometimes, it feels like no matter how many things you have, you still do not feel safe. It is normal to want a home that is good for you, but sometimes we want too many things. Advertisements make us feel like we need more things. They tell us that if we do not have certain things, we are not good enough. Next time you walk down the street, try not to look at any ads. There are many ads everywhere: on TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, t-shirts, and the internet. They all want us to buy more things.
**Caves**  
Many scientists study caves. They want to know where caves come from, how water works in caves, and what lives in them. Caves are interesting and make us curious. Many people study caves because they are important in nature. However, it can be hard to visit some caves, so many people who study caves are not just scientists but also people who visit caves for fun.
**Weather Watch**  
A long time ago, people started to study the weather just by watching it. Now, we have many tools like satellites and computers to help us understand the weather. These tools give us a lot of information very quickly. Sometimes, the words used to talk about the weather are very hard to understand. But our own experiences are still very important for making weather forecasts. What we see and feel can help scientists understand the weather better.

**Questions:**
1. What do advertisements make us feel we need?
2. What do scientists study about caves?
3. How did people study the weather a long time ago?
4. What tools do we use today to help us understand the weather?
5. Why are our own experiences important for weather forecasts?"
CPE_16,C2,"**MUSIC AND THEATRE**
I used to think that opera is mainly theatre. Now, I think it is more about music. I worked at a national opera house and learned that music is the most important part. I come from the world of theatre, where words and actors are very important. In theatre, the audience and the performers usually speak the same language.
At music performances, like concerts or operas, many people do not know much about music. Some feel embarrassed about this. Most people admire the performers. A good musician works very hard for many years. Watching great music is like watching a sports match. We know how to run, but we see that athletes are much better than us.
Theatre audiences have different expectations. They do not always understand how hard acting is. They may not be impressed when an actor says a long speech. People often ask actors, ""How do you remember all those lines?"" This does not mean that theatre audiences are easier or harder to please than music audiences. Many people enjoy both.
I think music can learn from theatre. A different approach can make the concert experience better. Live music is full of feelings and can connect with the audience. However, music performances often have strict rules, like dress codes, which can make the audience feel separate from the performers.
Sometimes, music audiences clap between songs, which can interrupt the performance. This is a way to show appreciation, but it can also break the flow of the music. 
Many people are working to bring new audiences to concerts and operas. They want to show that ""serious"" music is for everyone. I remember a special event called In Search of Angels. It took place in a cathedral and outside in the town. It was a great musical experience, and many audience members felt changed by it.
I wish music could be more like theatre, which can be exciting and different. Sometimes, using unusual places for performances can surprise both performers and audiences. It may not be comfortable, but theatre audiences are often brave and willing to try new things.
I know that many plays are done in a normal way, like concerts. But I believe we can change how people experience music. I love theatre and music, and I want more people to enjoy them too."

**Sand**  
I think sand is not very nice. It can be useful for making things like glass and concrete, but I don’t like it at the beach. Sand gets in my face and my food. It can hide important things like car keys and coins. When I am wet, sand sticks to me and is hard to wash off. But when I step on a towel or walk in a car, the sand falls off easily. Even after that, I find sand in my shoes and socks for days. I do not want sand!
**Lock and Key**  
People have always wanted a safe home. A long time ago, they used simple locks. Now, we have electronic locks that use cards. But many people still like to use a real key. They feel safer with a key. One company made a new electronic lock, but they also added a real metal key.
**Modern Art**  
I was nervous to visit the new Tate Modern gallery because I do not understand modern art. I like some art, like furry things and bright lights. I wish I knew more about it. The important thing is to enjoy the art, not to study it like a school essay. The gallery helps visitors understand the art better. They have good labels that explain what the art means. Now, I can understand the pictures more than before."

**Every Picture Tells a Story**
Making movies from books often means cutting parts of the story. This can be hard for the writer, but it can also help them see things in a new way. When I worked on a movie script, I saw that I could remove a lot of the dialogue and descriptions from the book and still tell the same story. This does not mean the original words were not important. In books, some details are repeated to help readers remember characters. In movies, we can often tell who is speaking by how the scene looks and sounds, but names like ""he said"" help us understand better.
**Watching Movies**
When we watch movies, we can feel like we are part of the story. It takes us away from our everyday lives for a while. But when the movie ends, we go back to reality. Some people think movies are just for fun and not real art. Many older people, like our parents and teachers, enjoyed movies but did not see them as art.
**The Film Studios**
The Leiper Film Company studios had many different buildings. It was hard to find your way around because there were many small rooms that looked the same. There were three main entrances, but none of them helped you find your way easily. Most people who worked there knew how to get around, but it was confusing for new visitors. The workers helped create stories of love and adventure for people to enjoy.
**Film-Makers**
Many people want to make movies. There are many books about how to write scripts and make films. Some universities offer classes on this. There are also contests where you can win cameras to make your own films. Robert Rodriguez made a famous movie called El Mariachi for only $7,000. He became a well-known director quickly. He wrote in his book that he wanted to make a great film before he turned 26, like other famous directors did when they were young.
In the past, it took longer for directors to start making movies. They often worked in other jobs first, like editing or writing. For example, John Huston was 35 when he made his first film. Now, many new film-makers have to work alone without big studios to help them.

CPE_3,C2,"
In the past, there were many council houses on the west side of the city. These houses were small and not very nice. In summer, there was a bad smell from a factory nearby. In the morning, a paperboy often looked unhappy as he walked to deliver papers. I don’t remember much from my early life, but I do remember sitting by a window and looking at the houses far away. I also remember my mother. She was small and often angry. I didn’t understand why she was angry, so I couldn’t make her feel better. 
When I went with her to small shops or around the city, I noticed she was very alone, even in a crowd. She cared a lot about rules and how to behave. She often cleaned the house and told me to ""behave properly."" I didn’t understand her rules. They meant not going into neighbors' gardens and sitting quietly at the dinner table. 
My mother had some friends. There was Mrs. Buddery, who loved the Royal Family, Mrs. Winall, who didn’t say much, and Mrs. Laband, who was more lively. They talked about their problems, like bad legs and cold weather. I often felt like I was part of their talks about ungrateful children. 
Looking back, it felt like a heavy weight was on me, and I needed to grow up and get away from it. Growing up in West Earlham was very routine. Until I was five, I stayed at home. I remember long days playing on the floor while my mother sat in a chair. After I turned five, I went to school half a mile away. Some kids had mothers who rode bikes, but my mother let me go with other children.
I remember summer holidays when I saw a little of the world outside West Earlham. There was an old man next door who told stories about his life at sea. One time, there was a charity event where a kind woman gave out lemonade. She wanted me to join a group to help others, but my mother said no because she thought they just wanted money. My mother often talked about how people wanted money, and she didn’t like politicians.
My mother did care about my education. Sometimes, she took me to the Norwich Castle Museum on the bus. We looked at paintings together. My mother didn’t mind this, and she even started to have opinions about the art. I remember one time she saw a painting of a Roman soldier and said, ""I wouldn’t want to meet him at night!"" This was one of the few times she tried to make a joke. 
**Questions:**
1. Where were the council houses located?
2. What did the paperboy do in the morning?

4. Who were the mother's friends?
5. What did the mother think about the charity event?"
CPE_10,C2,"Philadelphia Avenue**
I walked down Philadelphia Avenue on the odd side of the street. It was getting dark, and the air felt wet and sticky. I knew this street well. I remembered my neighbors, the Matzes and the Pritchards, and Han Kieffer's grocery store. I played with girls who lived in the Kring's and the Pottses' houses.
The houses were different. Some were nice, and some were not as nice. Over the years, things changed. Some houses became stores, and some stores became homes. I wondered how people lived in these places.
**Bachelor Fads Furniture**
Rick Gilbert lives in a flat that used to be a curtain warehouse. His flat has big doors and brick walls. He did not want an empty space. He wanted to separate his living area from his work area. He used a big piece of plastic to make a hallway and hide his office. He wanted his kitchen to be a place where he could cook for friends or make coffee for clients. He put light wood on the floor and mixed modern furniture with old furniture from his parents.
**Bruce Chatwin**
Bruce Chatwin was a writer who loved to travel. His life was full of secrets and stories. His first book, *In Patagonia*, came out in 1977. It was a special travel book that told exciting stories. Sometimes, he changed facts to make his stories better. He believed that traveling could help people learn about history.
**Swimming**
One summer day, it rained a lot. I ran to the pool in my backyard. I swam and watched the raindrops make bubbles in the water. The best part was when the rain got stronger, and the sound of birds went away. That summer, I thought about swimming across Britain. I wanted to follow the rain to the sea. I felt tired of swimming in the same place. 
Many places today have signs and labels. This makes things feel less real. Walking, cycling, and swimming help us feel free and discover new things. A swimming journey would let me see parts of the world that are still mysterious."
CPE_67,C2,"CRYING**
Charles Darwin thought that crying did not have a clear purpose. He was probably wrong. Scientists now say that crying is important for social reasons. For example, psychiatrist John Bowlby said that crying helps mothers and children bond. Many people think that children cry because they feel helpless.
It is harder to understand why adults cry. The sound of crying is not as important as what we see when someone cries. In early human groups, crying may have helped people trust each other and feel close.
People cry for different reasons. We may cry when we feel sad for someone who is treated unfairly. Sometimes, we cry when we hear beautiful music or see a touching speech. We might also cry when we watch a sad movie, especially when we are with other people. 
Crying is important in social situations, and scientists are still studying it."
CPE_27,C2,"The Heat is On**
We all know about global warming. It means the Earth is getting warmer. But how much warmer will it get? And how will it change our lives? Many people have some idea about global warming, but they are not sure what will happen because of it.
A warmer Earth will change the weather everywhere. This will affect plants, animals, water, and soil. Humans use these natural resources to grow food, build cities, and live. If these resources change, it is a big problem.
In the last 100 years, human actions have made the air warmer by adding gases. These gases are connected to global warming. Scientists say that the Earth has warmed by about 6 degrees Celsius in the last century. They think this is not just natural and is partly because of pollution.
Scientists use computers to predict what will happen with the climate. They use special programs to look at temperature, pressure, and other factors. But these predictions are not always correct, and they can be slow and expensive.
Most people agree that climate change will happen faster than before. Predictions say that by the year 2100, the average temperature will go up by 1 to 3.5 degrees Celsius. The sea level will rise by 15 to 95 centimeters. There will also be more extreme weather, like heatwaves, floods, and droughts.
These changes can affect where plants and animals live. They can also change how we get food and water. Some areas may have big problems, but some changes might be good. For example, in Australia, wheat production has increased because of warmer temperatures.
However, small changes in climate can also cause water shortages. This is a big problem in dry areas. In places like the Mediterranean, there has been less rain in recent years.
Another problem is that glaciers are melting. This can change the environment and affect animals and people. The Arctic ice is melting, which can make it easier for ships to travel but also creates dangers.
The most serious effect of global warming is rising sea levels. Warmer water takes up more space, and melting ice adds to this. Many people live near the coast, so rising sea levels can cause flooding. Cities like London, New York, and Tokyo could be affected. Many people could lose their homes.
Small island countries are at the greatest risk. If sea levels rise too much, these islands could disappear. This would be a big loss for the people and their culture. It would also create many refugees who need new homes."

Dennis Tito, a rich man, wants to send a spaceship on 5 January 2018. The spaceship will go to 160 km above Mars. It will use Mars' gravity to come back to Earth without using much fuel. This is important because the next time Mars and Earth are close is in 2031. 
It is a big job, and new technology is needed. If the technology is ready, the spaceship might go. Even if it does not go, the work will help for future trips to space.'"
CPE_44,C2,"Aesthetics**
Art is important in our lives. It includes things like buildings, books, paintings, and statues. People often think of art as just these objects, but art is more than that. It is about how we feel and experience these objects.
Sometimes, people admire art so much that they forget how it connects to everyday life. When art becomes very famous, it can seem separate from the real world. This makes it hard to understand what art really means.
To understand art better, we need to look at our daily experiences. Just like mountains are part of the earth, art is part of our lives. We can enjoy flowers without knowing much about them, but to really understand them, we need to learn about how they grow.
Many people enjoy things like movies, music, and comics, but they do not always think of these as art. When art is only in museums, people may forget to enjoy the art around them in everyday life. 
To appreciate art, we should connect it to our daily experiences. When we see art in our lives, we can enjoy it more."
CPE_22,C2,"Observing Lions**
Lions are big cats that live in groups. They hunt together to find food. When the sun sets, lions quietly move to catch their prey. They work as a team to get their next meal. 
In 1978, researchers wanted to learn why lions hunt together, take care of their young, and scare away other animals with their loud roars. They thought that working together would help lions survive better. But they found out that sometimes, being too nice can be a problem. If one lion helps too much, it may not get enough food.
Lions are very good at resting and doing nothing. This made it hard for researchers to learn about their behavior. Lions can live for about 18 years, so it took a long time to find answers.
**"
CPE_39,C2,"Advertising Problems**
If you work in advertising, the early 1990s were very hard. There was a big recession. This means that many businesses had problems. In Britain, in 1991, many people lost their jobs, and many homes were taken away because people could not pay for them. Many businesses, like car and building companies, lost a lot of money.
People in advertising also lost their jobs, but those who kept their jobs felt a lot of pressure. They had to do more work with less money. They were told to do better work with smaller budgets. At the same time, companies started to think more about what their customers wanted. They wanted to make products that people liked, not just what was easy for them to make.
Because of this, advertising became more important. Many companies started to pay more attention to advertising. They wanted to know if their advertising was working. They wanted to see results for the money they spent. But many companies were not sure if advertising was worth the money. They wanted better ideas and better advertising.
Even though advertising people were busy, they had to find ways to make good ads with less money. There were many challenges. Some were because of the recession, like high production costs. Others were changes in society, like new shopping habits and new laws about advertising. 
Now, more than ever, advertising people need to show that their ads work. But it is hard to find help or good information about how to make better ads. Many companies are too busy to talk about their problems. Those who are doing well often keep their success a secret. This means that there are not many good books or resources to help people in advertising. 
**Questions:**
1. What was hard for advertising workers in the early 1990s?
2. What happened to many people in Britain in 1991?
3. What did companies want to know about their advertising?
4. Why is it hard for advertising people to find help now?
5. What do many companies keep secret?"
CPE_18,C2,"**The Kitchen**
When I was in university, I wanted to be a chef. This was not a common choice. Many people wanted different jobs. Being a chef is hard work. Chefs work long hours and do not earn much money. But I still wanted to be a chef. I was not happy at university. The work was difficult, and the people were not friendly. Cooking seemed like a good way to be happy. 
I remember the first time I ate at a famous restaurant in London. The food was amazing! I loved it so much that I wanted to learn how to cook like that. I started to read cookbooks and practice cooking. I wanted to be a chef more than anything else.
**The Swimming Instructor**
The swimming teacher was a small man with strong arms and tattoos. When I asked him to teach me how to dive, he told me to sit on the edge of the pool, put my hands above my head, and jump in. I practiced this until my time was up. The next time, he made me stand up and dive from the edge. He was strict and told me what to do: ""Look up!"" ""Keep your legs straight!"" 
One week, I went to the high diving board. It was very high! I felt scared but I tried to be brave. I jumped off and for a moment, I felt like I was flying. But when I hit the water, I fell awkwardly. The teacher looked unhappy, but I felt very happy. I understood what it means to be ""free as a bird.""
**The Traveller**
Some people love to travel. They like to explore new places and take risks. They climb high mountains and sail on the ocean. They eat strange food and live in different ways. Some people think these travelers are strange. They live in a world that is very different from ours. We like our comfortable homes and safe lives. 
**Sailing**
Jonathan Raban is a writer who is afraid of the sea, but he spends a lot of time on it. He is not the best sailor, but he knows how to sail. He likes to write about his sailing adventures. His small boat has a device that tells him where he is on the sea. 
Raban thinks that using a compass is not good. He believes it makes sailors forget to look at the waves and feel the sea. He thinks the ocean used to be full of life, but now it is just a big space. Because of this, a machine can help steer the boat, and sailors do not need to pay attention as much. This is why Raban has time to watch the waves carefully."
CPE_62,C2,"Holiday Reading**
Summer is a time for two great joys: going on holiday and reading books. These joys are connected. Books can help us feel at home in the world. We can see our own experiences in the stories of others. Authors use words to describe feelings and situations that we may think we are alone in. They can express our thoughts clearly, helping us understand ourselves better. 
When we read a good book or travel to a new place, we see things differently. At first, we notice many details, like the colors of the sky or the expressions on people's faces. We may even feel emotions we didn’t know we had before.
**Author's Note**
These thoughts about travel were published in the Observer newspaper over seven years. I made some small changes to fit the articles, but I kept most of the original text. Sometimes I corrected mistakes, but I did not change the main ideas. 
Traveling has changed a lot. Now, many people can travel anywhere with just a ticket. I believe that travelers are not blind to the world around them. Even a postcard can have a purpose.
**Ecotourism**
The word ""ecotourism"" is often used but not always correctly. It started in the 1980s when people became more aware of the environment. Tour operators saw that many travelers wanted to travel without harming nature. Now, ""ecotourism"" can mean many things, from living with remote tribes to short boat trips. Many tours that include nature or culture are called ecotourism. The original idea was good, but now it is confusing because there are no clear rules.
**Transylvanian Journey**
I lost my notebook about my trip to Transylvania for 50 years. I found it again a few years ago, and it helped me remember that time. In Transylvania, I had a great time, staying in friendly homes for weeks. I thought I had nothing to write about because I was enjoying myself. When I moved to a new place, I sometimes forgot to write. I worried that my notes were not in order, but I decided it was okay. I let the story tell itself without too many worries."
CPE_49,C2,"Fashion and Writing**
**Fashion**  
Fashion is often seen as something new. Many people think it started in the 1800s and 1900s. But fashion has a long history. Some historians say fashion began in the 1500s and 1600s when trade grew. As societies grew and changed, more types of clothes were made. This made the meaning of clothes more complex. For example, a man's suit can mean different things to different people.
**Writing**  
Many people think that all writers are famous and rich. But this is not true for most writers. Some writers have other jobs and write in the evenings. They need money to live. Others, like me, do different jobs, like teaching and writing articles. I have heard of a job in a chocolate factory for writing, but I never got that job. Still, I manage to write my novel by working part-time and using credit cards. 
**Sudden Fame**  
When we started performing, many people came to see us. We had to use secret doors to avoid fans. On days we did not work, it was hard to go outside without being followed by fans. In a few days, we became famous. Our fans watched us, and our managers took care of us. I felt shy, but I also felt a strange confidence. I was not used to this new life."
CPE_31,C2,"Music - The Future**
Technology is changing our lives. Susan Hallam talks about how this affects music in Britain. In the late 20th century, people had more ways to listen to music. They could use radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, and videos. But, there are fewer live music performances and fewer jobs for musicians.
Many people believe that music will always be important. Music is part of big events in the country. It also helps people in many ways. A world without music is hard to imagine. The question is not if there will be music in the 21st century, but what kind of music it will be. 
The music industry is very important in Britain. It helps people get jobs, especially in media. Playing music can also help children learn better. Research shows that making music can help with thinking skills. Group music lessons can help children make friends and focus better in school.
Playing an instrument can help people learn good habits, like being on time and staying organized. Because of this, more people will want to learn instruments in the future. 
In the future, people will listen to many different kinds of music. New styles will mix together. Technology will also help people make music. This means that fewer live performances may happen, but more people will want to make music together in their communities.
To prepare for this future, music teachers need to change how they teach. They should help more people learn different instruments at all ages. Music education will need to include many skills. 
Musicians will need to learn how to teach and inspire people of all ages. They will also need to work well with different groups and learn how to manage community projects. This is a big change from how things are done now.
Finally, we need to show how important music is in our lives. Music is often taken for granted. Everyone in the music world should work together to make sure people understand its value."
CPE_58,C2,"**The Actor's Craft**
Sometimes, people do not like actors. This can happen when actors talk about their work in interviews. Instead of saying something interesting, they often use boring phrases or talk about gossip. 
An actor named Paul Scofield said that acting is special when it happens on stage. He believed that talking about acting makes it less interesting. Each time an actor performs, they start fresh and learn new things. After a play, they may feel empty until the next performance.
**A Review of Hamlet**
Adrian Lester plays Hamlet. He is a young man who is both a boy and a man. His performance is simple but very good. He shows a lot of control and confidence. Lester plays a young man who feels angry but also has a sense of humor. His acting is very impressive.
**What is Acting?**
Acting is about how people behave. It can be like copying someone or showing feelings. The big question is: what makes actors move and feel on stage?
**A Director's Rehearsal Process**
One director has a special way to start rehearsals called ""dropping in."" The stage manager shows the script on a screen. The actors listen quietly. When it is their turn to speak, they think about the words and what they mean. They wait for a feeling or idea before they speak. For example, if the line is about waiting in the rain, they might remember a time they waited in a line. This helps them find the right way to say the line.
**The Perfect Theatre**
A perfect theatre makes you feel important. When you go to see a play, it should feel special. The people who work at the theatre should care about the audience. The audience should be close enough to see and hear everything. The size of the theatre is important too. It should fit the actors and the audience well. 
Some old theatres are nice because they feel like they have history. When you go to the theatre, you want to see something new and surprising. If it is not surprising, you might as well stay home."

**Paul Simon**  
Rock and roll in the 1950s was music for young people. It was very important for many people, especially for the middle class. This music helped new rock stars to grow. They listened to this exciting music and knew it would change their lives. For Paul Simon and other young people in the US, the best way to hear this new music was from a radio show called Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party by Alan Freed. Many young rock stars listened to this show. Like John Lennon, who lived far away in Liverpool, Paul Simon loved the music from Freed's show. He wanted to go from just listening to music to making his own music.
**Snow**  
I could not see a path, but I thought I would be okay if I was careful. The wind was very strong, and it pushed me over on the ice. Suddenly, the snow under me broke, and I fell into a hole that was about four feet deep. The snow had covered a space between two rocks. I climbed out of the hole, feeling scared. I wondered what would happen if the hole was much deeper. I sat against a pine tree that was sticking out of the snow to think. In one hour, I walked about half a mile. I knew I had to change my plan.
**Qualitative Research**  
There are many books that help researchers with qualitative research. These books talk a lot about collecting data, but they do not say much about how to analyze the data. Many people do not understand how researchers analyze their data. So, we asked different social scientists who have done qualitative research to talk about their methods. We wanted to share their ideas about analyzing data, not to make a guidebook for new researchers. This is not easy to do. We let our contributors share their work in different ways, like personal stories and more formal writing."
CPE_2,C2,"Screen Learning**
A few days ago, I saw my six-year-old son eating noodles in a funny way. He was pulling them up with his teeth and pretending to be a dinosaur. ""I am a little dinosaur,"" he said. He was acting like a character from a TV show. I asked him what he knew about dinosaurs, but he did not know much.
Many people like to use the internet and computers for learning. But is learning from a screen good? One father tried an interactive program with his son. The father read the words while the son played with the pictures. The father thought that if his son had read a book for ten minutes, he might have learned something.
Research shows that children learn better when they talk with teachers or parents. Learning needs help from others. It is good to use new technology to teach our children, but traditional education is still very important.
**Hollywood**
By 1918, most movies in the world were made in Hollywood. People who lived there did not like this change. They thought Hollywood was becoming a bad place. But in the end, people liked the idea of success. Success means making a lot of money from movies.
Hollywood has changed a lot. It went from a small village to a famous town like New York or Paris. A long time ago, you could walk through orange trees to get to the store. Now, it is very different, but it still feels like a small village. People in Hollywood talk a lot about movies: how much money they make, who is dating who, and what projects they are working on. Many successful people want to live somewhere else but still work in Hollywood. It is a special place for everyone in show business.
**Photography**
Photography was created by artists in the 1800s. They wanted to keep a real record of what they saw. With new tools, they could make pictures that looked very real and detailed. This made other artists worried. They thought photography could not be real art because it used machines.
But photographers believed they had found a new way to express themselves. They used cameras like other artists use brushes and pencils to show the world and nature.
**Book Illustration**
In the past, every children's book had pictures. This was also true for many novels for older children. There were many children's books, but most were made with a small budget. Some work was not very good, but the best artists always did their best.
The collection of black-and-white illustrations is a mix of good and not-so-good work. It is a great place to find interesting things and learn about art. Some of these treasures will be shown to the public again, either through new books or exhibitions. There are signs that this is starting to happen, and soon, we may see classic children's book illustrations again."
CPE_68,C2,"Blogging: Sharing Online**
A long time ago, a website talked about the risks of telling people where you are online. When you say, ""I am here,"" you are also telling many people about your life. Some of these people may not be nice. This shows that sharing a lot online can have problems.
Many people want to share their lives on the internet. They think it can bring them money or fame. But sometimes, sharing too much can be dangerous. In the past, some people, called bloggers, shared their lives online. They learned many lessons about sharing.
In January 1994, a 19-year-old student named Justin Hall started sharing his life on the web. At that time, the internet was new and mostly used by students and scientists. Hall wanted to share his story. He wrote a blog every day, and many people read it. He wrote about everything in his life.
One day, Hall had to stop his blog because he fell in love. His partner said he could not write about their relationship. Hall felt sad because sharing his life made people not trust him.
In 2002, a woman named Heather Armstrong had a blog called Dooce. She wrote about her job. One day, someone at her work sent her blog link to her bosses. Because of this, she lost her job. This shows that what we say online can affect our real lives.
Armstrong was sad but later got married and started her blog again. Now, she writes about her family and is very popular. She learned that we can say many things online, but we should be careful about what we share."
CPE_23,C2,"Enough Sleep?**
Many people today feel tired. In rich and busy countries, many people do not sleep well. In the USA, 40 million people have problems with sleep. Some books in Britain talk about people who cannot sleep. 
A sleep expert says, ""People need more sleep."" When people are busy, they sleep less. They wake up early to avoid traffic. 
One sleep expert did an experiment. He let people sleep for 14 hours a night for a month. After three weeks, they slept about 8 hours a night. This shows they needed more sleep.
In Europe, a university studies sleep. They look at how tiredness affects sailors and how noise at airports disturbs sleep. They also study how tired drivers can be dangerous. 
For their studies, they ask students to help. Students get paid £5 an hour. They change their sleep patterns based on instructions. Dr. Louise Reyner helps them feel safe. Some people worry because they wear special equipment on their heads. But the scientists are only looking at how the body works.
In a dark room, there is a driving simulator. The students come at 2 PM, a time when people often feel sleepy. They drive while answering questions. The road looks long and bright. 
The young men say they will not fall asleep. But Dr. Reyner has a video of one man trying to stay awake. At first, he sits up straight. Then, he starts to blink and nod off. He falls asleep for a few seconds and wakes up suddenly. The car goes off the road. 
Dr. Reyner says coffee can help. Two cups can keep you awake for a while. She suggests energy drinks and gum for alertness. 
Scientists know that humans sleep in cycles. When we sleep, we go through four stages, from light sleep to deep sleep. We dream during light sleep. Our body stays still to keep us safe. 
Scientists think sleep helps our bodies heal and rest. Women usually sleep longer than men. Older people need less sleep, but no one knows why. 
Some researchers say sleep helps us travel through time safely. In the past, people slept differently. A history professor found that in Britain from 1500 to 1850, people went to bed early, woke up after midnight, and then went back to sleep. This time was good for thinking and remembering dreams. 
By the 17th century, rich people started to sleep less and work more. The industrial revolution made people work longer hours. 
In some places in the world, people still do not have set bedtimes. They sleep for a few hours, then wake up. For some tribes, noise and the need to watch for danger make it hard to sleep all night. 
It seems that people everywhere need more sleep."
CPE_60,C2,"
I am wearing big cowboy boots. They cost a lot of money. I am standing on rocks in the Arizona desert. I have a cowboy outfit, but I am not a cowboy. I look at the mountains and feel out of place. I flew in from Denver early in the morning. I thought I looked like a cowboy, but then I saw a real cowboy at the airport. He looked very different from me. 
I used to be a racing driver. I loved it. But now I do not race anymore. I wonder what I can do now. I thought I could be a commentator for races, but many people want that job. I also thought about selling classic cars, but that did not work out. 
Being an ""ex"" is hard. People do not want to hear about my past. They do not want to hear that I was almost a champion. I had a good time racing and made money, but I miss it. I miss the fast cars and the excitement. 
Now, I have a lot of free time. I looked at the blue sky. There were no big birds flying. I saw some small brown birds in a cactus. They seemed to want me to leave. I did not know there were songbirds in the desert. I realized that I have a lot to learn about being here. 
**Questions:**
1. What kind of boots is the person wearing?
2. Where is the person standing?
3. What did the person used to be?
4. What did the person think about being a commentator?
5. How does the person feel about their past?"
CPE_1,C2,"Vancouver**
In the last ten years, many people from all over the world have moved to Vancouver, in western Canada. In the evening, people walk in the city streets. If you walk with them, you can hear many different languages. People come to Vancouver because it has nice weather, beautiful views of the ocean and mountains, a clean and safe place to live, and good schools and jobs. Some people do not like how fast new buildings are being built, but many agree that new people and tourists have helped the city grow.

**Citizen Kane**  
The film *Citizen Kane* came out in 1941. Many people talked about it, but it did not make a lot of money at first. Later, it became popular again on television. This film inspired many people to make their own films. This is surprising because it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles said that he did not know what he could or could not do, so he just made the film his way. He had a great team with him, including cameraman Gregg Toland and screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz. Welles and Mankiewicz had the idea to show a newspaper owner who was like Hearst. Welles thought this was a great chance for him as a director and actor.
**Dermot and Carmel**  
Dermot thought Carmel was a bit strange that morning. He said twice that he might be late and might stop at the golf club. He wanted to talk to someone there. Carmel nodded her head but seemed not to really hear him. He asked her, ""Will you be okay? What will you do today?"" She smiled and said, ""Funny you ask. I have nothing to do, so I will walk downtown and look at the shops. I feel like it is a little wrong to waste the day."" Dermot smiled back and said, ""You should enjoy yourself. If I am late, I will not want to eat. So, don’t worry."" She replied, ""No, that’s fine.""
**Job Titles**  
A recent study says that job titles can make people unhappy at work. A survey found that 90% of bosses and 70% of workers think titles create problems between colleagues. Most surprisingly, 70% of office workers would give up a pay rise for a better job title. People do not want to be called ""subordinate"" anymore. The titles people want sound nice (like ""specialist"" or ""coordinator""), but they often mean the same thing."
CPE_55,C2,"**The Vienna Assignment**
I was in Vienna to take photographs. This was my job and my passion. I loved how light fell on things. A single picture could show a moment in time, a city, or a person. I always hoped to take the perfect photograph. I had my camera ready and kept looking for good shots.
Once, I took a picture of smoke from a burning oil well. It was a great photo, and many newspapers wanted it. After that, I worked for myself. I thought it was a smart choice, but life had other plans. The mid-nineties were not as successful as I hoped. That is why I was in Vienna, not somewhere more exciting. But I was still taking photographs, and I was getting paid. 
I got this job by chance. I had taken pictures in London for a book called ""Four Cities in Four Seasons."" The publishers liked my work. When the Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, left the job in Vienna, they asked me to take his place. I was happy to go because things were not good at home. A week in snowy Vienna sounded great.
I stayed at the Europa hotel in the old city. I had visited Vienna before with my wife, but it was a busy trip. This time, I was alone, and I felt it would be different. When I arrived, I saw the beautiful pink-grey dome over the snowy roofs. I was excited to take great pictures.
On my first day, I just rode the trams around the city. I wanted to feel the place. The weather was cold, and the city looked beautiful. I didn’t want to see what Rudi had done. This was going to be my Vienna.
A photograph is a moment in time. You have to wait for the right moment. So, I looked and waited. The next morning, I went out early. The snow made Stephansplatz look very pretty and quiet. I wanted to take a picture of the big cathedral, but it was hard to fit it all in one shot. It was tall and wide. I knew I would have to take a different kind of picture.
Photography is magical. You can watch a blank piece of paper turn into a photograph. Even when you understand how it works, it still feels mysterious. That morning at Stephansplatz, something surprising happened, but I was ready for it."

**Kinetic Art**
Good news! The Hayward Gallery in London is now a fun place to visit. It has a new exhibition about kinetic art. Kinetic art is art that moves or shows movement. This exhibition looks at kinetic art from the last 60 years. It shows that many artists have made moving art, even if people do not always notice it.
The exhibition has many paintings, drawings, documents, and films about kinetic art. The curator, Guy Brett, has studied this art for a long time. There are not many texts, so visitors can enjoy the art and make their own discoveries.
**David Hockney**
David Hockney is a popular artist. Many people like his work because it is easy to understand. His art often shows fun and relaxing moments. Some people like Hockney not just for his art but also for his funny personality. Some critics say Hockney is not a great artist. But others think he is good because he is popular. Hockney knows his art is not perfect, and he believes that only time will tell how good his work really is.
**Window-shopping - an Art Exhibition**
In the last few years, I have seen many art exhibitions. Some are great, and some are not so good. I do not like exhibitions that try to show a common idea among artists. Sometimes this works, but often it does not. So, I decided to create a different exhibition called ""Window-shopping."" 
I worked with seven artists in an empty warehouse. This exhibition showed different artworks that were connected only because they are all art. For example, Sam Cole made knitted cats that run around on a toy train track. Matthew Crawley made a video of him breaking a camera. These artworks are very different, but they can be together in one show.
**Art History**
Many people enjoy looking at paintings, but they may not want to think too much about them. Some art historians focus on theory and forget the joy of looking at art. This is like knowing how to cook a dish but not enjoying the taste. 
It is important to enjoy art, but knowing more about it can also make it more enjoyable. What we like about art can change over time and is influenced by our society. While feelings about art are important, thinking about art is also valuable."
CPE_25,C2,"Metals and St Ives**
**Metals**  
A long time ago, people in the Stone Age liked shiny things. One day, a person sat by a river and found a shiny yellow stone. It was not like other stones. This stone was gold. People liked gold because it was soft and easy to shape. They also found copper. They learned that copper could make strong tools. So, they started to look for copper and learned how to use it. 
**St Ives**  
We walked down a narrow, cobbled street to the town of St Ives. The wind was very strong, and the waves were big. There were no people outside, and all the windows were closed. We saw the weather get worse as we arrived on a small train. The sky was grey, and I thought visiting Cornwall without a car was not a good idea. I had told my friend we would walk by the beautiful coast and enjoy warm evenings by the fire.
**Computer Modelling**  
Studying the past is hard because it is gone. The people who lived long ago are not here now. We cannot see what they did or how they lived. Archaeology gives us some clues, but we cannot test our ideas with real experiments. However, we can use computer modelling. This means we can create pictures of old places and make virtual people. We can see how they might live and react to changes, like more rain or more people."

**Vervet Monkeys**  
Cheney and Seyfarth studied vervet monkeys. One day, the strong male monkey saw a strange male monkey near their trees. The strange monkey wanted to join their group. If he joined, the strong male could lose his place. To keep the strange monkey away, the strong male made a loud alarm call. This call means there is a leopard nearby. The strange monkey ran back to the trees. The strong male did this many times. But then, he made a mistake. He called out the alarm while walking across the ground. 
**Cats and Their Prey**  
In a village in England, people counted what their cats caught. In one year, seventy cats caught over 1,000 animals. A professor in America thought that all cats in Britain could catch 100 million birds and small animals each year! But this is not true. Most cats live in towns and catch fewer animals. The important question is: can the bird population survive? Yes, it can. In winter, people feed birds, and there are many places for birds to nest. So, cats are hunters, but they do not hurt the bird population too much.
**Buffalo's Day**  
Buffaloes are very important for the marshman. Every morning, the buffaloes leave their sleeping place slowly. They make sad sounds as they walk to the water. They stand at the edge for a long time, tired. Finally, the leader goes into the water. Once in the water, they relax and forget what they were doing. They swim slowly, looking tired. They spend the day in the reeds, eating green plants.
**Picasso**  
Pablo Picasso painted many things around him. In early spring 1940, he painted fish while in a fishing town. The painting shows a fish market with a crab and some fish on a scale. The fish look alive. The painting is hard to read because Picasso used a flat style with many colors. It looks calm, like underwater. But there is a feeling of danger because the fish look like they are fighting the crab. The painting shows both calmness and tension."
CPE_12,C2,"Photography**
Photography is a way to take pictures of people, places, and events. It has been around for about 180 years. People use photography to show many things in life. It helps us see moments that are quick and things that are very big or very small. We can see pictures from faraway places and learn about different cultures and problems in the world.
Before photography, people made pictures a long time ago. The first pictures were made about 35,000 years ago in caves. We do not know exactly why they made these pictures. They could have been for hunting, for religion, or just to make their homes look nice. Pictures have always been important in human culture.
When photography was invented in the 1800s, it was exciting. People thought it could show the truth. The camera works like our eyes and can take a picture of what we see. This made photography special because it could capture real moments.
Some people believe that everyone can understand photographs, no matter where they are from. For example, a person living far away could understand a picture of the sun and moon. But as the world changed, we started to wonder if everyone really sees photographs the same way.
Photography is often seen as a clear way to show reality. For example, when someone shows a picture and says, ""This is my grandson,"" it feels very real. Since photography started in 1839, people’s ideas about it have changed a lot. 
At first, photographs were just for remembering things. Now, they are also important historical documents. They tell us about the people and the time when the picture was taken. 
Photography can also help bring change in society. For example, during the Italian Renaissance, new ways of seeing and making pictures changed art and culture. Today, photography is a big part of our media and helps us see the world’s problems."
CPE_26,C2,"**How to Write Poetry**
Writing poetry is fun, but it can be hard. It is important to read a lot and write a lot. This helps you think of new ideas. Some people write poems when they feel safe. Others write when they are sad. Some people write poems every day. Others wait for a good idea. All ways are good if they help you write.
**The Short Story**
In a short story, you should not have too many characters or too much detail. Flashbacks should be short and only used when needed. A flashback is when a character remembers something important. This can help the story move forward. Talking between characters is also important. It can show different sides of a story quickly. Too many words can make a short story boring. In a short story, every word should be important.
**Screenplays**
Writing a screenplay for a film is like playing chess. In chess, you make moves without knowing what will happen next. You learn to see the whole game, not just one move. The more you play chess, the better you understand it. Writing a screenplay is similar. You need to see the big picture and understand how the story works.
**Looking at Writing**
People naturally learn to speak, but writing is different. Children learn to talk without help, but they do not learn to write easily. Writing systems were created a long time ago and are not easy to learn. Many children today still find it hard to read and write. Writing is something we learn, while speaking is something we do naturally. We need to understand how writing works and how to help children learn it."
CPE_8,C2,"""I am writing a book. I feel unsure about it. I call it a novel, but I am not sure if it is really a novel. I do not have a big story to tell. There is no wedding or death in my story. I leave the reader wondering. This book is about a man I met many times, but I do not know much about his life. I could make up stories to fill in the gaps, but I do not want to do that. I just want to share what I know.
To protect people who are still alive, I have changed the names of the people in my story. The man I write about is not famous. Maybe he will never be famous. When he dies, he might not be remembered at all. My book may only be interesting for some people. But maybe his life and character will inspire others. After he is gone, people might see that he was special.
I think my book will help people who want to write about my friend. I do not say that my conversations are exact. I did not write down what was said, but I remember well. I have used my own words to tell what I think was said. Sometimes, I have imagined what people might have said to make the story more lively. I want people to enjoy reading my book.
Another reason I feel unsure is that the people in my story are from a different culture. It is hard to really know people from another country. People are shaped by where they are from, the games they played, the food they ate, and the schools they went to. You can only understand these things if you have lived them. Because I do not know these people well, it is hard to write about them in a believable way.
I usually write about people from my own country. If I write about others in short stories, it is easier because I can give quick details. In this book, I do not say that my characters see themselves the same way I see them. They are seen through my eyes."""
CPE_4,C2,"**POETRY RECITALS**
Poetry recitals are events where people read poems aloud. Many people enjoy these events. There are different types of poets. Some poets write poems for books. They want people to read their poems on the page. Other poets like to perform their poems in front of an audience. They enjoy reading their poems out loud.
In the last twenty years, poetry readings have become more popular. Many places have these events. Small groups in towns hold poetry readings in community centers or homes. Schools invite poets to read to students. Arts festivals also have poetry readings with famous poets.
For poets who perform, reading their work to an audience is good. Their poems are often simple and easy to understand. People can enjoy them right away. But for poets who write complex poems, it can be harder. Many people may not understand their work if they hear it for the first time. These poets might choose to read their easiest poems, which may not show their best work.
Listening to poetry readings is fun and can help people understand poetry better. It is good to read the poems while listening or to know the poems before the reading. Poetry readings can help people enjoy poetry and see that it is for everyone, not just a few special people."
CPE_30,C2,"**Oral History**  
Oral history is when historians use stories from people to learn about the past. This can be hard because what someone remembers is not always true. When a historian talks to someone, both people can change how they feel and what they say. The historian chooses who to talk to and what to ask about. Even if the historian just listens, their presence can change the way the other person remembers things. The memories can also be affected by other things, like what people see on TV or how they feel about their past. Sometimes, people remember things differently because of their feelings now, not just what happened before.
**Animal Science**  
Animal science has two main ways to study animals: the body and the whole animal. Scientists who study the body look at how the body works, like how nerves and muscles help animals behave. Those who study the whole animal look at how animals act in their natural homes. There are two types of scientists in this area: psychologists and ethologists. Psychologists study how some animals, like rats and pigeons, learn in labs. Ethologists study how animals behave in the wild without learning. Both types of scientists are now working together more. It is important to study animal behavior in a way that makes sense, not just by looking at tiny parts of the body.
**The Social Sciences**  
When students start studying social sciences, they have to learn two things at once. They need to understand the subject and also how to study it. This means they learn not just facts but also how to find and organize information. Social sciences are about people and society, but they are more than just common sense. Each social science looks at different parts of social life and uses special methods to study them. These methods and ideas help scientists understand society better and make each subject unique.
**Classical Architecture**  
In ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building. The Roman architect Vitruvius said architecture is about order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, and distribution. He did not talk about how useful a building is at first, but he later explained how to design buildings for different needs. The beginnings of classical architecture are complicated. Before the grand buildings, there were simple homes made of basic materials. These simple homes helped shape the later, more artistic buildings. Even though classical temples look fancy, they are based on simple, one-room huts."

Lily and her sister, Mui, kept a secret from Chen. Lily was learning to drive. She drove around the gardens and the train tracks. One time, she drove over a small bridge and bumped the car. Chen found out and was happy. He said, ""You can drive, Lily! Good job!"" Mui thought it was strange. Chen should be upset, but he was excited to make plans with Lily to go out driving. They chose a Monday next month. It was a quiet day, so they would leave early and come back by noon. Lily would practice driving before that.
Mui bought a road map. She got a discount, and Chen was impressed. But Lily felt bad because Mui did not trust her to find the way. Soon, they were at the beach. Lily drove very well. Mui sat in the back and watched. Chen even clapped for her. They drove past the gasworks and the lagoon with small boats. Lily parked the car in a quiet street. She was not sure about the parking signs, so she paid to avoid problems.
Lily locked the car doors. Chen joked, ""No one will want this old car."" The sisters were not happy. Lily told Chen he was ungrateful. Mui told him to be careful about what he said. Chen took their son, Man Kee, to see the sea. Man Kee was warm and soft. He put his little hand on Chen's sleeve. Chen thought about how to raise Man Kee. He wanted him to learn about business and own restaurants.
Chen looked at the sea and felt thoughtful. He saw smoke on the horizon and a ship. He used a telescope to look at it. At first, he could not find it, but then he did. It was a small, old ship. Chen lifted Man Kee to see. ""Do you see the ship, Son?"" he asked. ""It is special for us. It will take us home one day."" Chen kissed Man Kee's head. Lily and Mui came to see too. Man Kee did not want to give up the telescope. When he finally did, the ship was gone, and all Lily could see were seagulls flying."
CPE_43,C2,"**The Well**
I read that if you go deep enough into a hole, you can see the stars when it is clear. I asked you to help me with my idea. You watched me as I pulled up the well bucket. I climbed into the bucket and told you to let me down. I did not think about how heavy the bucket was or that you might not be strong enough. You held the handle while I pushed the bucket away from the wall. I fell into the well. I hit my head. At first, I saw strange lights. Later, I thought about how cartoon characters see stars when they hit their heads.
At first, I was confused, then scared, then relieved. I was also angry at you for letting me fall and worried about what my mother would say. You called down to me, asking if I was okay. I wanted to shout, but then I heard panic in your voice. I stayed quiet and watched you through my eyelashes. You ran away to get help. I waited a moment, then climbed back up and pulled myself out of the well. I landed on the ground and heard loud voices from the castle. I ran away to hide in the shadows.
My mother and father came with you and old Arthur. My mother was screaming. My father told Arthur to pull the winch handle. You looked pale and shocked. I was hiding in the shadows. I felt a strange happiness. Then I saw drops of water on the ground from my wet clothes. I looked in fear at the dark spots on the dry ground. I looked back at the courtyard where my father was shining a flashlight into the well. I could not believe no one saw the drops.
My mother was screaming loudly. I felt scared. I had played a trick on you, but now it was serious. I thought I would get in trouble. I wished I had thought more about my plan. I decided to come out of hiding. I stepped out and called out softly. When no one heard me, I yelled louder. I pretended to fall on the ground. I sat up and said I found a secret tunnel from the well to the moat. I said I crawled through it and came out.
I thought I was almost safe until my father came to me. He wanted me to tell my story again. I did, but I was nervous. He looked at me closely. I said the secret tunnel fell in after me and that the well was dangerous. I looked into my father's eyes, and it felt like he was seeing me for the first time. My words got stuck in my throat. 
“Don’t be ridiculous, boy,” he said. He walked away. Arthur looked at me with a sad face. He seemed worried about me because he knew I was lying. I felt bad about my lie and what my father thought of me."

Susan's house is very nice. It has four floors and looks at a small harbour. She remembers the years she spent there with her children. When they bought the house, her son Robert, who was five years old, asked, ""Mum, how do you get a house home?"" 
Now, Robert is helping her move. He is making sure they take care of the piano. Francesca, her daughter, is also helping. She thinks she is the best person to take care of the piano. 
Fred, the removal man, says, ""She doesn't look like she's going to cry."" Susan asks, ""Do people cry?"" Fred replies, ""Yes, they do. They are happy while we work, but when they see the empty room, they cry."" Susan understands this feeling.
The piano is very special. It is in the best room of the house. They will take it last. Susan remembers when they brought the piano into the house. It got stuck on the stairs. The removal men worked hard for two hours to get it in. Robert watched, and Francesca cried, ""We can't live without a piano!"" 
Peter, Susan's late husband, helped solve the problem. They took out a window and used a crane to bring the piano inside. The children were very happy to see it. 
Now, Susan thinks about how her children are busy and do not come home often. She feels tired going up the stairs. She worries about the piano. Fred asks her if she is okay. 
Susan looks around and feels sad. She thinks about all the things in the house. They are important to her. Just then, the piano comes down the stairs. Fred is careful with it. 
When the piano is outside, Robert laughs. Susan and Francesca start laughing too. They are happy it is all over. They walk down the path together for the last time, laughing and feeling good. Susan's tears are now tears of laughter."

**Online Book Reviews for Everyone**
Anyone can write book reviews on the Internet. This idea started when the Internet became popular. At first, it was hard for some people to publish their thoughts because they needed some technical skills. But then, Amazon.com, a big online bookstore, made it easy for everyone to write reviews about books.
On Amazon, anyone can write what they think about a book and give it up to five stars. Each book has its own page, and when someone writes a review, it appears right away. This helps other readers see what people think about the book, not just what the publisher says.
Amazon is very popular, and many people write reviews every day. Because there are so many reviews, Amazon cannot check all of them. They have a team that looks for bad reviews, like those with bad words or personal attacks on the author. But many reviews are anonymous, so it is hard to know who wrote them.
Some authors write good reviews for their own books. For example, a writer named Lev Grossman was upset about bad reviews for his first book. He wrote good reviews for his own book without saying who he was. Later, he told people he did this, and Amazon removed his fake reviews.
Authors can also write comments about their books on Amazon. Most of them write nice messages asking people to read their books. Some even give their email addresses for readers to contact them. However, Amazon does not always check if the comments are really from the authors.
Sometimes, readers write angry reviews. For example, when a book called ""We've Got Spirit"" was published, some people mentioned in the book were upset and wrote bad reviews. Many of these reviews disappeared after a few days. But Amazon liked that many people were writing reviews because it was good for business.
Most reviews on Amazon are serious. They help other readers decide if a book is good to buy. A famous writer, George Orwell, once said that writing too many reviews can be hard. But it is good that everyone can share their thoughts about books now."

**Art Today**
In modern times, many people think that artists must be different from other people. We say that art should be new and special. We like to admire artists whose work was not liked a long time ago. But when we see art today, we often say it is too strange or not real art. The media also say this, and many people agree. We expect art to be new and different, so we forget that today’s art has old ideas and styles too.
In the past, people asked artists to make art for special reasons. Art was part of everyday life. Now, artists work alone, and sometimes we get upset if they want to make art that is not serious.
**A Situation**
I will tell you a story and ask a question. An artist picks a text from an art book. The text talks about different pictures and says there are many kinds of pictures. Then, the artist asks someone to make a canvas for him. He tells a sign painter to write the text on the canvas in simple letters. The sign painter does this. My question is: is this finished work a painting?
**Art and Success**
In London, there is a rule for painters: if you find a style that sells well, you should keep using it. People who buy art want to see the same style again and again. Some artists, like Picasso and Hockney, try new things and still do well. Eric Rimmington is another artist who is trying something new. He is making paintings about the London Underground instead of his usual still lifes. He has made 40 paintings and drawings that show the interesting world under the city.
**A Story from an Island**
I have come to this island with some books. I do not know why I say ""escape."" The villagers joke that only a sick person would come to this quiet place. I am here to heal myself. I am alone except for an old woman who comes to clean my house. I feel neither happy nor sad; I feel like I am floating in my memories.
I talked about how art seems useless, but I did not say how it can help us. Art helps us see the world in a new way. In art, we can find joy and understand our lives better. Artists can show the beauty in life, even when life is hard. Why do we hurt each other if we can create and understand through art?"
CPE_63,C2,"**Family Business**
""Look, this is not good!"" said my Dad. We were in the car going back to London. My father, with my brother Maurice, had just picked me up from my school. I had just won two prizes: one for Latin and one for my exams. My father talked with my headteacher, and now we were going home for the holidays.
""What isn't good?"" I asked, but I knew what he was thinking. My father usually talked a lot, but now he was quiet. ""You can't trick me. You will do what you want now,"" he said. ""You have all those certificates. I heard you will get a scholarship to Oxford.""
""So?"" I replied. ""Isn't that good?"" 
""I also heard you want to be a barrister,"" he said. ""A barrister!"" My father knew a lot about lawyers. 
""I just said that,"" I said. ""I didn't know what else to say!"" 
""And I heard you have the right personality. You can understand things quickly, you talk well, and you like to perform,"" he continued. 
""I don't know about that,"" I said. ""I only know what I see on TV."" 
""Anyway,"" he said, ""I think you will not want to join the family business. You will go to Oxford, and after that, I don't think you will want to work with us."" 
I felt trapped by what my family wanted. I saw many jobs I could do, and I wanted to explore them. But I didn't want to upset my father. I was not as scared of him as Maurice was - I was his favorite - but I still found him strong.
""It's too soon to know,"" I said weakly. 
""You will not want to join us,"" my father said. ""It's a pity because you have the skills."" 
""There's still Maurice,"" I said, unhappy. My father laughed. We both knew Maurice did not like the business. 
""Anyway,"" I said, ""you could use me as a consultant."" My mother was not around to help - she died when I was young, and my father raised me and Maurice. Maurice was two years younger than me, and I took care of him. I loved Maurice. 
Because the business was successful, we lived well - in a big house in London, good schools, nice clothes, and fun events. My father knew many people - politicians, actors, and businesspeople - and our house was always busy with interesting talks.
""I have an idea,"" my father said. ""You can help us during the holidays until you leave Oxford. Then if you want to leave, you can. It will give you some money and help me."" 
""OK,"" I said, happy to avoid making choices right now. I didn't want my father to be sad if I disagreed with him. This was how he controlled us. 
So, I helped out during my last term at school and during university vacations, but not too much. I became a smart student, with a small house, a nice car, and good clothes. 
In my last term, my father came to see me. He took me to a village for a meal and a talk. I had only a few weeks left. My teacher said I would get a First Class degree in Law, and I wanted to focus on my studies.
My father told me he needed me to do one last important job for the family business. ""It is very important,"" he said. ""I will make it worth your while.""
""But Dad,"" I said, ""I have my final exams soon. I need to focus on that. It is really important!"" 
I could see my father did not understand my pressure. He would think I was being unkind if I said no. As he explained the job, I saw how focused he was on his work. He was very good at what he did, and I admired him. 
It made my own plans seem less important. ""All right,"" I said. ""I will do it."""
CPE_56,C2,"
Simon Costello bought a house in Pembroke Square with his wife, Lois. After one year, he thought it was a mistake. They needed to save money, but at first, the house seemed like a good idea. Simon had many successful cases at work, and Lois returned to her job after having twins. She earned thirty-five thousand dollars a year. Lois wanted to move because their flat was too small for their family. They needed more space, a garden, and a place for a helper. 
Lois wanted to live in a nice area. She thought Mornington Mansions was not good enough for them. Lois decided that one of them should take public transport to save money. Simon had to take the train because Lois's job was far away. The train was crowded, and Simon often felt unhappy during the ride. He remembered his grandfather's house, where he felt safe and happy as a child. His grandmother took care of his grandfather after work. 
Lois wanted her job to be as important as Simon's. They needed both of their salaries to pay for the house and their lifestyle. Simon was worried about a woman named Venetia. She was angry when she came to their office. Venetia said that a man named Brian Cartwright accused Simon of doing something wrong in a trial four years ago. She asked Simon if it was true. Simon said it was not true, but he felt guilty. 
He remembered feeling scared when he was a child and got in trouble. He looked into Venetia's eyes and saw that she did not believe him. He wished he had said something different. He thought he should have told her that Cartwright was lying. But he did not say that, and now he was worried about his job. He was not sure what Venetia could do, but he knew it could be very bad for him if people heard the rumors."
CPE_36,C2,"
I chose this place to live because I thought I would be alone. I wanted to be with people who did not care about broken houses or messy gardens. But I was wrong. People in the shops see me, even if I do not see them. The flowers in my neighbor's garden remind me that gardens can be beautiful. 
I usually stay inside, but tonight I am watching the birds fly. I cut some plants to make space for a chair. My arms feel itchy from the plants. My garden is small, and the plants have to grow tall to live.
My neighbor, Jaz, is looking out of her window. She is a writer. I have her new story. ""How is your writing, Jaz?"" I ask. She says, ""In my job, people always ask me questions."" Then she says, ""I have a drink in the fridge. I will bring it down."" I do not want Jaz in my garden, and I see that it looks messy. Jaz knocks on my door. 
She sits in my garden and says, ""You are lucky to have a holiday."" I feel sad about the empty days of summer. I think about walking to the shops and sitting alone in the park. 
""Tomorrow, I will go to Stonebridge. Can you feed my cats?"" I ask Jaz. ""Yes, I will,"" she replies. ""Where will you stay?"" she asks. ""I will stay with my friend Ruby,"" I say. This is not true, but I often tell stories.
Jaz asks about her story, ""The Cruelty of Red Vans."" I like the title. I think red vans can be mean because they bring gifts to other people. I want to give Jaz some advice. ""Try writing about nice people,"" I say. She looks upset. ""I write in my journal about good things every day,"" I tell her. 
""Keep a journal? Get a life, Ann,"" she replies. I have a life. I work, and I go out sometimes. When we go inside, my kitchen feels calm. Then I remember my old teacher, Miss Tarrantine, who used to wink at us and say, ""I've had my moments."" We all laughed. 
---
**Questions:**
1. Why did the person choose this place to live?
2. What does the person usually do at home?
3. Who is Jaz?
4. What does Jaz bring down from her apartment?
5. What does the person think about summer?
6. Where is the person going tomorrow?
7. What is the title of Jaz's story?
8. What advice does the person give to Jaz?"
CPE_6,C2,"**Heritage**
Heritage means the things we get from our past. It helps people feel connected to their history. We often know about our grandparents and their stories. Learning about our past helps us understand our future. Heritage is important because it gives us a sense of belonging. Just like we inherit our genes, we also inherit our culture from our families. Some parts of our heritage may not be good, but it is still a part of us. Heritage teaches us many things and is important for our happiness. It includes our customs and the things we make. In the past, we learned about our history through stories from our ancestors. But now, many of these stories are lost. We can learn about our past from old buildings and places. It is important to take care of these places to remember our ancestors.
**The Fens**
I wrote a book called *Waterland*. In this book, I talk about a place in England called the Fens. At first, I did not know much about the Fens. I chose this place because it seemed quiet and simple. But when I learned more, I found that the Fens are very interesting and different. Many people in England think the Fens are strange. They are both empty and full of life, and they are beautiful in their own way. I have not visited some towns in the Fens, but I like to imagine what they are like. The Fens are not just a place; they are also a way of thinking.
**Museums**
Museums should make their collections easy to see and understand. In the past, museums just put things in glass cases with long labels. Now, museums should be more interesting and fun. They can use different ways to show their items and make people feel something. Museums should help everyone in the community. For example, they can give boxes of objects to teachers or help elderly people who forget things. Museums show real items from history, not copies. This is what makes them special. Museums that create exciting displays and programs will attract more visitors who want to see real history.
**Architecture and Environment**
Wanting to keep things safe is not new. But now, changes in our towns happen very fast. This can make some people want to protect old buildings. People who have lived through big events, like wars, may want to keep things stable. If we need to preserve our history, city planners should think about this. Change can be good if we learn how to manage it. Changes in our towns show changes in our society, like how many people live there and what they need."
CPE_33,C2,"Einstein**
If you stop someone on the street and ask them to name a scientist, they will probably say Albert Einstein. His face is used to sell many things, like computers and books. Most people do not know much about what Einstein did. They know he made important ideas called 'relativity'. These ideas can be hard to understand and seem strange.
Einstein helped change how we think about science. He looked at basic things like time, space, matter, and energy. Before him, people thought that stars and planets moved in a fixed way. Einstein said that time and space are not fixed; they can change.
**Young Readers**
When we were children, my sister Lydia and I did not like prize-winning books. We thought they were boring. Our mother did not like this and often told us to read better books. Our father gave us small coins to read good books. He also gave us some books for Christmas and birthdays that he said were not boring. We thought many of his books were for boys, but he did help us read some good stories and poems.
**Language**
Jacob Grimm wrote in 1851 that the start of human language is a secret and wonderful thing. Many people have strange ideas about how language began. For example, Charles Caller said in 1928 that early humans made sounds like ""meuh"" when they were scared. This sound is sad. Early humans made sounds when they were in danger, and some words today still show this, like ""malaria"" meaning ""fever"" and ""mors"" in Latin meaning ""death"".
Many people did not want to talk about how language started because they thought it was silly. But now, studying how language began is very important. Language likely started in East Africa about 100,000 years ago. At first, people used speech to be friendly and to help in fights. Sharing information was not the main reason for language, which is different from what philosopher John Locke said."
CPE_20,C2,"Writing Reviews**
Frank Kermode talks about writing reviews. A review is a short piece of writing that gives an opinion about a book, movie, or other work. Most reviews are written quickly and are not read for long. They are often in newspapers or magazines and may only be read for a day or a week.
Many people think that writing reviews is not very important. Some writers do it because they need money. Others do it because they cannot spend all their time on a big project like a novel. But writing reviews is a skill. It is different to write a short review of 600 or 800 words than to write a longer one of 6,000 or 8,000 words. 
A reviewer must think about who will read the review. Some readers just want a quick summary, while others want more details. A good reviewer knows a lot about different topics and can write in a way that is easy to understand.
Many reviewers also write other things, like books or articles. For example, the American writer John Updike writes novels but also writes reviews. He collects his reviews in books with funny titles.
Some people think that writing reviews is not as good as writing serious books. But in English-speaking countries, many writers do both. It is now common for professors to write reviews, and this is accepted more than before. 
Writing reviews can be good for readers because they can trust that the reviewer knows what they are talking about. It is also good for professors because it helps them remember to write clearly for everyone, not just for other professors. 
In conclusion, writing reviews is important, but it is usually a side job. You can do it well only if you are also doing something else well."
CPE_40,C2,"Ralph opened the door to his flat. It was dark and quiet inside. Sometimes, after three years, he still felt a little strange when he came home alone at the end of the day. When he first bought the flat, he was always excited to come back. He wondered what the flat had been doing while he was away. It felt like a welcome place for him, a space that was always there for him. 
He thought he should worry about things like break-ins or leaks, but his flat was always waiting for him. It looked either clean or messy, depending on how he left it. Over time, he started to see it as part of himself, a place where his thoughts and feelings spilled out. He got frustrated that he could not change it. 
Sometimes, letters piled up by the door, and the answering machine blinked when he got home. He was happy that his windows were not broken and that nothing bad had happened to his flat. From his small office, Ralph often looked forward to his quiet evenings at home. After a long day at work, he wanted to be alone, but he also felt lonely. 
At his desk, he wanted to be by himself, but when he got home, he felt empty. He thought that his job was not right for him and that it changed him. He would read or listen to music at night, but he started to wonder why he did these things. He felt lost and confused. 
There was a time when he felt stronger and believed in himself. He wanted to improve his life, but he just wanted to get by. He applied for jobs that his friends talked about, following them as they moved forward. He went to one job interview and was happy to talk with Neil, his future boss. Neil offered him the job right away, saying he was the only graduate who applied. Ralph took this as a compliment."
CPE_45,C2,"**Goat Racing**
I was going to see goat racing. It was Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. There were many people, ice-cream vans, and food stalls. The music was loud. Everyone was going to the racecourse. I pushed through the crowd to find a good place to watch. They made a special area for the race. It was not like a big racecourse, but people stood on both sides of the ground where the goats would run. They were trying to keep a few goats in order. This is not easy because goats can eat almost anything!
**Canoe Trip**
As the day ended, I thought about the night. I felt scared. The canoe was too wet to sleep in, and there was no place to stop. We had not seen any villages or huts since morning. In the dim moonlight, we saw the cliffs. Our flashlight was getting weak, so we changed the batteries, but they did not work. We could not find a place to camp. After a while, Lesley saw a light far away, and we felt hopeful. But the light was just the moon shining on the waves. Soon, we heard loud water, but we could not see it. We kept moving.
**How to Be Presentation Perfect**
I am not good at making presentations, but as a manager, I have to present to my colleagues and important people. How can I get better at this? You are not alone. Making a presentation is different from running a company, but many leaders need to do it well. If you want to convince your audience, you must believe in what you say. Show your passion and enthusiasm. This means you need to prepare. Think about your ideas carefully. Ask your colleagues what hard questions the audience might ask. You should also start with something people can relate to and then lead to your main point."
CPE_64,C2,"
Some activities take time. You cannot hurry them. If you are late for a meeting, you can rush. But if you are too quick with mayonnaise, it will not be good. If you pull hard on a tangled fishing line, it will get tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some things happen very fast, but others take time. 
We can get better at some things, like solving puzzles. But some things cannot be rushed. If you try to hurry them, they will not work well. For example, you cannot sleep well in a short time. 
We learn and think in different ways. Some ways are fast, and some are slow. There are three speeds of thinking. The first speed is very fast. Sometimes, we need to react quickly. For example, if you fall off a bike, your body knows what to do before you think about it. 
The second speed is thinking. This is when we solve problems and make decisions. A mechanic fixing a car or a student doing homework is using this kind of thinking. We call this 'intellect'. 
The third speed is slow. This is when we think in a relaxed way. Sometimes, we need to sit and think about things slowly. This is important too. 
Some problems are better solved with a slow mind. For example, if you are not sure about something, it is good to take your time and think. This slow thinking can help us be creative and wise. 
Scientists are now studying how our minds work slowly. They find that our minds can do many important things if we give them time. They can understand complex situations better than quick thinking."
CPE_29,C2,"Living in a New Place**
I have been welcomed nicely. It is a friendly place with many people. There are about forty people here - scientists, students, and weather experts. We all help each other. My French is okay for talking, but not for chatting. I miss some words, and my phrasebook does not help at breakfast. This is not a big problem, but at first, I felt shy. I was a little scared at mealtimes. I did not know which table to sit at. I felt nervous when I spoke, like when I was new in school. I still smile a lot or feel scared when people talk to me. I think I feel a little sad because I cannot talk as easily as before.
**Elliot**
When I first met Elliot, I was a young writer. He did not notice me. He remembered faces, and when I saw him, he shook my hand but did not want to be friends. If I saw him at the opera with important people, he did not see me. Then, I became a successful playwright, and Elliot started to be nicer to me. One day, he invited me to lunch. I thought he wanted to know me better. After my success, I saw him more often.
**Alfred Hitchcock**
Alfred Hitchcock was a famous film director. He said he did not care about the story or the acting in his films. He cared about the pictures and the music. For Hitchcock, it was not about the message or the acting. He believed that people feel the same way when they watch a good film, no matter where they are from. If a film is made well, people in Japan and India should react the same way. Hitchcock was very smart and knew a lot about films. He wanted to make people feel strong emotions when they watched his movies. He focused on the beauty of film and how it can affect the audience."
CPE_57,C2,"Amateur Astronomy**
Many things have changed in astronomy in the last 50 years. About 30 years ago, there were not many charts and books. Telescopes were not very good. Now, there are many types of telescopes and equipment to buy. Computers help make charts and analyze observations. This is a good time for amateur astronomy.
But some things are not as good. Now, you may have to travel far to find a dark sky. In cities, the sky is not as clear as it was 50 years ago. There are many planes in the sky, and they leave trails that can last a long time. This makes it hard to see the sun and the stars.
**Too Much Choice**
Today, there are too many choices. There are many things to do and many products to buy. People want the newest things, and technology makes this faster. New products come out all the time. This can make people feel tired and stressed. 
People are looking for simple things that make them happy in a complicated world. But it is not easy to simplify life when there are so many options. There are many brands of soap and cereal, and many phone plans. 
**McAndrews Hotel**
Every summer, my family goes to McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. This is a family tradition started by my grandmother. It is very important to us. We do not want anything to change this tradition.
The guests at McAndrews Hotel are special. Some people may think they are old-fashioned. I do not like rude shop assistants or waiters who are too friendly. I know many of the other guests because we have been coming here since we were children. When I see them, we only say hello. This respect for privacy is hard to find in hotels today."
CPE_9,C2,"Othello and Lake Vostok**
**Othello**  
There is a play called Othello by Shakespeare. It is now in London. I wrote a bad review of it last spring. I said the actor Ray Fearon was too young for the role of Othello. I was wrong about his acting. He did a great job. The whole cast is great. There are many memorable scenes. One scene is when Cassio plays games with other young officers. It gets out of hand. Another scene is when Iago starts to lose control. It is very emotional when Emilia helps Desdemona get ready for bed. The play is exciting. You should see it.
**Lake Vostok**  
In Antarctica, there is a big lake called Lake Vostok. It is under 4 kilometers of ice. This lake has been closed off from air and sunlight for 25 million years. Scientists want to explore this lake and find out what lives there. They are very excited to learn about it. Many researchers are trying to find ways to study the lake. In the next few years, we may learn a lot about Lake Vostok.
**Scientists**  
Last week, I heard something interesting on the radio. Some scientists are thinking about why they want to be scientists. They want to know why we want to learn. It is important to understand what we do in science. We should think about how and why we use science."
CPE_42,C2,"**Food**
Food is very important to us. Many people who like cooking buy cookbooks. Sometimes, we think cooking is only for special days or fancy meals. But that is not true! You can make a tasty soup with just some chopped carrots, a leek, celery, and herbs in water. This soup is better than buying a packet or a tin. You can also make a yummy dessert in five minutes that everyone will enjoy. Cooking is a way to show care and love. Sharing food is special. We celebrate important days like birthdays and anniversaries with food. No one wants fast food for a wedding!
**In the Elevator**
This morning, Alistair tried to clean his office, but it was still messy. Papers were everywhere. He had tax forms and many books. As he took the elevator to his floor, he thought about Mallory. She was always on time. She would knock on his office door exactly at the hour. Alistair worried about the mess. What would she think? He hoped she would not be too shocked. His cleaning lady, Mrs. Wilson, had come while he was trying to clean. When he saw her, he smiled, but she looked unhappy. She did not want to go into his messy office.
**Karen**
Karen wanted to be different from her mother. She made her own story. When she was twelve, her brother accidentally hit her in the eye with a golf club. At first, she thought she would go blind. But the doctor said she was okay. She only needed a few stitches. When she opened her eyes in the doctor’s office and saw her mother, she felt grateful. She knew she was saved for a reason.
**Miss Fogerty**
Miss Fogerty was happy and sad at the same time. She had just seen something important in her small village. She liked to be the first to know news, but she was also worried about Dr. Bailey. He had been her doctor for many years. He always cared for her when she was sick. Miss Fogerty appreciated how he listened to her problems. He made her feel like he had time for her. This is why everyone in the village liked him so much. He gave his time, knowledge, and humor to his patients. They loved him for it."
CPE_59,C2,"**Joanna's Lessons**
Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist. She plays music for many people. She also writes books for young children who want to learn the piano. 
Joanna plays the piano very well. She can play many types of music like classical, jazz, and blues. One time, at a concert for kids, a small boy asked her, ""Can you play Match of the Day?"" This made Joanna laugh. She thought it was funny that the boy wanted to hear that song. 
Joanna cares a lot about how children learn to play the piano. She has written a book called *Joanna MacGregor's Piano World* for beginners. Even though she is very busy, she wants to help children learn music. 
Joanna believes that everyone should be able to learn the piano, just like swimming or speaking a little French. Some kids learn quickly, but others take more time. She thinks it is important for children to enjoy music, not just to be the best. 
Joanna wants her books to be fun. She includes stories in her books to make learning interesting. She also has CDs with music to help children play. She believes that learning should be fun and that children should practice. 
Joanna understands that practicing can be hard. She wants to help children enjoy playing the piano, even if they make mistakes. She thinks it is important to have a goal when practicing. 
In her view, everyone can learn to play music if they have fun and keep trying."
CPE_54,C2,"Writing by Hand and on Screen**
Dr. Johnson said, ""What is easy to write is often not nice to read."" This means good writing is hard to do. When I look at my old school essays, I see that I did not cross out many words. Now, I would change them many times. I think this is because writing by hand is hard. Writing slowly helps me think better. When I write on a computer, I can change things easily, but I often make mistakes. 
Emails are different from handwritten letters. Many people now write love letters by email. This is good because at least they are writing. But words on a screen can be boring. People often write too quickly and their messages can be confusing. Writing by hand is special and has more feeling.
One day, I looked at a CD. The case was not nice, but the shiny disc inside was interesting. Mr. Warriston came into the room and said, ""These are wonderful!"" I agreed and gave him the disc. He said, ""It is amazing that they can fit seventy minutes of music on one."" He turned on the music player and many lights turned on. He put the disc inside and pressed a button. 
I asked, ""Do you have to turn it over like records?"" He said, ""No, you only play one side."" I wondered why. He thought for a moment and said, ""I don’t know. You could make both sides play."" He smiled and said, ""Good question!"" Then he told me to sit in the best place to hear the music.
**Books vs. Electronic Text**
Malcolm Bradbury said that if we had cigarette lighters before matches, we would think lighters are amazing. Some people say that electronic text is as important as the invention of books. But this is not true. It takes a long time for people to change how they think. 
Reading long things on a screen is not nice for many people. Most people do not do it. Computers make it easy to read small parts of text, but they do not help us read everything from start to finish. Many books, like religious texts and dictionaries, are not read from beginning to end. 
**The Office**
Charles walked into the office. It was very neat. The carpet was clean and the desk was dark wood. Everything was in its place. Kathleen was trying to close a filing cabinet. She said, ""You need to use computers, Charles. This is too much."" 
""Hello, Kathleen. This is amazing,"" he said, looking at the room. He did not want to think about computers. They had talked about this many times. She did not understand why he did not like technology. He was good with computers and had even written an important paper about them. She could use software to create new things."

""Do you want sugar in your coffee?"" shouted his secretary. She asked this because she had made coffee for Lancelot many times. She forgot because he was not usually at work. But now, he was there all the time. He thought about how he went from being an important helper to someone who was always busy and had no place to park.
""Here is something,"" she yelled, waving a folder. ""It is from a man in Los Angeles. You wanted to see it."" The folder had a label that said: ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert."" It also said ""An Expanded Synopsis."" Lancelot did not want to see the word ""synopsis."" He wanted to see ""A First Draft."" He had already seen a synopsis of this book and did not want to see another one. Ian Cuthbert had received a lot of money for this book when Lancelot bought the company. Ian was a friend who Lancelot had asked to write books, but Ian was very hard to work with.
Lancelot quickly read the synopsis. He recognized almost every phrase. He closed the folder and put it aside. It seemed like Ian's manuscript would never come. The synopsis did not have the great ideas that people said Ian had. Lancelot remembered a famous author who had published an incomplete book after he died. But that author had not received any money before. Ian had received a lot of money, which was not how things should work.
Lancelot remembered when Ian was a promising writer. He had many ideas and was very talented. But for some reason, Ian did not share his ideas. While other writers became successful, Ian stayed quiet. He was hard to work with, even when he was in charge of a magazine. The magazine used a lot of money but never published anything. Ian also had a contract with a fashion magazine, but he did not produce anything there either. At meetings, he was often rude and critical of others' ideas. Now, Lancelot thought that ""A World History of the Short"" was a mistake from the beginning."
CPE_65,C2,"England's Breakfast Change**
Breakfast is very important for health, say experts. But in the past, breakfast was not common in England. In old stories, people did not often talk about breakfast. Some travelers ate a meal early in the morning before long trips. Sick people sometimes had breakfast to feel better. But most people did not eat breakfast unless they were kings or rich people.
In the 1500s, more people started to eat breakfast. Some people think this happened because there was more food available. But there were also big changes in society. For example, more people had jobs with set hours. Many of these jobs started very early in the morning. So, eating breakfast became necessary for everyone, not just for rich people."
CPE_61,C2,"**Photography**
When a photographer takes a picture, they choose what to show. This choice depends on their skills, ideas, and experiences. It also depends on the culture and society around them. In this book, we will see how these things change the style and meaning of a photograph. We will also see how people look at and feel about these pictures.
For example, when someone reads a newspaper, they understand the photos in it. But we can ask questions about the photos. Does the photo show what really happened? Or does it show what the photographer thinks? Is the moment in the photo very important, or does it mean something bigger about the world?
**More than a Game**
For me, sports are more than just a game. The best athletes believe in themselves completely. To be the best, you need to focus and work hard. Sports can be tough, and you must do it yourself. It is a challenge. 
Sports teach me discipline and determination. They also show me how to work with a team. My sport lets me shine as an individual, but it is also a team sport. This is like life – you can do well alone, but you must remember others are with you. Sports have given me a lot, not just money. They have opened doors for me and let me see many things in the world. But I also have to give up a lot to get these rewards.
**Tuning In**
Some memories are very clear and special. For me, one special memory is from a night in California a long time ago. I was awake, listening to a mockingbird singing in a tree. I was not awake because I could not sleep; I was awake because the bird sang beautifully. 
As I listened to the bird, I felt like I was in a special musical place. The bird's songs reminded me of jazz and Indian classical music. It felt like a wonderful performance. I enjoyed the music until I finally fell asleep."
CPE_52,C2,"
People have always talked a lot about birds. Birds are important in our culture. Paul Evans writes about this. 
In a greenhouse, a little brown bird is bumping against the glass. This bird is a wren. Some people think wrens are special and have messages for us. Others think it is just a bird that is lost. 
Wrens have been part of British culture for a long time. In the past, people believed that the way wrens flew could tell them about their luck. Today, we still see pictures of wrens in many homes. Even if old beliefs are not common now, people still like wrens. A place without wrens feels sad. 
There are many stories about birds that show how people used to see the world. In the past, people depended on nature for food and safety. They learned to understand the meaning of birds in their lives. 
One example is the red kite bird. In the 1500s, people in London loved to see red kites flying down to get food from children. These birds were important and protected. But later, people thought they were pests and many were killed. Now, red kites are protected again and are coming back to their old homes. 
Birds are important to us for many reasons. They can show us things about nature and ourselves. Birds can fly, sing, and represent freedom. Some people think our feelings about birds are not important now, but they are still part of who we are. 
In recent years, birds have shown us how the environment is changing. In Britain, 30 bird species are in danger. This is sad because it means we are losing not just birds, but also part of our culture. 
Some birds, like the skylark and turtle dove, are symbols of love and magic. Many poems and stories talk about these birds. When we lose these birds, we feel sad. But we often ignore the loss of other birds that are not in stories or poems. 
Stories about birds are very important. They connect us to the past and help us feel emotions. Watching birds, whether on TV or in our backyards, gives us joy that science cannot explain. The wren in the greenhouse reminds us of our history and makes us think about the future."
CPE_28,C2,"Maps**
A map shows where places are on the earth. It helps us understand how far things are and in what direction they are. Long ago, people talked about distance in time, like ""a few hours' walk"" or ""a day's trip by river."" This helped people know how easy it was to travel, not just how far it was.
For many travelers, the most important questions were ""Where do I go?"" and ""How far is it?"" So, exact directions were not always very important. Because of this, written directions were used a lot, just like maps. Some maps, like train maps, do not always show true directions.
In the past, important places were marked with signs. These signs could be big or small, depending on how important the place was. Different maps used different signs, so it is important to understand what each map means.
Over time, maps became more accurate. People learned to use tools like the compass to find directions. They also learned more about the earth through exploration. They found out that the earth is not a perfect ball; it is a bit flat at the poles. This helped make better maps.
More people started using maps, not just travelers. Soldiers needed maps to understand the land for battles. Later, archaeologists, historians, and geographers also needed maps for their work. Today, map makers create maps for many things, like weather and land use.
The study of maps is important because it shows us how people thought and worked in the past. Many maps we have today are the result of a lot of hard work and ideas. This is why learning about old maps is interesting and helpful."
CPE_35,C2,"
I met a young man named Andrew Lloyd Webber. He had a nice room with many records and a stereo. Andrew was a teenager who liked music. He won a scholarship to study history at a college in Oxford. He wanted to be a famous composer like Richard Rodgers. I also had big dreams. I wanted to be a pop star for fun, money, and fame. 
Andrew asked me to help him write songs. He played some of his music on the piano, and I thought it was very good. I showed him a song I had written with a small band. We decided to meet again and write music together. I was still more interested in pop music than in theater, but I thought Andrew was very talented.
The next day, I went back to my job as a lawyer. I thought about my dreams of being in show business with Andrew. I still looked for bands that needed a singer. I worried that I would stop liking pop music soon, as my father said I would. But I wanted to see Andrew again. It would be fun to write songs for musicals.
Andrew had an idea for a musical about Dr. Thomas Barnardo, a man who helped orphans. I thought the story was not very exciting, but Andrew believed in his music. I started to write funny songs for the musical. I even skipped work one day to write lyrics. I didn’t know it then, but I was starting a new career. 
**Questions:**
1. What is the name of the young man Tim Rice met?
2. What did Andrew want to study at college?
3. What did Tim Rice want to be?
4. What did Andrew play for Tim Rice?
5. What was the idea for the musical about?"
CPE_5,C2,"**Text:**
**Language**  
You and I can talk to each other. This is a special skill. We use language every day. When people are together, they talk. If no one is there, people talk to themselves, their dogs, or even their plants. I think talking is like an instinct. This means we know how to talk, just like spiders know how to make webs.
**Climate and Weather**  
Climate and weather come from the air around us. They affect animals and plants. Climate can change how a place looks. For example, warm and wet places have tropical jungles with many types of plants and animals. Cold and windy places have fewer living things. Weather changes every day because of moving air. The sun also helps to move the air.
**Coffee**  
As a bar-person, I served drinks and made coffee. In Melbourne, a restaurant needs good coffee. I had many days of training to learn how to make coffee. I learned how to clean the coffee machine and make a good cappuccino. At first, it was hard to make coffee. My boss was kind and said, ""Making coffee is both an art and a science. You need time to learn."""
CPE_41,C2,"Art on TV**
Why does television not show art well? Painting and sculpture are good for TV because the camera can show the whole artwork and also show the details. But there are not many TV shows that show the beauty and details of art. 
One example is Robert Hughes's show called ""American Visions."" He is a trusted critic and has a strong personality. He had almost eight hours to show British people American art, which British galleries do not show. I thought the show would focus on great artworks. Instead, it talked about how American history and culture are shown in its art and buildings.
**Dealing in Metals**
For 20 years, I worked as a metals dealer and became known for taking risks. The metals market is not controlled as much as other markets. With some luck and a good understanding of the market, you can make a lot of money. Taking risks is part of this job. 
But now, the free-trade economists who said the market would keep metal prices high have found that more minerals are being taken out of the ground, and prices are going down. After considering inflation, most metal prices are about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to look into claims against a big company that benefits from these cheap raw materials.
**Extract from a Holiday Brochure**
Abaco and its small islands are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas. Each island is different and has something special. To get around the islands, you need a boat. If you don’t get a boat with your room, don’t worry. There are many ferries and water taxis. You can also rent a boat if you want to go by yourself. 
Sailing is very popular here. Abaco is called ""The Sailing Capital of the World"" because the waters are calm and safe. It is also great for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The islands and their beaches stretch for 200 miles. At night, the lights of the restaurants and cafes in Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay shine brightly."
CPE_69,C2,"Build Your Own Bamboo Bike**
You can build your own bike at the Bamboo Bike Club in the UK. This club is run by two engineers, James and Ian. They help you make a bike frame from bamboo. You can join a fun weekend course to learn how to build your bike.
It is Saturday morning in Hackney Wick, London. The Bamboo Bike Club is busy with people making bikes. Bamboo is a special material for making bike frames. Many people like bamboo bikes, but they can be very expensive. A ready-made bamboo bike frame can cost about $2,995 or £1,868.
James and Ian wanted to make bamboo bikes that everyone can afford. They worked hard to create a way for people to build their own bikes. They want to share the fun of making something special. The Bamboo Bike Club is a community project. James works on wind turbines, and Ian is a civil engineer.
In the course, you learn how to choose strong bamboo and how to put the pieces together. You will use tools and follow plans to build your bike. James and Ian help you with every step. If you make a mistake, it is okay! You can try again with a new piece of bamboo.
On the second day, you will work on the bike's details. You will wrap the joints with hemp and glue them to make them strong. At the end, you will have a bike that is ready to ride. James and Ian say their bamboo bikes are strong and last a long time.
The bamboo bikes look different from metal bikes. They have a unique style. Some people like to ride them slowly and enjoy the ride. The Bamboo Bike Club offers a great way to learn and have fun. The price for the course is less than £500."

**Self-help Books**  
Diane Reverend worked as an editor at Random House in New York. One day, she saw a book by a new author, Dr. John Gray. She thought the book would be very popular, and she was right. Dr. Gray became very rich, and Diane started her own company. Dr. Gray's book helps people understand each other better. This book is part of a big self-help industry in America. Many people want to improve their lives, and this industry helps them. There are many self-help books, but many are not published because they are not good enough. Editors look for books that can sell well. They ask questions like, ""Is the author interesting?"" and ""Does the title catch attention?"" A good title can help a book sell better.
**Autobiographies**  
When someone writes an autobiography, they should tell the truth. But sometimes, writers do not tell everything. They may feel ashamed or think some things are not important. Sometimes, they make up stories to explain their lives better. They may call their book an autobiography to make readers believe it is true, even if it is not. 
**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**  
Dashiell Hammett wrote detective stories. These stories show problems in society in the late 1800s and early 1900s. In these stories, a crime represents human feelings like greed or desire. Solving the crime helps society return to normal. In Hammett's stories, both the detective and the criminal understand each other. The detective is part of both worlds: he is a little bit good and a little bit bad. His job is complicated because he feels connected to both sides.
**Science Writing**  
Stephen Jay Gould is a famous science writer. He believes that only scientists can write well about science. If you do not understand science, it is hard to write about it. Gould says that writers should not talk down to their readers. They can use simple words, but they must keep the main ideas clear. If readers feel that the writer is treating them like they are not smart, they will not like the writing.

5. What does Stephen Jay Gould say about writing science?"
CPE_17,C2,"Air-conditioning**
At Cannons Gym, it is cold inside. Many people from the City of London come here for lunch. This summer is very hot, so the gym uses a lot of air-conditioning. Sometimes, it feels very cold, like the Arctic. This shows how we use air-conditioning too much. 
Air-conditioning is common in many buildings. But there are other ways to keep places cool. Buildings can use sunlight and fresh air. They can have thick walls that keep heat out during the day and let it go at night. These ideas can help reduce the need for air-conditioning.
**Sundials**
Sundials are tools that tell time by the sun's position. A long time ago, they were very important for telling time. People needed them to keep their clocks right. But as clocks became better, sundials were not used much. They became pretty decorations in gardens.
Now, people are interested in sundials again. David Harber makes sundials. He thinks they are special because they connect us to the sun and planets. When he delivers a sundial, it feels magical when it starts to work. Sundials are calm and remind us of our place in the universe.
**Paint Your Own China**
I remember seeing china-painting at an art show. Older women painted flowers on teacups very carefully. They made perfect petals and leaves. I thought it would be hard to paint like them. 
But when I went to a china-painting class, it was fun! The students were happy and wanted to enjoy painting. The teacher did not want everyone to paint like robots. It was a nice and friendly atmosphere."

**The Wrong Country**
Uncle chose a holiday for Keith and Dawne. It was a good price: a flight from Gatwick Airport and twelve nights in Venice, in a hotel called Pensione Concordia. When Keith and Dawne went to the travel agency to book the holiday, the clerk said they would be with a school group from the south coast. This group was learning Italian.
But something went wrong. They ended up in a hotel called the Edelweiss, in Switzerland, not Venice. At Gatwick, they gave their tickets to a girl in a yellow-and-red uniform. She checked their tickets and said everything was fine. On the plane, they heard older people talking with accents from the North of England. Keith thought there was a mistake.
When they landed, a woman with glasses told them to stay together. They did not see anything about an overnight stop in the brochure. When they got off the coach, it was almost midnight. They were tired and did not ask about their beds. But the next morning, they found out they would stay in the hotel for their whole holiday. This made them worried.
Keith told the receptionist, ""We were meant to be in Venice."" The receptionist said he did not know that hotel. Dawne said the travel agency's name and described the man who booked their holiday. 
A woman named Mrs. Franks came to help. She was the same woman they saw at Gatwick. Dawne told her they were in the wrong hotel. Keith said they followed the girl with the yellow-and-red uniform. 
Mrs. Franks explained that there are many holidays with the same yellow-and-red labels. She said if they followed the wrong people, they could end up in the wrong place. Keith insisted they were not meant to be in Switzerland. 
Mrs. Franks then left them. The receptionist was gone, and they could hear typing. Dawne said Mrs. Franks seemed nice, but Keith was not listening. He thought about everything that happened: giving the tickets, waiting, and getting on the plane.
An old man named Mr. Nottage spoke to them. He and his wife were happy and said they had a good sleep. Dawne said that was nice. Keith and Dawne left the hotel and did not talk about how funny it was that they were on a holiday with old people. They wanted a holiday away from older people, but Uncle had chosen this trip for them."

**HE WAS A PEOPLE PERSON**
Many people in Britain know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was. He was an explorer in Antarctica. In America, people are just starting to learn about him. The Wall Street Journal called him ""an Antarctic explorer"" who was not well known for a long time. Now, many Americans are excited to learn about Shackleton. There are new books and a big exhibition at the American Museum of Natural History. A film about his life is also being made.
Some American managers look up to Shackleton as a good example of leadership. They talk about his adventures and what they can learn from him. Shackleton was strong and smart. He had a special sleeping bag and a stove made from animal fat. Jim MacGregor, a manager in New York, thinks Shackleton is a great role model. He helps companies communicate better during problems.
Shackleton made a tough choice when he was very close to the South Pole. He turned back because he wanted to keep his men safe. This showed that he cared about their lives. In a crisis, people want a leader. Shackleton was not afraid to take responsibility. His ship, the Endurance, got stuck in ice for nine months and was finally crushed. When the ship sank, Shackleton told his men to trust him and do their best.
Shackleton always planned carefully and kept his men informed. He was flexible and changed plans when needed. He believed that explorers need to be hopeful, strong, and patient. He showed his men how to work together. For example, when he saw a photographer without gloves, he gave him his own gloves. Shackleton cared for his team, even when they were very hungry.
Caroline Alexander, who wrote a book about Shackleton, says that people today want to hear stories of real heroes. Shackleton is a true hero who shows us the values we admire.

CAE_15,C1,"
In the forests of Madagascar, there is a special animal called the aye-aye. The aye-aye is a type of primate. It has a way of finding food that is similar to a woodpecker. Both the aye-aye and the woodpecker look for insects in wood. The woodpecker uses its beak to make holes in the wood and its long tongue to get the insects. The aye-aye uses its big teeth to make holes and its long finger to reach inside and get the insects.
Scientists have studied the aye-aye to understand how it finds food. Dr. Carl Erickson watched three aye-ayes: two males named Nosferatu and Poe, and a female named Samantha with her baby, Annabelle. He wanted to see if they could find insects by looking for holes in the wood. Dr. Erickson made logs with holes. Some holes had food inside, and some were empty. The aye-ayes went straight to the holes with food. They did not need to see the holes to find the food.
Dr. Erickson thought the aye-ayes might find food by smell or sound, but they could find food even when there was no smell or sound. He found that the aye-ayes could feel the empty spaces in the wood. When they look for food, they tap the wood with their long finger and listen carefully. They can hear if there is a hollow space inside the wood.
The aye-aye is special because it can do things like a woodpecker and a bat. It also acts like a squirrel. Its teeth keep growing like a squirrel's teeth. Recently, scientists saw the aye-aye eating nuts in the wild. It used its long finger to get the nut meat out of the shell. 
**Questions:**

CAE_19,C1,"'Ordinary People, Ordinary Lives'**
Many of us have pictures of our grandparents. But how many of us know what their lives were like? We have some stories from our families, but they are often not complete. What will our grandchildren know about us? We want to write things down, but we often do not do it. 
Hannah Renier has a solution. She writes life stories for other people. She makes a book with at least 20,000 words and pictures if needed. She writes about ordinary people, not famous ones. Hannah got this idea when she talked to her family. She saw that many stories from the past were disappearing. 
""When I started, I did not think it was very important,"" she says. ""But then I met people who have interesting lives. They want to share their stories for their children and for the future. They enjoy it too."" 
People feel safe to share their stories with Hannah. A 62-year-old man said, ""I was honest. I talked about my divorce and it still hurts."" He wrote his story for his family, but he has not let his children read it yet. He wants to protect them from some painful details. 
Hannah sees that many people are affected by their childhood. ""Many people repeat the same mistakes in their lives,"" she says. ""They marry people their parents liked or they choose the opposite to rebel."" 
Many people have regrets. Even after many years, they still feel sad about things that happened with their parents. They try to impress their parents, but it does not always work. 
Hannah listens to people without judging them. ""I am not here to be nosy,"" she says. People sometimes share things and then worry if it should be in the book. But most people want to be honest. 
Hannah's books are not for everyone. They are not about showing off. She believes we are losing our connection to the past. We need to remember our roots. 
Each book takes about 30 hours of interviews. Hannah uses these talks to write the life story. She can make the book look nice, and people can choose the color and title. The books are special and cost about £3,000. Extra copies cost £25 each. 
Hannah gets about 10 requests each week, but the price stops many people from buying. ""I thought more people would want this,"" she says. ""But the people I have worked with are often wealthy and want to leave something for their families."""

A. **The Theatre Director**  
I have had a strange life, but I love being a father. I have spent 35 years with my children, and I enjoy every moment. This morning, I fed the baby, and that is what being a father means to me. I am very lucky with my children. We all like the same things: opera, theatre, books, and music. This makes us close. Now that they are older, I feel more like a friend than a father. I do not believe in hitting children. I have been angry and slapped them, but I do not think it is right. I may not have been the best father, but I always try to be there for them. I wait for them to call me. I do not want to make them feel guilty if they do not call.
B. **The Advertising Executive**  
I was young when my children were born, only 25 years old. I found being a parent hard sometimes, but it also kept me young. As they grew up, they showed me new things like music and fashion. This helped me in my job. I missed some important moments when they were young, like their first concerts, and I feel sad about that. But now, I can take them on holidays, and they enjoy being with my friends at parties.
C. **The Politician**  
My first child was born when I started my political career. I promised my wife that we would spend time with our children, but it is hard because I am very busy. I only go to meetings on weekends if my kids can come with me. This way, they can see what I do, and they do not feel like I am gone all the time. I see more politicians bringing their kids to work. Maybe we all want our children to be part of our lives.
D. **The Writer**  
My first marriage ended when my daughters, Kate and Bonnie, were young. I wanted to stay close to them. My ex-wife and I even lived next to each other for a while, but it was confusing for the kids. Kate says I was always there for her, but I am not sure I was a good father. I was around a lot, but I treated them like adults too soon. Kate thinks I was too easy on them. I wish I had set more rules. I still worry about my daughters, no matter how old they are.
E. **The TV Presenter**  
I was ready to be a parent when I turned 30. I met my wife, and we had a nice home. We thought, ""Why not have a child instead of just buying new things?"" Having my daughter, Betty, made me think about who I am. It feels special to have a child, but it also makes you just one of many parents. Sometimes I feel frustrated, but when I see her smile, all my worries go away. A baby's smile is very powerful."

**Flying Without Gravity**
Journalist Tom Mumford writes about students who fly in a special plane to test their ideas. The plane looks like a normal airplane. It is a Boeing KC-135, made in 1964. But inside, it is very different. The inside is a long white tunnel with few windows and bright lights. Most of the seats are gone, and 13 students from Europe and America sit at the back. They are excited but a little scared.
For one year, these students worked hard to win a chance to fly. The European Space Agency asked them to think of fun experiments to do in weightlessness. The best ideas won a place on this special flight, which is like a big roller coaster.
During the flight, the plane goes up high and then down quickly. When it goes down, everything inside the plane becomes weightless for a few seconds. The students feel like they are floating. At first, the flight is smooth, but then the pilot makes the plane climb steeply. The students feel the pressure in their heads, and some fall on the floor.
When the plane goes down, they float in the air. They can jump and move easily. Up and down do not mean the same thing anymore. After a few seconds, the plane comes back down, and gravity returns. Some students land hard on the floor.
The students have 10 minutes of weightlessness to do their experiments. The Dutch students study their robot cat, Leonardo, to see how cats land on their feet. They let their robot float and try to turn it over. 
Another group from Germany studies how metal joins change without gravity. A team from Utah State University tries to make solar sails from thin films in the air. They want to use the sun's energy like a sailboat uses the wind.
After two hours of flying, the students feel excited. One student says, ""It was an unforgettable experience. I want to be an astronaut even more now."""
CAE_3,C1,"
Jonathon Porritt is a writer. He wrote a book called ""Seeing Green."" 
When he was younger, he spent many summers in New Zealand. But in New Zealand, it was winter. He liked winter. His parents had an idea to buy a small piece of land for him and his siblings. They could plant trees there. His mother said, ""If you plant trees, you can have the land."" 
They found land near Auckland, in a place called Rangitoupuni. The land was not very good, but it was good for trees. Jonathon liked working with land. He had worked in Australia on farms. He thought planting trees was a nice idea. 
In 1968, he started planting trees. By 1972, he and his siblings had planted 70 acres of trees. In 1968, it rained a lot while they were planting. It was cold and wet, but Jonathon was happy. 
Every morning, he got ready to plant trees. He had a bag for trees. When the bag was full, it was heavy. It was easier when the bag was lighter. He had to make straight lines to plant the trees. He used poles to help him. 
Jonathon liked hard work. It made him strong. After a while, he could plant trees easily. He learned a rhythm for planting. He took the tree from the bag, dug a hole, put the tree in, and moved on. 
While planting, he thought a lot about life and nature. He went back to New Zealand four times and saw the trees grow. He felt good about the trees he planted. 
He worried when he read bad news about New Zealand, like strong winds or droughts. But the trees grew well, and they are now 20 years old. 
In 1984, he took time off from teaching and went back to New Zealand alone for three months. He wrote his first book there. He stayed in a simple cabin with a bed, a table, and a chair. In the mornings, he wrote. In the afternoons, he took care of the trees. 
Jonathon feels a strong connection to that place. He believes it is important to connect people with the earth."
CAE_10,C1,"'CARING FOR BADGER CUBS'**
One day, I saw a helper bring a cardboard box to me. My husband Derek and I have a farm in Somerset. We help orphaned animals. I heard strange noises from the box. I looked inside and saw three small grey badger cubs. They were about eight inches long. They had soft fur and looked up at me with their milky eyes.
I had never seen badger cubs before. Most badger cubs are born in winter and stay underground. If their mother is not there, they can die. These three cubs were found by builders. The builders accidentally hurt their home. The mother was dead, but the babies were alive.
I took the cubs to my kitchen to keep them warm. There were two girls named Primrose and Bluebell, and one boy named Willow. At first, I fed them with a syringe. I had to wipe them with a warm cloth to help them feel like their mother was licking them. This helped them go to the bathroom. For the first few days, I fed them every four hours. After a week, they learned to drink from a bottle and started to move around.
Three weeks later, I saw that Willow was not active. He was still eating, but something was wrong. The next morning, I found him dead. The vet said he had a lung infection. It was my fault because I let him drink too fast. I was sad, but I took care of the other two cubs.
Then, a farmer came to me. He found another badger cub, a boy, who was alone. I named him Willow II. He was younger than Primrose and Bluebell. He was hard to feed. I had to help him drink from the bottle. After a week, he learned to eat sausages.
By five months old, all the cubs were eating different foods. They liked cereals, meat, vegetables, fruit, and nuts. Badgers usually eat worms, bugs, and small animals. My badgers were doing well, even in the hot summer.
By August, the badgers started to go out at night. They liked to play in the orchard. They chased each other and had fun. I learned to be careful when they played, but Derek sometimes got nipped.
One night, I saw other badgers in our field. They were looking for food. Badgers can be dangerous to each other, so we put metal over the gate to keep them safe. The local newspaper took pictures of me with the badgers. Many people wanted to help build a home for them.
We made plans for a new home with tunnels and a special gate. It took a lot of money, but local businesses helped us. Finally, the badgers moved into their new home. I watched them and then left them alone. Later, I saw them sleeping in their chambers.
Now, I don’t walk with them as much because they wake up late. Primrose has moved to another home, but Bluebell and Willow II still come to say hello before they run off into the night. This is their home now, and they are happy."
CAE_67,C1,"In Search of True North**
Dr. Toby Clark is a researcher at the British Geological Survey. He wants to follow the journey of Sir Edmund Halley, who studied compass variations. Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is famous for the comet named after him. He also did important work with compasses. He used his sea trips on a warship called Paramore to study the angle between magnetic north and true north. This angle is important for sailors to find their way on the ocean.
Halley wanted to chart this angle in the North and South Atlantic. His first trip to the Cape Verde Islands did not work out because of problems with the crew. But he tried again. On his second trip, he went to Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, Newfoundland, and back to England. In 1701, he published a chart showing compass variations in the Western and Southern Oceans. This chart helped sailors for many years.
Now, Dr. Clark wants to celebrate the 300th anniversary of Halley's trip. He plans to follow Halley's route. He needs to raise £70,000 to start this journey. Sir Vivian Fuchs, who led the first cross-Antarctica expedition, is helping him.
Dr. Clark learned about Halley while he was in Antarctica. He read many books about Halley. Dr. Clark says, ""Halley had a remarkable life. He was a respected scientist and led many expeditions. He studied stars and helped Sir Isaac Newton with his work.""
Dr. Clark wants to recreate Halley's voyage. He will take measurements like Halley did, but with better tools. The Earth's magnetic field changes slowly, so these measurements are important. Dr. Clark says, ""We can use satellites to find true north.""
The British Geological Survey and the United States Navy will help with instruments. A Danish satellite will also take measurements. Dr. Clark hopes his work will help scientists understand the Atlantic Ocean better.
Halley's journey was the first scientific trip at sea. He was the first civilian to be a naval captain for this kind of work. Dr. Clark has experience too. He spent two years in Antarctica and has sailed from Rio de Janeiro to England.
He plans to complete the expedition in four parts with different crews. Dr. Clark says, ""I am ready to spend eight months on this journey. Some people may think I am obsessed, but Halley’s life gives me a purpose."""

**PEACOCKS IN WHIPSNADE PARK**
Every summer, peacocks walk around Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire. They show their beautiful feathers to the peahens. This is a mystery that Charles Darwin thought about a lot. He wondered why birds have such big and colorful tails. How do they survive with these big tails?
A scientist named Marion Petrie and her team are studying the peacocks at Whipsnade. Darwin said that animals change over time through evolution. He believed that the strongest animals survive and have babies. But he thought that peacocks' tails were not useful for survival. He called this idea ""sexual selection."" This means that female birds like beautiful males.
Darwin's friend, Alfred Russel Wallace, had a different idea. He thought that if peahens liked the males with the biggest tails, then those males must have something special that helps them survive. 
Now, 100 years later, scientists still want to know if peahens really choose the males with the biggest tails. They also want to find out if these males are better in other ways. At Whipsnade, the peacocks show off their tails in groups, and the peahens choose their favorites. 
Scientists have noticed that peahens like the males with the most eye spots on their tails. These males attract more mates. But they are still studying if these males are better in other ways. 
One scientist, William Hamilton, thinks that male birds with big tails might be healthier and have fewer parasites. This means they are less likely to be sick. Dr. Petrie is comparing the babies of attractive males with those of less attractive males. She wants to see if the babies of the attractive males grow faster and are healthier.
There is also an interesting idea from a scientist named R A Fisher. He said that if a female chooses a male with a slightly better tail, their sons will have long tails, and their daughters will like long tails too. This could make the tails even longer over time. 
In the end, this means that females might choose males just for their beauty, as Darwin thought."
CAE_66,C1,"**THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS**
Tom Cunliffe says the best boat design should mix old and new ideas. He made his own boat called 'The Westerman'. This week, there is a big boat show in London with many new yachts. Most of these boats have new technology and designs from 25 years ago. 
My boat is different. It is quiet and sits in a small creek on the south coast. It was designed last year, but it looks like it is 100 years old. Some people might think I am a romantic person because of this. I like old boat designs, but I also use some modern technology to help me. 
Modern technology is useful, but it can make sailing too easy. Sailors want to feel the real sea life, not just sit back and relax. I think it is important to have a warm stove and comfortable beds on a boat. But if everything is automatic, what is the fun in sailing? Sometimes, dealing with sails that flap in the wind is part of being a sailor. 
When I bought my first boat, Hirta, I sailed around Britain for a TV show. The last owner said it was comfortable but not luxurious. Hirta had heavy sails and no electricity, no fridge, and no fancy gadgets, but she was easy to sail. 
However, old boats need a lot of care. When I hurt my back, I knew I had to stop sailing Hirta. I looked for a newer boat but could not find one, so I decided to build a new boat. 
The Westerman has been great. The designer, Nigel Irens, started drawing the boat on a paper napkin before using a computer. We made many changes to get the design just right. The finished boat has crossed the North Atlantic and won four out of six races. 
The Westerman looks beautiful and sails well. It is made from wood and is very strong against water. It feels like a real boat, not just a fancy one. I believe that a boat should be made for sailing, not just for comfort. Sometimes, it is good to learn from the past."

Many health farms and country hotels with spas are very popular now. We asked five journalists to visit some of these places.
**A. HENLOW GRANGE**  
I went to Henlow Grange for six days because I was tired and wanted to relax. My room was very comfortable. On the first day, I did nothing and slept a lot. From the second day, I started to join classes like yoga and body conditioning. The teachers were very good. I felt more flexible as the week went on. They have many treatments like aromatherapy, seaweed baths, manicures, and pedicures. The facial treatment made me feel great. The staff were very friendly and professional. Henlow is planning to make some changes this year, including a swimming pool. You can ride bicycles around the grounds or enjoy a walk in the garden. I felt happy and full of energy when I left. I want to visit again!
**B. SHRUBLAND HALL**  
Shrubland Hall is a calm and relaxing place. When I arrived, I saw a big staircase and a nice library. Everyone gets a health check when they arrive. They check your weight and blood pressure. I was called a patient, which felt strange because I am healthy. They found a shoulder problem, and I worked on it in group classes. Each person has a special diet. I lost weight but felt hungry. My meals included grapefruit, salads, and fruit. If you don’t want to diet, you can eat tasty food in the dining hall. You can also have massages and water therapy.
**C. CAREYS MANOR**  
Careys Manor is not a health farm, but it is a nice old hotel with a cozy lounge. The food is very good but rich, so if you want to lose weight, you should be careful. There is a gym and a pool to help you stay fit. They have a spa, sauna, and treatment rooms. I got help for an old shoulder injury from a physiotherapist. Careys is comfortable and relaxing, and there is beautiful countryside to explore.
**D. CLIVEDEN**  
Cliveden is a beautiful country home and a five-star hotel. It has health and beauty treatments, a gym, saunas, a swimming pool, and more. There are lovely walks and gardens. The restaurant has amazing food. I enjoyed my dinner very much! The next morning, I spent time in the gym. I had a facial and an aromatherapy massage. Cliveden has many fitness and beauty options if you want them.
**E. SPRINGS HYDRO**  
At Springs Hydro, the best thing is the carrot cake. It is very delicious but also has many calories. The second best thing is the aromatherapy massage. I felt so relaxed during the massage. The hotel is modern and has many beauty rooms. There are many treatments like manicures and facials. The guests are different people, like families and friends. I would love to visit Springs Hydro every month.

CAE_22,C1,"**NATURAL TALENTS**
Humans and chimpanzees are very similar. We share more than 98% of our genes. This means that we are not very different from them. Scientists study animals to understand what makes us human. They find that many things we thought were only human are also seen in animals.
For example, both humans and chimpanzees use tools. Chimpanzees use sticks to eat and to fight. Sea otters use rocks to open clams. Monkeys also have a simple way to communicate. They make different sounds for animals like leopards, eagles, and snakes. This shows that the differences between humans and animals are not very big.
Art is one thing that many people think is only human. But for a long time, our ancestors did not make art. The first art might have been wood carvings or body painting, but we do not have proof of this. The first clear evidence of human art is from about 35,000 years ago. This includes cave paintings, statues, and musical instruments.
Some people say that human art is different from animal art in three ways:
1. Human art is not made to help us survive. It is made for enjoyment. Animal behaviors, like birds singing, help them find mates or protect their homes.
   
2. Human art is made for beauty. We do not know if animals enjoy their songs. Birds sing mostly during mating season, so they may not sing just for fun.
3. Human art is learned. Each culture has its own art style. For example, songs in Tokyo are different from songs in Paris. Animals, like some birds, are born knowing how to sing their songs.
There are also some interesting examples of animal art. Two chimpanzees, Congo and Betsy, made many paintings. Congo made up to 33 paintings in one day. They did not make these paintings to communicate with other chimps; they did it for fun. Their paintings were shown in a gallery in London, and many people bought them.
This shows that the line between human art and animal behavior is not very clear. While human artists often want to share their art with others, some animal artists do not care about sharing at all."
CAE_39,C1,"A Big Adventure**
The Taklamakan Desert in western China is a very big and dangerous place. Charles Blackmore crossed it and lived to tell his story. There are not many big adventures left today. In the past, stories were about brave explorers with sunburnt skin and narrow eyes looking into the distance. Now, we do not see these heroes in stories or in real life. But then I met Charles Blackmore.
Charles Blackmore led a group across the Taklamakan Desert. The desert is very hard to cross. Its name means ""once you enter, you never come out,"" and local people call it the Desert of Death. Charles talked about the dangers and excitement of his journey at home with his family. 
His team had four British people, one American photographer, four Chinese experts, 30 camels, and six camel handlers. The camel handlers had never worked with camels before; they were truck drivers. This mistake could have been very dangerous for everyone. 
They set out to cross 1,200 kilometers of the desert. Charles Blackmore wrote a fascinating story about their journey. At that time, he was leaving the Army after 14 years. He wanted to have fun and find out who he really was. His wife, Tina, was worried he would not come back because no one had crossed that route before. 
It took them 59 days to cross the desert. Charles said the desert was ""kind"" to them, but they faced many problems. They had sickness, very hot and cold weather, and not enough water. They lost some of their water supply. But when they were very thirsty, they found water. They did not have the big sandstorms that the desert is known for, and they did not feel the very cold weather.
Charles said, ""What pushed me on was the need to survive."" They had no backup plan. They were alone in the desert. He was scared but knew he could do it. On the first day, it was very hot, and he thought, ""We have to start now!"" 
After walking for 1,000 kilometers, they could not stop. They were very thin but strong. Charles felt proud of crossing the desert. He thought about his family while lying in the desert at night, looking at the moon. He said, ""I feel prouder of this trip than anything else."" But he also thought about his family and their happiness.
Has Charles Blackmore found peace? He said, ""I want the challenge and the open spaces. I find it hard to live in the same way as everyone else today."""

CAE_49,C1,"Three Theories About Sleep**
People sleep for about one-third of their lives. Sleep is very important, but we do not know exactly why. Scientists have three main ideas about why we sleep.
The first idea is that sleep helps our bodies stay healthy. When we sleep, our bodies fix any damage from the day and help us feel better.
The second idea is about learning. This idea says that sleep helps us remember things we learned during the day. Without sleep, it is hard to learn new things.
The third idea is about energy. This idea says we need sleep to recharge our energy. When we sleep, we get ready for the next day.
These are the three main ideas about why we sleep."
CAE_31,C1,"**ECCENTRICS**
An eccentric is a person who acts differently from most people. They do not follow the usual rules of society. This makes us think, ""What is normal?"" Many of us have our own strange habits. For example, someone might love to enter contests in newspapers, collect beer mats, or write letters to the newspaper about many topics.
Eccentricity shows our individuality. Inside us, there is a struggle between two things: wanting to be ourselves and wanting to fit in with others. Most people want to be accepted and liked. This desire is often stronger than the wish to be different.
People with unusual hobbies or strong opinions often find each other. They create clubs and hold meetings to talk about what they like or their problems. They want to be with others who understand them, even if others think they are strange.
We all feel a mix of wanting to be ourselves and wanting to fit in. Sometimes, we want to show our individuality. For example, a man at a bar might say, ""I say what I think."" Or a new person might say, ""You must take me as I am.""
Anyone can choose to be more individual. Some people become very successful by being themselves. Bob Dylan, a famous American singer, said, ""When you know what you want to do, go for it and don’t give up. You will surprise many people."" 
However, being different just to get attention is not true eccentricity. For example, if a singer wears strange clothes just to be noticed, that is not eccentricity. But if they keep being different for a long time, they may become eccentric.
True eccentrics do not try to be odd; they just are. They do not care much about what others think. They act based on who they are. This makes them different from people who want to impress others or escape from society. Eccentrics live their lives happily, no matter what others think."

It was easy to choose the author. I am an environmental journalist, and I have met many important people in this field. One of them is Barbara Ward. She is a small, thin woman, but she is very important for environmental issues in Europe after the war. She combined her experiences into her own ideas. When I was a young journalist, she helped me understand everything. Choosing the book was harder. I could choose ""Only One Earth"" or ""Progress for a Small Planet."" But I think Barbara's most important book is ""The Home of Man."" It talks about the fast growth of cities and important themes in her life. It is a strong call for what we now call ""sustainable human development."" I have read many books, but none are as good as this one.
**B. Linda Bennett**  
When I read ""Signals for Survival"" by Niko Tinbergen, I can hear the calls of seagulls and remember the smell of the sun. This book explains the amazing world of animal communication with words and pictures. If you read ""Signals for Survival"" and then watch a group of seagulls, you will see how they work together. Niko Tinbergen was a great scientist who wanted to share his ideas with everyone. He worked with a talented wildlife artist, Eric Ennion, to make this book interesting for all nature lovers. Eric's paintings show how birds act, like when one bird is aggressive and another is calm. 
**C. Lee Durrell**  
The book that changed my life is ""My Family and Other Animals"" by Gerald Durrell. This book helped me find a wonderful husband and a great job in conservation. I read this book while I was studying animal sounds in Madagascar. I was feeling sad because of many problems, but when I read this book, I felt happy again. It shows animals and people together in a beautiful world. Some people think humans are bad because of what we do to nature. But I remember Gerald as a boy in the book, seeing all living things as a family. We need to understand this idea.
**D. Bruce Pearson**  
I found ""The Shell Bird Book"" by James Fisher in my school library when it was first published in 1966. I loved it right away, especially the 48 colorful pictures of birds by Eric Ennion. I already had other bird books and learned to identify birds during my holidays. But ""The Shell Bird Book"" had so much more. It had beautiful paintings, chapters about bird migration, and even a chapter about birds in music and art. This book helped me appreciate birds and nature more. It showed me that my feelings about nature are just as important as scientific facts. Since I was better at art than math, I saw a new path for myself."
CAE_37,C1,"DO REVIEWS HELP SELL BOOKS?**
We asked five British publishers if book reviews help sell books. Here is what they said.
**Publisher A**  
Reviews are very important for publishers. They look at reviews first in the newspaper. A study showed that many people buy a book because of reviews, more than because of ads or displays in shops. Authors feel sad when there are no reviews. Publishers also feel sad, but they think that any review, good or bad, can help sell books. They like reviews that match their own feelings about a book.
**Publisher B**  
Publishers and newspapers want different things. Newspapers want to entertain their readers. Publishers want their books to be reviewed, and they hope for good reviews. Book reviews are better now than 40 years ago. However, many paperback books do not get enough attention. Publishers need reviews to help readers find their books. A good review from a trusted person can help sell more books.
**Publisher C**  
Reviews are very important for publishing. Many books are not by famous authors, so publishers need reviews to help sell them. Good reviews are better than ads because they show the book is good without being paid for. Publishers say they want big reviews, not just good content. Good reviews can help a book sell well, but they need help from other things like word-of-mouth and good marketing.
**Publisher D**  
In Britain, the connection between publishing and reviewing is not clear. In the U.S., a review in the New York Times can make a book popular. In Britain, bookshops may not pay much attention to reviews. Sometimes, it takes many years for people to notice a good writer. Some books that get bad reviews can still sell very well. Non-fiction books let reviewers talk more about the subject than the book itself.
**Publisher E**  
All publishers and writers want great reviews. But do they help sell books? I published a biography with great reviews, but it did not sell well. People thought they could learn everything from the reviews and did not need to buy the book. The name of the reviewer can matter. Thirty years ago, if certain reviewers liked a book, people listened. Now, sometimes a surprising reviewer can make people want to buy the book."
CAE_2,C1,"WEATHERVANE MAKER**
Making weathervanes is an old skill. It started in ancient Egypt. Today, Graham Smith makes weathervanes in his workshop. He is one of the few people in the country who makes them by hand. 
Graham makes special designs for his customers. He says, ""I can make a unique item."" Many of his customers are women. They buy gifts for their husbands. They want something special that shows the man's job or hobbies.
Graham's first weathervane was not a cockerel, which is a common design. It was a witch on a broomstick. His friends liked it and asked him to make weathervanes for them. Graham saw that he could make many different designs. 
He decided to start a weathervane business. Before this, he worked as a precision engineer for 15 years. Then, he and his wife, Liz, changed jobs. Liz went to work, and Graham stayed home to take care of the children and build his business. This was five years ago, and he is happy with his choice. He says, ""My old job was not creative, but this is exciting.""
Graham has made over 100 original designs. He pays attention to detail and asks customers for their approval before cutting the weathervanes. He also keeps traditional designs because people like them too. 
Graham believes people enjoy handmade items. They want something different. He does not want to grow his business too much because he likes it as a small craft. He says, ""People love unique items, and I enjoy seeing a simple shape become something special.""
For many years, weathervanes have helped people understand the weather. Now, more people are moving to the countryside. They want to add something special to their homes. This helps crafts like Graham's.
Graham is busy and sends weathervanes to customers all over the world. People from America and Denmark are interested in his work. He says, ""The price depends on how detailed the design is."" His latest request was for a curly-coated dog. No matter the occasion, Graham can create a special gift."

**A New Writer's Success**
Before it was published, *The Horse Whisperer* was a very popular book. It is the first book by Nicholas Evans, a British writer. He earned a lot of money from it. Here, he talks about his ideas and success.
At the start of the year, Nicholas Evans had a hard time. A film he was working on did not happen. He was sad and worried because he had not made money for two years. He needed money to pay the bank. A smart person would have found a job, but Nicholas did something different. He bought a ticket to America to research his first book for three months.
Nicholas had an idea for the story from a farrier he met in Dartmoor. The farrier told him about a calm horse that suddenly became very angry. The owners were worried until they heard about a gypsy who could talk to the horse and help it. These people are called ""horse whisperers."" Nicholas liked this idea and wanted to write a story about it.
He drove around the US, visiting ranches and learning about horses. He felt alone and worried about his life. He had tried to be a filmmaker for ten years, but now he was in debt and worried about his family.
By the end of August, he had written half of the book. He showed it to a friend who was a literary agent. The friend said it was ""fine"" and thought Nicholas could get $30,000 for it. Nicholas needed this money to pay his debts. He spent seven months writing *The Horse Whisperer* and needed more time to finish it.
In October, he sent the first part of the book to seven publishers in the UK. Soon, his agent called to say that they had an offer of $75,000. Nicholas was surprised. After a week of offers, the book was sold for $550,000 in the UK and $3.15 million in the US. This was a lot of money for a first book.
Nicholas could not believe it. He did not send the book to New York, but it got there anyway. Many movie studios wanted to make a film from the book. Nicholas's agent said they could get $3 million for it. Nicholas was shocked.
One night, four famous filmmakers called him to ask for the rights to the book. Nicholas decided not to write the movie script. He thought it was a great story and did not want to spoil it. He wanted to write another book instead."

Bobby Fischer is a famous chess player. He is trying to come back to chess after being away for 20 years. Chess is now a game for younger players. Bobby is 49 years old. He played his old rival, Boris Spassky, and won the first game. But Bobby is not as good as he was in 1972. 
Chess has changed a lot in the last 20 years. Now, many players are younger. Most of the top ten players in the world are under 30 years old. Players must prepare a lot before matches. They use computers to study many chess games. 
A chess game can last a long time, sometimes up to eight hours. Players must stay focused. If they make a mistake, they can lose. There is a chess clock that makes the game more exciting. Players have to make their moves quickly. 
Winning a game is very important, but one win is not enough to win a tournament. Tournaments can last 9 to 11 days, and players must play every day. Bobby Fischer wants to show he is still the best player. If he wins, he can earn a lot of money. But if he loses, it could be very sad for him. 
**Questions:**
1. How old is Bobby Fischer?
2. Who did Bobby Fischer play against?
3. How long can a chess game last?
4. What do players use to prepare for matches?
5. What happens if a player makes a mistake during the game?"

Imogen Edwards-Jones talks to some new British talents, like poets and pop stars, who are becoming famous.
**A** Nick Grosso is a man in his early 30s. He has written three plays. Now, he is making his first play, called Peaches, into a movie. He says, ""It is low budget, but I don’t know how low. It will not be over £30 million, but it could be £30."" Nick is very talented. Before he wrote Peaches, he had never been to a play or read one. He says, ""When I wrote the play, I did not think it would be shown."" The play is set in a car. He left school at 16 but went back a year later. After finishing A-levels, he joined the Young People's Theatre. He wanted to write for actors. He liked writing because it has rhythm and rhyme. He says, ""I was happy to be with people like me. It was the first time I enjoyed school.""
**B** Simon Pegg is 28 years old. He studied drama at Bristol University. Now, he is writing a TV comedy show and just finished a tour with comedian Steve Coogan. Simon worked hard from the start. He performed in comedy clubs while at university. He says, ""University was very theoretical. I did not want to be a normal actor. I liked comedy more."" He thinks comedy is not the hardest job. If you have courage and good ideas, it is great to make people laugh.
**C** Ciaran McMenamin is 24 years old. He became famous when he danced in the show The Young Person's Guide To Becoming A Rock Star. People liked his performance. He says, ""Now I can choose what I want to do."" Ciaran acted in school and then joined the Ulster Youth Theatre for four years. He laughs and says, ""I used acting to avoid homework."" He decided to take acting seriously because he liked it. Now, he waits for good things to happen. He thinks fame is not what he wants. He says, ""When you are 18, you think you will love the photos and interviews, but it is not why you act. You want respect for good work.""
**D** Neil Taylor is 25 years old. He is the lead singer of the pop band Matrix. They just signed a deal to make three albums. Neil and his bandmate, Rick Brown, hope their single, Chimera, will be a hit. Neil says, ""The record company wants big sales, but I just want two people to buy it."" He worked hard for his success.

A. Isabel is 31 years old and studies art. She thinks she looks good in jeans, but she does not wear them often. She wants to find the right man but worries that her knees are not nice. Isabel is hopeful, and this helps her and others in the story. The author writes in a fun and lively way.
B. This story is about a local radio station in America. A smart boy named Francis works at WLT Radio. The station was started by two men to promote their sandwich shop. Soon, the radio plays many different types of shows with singers and speakers. The author uses humor to show life in a small town and takes readers back to the 1940s and 1950s.
C. In this story, a man named Richard talks to his wife’s ex-husband. Richard loves a Russian poetess who writes bad poetry. She wants Richard to help her brother, who is in prison. The author tells this story in a funny and clever way.
D. In London during the 1960s, two sets of best friends meet. One friend, James, is starting a newspaper, and his friend Richard is the editor. They both loved a woman who died years ago. The story has love, jealousy, and ambition. It is a long book where you can really get to know the characters.

The story shows the loving relationship Ian has with the youngest child, Daphne. It is a warm book with both sad and funny moments."
CAE_53,C1,"Volunteer Tourism**
Four writers talk about volunteer tourism. 
A. Volunteer tourism is when people travel to help others. They can build homes or schools. But, they usually pay a lot of money to do this. If they gave this money to local people, it could help more than their work. Many young people volunteer during their gap years. They often do not have special skills. Some studies ask if these young people want to help others or if they want to help themselves in their careers. However, volunteering can help people learn to care for others in the future.
B. Volunteering can help people understand each other better. It can help solve problems and create connections between people from different countries. This can be good for both the volunteers and the communities they help. But, if only rich people can volunteer, it may not help the communities that need it the most. The volunteers may gain experience, but the local people may not benefit much.
C. Sometimes, international volunteering can be seen as a way for rich people to feel good about themselves. It can also be a way to help communities with skills and knowledge. At its best, volunteering can help both the volunteers and the communities. It can also make people aware of problems like poverty and injustice.
D. Volunteer tourism is popular because it allows people to help others without going through big governments or businesses. This can seem good, but it may not change the real problems in poor communities. Some people think that volunteering is just simple charity. However, when it is called sustainable development, it can be misleading. Volunteer tourism can sometimes ignore the bigger issues of poverty and inequality in the world."

**Sound the Alarm**
Stuart Harris reports
Many people listen to the radio in the morning. Most of us need an alarm to help us get out of bed. This is why we have clock radios. But how do you choose a good one?
I tested five clock radios with Tom Granger, an inventor, and Paul Bridges, a broadcaster. One clock radio has a 'dual alarm function'. This means you can set two different wake-up times. One time can be for work days and the other for weekends. But who needs two alarms? 
This clock radio costs about the same as another one we tested. It has a cassette player, so you can listen to your own music when you sleep and wake up to the radio. We all liked the radio quality, but the clock radio is very big, like a rugby ball. Paul said he needs space on his bedside table for his keys, wallet, glasses, and phone. He also likes to book a wake-up call in case the alarm does not work.
This clock radio was voted the best. Paul said he loved it, but the clock sometimes got stuck at 16:00. I liked the digital display with grey numbers on a green background. The snooze button is wide, so you can tap it easily. But the buttons felt nice to touch, and I accidentally pressed them too much.
The clock has a backup battery, so you do not have to reset it if the power goes out. We all liked this feature. However, it was hard to set up. Tom said the clock with a lamp was not good. He had to read the instructions twice to make it work. The lamp was hard to use, and it only shines on the clock.
Paul thought the lamp idea was funny, but he said the radio was hard to tune. The buzzer sounded like a submarine alarm, and it made me want to throw it away. This model is popular with young people because it is bright and colorful. Tom liked it because it stands out. 
The controls were easy to use, and we could set it up without reading the instructions. But the alarm can be 20 minutes early or late. Paul laughed at this and said the model was hard to use and not good.
The simplest and cheapest clock radio was liked by Tom because it was small and easy to use. It has old-fashioned dial tuning, which is easier to set up. With modern buttons, you are not sure if you pressed them right. We thought the tuning was not great, but the radio quality was good. The buzzer worked well; it got me out of bed in just two beeps! 
**Questions:**
1. What do many people listen to in the morning?
2. What is the purpose of a clock radio?
3. How many clock radios did Stuart test?
4. What feature does the 'dual alarm function' have?
5. What did Paul say he needs space for on his bedside table?
6. What did Tom think about the clock with a lamp?

CAE_50,C1,"**Hedgehogs**
A hedgehog is a small animal. It has sharp spines on its body. Hedgehogs live in many places in the world, but they are not from America or Australia. 
When a hedgehog is in danger, it can roll into a ball. The spines point out to protect it. Some hedgehogs in the desert have fewer spines. They may try to run away instead of rolling up.
Hedgehogs are mostly active at night. They sleep during the day in bushes or in holes in the ground. All hedgehogs can sleep for a long time in winter, but not all do. Some stay awake all year."
CAE_25,C1,"Great Sportswomen**
It is hard to be good at sports. Women have to work very hard. They train a lot and have little time for normal life. They make sacrifices. But they are winning and breaking records. Here are some British sportswomen who are doing great things.
A. **Jill, 27, Skier**  
""I love to ski. It feels great to jump and land well, but it can be scary. Sometimes I feel sick or it is windy, but I keep going. I train for ten months each year, so I don’t see my friends much. There are six men and three women on the British team. We all compete together.""
B. **Caroline, 22, Cyclist**  
""Two years ago, I borrowed a bike for a charity race. I won because I cycled faster than everyone else! I train for four hours every day. I also swim and run. My boyfriend is a cyclist too, so he understands how much time it takes.""
C. **Annabel, 26, Rower**  
""Rowing is hard for girls because few schools have rowing teams. Most girls start late, so it is hard to be the best. But I love rowing and being fit. It is also fun to be with friends.""
D. **Ffyona, 24, Long Distance Walker**  
""When I was 13, I wanted to walk around the world. I didn’t know how big it was! Walking across Australia was very hard. I walked 50 miles a day with little sleep. I got a record! Some people think women cannot do this, but I did.""
E. **Lisa, 26, Car Racer**  
""Some men think they are better drivers. When I do well, they ignore me. Being a woman in racing is hard. I have to be very competitive. Women have raced cars for a long time, and now more women are joining.""
F. **Alison, 28, Triathlete**  
""I wake up at 5:30 AM to swim three times a week. I also cycle and run. Sometimes I feel tired. I like to keep fit and racing is fun. Men and women race together, but the news talks more about men. We are working to change this.""
**Questions:**
1. What sport does Jill do?
2. How long does Caroline train each day?
3. Why is rowing hard for girls, according to Annabel?
4. What did Ffyona want to do when she was 13?
5. What does Lisa think about men drivers?

One day, Richard Cork, who was 78 years old, met the famous artist Picasso. Richard was a student and was traveling in a van around Europe and Morocco. He ran out of money and found a job painting boats. He liked to draw and had a sketchbook with him.
One day, Richard saw Picasso sitting at a restaurant in Cannes. Picasso was eating lunch with his wife and friends. Richard was surprised to see him there because Picasso usually stayed at home. Richard was nervous, but he went to ask Picasso for his signature. Picasso was nice and signed his name on Richard's paper. Then, he drew some lines on the page too.
Richard wanted to talk to Picasso, but they did not speak the same language well. An American woman at the table helped them talk. She called Picasso ""the Maestro."" Richard told Picasso that he loved art and admired his work.
After a while, Richard went back to his boat. His friend told him to go back to Picasso and draw his portrait. Richard took his sketchbook and went back to Picasso's table. He did not ask if he could draw him because he was afraid Picasso would say no. Instead, he started to draw.
When Picasso saw Richard drawing, he made funny faces to make it hard for Richard to draw him. Richard wanted to stop, but he kept going because he wanted to do his best. After a few minutes, Picasso stopped making faces and sat still. Richard looked at Picasso carefully. He saw that Picasso looked strong and young for his age.
The American woman told Richard that Picasso wanted to see his drawing. Richard felt shy and said it was not good enough. But Picasso wanted to see it. Richard showed him his drawing, and Picasso smiled at it. Then, Picasso took the crayon and quickly drew a picture of Richard. It was very different from Richard's drawing. Picasso made Richard look funny and happy.
Richard thanked Picasso and asked him to sign the new drawing. The American woman said that Picasso said he already signed Richard's paper. Richard felt lucky to meet Picasso and to have his attention. It was a very special moment for him."
CAE_12,C1,"Shopping Tricks**
Have you ever gone to a store and bought more than you planned? Stores use tricks to make you spend more money. 
A. **Fresh Food**  
Supermarkets know that people like fresh food. They put fruits and vegetables at the entrance of the store. They may also have a bakery that smells like fresh bread. The color green is often used in stores because it makes people think of fresh food.
B. **Product Placement**  
Where products are in the store is very important. Supermarkets use computers to find out where people look for items. They put popular products at eye level so people can see them easily. Special offers are often in big bins to attract shoppers. Sometimes, they place items that go together near each other, like ice cream and toppings.
C. **Spreading Essentials**  
Supermarkets may place cheap items like bread and sugar far from the entrance. This way, shoppers pass by other tempting items. Stores may also put popular products far away, hoping customers will look for them and see other items.
D. **Less is More**  
Some stores, like Next, show fewer items on the shelves. This makes the clothes look special. Even though they sell many clothes, the store design makes it feel exclusive.
E. **Total Price**  
Shoppers often care more about the total price of their shopping than the price of each item. Supermarkets mix cheap and expensive items. They may sell some items at a loss to attract customers. They also buy in large amounts to get better prices.
F. **Price Tags**  
In chain stores, shoppers notice prices more. For example, a blouse priced at £14.99 seems cheaper than one at £15. This helps reduce theft because workers must ring up sales to give change.
G. **Lighting**  
Stores think carefully about lighting. Chain stores use lighting that looks like natural light so shoppers can see colors well. Supermarkets use special lights to make fresh food look better.
H. **Store Layout**  
Many stores use different carpets to guide shoppers. One pattern shows the way through the store, and another shows sales areas. Some stores use nice carpets to make shoppers want to walk into sales areas.
I. **In-Store Ads**  
When you enter a supermarket, you see big pictures of tasty food. In some places, shopping carts have screens that show ads for products as you shop. This is to catch the attention of shoppers and make them buy more."

CAE_8,C1,"**A Simple History of the Apple**
Apples have been around for a long time. They come in many colors, shapes, and sizes. 
**Early Apples (8,000 BC)**  
People have eaten apples for thousands of years. In ancient times, they threw away apple seeds. In Switzerland and Italy, people found apple remains near their homes. They even saved apple halves for winter. These apples were small and wild, not like the apples we eat today.
**Learning About Apples (1000 AD)**  
The Romans taught the French how to grow fruit. This knowledge came to Britain. Some apples were brought by the Romans, but many did not grow well in Britain. British monks started to grow new types of apples.
**Popular Apples (1200)**  
In the 1200s, many apples became popular in Britain. One type was called the Old English Pearmain. It was sweet and shaped like a pear. Another type was the Costard, used for cooking. But there were problems like droughts and the Black Death, which made fewer apples grow. In the 1500s, King Henry VIII sent a man to France to learn more about apples. He brought back many new types of apples.
**Apples in New Places (1750)**  
By the 1600s, apples were very popular in Britain. When people moved to Canada, Australia, the US, South Africa, and New Zealand, they took apples with them. Captain Bligh took apples to Australia. A man named Johnny Appleseed planted many apple trees in America.
**New Apples (1850)**  
In Iowa, a farmer named Jesse Hiatt found a new type of apple. He named it 'Delicious' because it tasted so good. Another famous apple, the Granny Smith, was found in Australia by Maria Anne Smith. She found a small tree and grew green apples that became very popular.
**Many Apples Today (1950)**  
Today, apples are grown all over the world. Most apples come from a few types that are easy to transport. Many old apple types are disappearing. People want more kinds of apples. It is important to keep different types of apples for everyone to enjoy."

Richard Nerurkar is a long-distance runner from Britain. He is one of the best 10,000-metre runners. He visits a training camp in Kenya. This camp is in the mountains, ten miles south of the equator. The camp is near Mount Kenya, which is the highest mountain in Kenya. For three years, Richard has trained in this beautiful but quiet place called Nanyuk.
On his fourth trip to Kenya, Richard trained with Kenyan runners. He also ran in his first race in Kenya. He was invited to the camp by the Kenyan national team coach after he finished fifth in a big race. This was a great chance for him. Training in the mountains helps runners because it makes their bodies better at using oxygen.
Richard's first race in Africa was special. It was the first international cross-country race in Africa, held in Nairobi. Many Kenyan runners finished ahead of him. Richard felt good about his race, even though he did not win.
Kenyan runners are known for their simple way of training. They run easily and enjoy competing. Richard learned how they train at their camp. The camp is at St Mark's College, high up on Mount Kenya. The athletes live with college students in simple rooms. 
Every day, they have three training sessions: a morning run, interval training, and a steady run in the afternoon. They start their day early, at six in the morning. They run about 40 kilometres each day, except on Sundays when they run 20 kilometres.
Life at the camp is simple. They wash their faces and brush their teeth before breakfast. Breakfast is tea, bread, and boiled eggs. Lunch and dinner are similar, with ugali (a maize dish), stew, and vegetables. After running, they go to a stream to wash.
By the end of his stay, Richard understood more about why Kenyan runners are so successful. It is not just because of their genes or the mountains. It is also about their simple lifestyle, hard work, and love for running."

Advertising is not doing well. This problem started in 1989, before the recession. Advertising is not keeping up with changes in the economy. Advertisers think about big groups of people, but now there are many different groups. Even big brands should focus on smaller groups, but they usually do not.
Think about your shopping. When you go to a supermarket, you might buy 30, 40, or 50 items. Most of these items are not from advertised brands. You may only buy a few advertised brands from many options in the store. In a year, you probably buy only a few hundred different brands. For things like cars, you might only buy one every three years. You do not buy many clothes, and most are not from advertised brands. Overall, you likely do not buy more than 400 different brands in a year.
There are many brands advertised, but most people do not buy them. For example, if you watch TV, you might see many commercials, but you only buy a few of those brands. Most of the commercials are not for brands you buy. Many people think they are not affected by advertising, but that is not true. Most people do not buy most of the brands they see in ads.
Advertising can be wasteful. Not everyone who sees an ad will buy the product. However, advertising can still be effective. It needs to reach many people to find the few who will buy. Advertisers cannot know who will respond to their ads. Even the best ads do not get a response from everyone.
If an advertiser knows who will buy, they can talk to them directly. This is true for all types of advertising. If an advertiser can get one million new customers, that is very good. For popular products, getting a small percentage of the population to buy is a big success. To do better, advertising needs to focus more on specific groups of people."

Charles Clover visits a special house in Southwell, Nottinghamshire. This house is very good for the environment. Near the house is Southwell Minster, a small old cathedral with interesting green figures made by craftsmen long ago.
The house is called the ""autonomous house."" It was made by Robert and Brenda Vale. They use rainwater for washing and drinking. They recycle waste into compost for their garden. They also use heat from their appliances and their bodies to warm the house. They live with their three teenage children and two cats named Edison and Faraday.
The house looks traditional with a clay roof. It is quiet inside because it has special windows that keep out noise. When you enter, you must take off your shoes. The house is warm and sunny. The Vales open windows to let fresh air in.
Robert and Brenda teach architecture at a university. They care about the environment and wrote a book about green buildings in the 1970s. They wanted to make a house that does not harm the environment. They do not use city water. They have special toilets and collect rainwater. They do not use dishwashers because they do not want to use strong soaps.
The Vales want to show that it is possible to build a house that is good for the environment. Their house does not have high electricity bills. Last winter, they used very little electricity. Soon, they will add solar panels to make even more electricity. They will use some electricity from the city for cooking, but they will also make extra electricity.
In winter, they have a small wood stove to keep warm, but they do not use it much. One night, Robert said it was too warm to use the stove. The temperature was comfortable because the house keeps the heat inside. 
The house is simple and easy to build. It did not cost much to make because they used local materials and workers. Many big building companies do not like this idea."

The camera never lies
Arthur Conan Doyle wrote the Sherlock Holmes stories. He thought he was a smart man and a scientist. In 1920, he saw photos of fairies in a garden. He believed these photos showed that fairies were real. He wrote an article and published the photos, saying fairies are wonderful.
In 1939, the two women who took the photos said they were fake. They cut out pictures of fairies from a book and put them in the flowers. The photos are very pretty. But this simple trick shows that the camera can lie. 
Today, we can change photos with computer programs. It is not true that photography was always honest. From the start, when cameras took pictures, they changed what we see."
CAE_11,C1,"Blacksmiths**
Blacksmiths are people who work with iron. For a long time, blacksmiths were very important. They made weapons, armor, and tools for farming. Before the Industrial Revolution, blacksmiths were as respected as doctors. They also made beautiful art with iron.
In the 1960s, there were not many blacksmiths in Britain because factories did not need them. But in the last 10 years, more people have become interested in blacksmithing again. They like decorative ironwork and new designs for homes. 
There is an exhibition of blacksmith work at the Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey. Alan Dawson, the secretary of the British Artist Blacksmiths Association, says this could be a new time for blacksmiths. They can now use power tools, which makes their work easier. They can bend and shape iron in new ways.
About 250 pieces of ironwork are in the show. Prices start at £90 and can go much higher. Some money will help the blacksmiths, and some will help the Association.
Many blacksmiths love working with iron. Susan May, a jeweller, says iron is soft when it is hot but hard when it cools down. Ann Catrin Evans makes door knockers and handles. She likes how steel feels cold and hard. 
Iron is a special metal that people enjoy using. It will likely be used for decoration for many years to come."
CAE_14,C1,"THE DAY I STOPPED SMOKING**
I stopped smoking. I thought my friends would be happy, but one person was very angry. She said, ""What do you mean? If it was easy, why didn’t you stop before?"" I could not explain how I stopped. It was strange for me too. 
I went to a stop-smoking class two months and three weeks ago. I did not want to stop smoking. I felt pressure from people who do not like smoking. I have good health and I do not feel sick. I went to the class to write an article about it. I said, ""I will not stop smoking. I am here to write, not to stop."" I liked smoking. It made me happy.
In the class, we could smoke as much as we wanted. The room was full of smoke. But when I was told to smoke, I did not want to. I think the messages about stopping smoking made sense. I started to think that stopping smoking was a good idea. I felt strong. 
It was not hard to stop. The desire for cigarettes went away after a few days. I thought working without cigarettes would be hard, but it was easy. The hardest part was being at home on weekends. I realized that smoking helped me not feel bored. 
I miss smoking a little, but not too much. Now, I have to think about new things as a non-smoker. Eating out, waiting for a plane, checking into a hotel, and waiting at the theater are all moments when I used to smoke."

Dorothy Hodgkin is a British woman scientist. She won the Nobel Prize, but many people do not know her name. For four years, I have asked my friends about her. When I tell them I am writing a book about Dorothy Hodgkin, some say, ""Isn't there already a book about her?"" If they know her, they pass my test.
Dorothy Hodgkin is important because she is the only British woman scientist to win a Nobel Prize. If someone in literature won a Nobel Prize, everyone would know their name. Dorothy died in 1994. She was a special person and studied crystals. Her life shows important changes in the 20th century, like better education for women and the growth of science around the world.
When I started my research, I wanted to read about other scientists. A friend told me to read about Linus Pauling. He was a friend of Dorothy and worked in the same field. I went to a bookstore, but I could not find a book about him. I was surprised because he was a very important chemist and won Nobel Prizes for chemistry and peace.
Some scientists think that biographies are not interesting. Peter Medawar, another Nobel Prize winner, said that the lives of scientists are often boring. If scientists think this, it is not surprising that publishers and bookstores think the same way. Many famous scientists do not have biographies in bookstores.
It is not true that scientists have less interesting lives than artists or writers. Some scientists do not want to be in the media because they do not want to seem like they are showing off. This makes people think science is not interesting, which can stop young people from wanting to be scientists.
Today, more scientists are seen in public. For example, Professor Richard Dawkins gives prizes on TV, and geneticist Steve Jones advertises cars. These activities help people see scientists as real people.
The world of books is changing too. Scientific biographies used to be boring and only about work. They did not talk much about the scientist's life outside of work, like family and personal life. But now, books like Richard Feynman's ""Surely You're Joking, Mr Feynman?"" show scientists as real people with feelings and problems.
Dorothy Hodgkin loved her work. She solved the structure of penicillin and vitamin B12, which won her the Nobel Prize in 1964. She also worked on insulin in 1969. She had three children and a husband who was often away for work. Her personal life is important, and we can learn from how she balanced her work and family.
Dorothy Hodgkin's life is interesting to everyone, not just scientists. She was very passionate about science, which is important for any successful scientist. It is hard for writers to show this passion because many readers do not know enough science. But understanding science is not harder than reading Shakespeare or learning a new language; it just takes practice.
It is sad that many educated people do not know about important scientists like Dorothy Hodgkin, but they would feel embarrassed if they did not know famous writers or artists."
CAE_56,C1,"Margaret and Her Water Finding**
Margaret Wilkins has a special skill. She can find water underground using a forked hazel stick. Many farmers need her help because their wells are dry. Margaret and her husband have a business that drills wells. They use machines, but Margaret uses the hazel stick to find water.
Margaret is very good at her job. She finds water more than 90 out of 100 times. This skill is called dowsing. Some people think it is magic, while others think it is about how things vibrate. Water vibrates more than other things. Some dowsers say they can feel or smell water.
In recent years, many farmers have come to Margaret for help. She usually sees each customer only once because wells last a long time. Some customers have holiday homes and need water. Others are building golf courses.
Margaret looks for water between 50 and 70 meters deep. She must be careful to find clean water. She needs electricity to pump the water, so the well should be close to power sources.
To start, Margaret looks at a map and uses a pendulum. She holds the pendulum over the map. If it swings, there may be water there. Then, she walks in the fields with her hazel stick. When she is above water, she feels something special. She uses the stick to find the best place to drill.
Margaret holds the stick with both hands. If the stick rises, it means water is below. It is important to drill in the right spot. If she and her husband do not agree on where to drill, they keep looking until they do.
Margaret's skill is interesting to many people. She calls it an ""intuitive perception of the environment."" This means she has a special way of understanding where water is. Because of this skill, she and her family can keep their well-drilling business going year after year."

Have you ever wanted to live like someone else for a day? We helped four people do this. 
**Amanda's story**  
Amanda is 23 years old. She is a mother with two daughters. She changed lives with her friend Cindy, who is 30 years old and works in a busy restaurant in London. 
Amanda went to the restaurant. It was dark and loud. There were many people. It was very different from her home. She had to learn how to carry drinks on a tray. It was hard! The drinks fell and made a mess. Amanda felt embarrassed, but the other waitresses laughed. They said everyone makes mistakes at first. 
At 11:30 am, many customers came. Amanda felt nervous. She was worried about remembering the orders, but it was easy because there was a computer system. After a few hours, her feet hurt, and the loud music was hard to handle. She had to ask customers to repeat themselves, which was embarrassing. 
At 5 pm, Amanda was very tired. She was happy to go home to her children. She thought being a waitress was hard work!
**Cindy's story**  
Cindy is 30 years old. She was nervous about being a mother for a day, but she was also excited. Amanda's daughters were cheeky, and Cindy thought she could handle it. 
Cindy had to dress and feed the girls. After taking Sophie to school and Katie to nursery, she thought she would have some quiet time. But she had to clean the house and do laundry. 
At 1 pm, Cindy took Katie home for lunch. When Sophie came home, they started playing and making noise. Cindy tried to relax, but the girls had a lot of energy! 
At 8 pm, Cindy finally got the girls to bed. But then they wanted more water and to watch TV. Cindy realized that taking care of children is very tiring. She enjoyed the day, but it was hard work!
**Rosemary's story**  
Rosemary is 42 years old. She runs a farm. She got to sleep in until 7 am, which was nice! At school, she felt nervous in front of many students. 
In class, the children worked in groups. They did a nature project with snails. At lunchtime, teachers only have five minutes to eat. Rosemary helped with a meeting and then with sports. 
She was tired, but the children had a lot of energy. Speaking in front of the class was hard for her. She liked farming more than teaching.
**Hilary's story**  
Hilary is 30 years old. She went to Rosemary's farm at 8:30 am. Rosemary had been working for three hours already! 
On the farm, there are many animals. Hilary worked in the ice-cream shop, filling bottles and making ice-cream. She wanted to eat some! 
At lunchtime, she checked the sheep. If a sheep falls, it needs help quickly. Hilary milked the cows, which took a long time. 
Hilary felt lonely without children. Farming is hard work, and there is not much time off. Rosemary only gets a few days of holiday each year. Farming is not as easy as it seems.

**Career Power: Be a Good Leader at Work**
A. **What is a good leader?**  
A good leader is someone who inspires others. They help people and show them the way. Being a leader is not about being tall or very smart. Pat Dixon, who wrote a book about work, says that a leader makes things happen with the help of enthusiastic people. A good leader should speak clearly and confidently. They should say ""I believe"" instead of ""I think.""
B. **Everyone can be a leader.**  
John van Maurik, who teaches about leadership, says that many people can be better leaders than they think. To be a leader, you need to find your talents and use them. We all have the ability to be leaders; we just need the right situation to grow.
C. **Think about your best and worst boss.**  
Your best boss helped you and motivated you. Your worst boss made you feel small and did not share information. The best boss led well, while the worst boss just managed badly.
D. **Leaders and managers are different.**  
Managers like to work within rules. Leaders create new ideas. A good manager can keep a company running, but a good leader can change a sad company into a happy one.
E. **Improve your leadership skills.**  
1. Leadership is best when you choose to do it. Find what you love and use that energy to lead.  
2. Think of yourself as a leader. You have the power to lead.  
3. Sometimes you need to lead firmly. Try different ways of leading. If you usually ask others for their opinions, try to take charge instead.  
4. Set goals and try to achieve them. Look at your job and see where you can be a better leader.
F. **Leadership takes practice.**  
1. You become a leader by taking the lead, taking risks, and learning from mistakes. Learn to share tasks and motivate others.  
2. Your way of leading may not always please everyone. Keep working on how you communicate.  
3. Be present and available for important people.  
4. You don’t have to lead all the time. Know when you are needed and how you can help others become leaders too."

Georgina McGuiness took a long break from her job as a journalist. She felt she did not know much about new technology. In this story, she talks about how she changed her home to work better.
Last Christmas, I turned 37 years old. I wanted to go back to my job in journalism, but I felt lost. My resume showed that I was stuck in the past, like in the 1980s. Back then, I used a typewriter, and now everyone uses computers. I thought it would be hard to find a job because I did not know how to use a computer.
I thought it would be difficult to leave home before my children went to school. But then, I entered a contest in a local newspaper. My family and I won a computer! We got a laptop for my husband and a personal computer for everyone. We started to learn about the Internet and how to chat with people from around the world. My children were good with computers because they learned at school. I was scared to use the computer because I thought I would lose my work. But I learned how to use it, and it was easier than I thought.
Now, I write articles for a magazine. I can work from home and still take my children to school. The computer helps me stay organized. I can keep track of money and write letters quickly. I can also find information online for my stories and talk to other writers.
But working from home has some problems. Sometimes, I feel lonely because I do not see many people. There are also distractions at home, like chores and my children wanting to use the computer. Many people in my neighborhood are also using computers for work and fun.
A report says that many people who work from home are educated and own computers. I feel good because I am learning and using technology. One day, I hope to send my articles to a newspaper in Australia or even start my own magazine from home. The possibilities are endless!

CAE_59,C1,"**The Tartan Museum**
The Tartan Museum is in Edinburgh, Scotland. It has a modern building that looks like a cheese wedge. The outside is very big and bright. People have different opinions about the building. Some think it is beautiful, while others do not like it.
Inside the museum, there are many interesting things to see. The museum tells stories about Scotland's history. There are important objects, like jewels from Mary Queen of Scots. The museum wants to show the truth about the past.
Dr. David Clarke is in charge of the exhibitions. He wants everyone to enjoy their visit. The museum is for all people, even those who do not know much about history. There are no fake scenes; everything shown is real.
The museum has many spaces to explore. There are different rooms with light coming in from the windows. You can take your time to look at everything. There is also a special area for children to learn and play.
On the top floor, there is a gallery that changes every three years. People from Scotland choose objects that are important to them, like toys and guitars. This is a fun idea, but some think it is not serious enough.
Overall, Dr. Clarke believes that objects can tell stories about the past better than anything else. The museum is beautiful inside, but some wonder if it is in the right place."

The end of print newspapers may take some time. ""Transition"" is a nice word. It means moving from one place to another. Some people may be scared of change, but it can also be good. 
Now, newspapers are moving to the internet. This is not easy. Many people do not buy print newspapers anymore, but more people visit their websites. For example, sales of newspapers like The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian are down by 8% to 10% each year. But their websites are getting more visitors.
However, not everything is bad. A survey showed that the number of newspapers sold around the world went up by 1.1% last year. In Asia, more people are buying newspapers. Some magazines also saw an increase in sales.
E-books are very popular now, and many people are buying them. But when stores looked at the sales of real books, they found that sales were only down by 0.4%. This means people still like both e-books and real books.
Many young people still read newspapers. In fact, nearly 5 million people aged 15 to 35 read the main newspapers in the UK. Different countries have different stories. In Britain, newspaper sales are down by 10.8%, but in Germany, the drop is only 7%. In France, it is just 3.1%.
Some people thought that online ads would help newspapers make money. But now, online ads are going down. Many US newspapers have started to charge for their online content. The best way to get readers is to offer both a print copy and online access together. 
Print newspapers are still important for selling online subscriptions. They make much more money from print ads than from online ads. However, it is hard for newspapers to keep both print and online versions. But print newspapers still have a strong presence, and it is harder to be noticed online. 
**Questions:**
1. What does ""transition"" mean?
2. Are more people visiting newspaper websites or buying print newspapers?
3. How much did the number of newspapers sold go up last year?
4. How many young people read newspapers in the UK?

CAE_32,C1,"**Photographing People**
People are very interesting to photograph. A photo with a person is usually better than a photo without a person. But taking good photos of people can be hard. The photographer must pay attention to how people move and what they do. Sometimes, just having a camera can make people act differently.
**A. Grouping People**  
When taking a photo of a group, do not make them stand in a straight line. Ask them to stand at different angles and distances. Some can sit or kneel in front so you can see all their faces.
**B. Posing for Pictures**  
People often feel stiff in front of a camera. Help them relax by suggesting they put their hands in their pockets or fold them.
**C. The Right Approach**  
Do not pretend you are not taking a picture when you are. Most people will agree to have their picture taken. They may feel shy, so you might need to help them feel comfortable.
**D. Eye Contact**  
A photo looks better if the person looks at the camera. Ask them to look into the lens. They may not be able to do this for long, so remind them just before you take the picture. You can also say something funny to get a real smile.
**E. Candid Concentration**  
Instead of looking at the camera, the person can look at something else in the picture. This can make the photo feel more natural. Candid shots can show real feelings.
**F. Expressions and Gestures**  
The way a person looks and moves tells us a lot about them. A happy child can make us smile, while a sad face can make us feel sad. Look for different expressions like smiles, frowns, or thumbs-up.
**G. Situation Interest**  
The background of a photo can add more meaning. Make sure the background does not take attention away from the person. Use a wide-angle lens to make the person look bigger compared to the background.
**H. Interaction**  
Photos of people talking, laughing, or working together can be very good. Look for moments when people connect, like a handshake or a smile.
**I. People and Places**  
Many photos of people are taken on trips. To show both the person and the place, step back to get everything in the picture. Make sure the people are close to the camera but do not block the background.
**J. To Pose or Not to Pose?**  
Think about why you want to take the picture. If you want to remember someone, ask them to pose nicely. But for family photos, candid shots of real moments can be more fun and memorable."
CAE_65,C1,"Sarah Janson, the Artist**
Sarah Janson is an artist. She paints in a special way called trompe-l'oeil. This means her paintings look real, like they are not just pictures. Joanna Watt is talking to her in an interview.
Sarah does not like to sign her paintings. She thinks the painting is more important than the artist. She says, ""It's not about me, it's about the work."" At first, she feels shy about talking about herself. When Joanna asks to take her picture, Sarah covers her face because she feels embarrassed.
After a little time, Sarah feels better. The interview becomes fun and interesting. Sarah has been a trompe-l'oeil artist for sixteen years. Before that, she studied art for two years and worked in a publishing house. She did not like illustration, so she started working with a special decorator named Jim Smart. He asked her to do one trompe-l'oeil painting, and she loved it.
Sarah says that you cannot learn trompe-l'oeil from a school. You learn by looking at things. She is always learning new things. She is honest about what she cannot do well. For example, she says, ""I can't paint bread; it always looks like grey concrete."" 
Once, she had to paint a big ceiling at Lulworth Castle. She got confused with the measurements and thought, ""Who do you think you are?"" She often talks about herself in a funny way, saying things like, ""When I finished that ceiling, I thought, 'Well, I didn't do it, she did.'""
Sarah's paintings are very special. Many people want her to paint for them. She gets ideas from buildings. For example, she painted a dining room that looks like a beautiful building in Venice. She also painted a hallway that looks like it has two more rooms.
Sarah knows that trompe-l'oeil must be clever and interesting. It should make people think and feel. She loves to work with her clients. Some clients know what they want, and some do not. She listens to them and tries to understand their ideas. Many of her clients become her friends because she spends a lot of time with them.
Sarah is thankful for her clients. She says, ""I am very grateful for the mad ones who have let me loose on their walls."" They are happy with her work, and that is why she is always busy. At the end of the interview, she says again, ""I really don't like to shout about myself."" She wants her work to be quiet and not loud. But her work is very special, and many people should know about it."
CAE_61,C1,"**Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success**
Daniel Goleman talks about important skills for success at work.
A. The rules for work are changing. We are not just judged by how smart we are or by our training. We are also judged by how we manage ourselves and how we work with others. This is important when companies choose who to hire. It helps to show who will do well at work and who may not. These new rules are different from what we learned in school. Doing well in tests is not as important anymore. Now, it is more about social skills and personal qualities, like being friendly, understanding others, and being flexible. These skills are called emotional intelligence.
B. Today, many jobs do not have security. People need to have skills that they can use in different jobs. Personal qualities are very important at work. Emotional intelligence means understanding and managing our own feelings and the feelings of others. It helps us think and act better. In our work, it includes being aware of ourselves, controlling our feelings, being motivated, understanding others, and having good social skills. Some people think emotional intelligence just means being nice. But sometimes, it means being honest, even if it is uncomfortable. It is not about showing all our feelings. It is about managing our feelings so we can work well with others.
C. More companies are seeing that emotional intelligence is very important for good management. In jobs that are not simple, emotional intelligence is even more important. If someone lacks these skills, it can make it hard to use their knowledge. Many people have succeeded without strong emotional intelligence, but as work becomes more complex, companies that work well together have an advantage. In today’s workplace, where teamwork and good customer service are important, emotional intelligence is essential for doing well in any job.
D. Unlike IQ, which does not change much, emotional intelligence can grow as we learn from our experiences. Studies show that most people become better at managing their feelings and understanding others over time. This growth in emotional intelligence is called maturity. We can learn these skills and use them to help us in our jobs. This is important now, as jobs are not always stable. Emotional intelligence is not a magic solution for companies, but if we ignore it, other things may not work as well."
CAE_52,C1,"'Should the media make money from content they do not own? Digital cameras and camera phones make it easy to take pictures of news events. Social media has changed how people share these pictures. Now, some journalists look at social media for images when news happens. But, some reporters use pictures from users without asking. There are rules that say images on social media can be used without asking if it is very important. But, people still talk about if this is right or wrong. Research shows that about one in ten people will take pictures or videos of news events. This means user-generated content (UGC) is important for the media in the future. However, the media should make sure that people are paid for their work and that they always ask for permission.'"

**Acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine**
Acupuncture is a type of medicine from China. It is over 2,000 years old. Acupuncture is part of traditional Chinese medicine, which also includes herbs, massage, diet, and exercise. Many doctors in the West use acupuncture to help with pain.
**What is Traditional Chinese Medicine?**
In traditional Chinese medicine, health means that the mind, body, and spirit are in balance. There is a special energy called Qi (pronounced ""chee"") that flows in the body. This energy moves along paths called meridians. There are twelve main meridians connected to organs in the body. If the flow of Qi is blocked, a person can feel weak or sick.
When you visit an acupuncturist, they will check your pulse, look at your tongue, and ask about your health and habits. They use very thin needles to help the flow of Qi. Sometimes, they use heat from herbs or apply pressure to certain points.
**Acupuncture Points**
There are over 300 points on the meridians where acupuncturists can place needles. These points may not be near the area that hurts. People often feel a gentle ache or tingling when the needle is used. This means the needle is working with the Qi.
**How Does Acupuncture Work?**
Doctors in the West believe acupuncture can help with pain. They think it may block pain signals or release natural pain-relieving substances in the body.
**What Pain Can Acupuncture Help?**
Many people with long-term pain try acupuncture. It can help with back pain, headaches, arthritis, and pain after surgery. Acupuncturists also say it can help with menstrual pain and pain from serious illnesses.
**Using Acupuncture in Surgery**
Acupuncture has been used in China for a long time, but using it instead of anesthesia during surgery started in the 1950s. In China, acupuncture is used in many surgeries. Some people say it helps reduce pain without side effects.
**Is Acupuncture Always Effective?**
Studies show that 50 to 80 percent of people find acupuncture helps with chronic pain. It may take six to seven visits to feel better, but some people feel improvement after two or three visits.
**A Different Way to Treat Pain**
Acupuncturists look at the whole person, not just the pain. They ask many questions to understand the pain better. They want to know if the pain feels sharp or dull and if it gets worse in different weather. This is different from how many doctors treat pain.
**Choosing an Acupuncturist**
Some doctors have training in traditional acupuncture, while others use scientific methods. It is important to choose a good acupuncturist. They should refer you to a doctor if you need more help."

The pen is stronger than the doctor. People are studying handwriting to learn about a person's character. In some countries, if you want a job, you may need to show your handwriting. This handwriting can help decide if you are right for the job. Handwriting analysis, or graphology, is seen as a real science in many places. Some researchers say it can help show certain health problems, like heart disease and cancer, and can show feelings and mental states.
Many big companies now use graphologists to look at the handwriting of people who want important jobs. But many doctors do not believe in graphology. Patricia Marne is a graphologist with over 20 years of experience. She thinks doctors should pay more attention to handwriting. She believes handwriting can show mental traits and some health issues. She says, ""Handwriting can show social class and intelligence. It can also help decide if a person should study arts or sciences.""
According to Ms. Marne, handwriting can help find out if someone might be a criminal. She says, ""Criminals often have bad handwriting. They may have had a hard life and may not have grown emotionally. This can show in childish handwriting."" She can tell if people are honest or not. 
Ms. Marne says that handwriting can show if someone is under stress or has mental problems. It can also show health issues with the heart and lungs. She says, ""You cannot make a diagnosis from one sample. But if handwriting changes over time, it could mean something serious is happening."" 
Ms. Marne explains that handwriting can show other traits. For example, if letters are connected like threads, the person may be clever but not honest. If someone writes mostly in capital letters, they may be hiding their true self. Light pressure in writing shows sensitivity. If handwriting is very small, it may mean the person feels shy. 
Ms. Marne says it takes six years to learn how to analyze handwriting well. She believes more research is needed to make graphology a real science. She thinks it is better than psychoanalysis because it can show a person's history without asking questions. 
However, many doctors do not agree. They say handwriting is just a result of education and has no special meaning. 
**Questions:**
1. What is graphology?
2. Why do some companies use graphologists?
3. What can handwriting show about a person?
4. How long does it take to learn to analyze handwriting?
5. What do some doctors think about graphology?"

Is your office good to work in? Fresh air and good chairs are important for happy and healthy workers, according to a new survey. We visited four different offices to see how healthy and happy they are. We had three experts with us: a building health consultant, an ergonomist (who studies work conditions), and an occupational psychologist. Here are their opinions.
**Office A: Advertising Agency**  
- **Building Health Consultant:** This office is very simple. It has no central heating and no air conditioning. The windows open to the street. The workers are happy and work well together. They change the office temperature by opening doors or using electric heaters, like at home.  
- **Ergonomist:** The furniture does not match. Some chairs are old and broken. This is not good for health. But the workers have different tasks, like meeting clients and making presentations. This helps them not feel tired or bored.  
- **Occupational Psychologist:** The workers like the variety of tasks. They say the office is ""just the right size"" – small enough to know each other, but big enough to work alone. The office is fun and creative.
**Office B: News Service**  
- **Building Health Consultant:** This office is not very exciting, but it is comfortable. The air is good, and there is a No Smoking policy.  
- **Ergonomist:** The chairs are very good, and the lighting is nice. The space is okay, but the layout could be better. The walls are plain and boring.  
- **Occupational Psychologist:** The walls have some planners and a poster about maternity rights. Most workers have been there for five years and get along well. The office could be better if desks were arranged to share information easily.
**Office C: Bank**  
- **Building Health Consultant:** This office has mixed feelings from workers. It feels like being in a glass box. The air is not stale, even with smokers nearby.  
- **Ergonomist:** The office is standard and not inspiring. The desks are okay, but some chairs are not good for working on computers.  
- **Occupational Psychologist:** The workers help each other and use technology well. The office is busy, but the colors are dark.
**Office D: Newspaper**  
- **Building Health Consultant:** This office is not good. The air conditioning does not work well, and the temperature changes a lot. The space is messy, and there is too much dust.  
- **Ergonomist:** The furniture is not good for working. Many chairs are old and do not help workers.  
- **Occupational Psychologist:** The office is dirty, with old chairs and carpets. It needs cleaning and better air conditioning. Workers seem stressed and do not talk much. The company should encourage teamwork.

CAE_38,C1,"**Chewing Gum Culture**
Chewing gum is popular in America. People chew 12 million sticks of gum every day. It is a type of food and must follow rules from the American Food and Drug Administration.
Today, most gum is made with chemicals. It has added ingredients to keep the flavor and make it soft. Long ago, the ancient Greeks chewed a natural gum from a tree called the mastic tree. Women in Greece used it to clean their teeth and make their breath fresh.
In America, colonists learned to chew gum from the Native Americans. They chewed a resin from spruce trees. In the early 1800s, people sold spruce gum in the eastern United States. This was the first commercial chewing gum in America.
Modern chewing gum started in the late 1860s with a substance called chicle. Chicle comes from the sapodilla tree in Central America. Gum made from chicle was smoother and more enjoyable to chew. However, it is hard to find chicle now. 
Today, many gum makers use synthetic materials instead of chicle. The few people who still gather chicle, called chicleros, have a tough life. They walk for miles in hot and humid conditions to collect the sap from the trees. They face dangers like snakes and insects. 
Chicleros take the sap to a camp, where they boil it to make it sticky. Their food is often just maize and a local drink made from sugar cane. Even though their work is hard, chicleros worry about losing their jobs. 
In the past, the United States imported a lot of chicle from Central America. But now, much less chicle is collected. As gum sales have increased, companies use more synthetic materials to save money.
Chewing gum is said to help with relaxation and reduce tooth decay. When we eat, acid forms in our mouths. Chewing gum can help our saliva fight this acid. Gum makers say that chewing for 20 minutes can help our saliva flow more.
There are many new flavors and types of gum. Some flavors are natural, but many are made with chemicals. In America, a large area is used to grow mint for the most popular chewing gums."

A. **Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)**  
Doug and his friend Dougal were in a snow cave. They were 91 meters below the top. Dougal talked about sleeping bags, which was strange because only they were there. Doug felt cold in his feet and remembered other climbers who lost fingers and toes. He thought about how to climb better to reach the top.
B. **Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)**  
This mountain is very dangerous. In April 1976, Doug and Dougal went to the Kahiltna Glacier. They carried equipment and food for four days. They climbed a new route to the top. They were very tired but finally reached the summit and felt happy.

Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. She has a big garden around her house. This garden has many flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow everywhere in the garden. There are two long flower beds along a path in the garden. The colors and shapes of the flowers are very nice. The people who lived there before Susan were good gardeners. They left many plants that Susan likes. She also kept the gardener, Danny. 
Susan says, ""It was really his garden."" She and Danny worked well together. At first, Danny did not like some of the flowers Susan wanted to paint. But when she told him she wanted to paint them, he understood.
Susan likes to paint one flower at a time. Sometimes she picks a flower and takes it to her studio. She does not paint everything at once. She paints one flower, which can take a few days. Then she brings in another flower. Sometimes it takes a long time to finish a painting.
Spring and early summer are busy times for Susan. This is when the tulips and poppies bloom. She loves to see how flowers change. For example, when she puts tulips in water, they change shape and look beautiful. At first, they may seem boring, but they become interesting.
Susan has always liked plants. She studied botany in school and collected wild flowers. She did not like garden flowers because they looked fake to her. She liked wild flowers that grew in tough places, like rocks or cliffs.
Now, her garden has many plants from different countries. They grow well in her garden. Susan is relaxed about her garden, like a kind aunt who lets children play as long as they are careful. 
Susan is busy preparing for two art shows. She has a lot of flowers to paint, but she finds it hard to work in the garden. She now has another gardener to help her. Even though she is busy, she knows that to paint flowers well, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""

Many trees in Brackham fell down in a big storm in March. The town lost two big lime trees from the market square. This made the town look very different, and some people were not happy about it.
Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham was the head of the local police. But during the storm, he was very sick with bronchitis. He had a headache and a tight chest. His wife, Molly, wanted him to see a doctor, but he did not want to go. He thought the police needed him. He tried to keep working, but he felt worse.
Finally, his colleague, Sergeant Lloyd, took him to the doctor. Pelham was too tired to argue. Soon, he got medicine and went home. Molly sent him to bed. 
On Thursday morning, Molly told him that the walnut tree in their garden had fallen down. Pelham was too sick to understand. On Thursday evening, he asked if the house was okay. When he heard it was fine, he felt relieved and went back to bed.
On Saturday, Pelham felt better. He got up and saw that the living room looked different without the walnut tree. Their house had a big garden, and Pelham liked it. The garden made them feel private. 
Before, the walnut tree made the living room look nice. Now, without the tree, the room was too bright, and the old furniture looked bad. The view from the window was not nice either. The tall house next door, which was hidden by the tree, was now visible. It had ugly purple bricks and many windows that seemed to watch the Pelhams.
“Doesn’t it look terrible?” Pelham said to Molly. But Molly seemed happy. “I told you we need to buy a new sofa, no matter the cost.”"
FCE_16,B2,"Living in the Valley**
We lived in our valley for sixteen months. One day, we saw that the hills around us could be dangerous. It was a year when storms came early, before winter. Until then, we felt safe in our valley. 
Then, snow began to fall. In one day, there was 15 centimeters of snow. The snow blocked our road and made the path by the stream slippery. In the hills, the snow was deeper and stayed longer. The wind was very strong up there. In our valley, we felt only some wind. The trees moved, but they did not break. 
We were worried about the river, the Ryburn. It usually flowed gently, but now it was dangerous. Many years ago, people built dams to control the water from the hills. 
Soon, the snow started to melt. Every day, we saw dark clouds over the hills. The clouds looked scary. We watched the river, which was getting fuller and wilder. The snow melted, and rain came from the clouds. The reservoir in the hills was filling up quickly. 
Then, the reservoir overflowed for the first time in years. Water poured over the dam like a waterfall. The river became wild and deep near our cottage. For three days, we hoped the river would not flood. Luckily, the dam held, and the water went down. 
Before the dam was built, the river flooded nearby villages many times. Now, the dam keeps the river safe. We can enjoy the clouds over the valley and feel safe in our home."

Mark Adams is a film critic. He has worked for a newspaper called The Front Page for ten years. Writing about films for this newspaper was his first real job. Before this, he wrote reviews for books and films for other newspapers and magazines. He also worked for the radio. 
He met Tom Seaton, who was the first arts editor of The Front Page. Tom hired Mark. Tom was not a journalist, so he did not choose his staff carefully. He wanted a team of critics to write about books, TV, theatre, film, and radio. They would have lunch together every week to talk about what to write. Mark felt happy to be part of a new newspaper. 
At first, Mark was surprised when he saw someone reading The Front Page on the London Underground. They were reading a page with his review. Mark did not feel confident. 
Tom's idea for a team of critics did not work out. They did not meet as planned, so they talked by phone. People liked to read reviews from critics who focused on one subject. Mark chose to write about films. 
Now, Mark writes a long article every week about one film. He likes this way of working. He does not want to be a standard film critic who watches every new film. He thinks that would make him tired of his job. 
Mark believes people choose films based on stars, ads, or the director. He thinks a film review is not just a guide for buying tickets. He does not feel he must always be right about a film. He just wants to share his opinion. He does not want to be a judge of films.

Why would a schoolgirl want to swim 1500 meters, cycle 40 kilometers, and then run 10 kilometers? Because ""it's fun."" 
Melanie Sears is a teenager who loves sports. She is looking for a training partner who also likes to swim, cycle, and run. It is important to be very interested in running long distances, swimming in cold water, and cycling long distances. You need to do all three sports without taking a break.
The triathlon is a popular Olympic sport. Many people watch athletes swim 1500 meters, cycle 40 kilometers, and then run 10 kilometers without stopping. It looks hard, but Melanie thinks it is fun. 
Melanie started doing triathlons when she was 14 years old. She won her first race, but she was the only junior in it. She felt confident and entered the National Championships. She swam fast and ran fast, but she got lost and cycled too far. She cried while running, but she did not give up. 
Melanie works very hard. She is the top junior in the European Triathlon Championships. She finished 13th. She wants to get better at cycling. She is asking her parents to buy her a new bike for the World Championships in New Zealand. 
Melanie trains a lot, so she does not go out with friends. She says, ""I don't have a social life."" After swimming for two hours, she just wants to sleep. But she still talks to her teammates about their times in races. 
Melanie has tried shorter races, but she wants to do even harder events. She says, ""The big trouble is, I have no one my age to train with."""
FCE_70,B2,"The Collectors**
Amanda Roy writes about collecting things and why many people like this hobby. Many adults enjoy collecting. It is a fun and exciting world. But if you want to collect something, remember: you should love the object. 
People have collected things for a long time. Long ago, early humans collected pebbles and wore them. They liked the shapes and colors of the pebbles. Today, children still collect stones and seashells because they are beautiful.
I have collected things all my life. I started with stones from my parents' garden when I was six years old. I went to a school in a cold place in England. When my parents visited, they took me to a museum. The museum had many interesting objects collected by people. I loved looking at them.
Many adults also like to collect. Some people collect because it makes them feel in control. For me, I just enjoy it. One famous collector was the Duc de Berry in France. He had a ""room of wonders"" with many strange and beautiful things. Another collector, Catherine the Great of Russia, had more than 4,000 paintings.
You do not need to be rich to collect. I have collected tulip bulbs and china cups. I remember when I got a special tulip from another collector. I planted it, but one year it disappeared. Someone took it!
I also collected 350 American rag dolls. I looked all over the USA for them. Sadly, my collection was lost in a fire. The next day, I saw the burned remains of my dolls and furniture. I was very sad.
I find it interesting how collections change hands. A silver spoon that belonged to a king is very valuable. When small objects become popular, their prices go up. For example, toys from the 1950s are now worth a lot, especially if you keep the original boxes. I wish I had kept mine!"

We always went to Ireland in June. The four of us, Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia, and me, Milly, spent the first two weeks of June at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. It is a big house by the sea, near the village of Ardbeag. An English couple, Mr. and Mrs. Malseed, own the house. They made it bigger, but it looks nice. Strafe found Glencorn for us. He saw an advertisement a long time ago.
Last summer, we went to a hotel that friends recommended, but it was not good because the food was bad. We have played cards together for a long time. My real name is Dorothy Milson, but my friends call me Milly. Dekko got his nickname at school. He and Strafe were friends in school, so we call Strafe by his last name.
We are all about the same age and live near the town where the Malseeds lived before moving to Ireland. Mrs. Malseed always smiles and welcomes us when we arrive. She seems to know when guests come. She tells the porter, Arthur, to take our bags to our rooms. The rooms are named after flowers: Rose, Tulip, Lily, and Geranium. Mrs. Malseed painted flowers on the doors instead of numbers.
Mr. Malseed greets us with a big smile and says, ""A hundred thousand welcomes!"" Everyone is happy, and we feel our holiday has started. Nothing has changed at Glencorn, and everything is good. Kitty from the dining room comes to say hello. She tells us we look younger every year, and everyone laughs.
After dinner, we played cards for a little while because we were tired from the trip. In the lounge, there was a man alone and a French couple. Many people were at dinner because Glencorn Lodge is full in June. From our table, we could see some guests walking on the grass and others going down to the beach.
In the morning, we would walk on the sand to Ardbeag and have coffee at the hotel there. Then we would come back for lunch. In the afternoon, we would drive somewhere. We liked this routine because we loved the beautiful landscape of Glencorn Lodge.

Miss Rita Cohen was a small girl. She looked much younger than Seymour's daughter, Marie, but she said she was six years older. One day, she came to Seymour's factory. She wore big clothes and had messy hair, but her face was pretty. Seymour was surprised that she was studying at the University of Pennsylvania. She was doing research about leather in New Jersey for her Master's degree.
Sometimes, students called or wrote to Seymour to ask if they could see his factory. He liked to help serious students by answering their questions or giving them a short tour. Rita was very small, like the children from Marie's class who visited the factory years ago. Seymour showed them how to make gloves. He remembered how Marie loved to see the special table where the workers shaped the gloves with hot metal hands. Marie called them ""pancake hands.""
Rita asked, ""How many pieces come in a shipment?"" Seymour replied, ""Between twenty and twenty-five thousand."" She wrote down the answers. She asked, ""Do they come to your shipping department?"" Seymour said, ""No, they go to the tannery. We buy the material, and they make it ready for us. My family worked in the tannery. I worked there for six months too. Have you ever been inside a tannery?"" Rita said, ""Not yet."" Seymour said, ""You should go if you want to write about leather. I can help you. The tannery is old and not very nice, but it is interesting. The first clothes were made from animal skins.""
Seymour said, ""My father knows a lot about leather. You should talk to him. He can talk for a long time about gloves. Do you know how things are made, Miss Cohen?"" Rita replied, ""Not really. I saw my mother make a cake when I was a child."" Seymour laughed. He liked her spirit and her desire to learn.

In the lumberyard by the lake, there was an old brick building with two floors. Outside, there were big piles of soft sawdust. The sawdust looked like golden mountains. One afternoon, Michael and his friends went up the ladder to the roof of the building. They sat with their legs hanging over the edge and looked at the lake.
Suddenly, Michael said, ""I dare you to jump down!"" He jumped off the roof and fell into the sawdust. He rolled around and laughed. ""I dare you all!"" he shouted. He called them cowards and wanted them to jump too. The friends looked scared, but one by one, they jumped down and laughed.
They lay on the sawdust and told jokes. Then one friend said, ""Let’s go up to the roof again and jump down."" They were not very excited, but they went up again. They jumped off until only Michael was left. The others called, ""Come on, Mike! What’s wrong?""
Michael wanted to jump, but he stayed on the edge of the roof. He felt nervous and smiled silly. He tried to count to ten and then jump, but he could not. The friends laughed at him and said, ""You are a coward! We can’t wait all night!"" When he did not jump, they started to leave.
Michael felt sad and looked at the ground. He stayed on the roof for a long time. The sun was getting bigger and bigger in the sky. His clothes were wet from sweating. Finally, he closed his eyes and jumped down into the sawdust. He lay there for a long time. The yard was quiet because the workers had gone home.
Michael felt ashamed and got up slowly. He walked home and was late for dinner. His stepmother said, ""You should be home on time. If not, you can stay out tonight."" She was a kind woman with soft skin and a little grey in her hair. But Michael did not listen. He was still thinking about his friends laughing at him."
FCE_44,B2,"**Careers Advice**
Are you unhappy in your job? Do you want to change? Kitty Doherty has some good advice. Many people who want a new job go to a careers adviser. First, you write a short history of yourself. Then, you take some tests called 'psychometrics'. After the tests, you get a report with suggestions for jobs and training.
I tried Career Analysts, a big company that gives career advice. The test was like a school exam. I was with about ten people, and we answered questions quickly. I had to remember that it was not about passing or failing. The tests were hard. They asked me to find mistakes in names and numbers and to match shapes. After the tests, I talked with an adviser. He gave me a report with his thoughts and suggestions. I agreed with most of what he said, but I was sad to see that I did not do well in science and technical tests. I am glad I did not become a nurse! But it was good to hear that I made the right choice for journalism.
Changing your career does not always mean a big change. Last March, Donna Laney, 25, lost her job as a marketing manager. Her friends told her to go to Career Analysts for help. She said, ""Losing my job was a chance to think about my career. I wanted to look at my skills and interests."" Some results surprised her. ""I did not know I was good at design. But I had to think about the cost of training in design,"" she said. She also thought about taking a year off to work in the Far East. In the end, she used her skills and moved to a job in Public Relations. She said, ""I think I would have found this job without Career Analysts, but they helped me see what I really wanted to do. I have sent six friends there, and they are all happy.""
Some people feel they need help. Juliet Greene, 26, went to Career Counselling Services. She worked at a bank for six years and thought her job was boring. She said, ""I did not know what I wanted to do, so I went to Career Counselling Services with an open mind."" She took tests that showed she liked sciences. She had four meetings with an adviser. The third meeting was recorded, which helped her remember what she said. After the fourth meeting, she decided to study geology. She said, ""The advice from Career Counselling Services was worth the money. I am much happier now.""
But not everyone finds careers advice helpful. Amanda Margetts, 24, was a sales representative. She said, ""I did not know where to go in my career. I thought a careers adviser might help me. I got many new ideas, but I did not like them because they needed a big pay cut or a lot of training. I did not learn anything new about myself. If I told a friend my story, they would give me the same advice."""
FCE_22,B2,"Fun at the Dentist's**
If you go to W. Lloyd Jerome's dental office in Glasgow, you will see bright paintings on the wall and a blue couch. Patients sit on the couch while he checks their teeth. Jerome says, ""Many people only go to the dentist when they have pain. They are scared."" To help with this, he wants to make the office a nice place. He does not wear a white coat because many people think white coats mean pain. He believes dental visits should be relaxing and fun.
Jerome uses new ideas to help people relax. He was the first dentist in Britain to use virtual-reality headsets. Patients wear these headsets during their check-up. They sit on the blue couch and watch a film about underwater animals while he looks at their teeth. Then, the headset shows them a video of their mouth. Many patients like this part of their visit.
The office smells nice, like a perfume shop. Today, it smells like orange. Jerome wants people to feel that this is not a normal dentist's office. The usual dentist smell can make people scared. I thought the nice smell in the office was very good.
Jerome is known as a fashionable dentist, but he takes his work seriously. The relaxation ideas are important, but good treatment is the most important. He uses a special tool that sprays warm water to clean teeth instead of scraping them. It feels a little strange, but it is not painful if people are relaxed.
Five years ago, Jerome went to the United States to learn about dental techniques. He says, ""When you make it easier for the patient, it is easier for you too."" He wants to change the way dentists work in Britain to be less formal.
One day, a patient comes in. Jerome quickly goes to him, offers tea, asks what video he wants to watch, and leads him to the chair. The patient seems to enjoy this special treatment. The office feels more like a nice beauty salon than a regular dentist's office."
FCE_39,B2,"Chocolate and Its History**
Chocolate comes from South America. Now, it is a big business around the world. In Britain, people spend a lot of money on chocolate at Easter. They buy more chocolate at Easter than at any other time, except for Christmas.
A long time ago, the Aztecs, Toltecs, and Mayans grew the cacao plant. This plant is found in warm places like Africa and South America. The cacao tree has big fruit with seeds inside. When the seeds are dried, they are called cacao beans. In English, they are often called cocoa beans. 
The Aztecs used cocoa beans as money. They also made a drink called xocoatl, which means ""bitter water."" This drink was special and had spices in it. The Spanish liked to add sugar and cinnamon to the drink. 
In the late 1600s, people in Europe started to drink chocolate in special places called chocolate houses. At first, people made the drink from solid chocolate. In 1826, a man named CJ van Houten made chocolate powder. This made it easier to make chocolate drinks.
In 1847, a company in Bristol made the first chocolate bar. Later, a Swiss company added milk to make milk chocolate. 
In the late 1800s, French companies sold a lot of chocolate in Britain. But then, Cadbury made the Dairy Milk bar in 1905. This chocolate bar became very popular because of good advertising.
Today, people in Britain eat about four chocolate bars each week. Chocolate companies are trying new ideas to sell more chocolate, like making chocolate ice cream or drinks. 
Cacao farmers still have problems because the price of cocoa beans went down in the 1980s. Many small farmers had to stop working. So, when you eat chocolate, think about the farmers who grow cacao."

Peter shows his work in his apartment. He asks, ""Am I boring you?"" He is not boring; he is very interesting and friendly. He has made many lovely things. He points to some shell decorations above his fireplace. He says, ""I don’t mind if people don’t buy them. I love them."" Peter never planned to sell his work. Five years ago, some friends told him to have an exhibition. They said, ""People should see your work!"" They helped him talk to a gallery owner.
His first exhibition was in London, and 70% of his art was sold. His second exhibition opened yesterday. The prices for his art are high, around £2,000 for some pieces. There are 86 pieces in the exhibition, with prices starting at £225 for a shell flower in a vase. Peter says he does not set the prices. He believes his work is special, and one day, people will want it even more.
Peter wishes he had started making art earlier. He thinks he could have made even better things. Now, he feels a bit limited because he is older. But his work is very different from the common shell art you see in shops. He has a ""miniature mind,"" which means he makes small, detailed art. He creates boxes with tiny shells, pictures made from shells, and baskets of beautiful flowers.
Peter uses different materials for his art. He uses cardboard from shirts for flower bases, glue from a sail-maker, and washing-up liquid to clean the shells. He has a clear idea of what he wants to make, and he works hard to make it happen. 
Peter travels to many places to find beautiful shells. He has been to France, Thailand, Mexico, South Africa, and the Philippines. He looks for shells on the beach. He only collects dead shells and does not take shells with living creatures. He believes that many shells are broken by people walking on the beach. He thinks it is okay to collect shells that are empty. 
Peter's work is beautiful, and he loves what he does."

Father and son look for gold
Terence and Chris Madden are a father and son. They have traveled from cold Canada to hot Africa to find gold. Terence is an explorer, and Chris is a mineral expert. They think their mine on a Welsh mountain has a lot of gold, maybe 10,000 ounces. After ten years of digging, they believe they are very close to finding a lot of gold worth five million dollars.
Terence, who is 68 years old and from Liverpool, said, ""As we dig, we find gold. We just need to dig a little more."" They have worked hard to find gold. Their search started when Terence read about gold in the 'Dolgellau gold belt' near the town of Dolgellau in Wales. They looked at old mining books and chose a good place to dig.
They cleared the land, found some gold in the rocks, and spent ten years getting permission to work. They took samples of the earth and removed old cars and trash. They dug out 150 tonnes of rock to make a tunnel and a 10-metre hole. Now, they need more money. They spent their savings and need to find someone to give them £50,000 to dig deeper for the gold.
Chris said, ""It looks hard to find a backer, but we have some people to contact."" Last week, people in the valleys heard about the dig, and many became interested in gold. Dolgellau needs tourists, and people are hopeful. Peter Woolven, the manager of the Royal Ship Hotel, said, ""If they find gold, it will bring more people here, but I hope many people do not come and damage the hillside.""
The gold industry in Wales has become smaller since the late 1880s when many people worked in many mines. One of the last mines, Clogau-St David's, closed a month ago. Now, more individual gold diggers are coming back. George Hall, another gold seeker, wants to dig a tunnel on the other side of the hill from the Maddens. He is 70 years old and said, ""Searching for gold is exciting. It is like finding hidden treasure. Maybe I will be lucky this time."" 
**Questions:**
1. Who are Terence and Chris Madden?
2. Where did they travel from and to?
3. How much gold do they think they can find?
4. What do they need to dig deeper?
5. What does Peter Woolven hope for if they find gold?"
FCE_31,B2,"IN HOT WATER**
Rachel Mills is a scientist. She works at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. Rachel studies marine geochemistry. This means she looks at the chemicals in the sea. She teaches at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University.
When Rachel is not teaching, she goes into a small steel vehicle. This vehicle is for exploring underwater. It is the size of a small car. Rachel dives three kilometres down into the ocean to study underwater volcanoes. Inside the vehicle, there is not much space. She can touch the two pilots. They cannot stand up or move. They must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside.
A dive can last for 16 hours. It takes three hours to go down, ten hours to collect rock and water samples, and three hours to come back up. If there is a problem, Rachel can hit a panic button. This makes a small escape vessel come out. It goes quickly to the surface, like a ping-pong ball in water. Rachel thinks it would not be a nice trip.
The first time Rachel got into the vehicle, she was nervous. She was on a ship with an instructor. He told her what to do in an emergency. They tested how she would feel in a small space. Now, Rachel has made six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian team. They went to a place five days away from the Canary Islands. There are many underwater volcanoes there. The Russian team was dropping off equipment to study a project that would make a hole through a volcano.
When Rachel is not at sea, she is in her office at the Oceanography Centre. She loves teaching, but she also wants to do research on ""black smokers."" This is another name for underwater volcanoes. Water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke. It comes out very fast and is very hot.
Once, Rachel was scared when she dived with an American team. They were using equipment when there was a loud explosion. Rachel thought she would die. They waited in silence, but they were still alive. The relief was amazing!
Diving to the bottom of the ocean is an adventure for Rachel. Every time she looks out of the window, she sees the chimneys of the volcanoes. She feels wonder because no one else has seen them. Rachel studied black smokers for three years for her PhD. When she saw them for real, it was an amazing feeling."
FCE_58,B2,"""I was dirty, smelly, hungry, and a little tan. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. I was very tired. I could not understand any more train times, money, or languages. I said, 'Never again,' when I got home. I said the same thing the next year and the year after. I just had to buy one train ticket. Because I was under twenty-five, I could travel anywhere in Europe for a whole month. 
Sleeping in a train corridor is different from sleeping in a bed. Carrying my things in a backpack made me travel simply. I learned to throw away things I did not need, like old socks and books. This is part of the fun of Inter-Rail. With a ticket in my hand, I felt free. 
On my first trip, my friends and I did not know how special this train ticket was. We thought it was just a cheap way to get to our campsite in southern France. But we wanted to see more countries. The extra miles did not cost us anything. We were excited to travel. This was our first holiday without parents. We made our own plans and only saw the things that were easy to find. 
I was proud that sometimes all I wanted to see was the view from the train station. We just wanted to enjoy our time. We shared the train floor, food, water, money, and music with other travelers. 
Traveling is exciting because you see places you only heard about before. When the train arrives, you see the city for the first time. You can only really know Europe by seeing it yourself. Everyone knows about it, but it is different when you see it. This is why other people's holiday photos can be boring. The train trip may not show you new things in the world, but it is a special experience. Europe is big, and Inter-Rail helps you see this."""
FCE_37,B2,"
It is very disappointing to arrive at an airport in another country and find out that your bags are not there. You may have to wear the same clothes for a long time until the airline finds your luggage. Sometimes, you may be in a different place with different weather and have to wear clothes that are not right for that place.
Airlines do not often say how many bags they lose, but it happens to many travelers. Even good airlines can make mistakes. It is hard for any airline to promise that your checked bags will go on the same flight as you, especially if you have to change planes.
Airlines ask passengers to arrive at the airport early. This is to give enough time for bags to be checked and put on the plane. There is also a minimum time needed to change planes. This time is often longer to help with bag transfers. Usually, this system works well. But sometimes, extra security checks and air traffic problems can delay flights. This can cause bags to be lost. Human mistakes can also happen, like if a bag label comes off.
Big airports, called 'hubs', can have more problems because many bags are processed there. For example, last year, Heathrow airport in London had over 41 million passengers, and many of them were changing planes. British Airways had two million transfer passengers at Heathrow.
Even good airports like Amsterdam and Singapore can have bad days. Some airports, like Miami in the United States, are known for losing bags when passengers change planes quickly.
To avoid losing your bags, try to choose direct flights and check in early. If you must change planes, try to use the same airline. Allow more time to change planes by taking an earlier flight. Make sure to put your name and address on your bags, inside and outside. Don’t forget to write your flight numbers.
If your luggage is still missing, talk to the airline staff in the baggage area and fill out a report before you leave the airport."
FCE_2,B2,"The Kingfisher**
The kingfisher is a beautiful bird. It is blue and green. It lives near rivers and streams. The kingfisher eats fish. 
In the places where kingfishers live, there are old trees. These trees give some shade to the water. The colors around are soft greens, browns, and yellows from the sun. The sound of water is soft and nice. 
The kingfisher moves very fast. It looks like a flash of light. It is here for a moment and then it is gone. Charlie James is a wildlife photographer. He loves kingfishers. He does not know why he loves them so much. 
There are stories about kingfishers. In Greek myths, a kingfisher is a bird that was once a moon goddess. Another story says that the kingfisher flew so high that its body became blue like the sky. 
Kingfishers do not have blue color in their feathers. They look blue because of how their feathers are made. The light makes them look blue or green. 
Charlie James has a strong passion for kingfishers. He likes to watch them from a hideout. His first hideout was an old blanket over his head. He waited near a place where kingfishers like to go. The bird came back very quickly and sat close to him. 
Charlie spent a lot of time by a stream with kingfishers. But he missed school because he wanted to be with the birds. He did not do well in school. At 16, he started working for a nature magazine. Later, he became a wildlife film cameraman. 
Now, Charlie wants to make a special film about kingfishers. He wants to show their beauty with pictures, not words. He loves to take photos of their wings. 
Charlie feels a strong connection to kingfishers. His photos show some of his feelings, but there is much more to his love for these birds."
FCE_68,B2,"Conducting an Orchestra**
Giving directions to an orchestra is not easy. Anne Inglis talks to five new conductors about their work.
A. ANNE MANSON  
Anne Manson is 30 years old. She asked to watch conductor Claudio Abbado's practice in Vienna. She ended up helping him because an assistant was not there. She was not nervous when she took the first rehearsal. Anne is from America and works with a London opera company. She focuses on modern music. She has also worked in other European countries with help from the British Arts Council.
B. ANDREW CONSTANTINE  
Andrew Constantine is 31 years old. He says the hardest part of being a conductor is getting good chances to work. He won a big competition in 1991 after trying two times before. He is happy it happened when it did. The competition gave him many chances to perform and work with a famous conductor. He hopes people will not only remember him for the competition. He is now working with the English Chamber Orchestra again.
C. WASFI KANI  
Wasfi Kani started Pimlico Opera. She loves the long practice time for opera. She began conducting in her late twenties. After university, she worked in London until Pimlico Opera became professional two years ago. She learned a lot from her teacher, Sian Edwards. Wasfi likes the complex nature of opera because there are many arguments and different personalities.
D. ROGER VIGNOLES  
Roger Vignoles is 48 years old. He says conducting surprised him, but he finds it very interesting. He started as a musician in an opera house and worked with good conductors. Last year, he directed Handel's Agrippina for the first time. He found it easier than he thought. He knows the music well and tries to get the best performance. He learns from all his experiences and is open to new opportunities.
E. WAYNE MARSHALL  
Wayne Marshall is 32 years old. In 1986, conductor Simon Rattle noticed him and told his agent about him. Wayne soon had to conduct a musical in London with little notice. It was a tough start. Some musicians were not paying attention during the show. He was firm with them and tried to get the best result. Wayne has not studied conducting formally, but he is determined and knows what he likes.

FCE_23,B2,"Fun at Theme Parks**
If you want to take children to a theme park, there are many in Britain. Here are five families who visited some parks.
**Fun Island - The Burns Family**  
Last year, we went to a big theme park in the US. We thought Fun Island would be boring, but it was fun! The park is good for younger children. Our three-year-old had a great time. The kids loved the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. There is a special ride for little kids, and they enjoyed it. For older kids, there are exciting rides like Splash Out, where you jump into a pool! After five hours, we were tired, but the kids wanted to stay. The park was clean and safe, and the staff were very helpful.
**Wonderland - The McMillan Family**  
None of us had been to a theme park before, so we were excited. We thought Oscar was too young, but he loved it! He liked the Mountain Train and Little Land, where there are small models of famous buildings. The older kids enjoyed the ferris wheel and driving toy cars. We spent six hours there and found nice places to rest. The staff were friendly and helpful.
**Adventure World - The Jeffree Family**  
After seven hours, we still wanted to see more. The kids loved the Big Top Circus, which was very exciting. We tried the Terror Line, and the girls were scared but said it was fun. Their favorite ride was Running River, which looked scary but wasn’t. For younger kids, Toy Land is very fun. The park is clean, and the staff are nice. One staff member helped me with one of my girls when I couldn’t sit with both.
**The Great Park - The Langridge Family**  
We got to the park at one o'clock and were sad it closed at 5 p.m. This park is great for younger kids because the rides are not too scary. I am scared of rides, but I had fun. We loved Exotic Travels, a boat ride that was exciting. We waited for half an hour for Lightning River, and it was over quickly! I didn’t want to go on the Big Leap, but it looked fun. The kids loved the rides.
**Fantasy World - The Break-all Family**  
The park says there is ""No Limit to the Fun,"" and we felt that was true. The Rocket is the tallest roller-coaster in Europe, and Ben thought it was the scariest ride. Jennie thought the Hanger, where you hang upside-down, was worse! There are many rides, and the older kids went on them many times. Sarah was too small for some rides but liked the Long Slide. Some staff were nice to the younger kids, but not all were friendly. You need a whole day to enjoy Fantasy World. We didn’t want to tell the kids we were going home early."
FCE_60,B2,"Running a Business in the Countryside**
Five women talk about their experiences starting a business in the countryside.
A. ""My customers are friends,"" says Christine Hogan. She has a computer design business. She makes over £200,000 a year and has four full-time workers. ""My husband and I moved from London to the countryside when our children were small. I wanted to work at home. I worked with computers before I got married. My husband said I should start a computer design business. It was hard at first and I needed a lot of money. I told the bank manager if I would spend too much. Working from home saves money, and I can work in the evening if I want. My business is small. People from the area come to pick up their work.""
B. ""I enjoy being independent,"" says Maggy Sasanow. She designs greeting cards from home. ""I studied art at university and wanted to work in a museum. But when I got married, we moved to the countryside, and there were no jobs like that. So, I started my own business. I make 50 different greeting cards and sell them to museums. I work in a big room upstairs. The bad thing about working from home is that there is always something to do, like mowing the lawn. I don’t advertise; people tell others about my work. I am cheaper than other artists. I work alone, so I don’t share ideas with others, but I like it more than not.""
C. ""It has been hard at times,"" says Delia Turner. She makes curtains. ""I started my business eight years ago. At first, it was good, and my income grew from £24,000 to £80,000 in two years. I had six workers, but I had to let them go because of money problems. It was hard to find new jobs for them. Now, I make curtains at home with my husband’s help and work with women who work from home. I have to lower my prices sometimes and look for new chances.""
D. Tessa Strickland runs a children's book publishing business from her farmhouse. ""I moved to the countryside three years ago for two reasons. First, London was too expensive, and second, I love the countryside. I like to work when I want. Most of my money comes from deals with Australia, the Far East, and North America, so I take calls at strange times. It is hard to close the office door. I publish children's books from different cultures and work with authors and artists. I felt alone at first because I worked in London before.""
E. Meg Rivers runs a cake business and a shop. She makes £250,000 a year and has six workers, some part-time. ""I started ten years ago at home. I care about health, so I made fruit cakes with good flour and eggs. Friends and family asked for cakes, and soon I was sending cakes all over the country. Seven years ago, I rented a small building. Now, we have a baker and an assistant. I don’t bake anymore; I manage the business. My biggest problem has been money because I did not have a lot to start."""
FCE_1,B2,"Meet the Watkins Family**
The Watkins family is very special. They are all musicians. The dad, John, makes musical instruments. The sons, Paul and Huw, play music. 
John and Hetty are teachers in South Wales. They wanted to buy a cello for their son, Paul, who is ten years old. But the cello was very expensive. John thought, ""I can make one!"" He found a school where he could learn to make instruments. He took classes for three years. 
John made violins first. Then he made a cello for Paul. Paul liked it very much. John now makes about twelve violins every year. He even sold one to a famous musician from America!
Paul and Huw started playing music when they were young. Paul learned to play the piano first. He wanted to play the cello because he thought the cellist in his dad's group was very cool. Huw also plays music, but he did not want to play the violin like Paul.
Huw said, ""My parents were very nice. They did not push me to play music."" Now, Huw is 22 years old and is a pianist and composer.
Paul is now a famous cellist. He won a big music competition and played in the BBC Symphony Orchestra. He played his dad's cello for a long time. Now, he has a very old cello on loan from a music school.
Paul will play on television soon. He will play a famous piece of music. But he cannot watch it because he is playing at a festival the same night. Huw will also perform in London that night. Their parents, John and Hetty, will be very busy trying to see both of their sons play music!"

**The National Trust**
The National Trust is a group that wants to protect the British countryside. Gill Page visits the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and talks to a warden from the Trust. 
Gareth Roberts is a National Trust Warden. He says, ""You need common sense and you must be good with people."" He talks to farmers, visitors, and builders every day. Gareth grew up on the Lleyn Peninsula and worked on his parents' farm. Many people wanted to be the warden, but Gareth got the job because he knows the area and has farming experience.
Gareth still helps on his parents' farm. This helps him understand farmers and their problems. He can also do physical work like building fences and planting trees. Since he started working with the Trust, he has learned more about nature. When he was young, he liked to pick flowers and collect birds' nests. Now, he sees that farming has changed the countryside.
At first, farmers and conservationists did not get along. They both wanted different things. Now, they talk and understand each other better. Gareth's job is to help finish projects and make sure everything is done well. He spends a lot of time writing reports and signing papers.
Gareth loves his job, especially talking to people. But sometimes, he finds some visitors rude. They come in, ask for things, and leave without saying thank you. This can be frustrating for him. 
If you have common sense and like working outside, you might want to be a warden like Gareth. But it may take a long time to find a job on the Lleyn Peninsula!"

Kendra Slowinski is the captain of England's netball team. I met her before the World Championships. She had a busy day. She taught at a school and then trained in a car park.
I asked her if people look at her when she trains. She said, ""I focus on my training. I don’t see much else."" Kendra is working hard to be ready for the Championships. This is her fourth time at the World Championships. There will be 27 countries playing.
Kendra said, ""We will have support from our home crowd. This is special."" She wants people to see netball as a good sport in England. The first game is against Barbados. Kendra thinks they can win because they have always won before, but she knows it will be a tough game.
The England team is ranked fourth in the world. Kendra said, ""The Championships are hard. You must play well every day. There is no time to rest."" In the last fifteen years, netball has become faster and more competitive. Kendra said, ""We train hard to win, but after the game, we are friends.""
Netball players now use science to help them train. Kendra believes it is important to think and train like the best players. As captain, she wants to support her team.
Kendra has planned her netball career carefully. She decided that this competition will be her last as a player. She may coach young players in the future. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she might feel emotional."
FCE_50,B2,"**SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS**
What can parents do for a child who is very good at music? It can be hard to know how to help them. Some parents may not see their child's talent until the child becomes upset or difficult. Most schools help children who are good at subjects like math or English, but children who are good at music need special help that regular schools may not provide. 
Specialist music schools can help these children. There are five music schools in Britain. These schools help children aged seven to eighteen to grow their musical skills with the help of professional musicians. 
At these schools, children spend a lot of time on music. They have individual lessons, play in orchestras, and learn about singing and music theory. They also practice in special rooms. The rest of their time is for important subjects like English, math, and science. 
The five music schools in Britain are independent, which means they are not run by the government. The classes are small, so teachers can pay more attention to each student. Most children live at the school, which means they eat and sleep there. This helps them be with other children who love music too.
However, there are some problems. The schools are expensive, costing between £12,000 and £17,000 a year. The schools try to help parents with scholarships, which are financial aids. Also, not all parents want to send their children to live at school, especially when they are very young. 
The directors of the schools worry about admitting children as young as seven. They want to help children grow into well-balanced people. Sometimes, being in a music school can be stressful. A child’s musical talent may change as they grow up, and the pressure to succeed can be hard. 
The schools watch how each child is doing and offer help if needed. Many former students say they learned a lot from the music schools, but some think it is not good to focus only on music and not on other subjects. Many musically talented children are also smart and want to learn more in school. 
It might be better to wait until a child is older to decide on a specialist music school. Children who are good at both music and school subjects can do well in regular schools with good music programs. Some music colleges offer lessons on Saturday mornings, but this may not be possible for families who live far away from big cities."

Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. She has a big garden around her house. This garden has many flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow everywhere in the garden. There are two long flower beds along a path in the garden. The colors and shapes of the flowers are very nice. The people who lived there before Susan were good gardeners. They left many plants that Susan likes. She also has a gardener named Danny. Susan says, ""It was really his garden."" They worked well together. At first, Danny did not like some of Susan's ideas, but when she said she wanted to paint them, he understood.
Susan likes to paint single flowers instead of the whole garden. Sometimes she picks flowers and takes them to her studio. She does not paint everything at once. She takes one flower, paints it for a few days, and then takes another flower. Sometimes it takes her a couple of years to finish a painting. 
Spring and early summer are her busy times because the tulips and poppies bloom. She says, ""They all come out together, and you're so busy."" She also likes to see how flowers change. For example, when she puts tulips in water, they change shape after a day. At first, they look boring, but then they become beautiful.
Susan has always liked plants. She studied botany in school and collected wild flowers. She did not like garden flowers because they looked fake to her. She thought wild flowers were real because they grow in hard places, like rocks or cliffs.
Now, her garden has many plants from different countries. They grow well in her garden. Susan is relaxed about her garden, like a kind aunt who lets children play as long as they do not break anything. She has two art shows coming up, so she has less time to work in the garden. She now has another gardener to help her, but she knows that to paint flowers well, ""you have to get your hands dirty.""

Five famous people share their favorite train memories with Andrew Morgan.
**Andrea Thompson - Newsreader**  
I love the south of France. I go there when I can. There is a train from Cannes to Italy. The views are beautiful, no matter the weather. You can see nice houses and gardens. The people on the train are happy. There are tourists and locals, all enjoying the trip.
**Raj Patel - Explorer**  
I have many good train journeys, but my favorite is the Nile Valley Express in Sudan. When I was young in South Africa, I missed a family train trip to Kruger National Park. I was too young and stayed with my aunt. When I moved to England, I saw my first big train station, London Waterloo. It was amazing!
**Betty Cooper - Novelist**  
One special train for me is the Blue Train. It took my husband and me on our honeymoon in France. On the train, my husband gave me a pink dress. I love pink now! The journey was lovely, and we took a boat on the Nile after that. It was a perfect trip after our wedding.
**Martin Brown - Journalist**  
I worked on a project about a trip around the world. We had to cross a desert in Africa. There was no road, so we took the Desert Express train. The schedule was not good, and we waited a long time. When the train came, many people got on, even on the roof! At night, we saw beautiful landscapes. It felt like a dream.
**Arisu Mezuki - Actress**  
Many people love trains from when they are kids, but I did not. I grew up in Singapore and Cyprus, where there were few trains. I started to love trains as a teenager when I made a film in Yorkshire. We filmed on an old train line. I loved riding the train, and when I visited last year, everything was the same, even the gas lights at the station!"

Do you want to get your story published? If you are not sure where to send it, Margaret Stubbs can help you. Many readers of this magazine ask, ""I have written a story or a book. Who can I send it to?"" 
First, you need to learn about publishers and practice your writing. It is important to know about the market for your writing. You can do this by reading a lot. Go to your local library and visit bookshops. Reading helps you understand what kind of stories publishers want. 
You should keep learning because new magazines and books come out all the time. Publishers always want new writers. If you want to write short love stories, find magazines that publish love stories. Get some recent copies and read them. This will help you know what kind of stories they like and who their readers are.
Sometimes, new writers send their stories to me and ask, ""This was rejected three times. Am I wasting my time?"" I try to give honest advice, but I also want to be positive. Many new writers are too quick to send their work out. If you have only written one story, it is very hard to get published. 
When you hear about someone’s success, they usually have worked in writing for a long time. When you send your work for the first time, keep writing more stories while you wait for a reply. Write ten or twenty more stories. Each one will be better, and you will feel more like a writer. 
Do not throw your stories away; try to make them better. At first, do not show your work to others. Remember, every successful writer has faced many rejections before they succeeded. 
Try to improve your writing. Look for a creative writing course near you. If you cannot find one, join a local writers' group. This will help you get ideas and feel more confident. Think of yourself as a writer and practice writing every day if you can."

On the last day of a bad year, I was at the Baltimore train station. I was waiting for the 10:10 train to Philadelphia. There were many people waiting. The station did not feel clean and nice like before. Older couples with matching bags sat on the benches, and college students had their bags on the floor.
A man with grey hair was walking around. He looked rich. He went to a woman sitting alone and asked her a question. Then he came to a girl near me. She had long blond hair. I thought I would like to talk to her. The man asked, ""Are you going to Philadelphia?"" The girl said, ""I am going north, but not to Philadelphia. I am going to New York."" The man thanked her and walked to the next bench.
Now I was watching him. He asked an old lady, ""Are you going to Philadelphia?"" She said, ""I am going to Wilmington."" He did not say anything and walked to a couple with matching bags. I moved closer, looking at the train platform. I was going to Philadelphia. I thought he could have asked me, but he did not. He looked at me quickly and then went to another bench.
He looked worried. He asked a woman reading a book, ""Are you going to Philadelphia?"" She was about thirty-five years old. She said, ""Yes, I am."" The man asked her for a favour. I stood a little away and looked at my wrist, even though I did not have a watch. The woman looked careful. The man said, ""It is not too difficult, I promise!""
They announced my train. People started to move to Gate E, pulling their bags behind them. The man said, ""My daughter is flying out this afternoon from Philadelphia. I put her on a train this morning and went home. My wife was upset. My daughter forgot her passport. She called from the station in Philadelphia and did not know what to do.""
The woman listened. I thought it was better to stay quiet and see what would happen. The man said, ""I told her to stay at the station. I will get someone to bring her passport."" I thought it was strange. Why did he not go himself? The woman asked, ""Why don’t you go yourself?"" He said, ""I can’t leave my wife alone. She is in a wheelchair."" I thought this was not a good excuse.
I looked at them. The man was holding a packet, not a normal envelope, but a padded one. I thought, ""Be careful, lady!"""
FCE_30,B2,"Gary and Me**
John Moore is the owner of a restaurant. He talks about his son, Gary, who is a famous TV chef. John believes everyone has a chance in life. Gary had a chance to cook, and John had a chance to run a restaurant. When John saw the restaurant, it was not in good shape, but he thought it was perfect for him.
John remembers his childhood. His mother worked in a factory, and he felt sad when he was alone. He wanted to have time for family. John's wife took care of the children and helped with the money while John ran the restaurant. They lived above the restaurant and always had meals together. This helped their children, Gary and Joe, to be confident. They talked to customers from a young age.
Gary was a lively child. When he was seven, he jumped into a bath and hurt himself. As he grew older, he did small jobs for money. By ten, he worked in the kitchen every weekend and earned a lot of money at school. He was very disciplined and woke up early. John liked to see Gary helping in the family business.
Gary was not very good at school, but he was great in the kitchen. By 15, he was as good as the adult cooks and sometimes in charge. He made many meals. John knew Gary would work in catering. When Gary needed work experience for school, John sent him to a friend’s restaurant.
Gary also started playing the drums and has his own band now. John told Gary to focus on one thing. He said, ""If you want to succeed, do it by 30."" Gary went to catering college at 17. On his first day, he finished his work very quickly and helped others.
Now, Gary has a successful TV cooking show. John is very proud of him. He always tells Gary to work hard for what he wants. John thinks that if Gary listened to even a little of his advice, it is good."
FCE_7,B2,"Finding a Flat in Dublin**
Finding a good flat in Dublin is very hard. It is like looking for gold. The best way to find a flat is to know someone. If you know a person who knows someone else, you can find a place. But Jo just arrived in Dublin. She did not know anyone. She had to stay in a hostel and look for a flat. 
Dublin was new and big for Jo. She felt nervous when she took the train to go there. She did not think about why she was going. Everyone at her school thought she would go to Dublin. They wanted to leave their small town and see new things. Some of her friends went to other towns, but Jo was going to Dublin alone.
Jo's mother thought it was good for her to stay in the hostel. The hostel was run by nuns, so her mother thought she would be safe. Jo's father hoped the hostel was warm because hostels can be cold. Jo's sisters worked in a hotel and thought it was crazy for Jo to stay in a hostel for a week.
Jo saw an advertisement for a flat in Ringsend. It said, ""Own room, own television, share kitchen, bathroom."" It was close to the post office where she worked. Jo thought it was too good to be true. She hoped it would be nice and not too expensive. 
There was no line for this flat. It was not just a flat for rent; it was looking for a third girl to share. Jo wondered if it was too fancy for her, but the house looked normal. It was a red-brick house with a basement. The flat was upstairs. A girl with a college scarf came down the stairs. 
""Desperate place,"" she said to Jo. ""They are both awful."" 
Jo asked, ""What do you mean?"" 
The girl said, ""She just looked around and made a face. She talked in a posh accent. We don’t want her here."" 
Jo met another girl named Pauline. Pauline had bright clothes and colorful hair. Jo thought she looked like a punk. Jo said, ""I’m Jo. I work in the post office."" 
Nessa, the girl with the college scarf, said they were going to have tea. She got three mugs. One mug had 'Nessa', one had 'Pauline', and one had 'Other' on it. ""We will put your name on a mug if you stay with us,"" Nessa said kindly."
FCE_43,B2,"Behind the Dolphin's Smile**
People love dolphins. We like to see them in the sea, in movies, and on TV. But dolphins are in trouble. Mark Simmonds tells us about this problem. 
Dolphins are special animals. They are smart and can feel human emotions. They make us think of freedom in the ocean. We see dolphins in shows like Flipper and Seaquest. But these happy shows do not show the real life of dolphins. The seas are dirty and there are not enough fish for them.
In the North Sea, the number of harbour porpoises (a type of dolphin) has gone down a lot. There are about 89,000 fewer porpoises now. You might think that dolphins are protected by law and live in safe places. This is not true. There are not enough plans to help them, and this could be a big problem for wildlife.
There are forty types of dolphins in the world. In northern Europe, we see striped dolphins, common dolphins, bottlenose dolphins, and smaller harbour porpoises. The striped and common dolphins usually live far out in the sea. We do not know much about them because we see them only in small groups. 
Bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises used to be common near European coasts. Bottlenose dolphins are friendly and were often seen in places like the Thames River in Britain. Now, we can only find them in a few places, like Moray Firth in Scotland and Cardigan Bay in Wales. The dolphins that are still there have injuries, which show they are stressed.
It is hard to know why there are fewer dolphins. Overfishing is a big problem. When fishermen catch too many fish, dolphins cannot find food. If fish are gone from one area, dolphins may not find food in time. They can also get caught in fishing nets, which they cannot see. 
In recent years, many dead dolphins have washed up on beaches in France and Cornwall. They have marks and cuts on their bodies from fishing nets. 
Dolphins can also get sick from waste in the sea. For example, pesticides can build up in their bodies. Female dolphins can pass these poisons to their babies through their milk. There is one case of a baby dolphin that died because of this.
Another problem for dolphins is noise from humans. Dolphins live in groups and use sound to communicate. Noise from ships and oil wells can disturb them. This noise travels better in water than in air, and we do not know how it affects dolphins yet."
FCE_51,B2,"**Getting Fit**
Exercise is very important for your body and mind. It helps you feel good and stay healthy. Many people talk about fitness because it is good for you. 
Exercise can make your muscles stronger and change your body shape. It helps you stand and sit better. It can also help you avoid injuries. Exercise is good for your heart and lungs. 
Exercise can help with feelings of sadness and tiredness. It can help you sleep better and reduce stress. It can also help with some health problems. 
There are many types of exercise you can do, like aerobics, jogging, or using weights. But be careful! If you exercise too hard, you can get hurt. Start slowly and ask your doctor if you are not sure what is good for you.
Good posture is important. It helps you look and feel better. If you slouch, try to imagine a balloon pulling you up. This can help you breathe better and look slimmer.
Stretching is also important. It helps your body move easily and prevents injuries. If you stretch four or five times a week, you will feel more flexible and fit. 
A good exercise routine should include warming up, stretching, a workout, and cooling down."
FCE_11,B2,"IN THEIR NATURAL HABITAT**
What makes film-makers Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman stay away from home for a long time? They want to find the best pictures of animals. Amanda and Owen work in East Africa, in a place called the Ngorongoro Crater. It has rained a lot there for six months. This has caused some problems for them. Owen said they had to buy a special tool to help when their car gets stuck in the mud.
Amanda and Owen make great wildlife films. One of their best films is about leopards. While people were watching this film, Amanda and Owen were already looking for another animal, the jackal. Film-makers like them travel all over the world to film animals.
I talked to Owen when he was at a safari lodge with other people. He said, ""We sometimes argue, but we make up quickly."" They do not think one of them is the boss. They both see animals in the same way. 
When they travel, they set up their tents every night. This time, they have a fixed camp. They wake up at 5 a.m. and make tea the night before. They eat pre-packed meals that they heat up. Owen said, ""We can be out for eight weeks, so cooking can be a little stressful.""
It can be hard work, but they like being in nature. They can get close to the animals. Owen remembers filming a family of lions. One lioness would go away and then come back to greet her family and even their car.
Owen first worked with Amanda in 1988 on a film called ""The Great Rift."" Two years later, they filmed Arctic foxes together. Now, they spend four months in one place to make enough material for a half-hour film. Before they start, they must show a script to get approval.
Owen said, ""Amanda and I work well together because we have the same ideas. We want to make a film that shows the true spirit of the place and the animals. We want to touch people's hearts."""
FCE_14,B2,"**The Netball Captain**
Kendra Slawinski is the captain of England's netball team. I met her before the World Championships. She had a busy day. She taught at a school and then trained in a car park. I asked her if people looked at her when she trained there. She said she was too focused on her training to notice.
Kendra said, ""I want to be my best for the Championships."" She has a strict schedule to be fit. This is her fourth World Championships, and many countries will play. She is happy to have support from home. She wants people to see netball as a good sport in England. There will be more pressure because they are playing at home. People want them to win their first game against Barbados.
The England team is ranked fourth in the world. Kendra said the Championships will be hard. ""You must work hard every day. There is no rest between games. You only have one chance to win,"" she explained. The game has become faster and tougher over the years. Kendra said, ""We train hard to win, but after the game, we are friends.""
Netball players now use science to help them train. Kendra believes it is important to think and train like the best players. As captain, she wants to support her team.
Kendra has planned her netball career carefully. She decided that this competition would be her last as a player. She may coach young players in the future. As she walks with her team in the opening ceremony, she might feel emotional. Her supporters will be with her."
FCE_63,B2,"In Hot Water**
Rachel Mills is a scientist. She works at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. Rachel teaches and studies marine geochemistry. This means she looks at the chemicals in the sea. She is a teacher at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University.
When Rachel is not teaching, she goes into a small steel vehicle. This vehicle is for exploring underwater. It is the size of a small car. Rachel dives three kilometres down into the ocean to study underwater volcanoes. 
Inside the vehicle, there is not much space. Rachel can touch the two pilots. They are used to being in this small place. They cannot stand up or move around. They must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last for 16 hours. It takes three hours to go down, ten hours to collect rock and water samples, and three hours to come back up.
If there is a problem, Rachel can hit a panic button. This button makes a small escape vessel come out. It goes quickly to the surface, like a ping-pong ball in water. No one has tested it yet, but Rachel thinks it would not be a nice trip.
The first time Rachel got into the vehicle, she was nervous. She was on a ship with an instructor. He told her what to do in an emergency, like if the pilot got sick. They wanted to see how she would feel in a small space.
Now, Rachel has made six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian team. They went to a place five days away from the Canary Islands. There are many underwater volcanoes there. The Russian team was dropping off equipment to study a project that would make a hole through a volcano.
When Rachel is not at sea, she is in her office at the Oceanography Centre. She loves teaching, but she also wants to do research on ""black smokers."" This is another name for underwater volcanoes. Water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke. It comes out very fast and is very hot.
The only time Rachel was scared was when she dived with an American team. They were using a long rope when there was a loud explosion. Rachel thought she would die. They waited in silence, but they were still alive. The relief was amazing!
Diving to the deepest part of the ocean is an adventure. Every time Rachel looks out of the window, she sees the chimneys of the volcanoes. She feels wonder. She is at the bottom of the sea, and no one else has seen them before. Rachel studied black smokers for three years. When she saw them for real, it was an amazing feeling."
FCE_56,B2,"**Interview Tips**
First impressions are very important. People often make opinions about us in the first few minutes of meeting. They notice how we dress, our eye contact, our body language, how fast we talk, and our voice.
Mary Pearce wanted to be a teacher. She worked hard to finish her studies. When she graduated, she felt confident. She applied for a job at a primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher. That morning, she saw a small hole in her jacket. She thought about changing, but she did not want to be late. She believes it is important to be on time. Mary did not get the job. A friend told her that the Head Teacher said, ""If someone does not care about their appearance at an interview, how can they be a good teacher?""
Simon Grant, a hotel manager, says that people who look good at an interview are more likely to care about their jobs. Many people forget how important it is to look professional. For example, Janet Goodwood worked for ten years as an assistant in a big company. When her boss retired, she wanted to be the new boss but did not get an interview. She asked why and the Director said she did not look like an office manager. He told her to improve her clothes before applying again. Janet was surprised. She does a good job, and she thought her clothes should not matter.
How we move and use our hands can also change what the interviewer thinks. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian found that 7% of our message comes from our words, 38% from our voice, and 55% from our facial expressions. If our words and our face say different things, the listener will believe the facial expressions more. So, it is important that our words match our body language. Confusing messages can make the interviewer unsure.
It is also important not to seem too desperate for the job. Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, applied for a promotion. Her interview went very well, and she got the job right away. She was very happy but showed too much excitement. The boss saw how happy she was and offered her a lower salary than she wanted. She thinks she could have asked for more money if she had controlled her excitement.
Finally, what we say and how we say it can help us in an interview. David Artesio, a manager of a job agency, says it is good to learn about the company before the interview. For example, the annual report can tell you what the company does. Mention something that interests you during the interview. This shows you care about the company. Business consultant Marian Woodall suggests having a few questions ready and using short sentences. She says, ""Poor communicators talk in long sentences. Good communicators use short sentences and clear points."""

He took courses in massage to learn. Now, he works part-time at the Life Centre. He is happy and feels in control of his life."
FCE_6,B2,"Four Young Sports Stars Talk About Their Lives**
A. **Darius (Runner)**  
I have always liked sports. I played many sports, but I was best at football and running. When I was 14, I tried out for a professional football team, but I chose to focus on running instead. My best moment was when I ran for my country and won a medal. Not many people heard about it, which was sad. I hoped to get some money for training, but it is expensive. I train at home in winter and then go to Florida for three weeks before the season starts. It is fun there, and I have to be very disciplined. If my friends want to go out the night before training, I have to say no. I wish I could go, but I want to do well in my sport. My big goal is to go to the next Olympics.
B. **Gabriel (Surfer)**  
The surfing community is small, so I see the same people at competitions. Professional surfers are serious, and the best waves are in the morning. If I want to do well, I cannot go to late-night parties. I do not mind this, but I love to sleep in. I usually have to wake up early. It is worth it because I won the National Championships last year. After a win, I like to celebrate, and if I win money, I go somewhere nice. Winning the championship helped me get a job on TV. Now, I am a bit famous.
C. **Dieter (Yacht Racer)**  
When I am on a boat with my friends, we have a lot of fun. We celebrate wins in a big way. Some people say we act like kids, but we do not look for media attention. Sometimes, reporters care more about our celebrations than our race results. I am away for eight months a year, so I enjoy going out with my friends when I come back. You cannot only think about sports all the time; it is not healthy. People know me in sailing, but I am not very famous. I get letters from fans who want my picture, and I reply to every one.
D. **Tomas (Tennis Player)**  
It feels great to play in front of a crowd. At my last tournament, it got a bit crazy with many fans. I like being recognized by fans when I am out shopping. But my last girlfriend did not like it when I got too much attention from female fans. Tennis players travel a lot, and that is why we broke up. It was hard, but you have to make sacrifices in sports. I focus on my game now and will think about other things in life when I retire, which is early in this sport."

Shopping in a supermarket with children can be very hard for parents. One mother says, ""My kids want everything they see. If it is not a new sugary cereal, it is a Disney video or a comic book. I cannot buy all these things. If I say yes, I feel bad because I know it is not good for them. But I also feel bad when I say no all the time. I try not to take them shopping, but I worry they need to learn how to choose things.""
Research shows that children ask for something to buy every two minutes in a supermarket. A lot of money is spent on advertising for children, especially on TV. Children do not always understand why their parents say no to certain things. Parents often talk about how sugar is bad for teeth, but children see fun ads and want the products.
Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, ""Most parents care about what their children eat. They have ideas about healthy food, but these ideas are not always right. It is good for parents and children to talk about food. If children only listen to ads, they get a one-sided view. Parents feel bad because they have to say no to their children because of ads.""
The rules for TV ads say that advertisers cannot tell children to ask their parents to buy things. But Susan Dibb says, ""The goal of advertising is to make people want to buy things."" 
Shopping with children can be stressful for parents. One mother says she talks to her son about food and ads. She feels happy because he does not ask for things she does not want to buy. 
Some parents are not always consistent. Mike, a father, says, ""We do not buy sweets for our son because they are bad for him, but we buy cream and chocolate for ourselves. It is nice to buy good things, and children want to share that. But sometimes, I feel annoyed by their requests. If I am in a good mood, I say yes more often. It is hard to be consistent.""
Supermarkets can help parents by not putting sweets at the checkout or by having play areas for children. Parents might spend less money if their children are not with them, but shopping without their children's demands could bring in more customers. 
**Questions:**
1. What do children often want when they go shopping with their parents?
2. How often do children ask for something in a supermarket?

FCE_45,B2,"**ICE SKATING**
Ice skating is a fun activity that people have done for many years. Long ago, people used skates made from animal bones. Later, they made skates from iron. In the past, skating was important for rich people in Scandinavia. 
In the early 1900s, skating was very stylish. In 1924, a young girl named Sonja Henie made skating more popular by showing a new way to skate. Today, skating is both beautiful and hard work. 
For beginners, it is important to have balance and control. To skate well, you need to relax. When you start, your heels should be close together, and your feet should point outwards. Push with your back foot and move the other foot a little. If you practice, you can move longer and faster.
Learning how to fall is also important. Even good skaters fall sometimes. To fall safely, stay relaxed. This helps you not to get hurt. To get up, use your hands to kneel, then stand up.
Once you can skate well, you can try different styles like figure skating, freestyle, and speed skating. It is best to start with figure skating. Many ice rinks have teachers who can help you learn.
Good skaters look relaxed and move easily. To skate well, you should do exercises to warm up your body. This helps you not to get stiff. After skating, do the same exercises to feel better.

If you want to see something special, look at a child winning a medal. Julia Gregson talked to three young stars and their mothers about their lives.
A. Annika Reeder is 15 years old. She won a gold medal for gymnastics. She wants to be a physiotherapist and compete in the Olympics. ""I work very hard. I don’t have time to watch TV or go out with friends. I focus on gymnastics and school. Sometimes I feel very tired, and my coach gives me a day off, but I usually keep training. If I take too many days off, I feel stiff.""
B. Annika's mother says, ""Annika has always been very talented. Some parents push their children too much, but Annika wants to do this. It takes a lot of time and energy. People say we give up a lot, but we love the sport and what it does for Annika. Before gymnastics, she was shy, but now she is confident and has friends from all over the world.""
C. Sarah Stokes started show-jumping when she was 10 years old. She has won the British National Championship. ""My parents love show-jumping. They train me and take me to shows. The shows can last from one to five days. I never get tired of it. I love it! My goal this year is to join the British young riders team. I want to win a gold medal at the Olympics.""
D. Sarah's mother says, ""Sarah loved horses from a young age. When she was 5, she woke up early to exercise her pony. To go to big shows, we travel all over England. We sleep in our horse box to save money. Sarah is very organized and happy on a horse. It is wonderful to see your child succeed at something they love.""
E. Jane McShane is 10 years old and is the Under-14 Chess Champion in Britain. ""Tournaments are friendly. I know everyone, and it is fun. When I play, I don’t concentrate. I should, but I just look around. I don’t talk about my success at school because I don’t want to feel embarrassed.""
F. Jane's mother says, ""Jane played her first game when she was 5. My father wanted to see if she liked it. I was bored when I learned, but Jane loved it. By the end of that day, she knew all the moves and started to beat adults. I am happy when she wins, but if she wants to stop playing, that is okay. I want her to use her talent."""

Chris Greener was fourteen years old when he told his teacher he wanted to join the navy. The teacher joked, ""What do you want to be? The flagpole on a ship?"" This was funny because Chris was already very tall. Now, he is the tallest man in Britain at 228 cm.
Every ten years, people in Europe get a little taller. More tall people are being born. This does not mean we are becoming a super race. Instead, we are going back to how we were a long time ago. We are getting taller because we are eating better food now.
A long time ago, people ate many different foods. Women picked fruits and berries, and men hunted animals. They ate many wild plants. But about 9,000 years ago, farming started. This changed how people ate. Now, most people eat just three main plants: wheat, rice, and maize. This has not been good for our health. 
In one study, scientists found that when people started farming corn, they became less healthy. They had more tooth problems and diseases. Farming could feed more people, but many of them were not healthy. Only in some rich countries like Europe, the US, and Japan are people starting to eat better again. 
Now, the average man in the US is 179 cm tall, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. This is good, but there are still problems. Beds have not gotten longer since 1860, and there is less space for legs on planes and trains. 
Some scientists think we might stop growing taller soon. They say we could reach a height of 193 cm this century. But, even if some people are getting taller, as a group, humans might be getting smaller. A long time ago, during the ice age, people were rounder and taller to keep warm. Now that the climate is warmer, we might be getting thinner and shorter. If the planet gets hotter, we could get even smaller. 
**Questions:**
1. How old was Chris Greener when he wanted to join the navy?
2. What is Chris Greener's height now?
3. What three plants do most people eat today?
4. In which countries are people starting to eat better food again?
5. What do scientists think about the height of humans in the future?"
FCE_57,B2,"Studio Audiences**
What is it like to be in the audience when a TV show is made? Cosmo Landesman found out. 
Studio audiences are a common part of TV shows, but many people do not understand them. When we watch game shows, we see the audience getting excited and wonder, ""Who are these people?"" 
Some people think studio audiences are not important. They say that even TV workers do not respect them. I thought studio audiences were just made up of silly people who want to be on TV. But there is no typical studio audience. They come from different jobs and backgrounds. TV shows want different types of people for different shows.
Many people at home do not understand why anyone would want to watch a show in a studio. Why would someone get tickets, travel far, and sit for a long time in a studio? One reason is that people hope to be on TV for a moment. I did not believe this until I talked to Angela. She said, ""I came for a chance to be on TV."" 
Another reason is that people want to see how a show is made. But many people go because a friend gave them a ticket. 
Most of us have not been in a studio audience, but we think we know what it is like. You sit close to strangers, and someone shows signs that say APPLAUD or LAUGH. You clap or laugh when you see these signs. This is true for some shows, but not all. 
One studio manager said, ""We think a show should be good enough not to need these signs."" But is there a real difference between being in a studio and watching TV at home? For Claire, being in a studio is ""more exciting."" Charlotte liked being part of live TV. She said, ""Last year I saw my favorite comedian. When you watch him at home, you miss a lot."" 
What I missed was seeing the actors. I could only see the back of someone’s head. The opening scenes were far from where I sat, so I watched the show on a monitor. 
Going to a studio may not be the best way to watch TV, but for most people, it was fun and a free night of entertainment."

**Favorite Places**
**Bruce**  
I do not like wild landscapes. I like places with people. When I travel, I like nice villages with old temples, not empty deserts. When I was eight, I went to school in England. On Saturdays, I rode my bike to the village of Lastingham. Cycling was fun for me. I loved to explore the hills and old villages. I am from Scotland, so the landscape felt familiar but also different. I still visit there today. I wrote about my adventures in my diary. This was my first travel writing.
**Sophia**  
There is a small train that goes from Hythe to Dungeness. It is run by volunteers. I always travel first class because it is not much more expensive. The view is not amazing. The train goes over Romney Marsh with sheep and next to a canal. But I like one part of the journey. The train goes through back gardens. For a moment, I see people making tea, washing dishes, and unfolding chairs. I feel like I am looking into their homes. I like the simple landscape with fields, sheep, and a grey sea. It makes me look closely at everything.
**Matthew**  
The Hartland Peninsula is a quiet and beautiful coast. The beaches are hard to reach and have many rocks, so there are not many people here. Some surfers come, but most visitors just enjoy the sea. This coast faces the Atlantic Ocean and has many shipwrecks. There are walks along the coast and trips into beautiful valleys with oak trees and wild flowers. We stay in a simple place with a family in the village of Southole.
**Annette**  
My favorite place in England is the Trough of Bowland. It is a wide-open area that is great for hiking. There are not many people living there or visiting. It is quiet and empty, and I like the space. I found this place by chance when I was a student. Since then, I visit every year, sometimes alone, sometimes with my boyfriend, and now with my son. It has not changed much since my first visit. Having a child makes these visits special. I feel sad that he is growing up in a city.
**James**  
I bought Glenthorne, my favorite house in Britain. I wanted peace and to connect with my English roots. I grew up in Sri Lanka, but when I was twelve, I went to school in Devon, England. I used to ride my bike around the moors and villages. There was a story about a place we never cycled past: if you went down the driveway, you would never come back. That place was Glenthorne. It is my dream place. It is a magical, quiet house. You can only hear the sea, wind, and birds."
FCE_42,B2,"A Big Snake**
We love animals. One day, my daughter called me at work. She found a pine snake. ""Can we keep him?"" she asked. I said, ""Yes, but only for one night."" We had a special tank for animals. I was late getting home. I put a pot on the stove. Suddenly, I heard my son scream, ""Oh, Mother! Help!"" I ran to his room. 
In the room, there was a problem. Our cat, Domino, had Bianca, a white mouse. Domino was running around with the mouse in his mouth. I tried to help, but I tripped and fell. Then, I saw the snake. It was escaping! The snake was moving off the table and onto the floor. 
Domino, the cat, and the kids were jumping and screaming. The snake was moving fast. The dog was barking. The pot on the stove boiled over. I ran to turn it off. I caught Domino by the tail and saved the mouse. 
I looked at the snake. It was big and strong. I sat on the floor and waited. Slowly, the snake relaxed. I carefully picked it up and took it to the garden. I wanted to let it go. I pointed the snake to a tree. 
When I let go of the snake, it climbed up my shoulders! It felt like a warm scarf. My children and I stood together. My oldest son said, ""Mum, you are warm, and the shed is not."" I asked the kids to help me. We gently encouraged the snake to move. 
Slowly, the snake went up the wall and disappeared over the roof. My three-year-old son said, ""Wow, that was a big snake!"""

""Write to me! In our fast world with phones and computers, writing letters is not common anymore. But I love getting letters. It is exciting to see a letter come, to see who it is from, and to read it. I have written letters for a long time. I started with little notes to my mother. My mother always made me write thank-you letters for gifts. It did not matter if they were short or messy, as long as they were letters.
When I was 18, I moved to London to study to be a doctor. I wrote to my mother every week, and she wrote to me too. Sometimes my father wrote letters, and I loved his funny letters. Most letters from home were about everyday things with my parents and their friends. We also called each other, but I remember the letters more.
I also got letters from my boyfriends. They had to work or study far away, so we wrote letters to stay in touch. Writing letters helped our relationships. I could say what I felt better in a letter than by talking. I love letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. Notes are nice, but letters with news are better! I like getting letters from other countries too. I have a friend in Sri Lanka, a penfriend in Australia, and another in Vancouver. I also have a friend in France. We started talking in a restaurant, and I asked for her address. Now we write to each other regularly. I can practice my French with her because she does not speak English. She has visited us, and we have stayed at her home.
This summer, my family and I visited my American penfriend in Texas. We wrote to each other for 29 years but had never met. People were surprised that we wrote for so long. My children also write letters. Like my mother, I make them write thank-you letters. My daughter writes me little letters, just like I did to my mother. She and my son have penfriends in Texas too. I hope everyone keeps writing letters!"""

Tourists are hurting old rock art in the French Alps. There are many ancient pictures on the rocks at Mont Bego. These pictures are about 4,000 years old. They show cows, fields, and gods. Scientists are worried that these pictures will not last for future generations.
More and more people visit Mont Bego, but some do not care for the art. They write on the rocks and damage the pictures. Jean Clottes, a leader in rock art, says, ""People think the pictures will always be there. But if this continues, there will be nothing left in 50 years."" He has seen tourists stepping on the drawings and hurting them. Some people even take pieces of the rocks home as souvenirs. 
Some visitors try to make the pictures look better by rubbing them. They think this will help them take better photos. Other people bring sticks to scratch their names or drawings on the rocks. 
Experts have different ideas on how to protect the art. Henry de Lumley, a museum director, thinks the best way is to close the mountain to the public. He believes this will save the site. But Jean Clottes thinks this idea will upset local people. 
David Lavergne, an architect, wants to keep the site open. He says it is hard to stop visitors from damaging the rocks. He thinks they may need to charge money to visit the site to pay for guards. 
Annie Echassoux, a researcher, is worried that more tourists will come because it is easier to reach the mountain now. She believes they should block off some areas and have guides. She says, ""We need money to protect this historic site. If we do nothing, we will lose the drawings for the next generation.""

Shopping in a supermarket with children can be very hard for parents. One mother says, ""My kids want everything they see. If it is not a new sugary cereal, it is a Disney video or a comic book. Usually, they want all three. I cannot buy all these things. If I say yes, I feel bad because I know it is not good for them. But I also feel bad when I say no all the time. I try not to take them shopping, but I worry they need to learn how to make choices. I feel stuck.""
Research shows that children ask to buy something every two minutes when they go shopping. A lot of money is spent on advertising for children, especially on TV. This makes it hard for parents to explain why they cannot buy certain things. Children do not always understand why their parents say no, especially when they see fun ads on TV.
Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, ""Most parents care about what their children eat. They want to give them healthy food, but they do not always know what is healthy. It is good for parents and children to talk about food. If children only listen to ads, they get a one-sided view. Parents feel bad because they have to say no to their children because of ads.""
The rules for TV ads say that advertisers cannot tell children to ask their parents to buy things. But Susan Dibb says, ""The goal of advertising is to make people want to buy things. So, even if they do not say, 'Tell your mom to buy this,' that is what they want.""
Shopping with children can be stressful for parents. One mother says she talks to her children about food, and now they do not ask for things she does not want to buy. Another father, Mike, says, ""We do not buy sweets for our son because they are bad for him, but we buy treats for ourselves. It is nice to buy good things, and children want to enjoy that too. But sometimes, I get annoyed with their requests. It depends on how I feel. If I am happy, I say yes more often. It is hard to be consistent.""
Supermarkets can help parents by moving sweets away from the checkout area or by having play areas for children. Parents might buy less if their children are not with them, but shopping without their children's demands could bring in more customers."
FCE_65,B2,"Climbing Walls**
Climbers used to go to the mountains. Now, people can climb indoors or outdoors. The crowd is excited. High on the climbing wall, the French climber Francois Lombard is hanging upside down by two fingers. He is in a climbing competition in Birmingham.
The place is called the National Indoor Arena. It is known for the TV show Gladiators, but it also has climbing competitions. This is possible because of new technology.
Before the 1960s, climbers practiced on cliffs. In winter, they had to deal with cold weather or climb on snow and ice. As climbing became more popular, climbers needed to stay fit. When they could not use cliffs, they climbed on brick walls or buildings. This helped them keep their fingers strong.
Many sports centers started to build climbing walls. These walls had special bricks to hold on to. A teacher named Don Robinson built a climbing wall in a hallway at Leeds University in the 1960s. He used natural rock in concrete to make climbing walls.
In the 1970s, many climbing walls were built, but they had problems. The walls were straight, but cliffs have different shapes. Once the walls were built, they could not be changed. Climbers got bored because the walls were the same.
In 1985, a Frenchman named Francois Savigny made a new material. He made shapes like those on cliffs. These shapes could be put on any wall and taken off when climbers wanted something new. French companies also made climbing walls with steel frames. Steel was lighter than concrete, so they could make different shapes. This gave climbers many new ways to climb."
FCE_61,B2,"'Do You Want to Be an Actor?'**
Do you want to be an actor? If you tell someone this, they might say it is risky. Acting can be a risky job. There are many actors, but not many jobs for them. When you choose to be an actor, some friends may think you are crazy. But everyone has different opinions. It is your choice, and you are responsible for it. 
There are no easy ways to become an actor. You do not have to take tests, and there is no guarantee you will get a job after training. Success depends on luck and talent. There is a need for new actors, and acting can be exciting and rewarding.
What is talent? Talent is a natural skill and imagination. Imagination is hard to measure. It also depends on your courage and belief in yourself. 
Why do you want to act? It can be hard to explain. In theater, the important thing is the moment between the actor and the audience. This moment is what makes actors want to perform.
If you ask actors how they succeed, they may not know. They understand some things about their skills, but they do not take success for granted. They know they must keep working hard because their fame can change. 
Disappointment is a big problem for actors. Last month, you might have been without a job. You could be selling clothes or working in a restaurant. Then, you may get a chance to audition for a role. But even if you want the job, you might not get it. 
Actors often do not talk about their chances of getting a job. They find ways to deal with the stress of competition and rejection. No one likes to be rejected. This possibility is there from the start when you want to be a professional actor. You are saying you are ready and talented enough for the job. If you do not care enough, others may not care about you either."

**A Fun Game**
Two brothers, Dave and Norm Lagasse, live in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA. They are in their forties and have big beards. They are playing a game called pichenotte. This game is special to them because their grandfather, Lucien Rajotte, brought it from Canada. The family played this game every weekend and had a lot of fun.
When the family moved to New Mexico, they still played pichenotte. Their grandfather made the game board from old wooden boxes. When visitors came, they were curious because no one knew this game in the southern USA.
Three years ago, Dave made a new pichenotte board because the old one was broken. His family and friends liked it. One night, Dave and Norm took the new board to a sports bar. At first, people thought it was silly, but soon they wanted to play!
Dave learned that pichenotte comes from a game in India called 'carroms.' This game changed over time and became pichenotte in Quebec, Canada. Pichenotte can be played by two to four people. Each player has 12 pieces called 'pucks.' They flick the pucks into holes on the board to score points. The game is quick and usually lasts two minutes.
When many people liked the game at the bar, the brothers made more boards and sold them at markets. Many people came to buy them, and soon there were pichenotte championships with a trophy called the 'Lord Pichenotte Cup.' The brothers decided to make pichenotte boards full-time. They work in their garage and have made over 450 boards. Each board is strong and weighs 12 kg.
The boards cost $595 each and can be bought from their website. There are no professional pichenotte players yet, but the brothers hope to make a lot of money from their game. For now, they enjoy playing pichenotte together.

When you come to the Model Village, you will see a beautiful place. A few years ago, this land was not nice. It was flat and full of weeds. One man and his wife worked hard to change this land into the village you see today.
Many tons of soil and clay were moved to make the land look nice. Machines helped, but many people also worked hard. They brought in 1,000 tons of good soil to make grass, flowers, and rocks.
In the Model Village, many trees and plants were planted. These plants were chosen carefully because they need to grow well near the sea. Some plants came from local shops, and some came from far away places like Canada and New Zealand.
Colin Sims had the idea for the village. He made over 100 models by himself. It took him nine years to finish them. The models are made from stone, concrete, wood, and plastic. They are strong and can handle all kinds of weather. At first, Colin needed help from experts, but soon he learned how to do it himself.
The models are very detailed and look real. The Model Village is popular and well-made. Other model villages in England use the same techniques.
The buildings in the village show traditional British styles. One important building is the Manor House. It is a 13th-century stone house with a brick tower. You will also see a Castle, St Mary's Church, a zoo, and a mini golf course.
Please stay on the paths and do not touch the models. If you touch them, it can take a long time to fix them. You can take photos from the paths. Dogs are welcome if they are on a short lead.
You can press buttons in front of some models to make them work. At the end of your visit, we would like to hear your thoughts. We are always making new models and want to know what you think. We hope you enjoy your visit and come back again. Please tell your friends about the Model Village!"

Every week, British tabloid newspapers show pictures of famous people. These pictures often invade their privacy. Sometimes, pop stars take pictures with paparazzi, but this is not common. Most of the time, these pictures hurt the famous people when they see their private moments in the newspapers. Very few famous people ask for help from the Press Complaints Commission (PCC). This group helps with problems like this. 
Are these pictures important for the public? For example, does a picture of a famous actress on a hotel balcony help anyone? The actress has talked about her privacy before. She was in a hotel, where people expect privacy, but she did not complain. It is surprising that the PCC did not start an investigation. 
There was also a story about a pop star's love life that was very bad. The pop star did not make a formal complaint either. Shouldn't the PCC do something about this? If they did, it could help stop bad stories in the newspapers. Other newspapers would talk about it, and people would not like these stories. 
But if the PCC became like a police officer for the press, there would be problems. How would they decide to investigate? Should they ask the famous person if they want to complain? If the person does not want to complain, should the PCC still investigate? Famous people might expect help, but they could be upset if they do not get it. 
The PCC would have a big job. How could they watch all the newspapers and magazines in Britain? Also, people might not want to have an investigation because it could be embarrassing. Many famous people just want to forget about the problem and continue with their lives. Some might be afraid that a worse story about them could come out if they complain. 
One British comedian and his wife were secretly photographed on their honeymoon. He did not complain then or later when a photographer took pictures of his family on holiday. He was afraid that the newspaper would make fun of him. This fear is normal. People think they will be targeted again if they complain. It is hard to find an easy solution to this problem.

1. What do British tabloid newspapers show every week?
2. Do pop stars often take pictures with paparazzi?
3. What does the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) do?

If you want to travel, now is a good time to do it. You can work temporarily when you come back and find your second job later. Employers will be happy to see that you have traveled and are ready to work.
Juliette Davidson worked for three lawyers after leaving St. Aldate's College. It was a good first job because the people were supportive. She learned how to work in an office and improved her typing skills. But there was no chance to move up in the job. One day, she decided to leave, bought a plane ticket, and traveled for a year.
Now, Juliette works as a Personal Assistant to Brenda Cleverdon, the Chief Executive of Business in the Community. She says, ""In two and a half years, I have learned a lot and my job has changed."" Her boss wanted to help her grow. Juliette's job title is the same, but her tasks have changed. She now does most of the letters and budgets. She also answers questions from important people and helps those who want to start their own business. Brenda includes her in all her work and gives her special projects to do."

**Confident People: What is Their Secret?**
Confident people seem to be born that way, but many say it is a skill they learned. Nina Hathway talks to five people about how they became confident.
**A. Jenny**  
When I left school, I was very shy. I thought I would always be shy. When I was twenty-five, I helped at my daughter’s school. I was scared, but I did well. Someone said I should go to university. I was very nervous on my first day, but my confidence grew. Working at the school changed my life.
**B. Michaela**  
Four years ago, my father got sick, and I had to run the family business. I was scared and became too aggressive. I learned that to be confident, I need to believe in myself. If work is too hard, I don’t feel guilty if I wait until the next day to finish. When things are difficult, I tell myself I have nothing to lose. Fear makes you less confident, so I talk to myself to feel better.
**C. Lisa**  
People think I am confident, but I often feel scared. I learned to look confident because it is important in TV. Interviewing people showed me that many of us feel nervous in important situations. My mother gave me good advice when I was a teenager. She said, “Who is looking at you? Everyone is busy worrying about themselves.” I remember this often. I also think you gain confidence by facing your fears. I was very nervous for my driving test, but I passed. After that, I felt less scared.
**D. Barbara**  
I feel confident because I enjoy my work. I have built my confidence over the years. If you work hard and learn from mistakes, you will be more confident next time. I am popular at my restaurant, but not everyone likes me. I don’t let that bother me. You must like yourself for who you are. My company has training courses that help me feel better about myself. It is good to set small goals and see what you achieve.
**E. Kim**  
After college, I worked as a secretary. I sat in meetings and was scared to speak. Eventually, I found the confidence to share my ideas. When I started working in politics, I was very nervous to speak in public. I told myself, “Don’t be silly. People do this every day.” I also wrote down some notes to help me. I think everyone feels a little nervous when speaking in public. The secret to confidence is to tell yourself, “Nothing is impossible.”

FCE_47,B2,"**Visit to Malaysia**
Paul Forster goes to a kite festival. He spends a nervous night in the forest. Adnan Ali smiles when Paul gives him his broken kite. ""You keep it,"" he says. ""It is traditional. If the line breaks, the finder keeps it. I have many more kites."" He shows Paul his beautiful kites. They are all the same size: 120 cm wide and long. They are made of paper and bamboo. 
Paul and Adnan sit in the shade of the trees near the Beach of the Seven Lagoons in Kelantan. They watch Malaysia's biggest kite festival. There are 10 platforms on the beach. Helpers hold up the kites. Competitors hold the lines of their kites and wait for the countdown. When the whistle blows, the crowd cheers, and the kites fly into the sky. More than 500 men and boys are in the competition. Each person has four kites. The kites are judged on how they look, how stable they are in the air, and how well they fly. 
""Flying kites is not hard,"" says Adnan. ""But making them is a real skill. Come to my house, and I will show you."" Paul decides to go to Adnan's house. There, he drinks cold tea and eats fish crackers. In the evening, Adnan asks Paul to come back the next day to help fix his kite, but Paul cannot. Instead, he drives to Kuala Lumpur, into the mountains with rainforests. 
Paul takes a wrong turn and finds a river. A small boat is there to take people across. He sees a sign that says, ""Jelawang Jungle 3 km."" He starts walking but does not know that it is mostly uphill and slippery. When he arrives, he meets Baba, who has a kitchen and some bamboo huts. Paul decides to stay there, even though he worries about insects under his mattress. 
At night, it is very dark, and he hears many sounds. In the morning, he sees a beautiful view of green mountains. In the afternoon, it rains. The wind blows, and there is lightning. Paul gets wet. He slides down the hill and thinks about his car. He worries it might be washed away. Luckily, the car is still there, muddy but safe. 
In Kota Bahru, the capital of Kelantan, people ask Paul many questions: ""Where are you from?"" ""How old are you?"" They are friendly. Kelantan is famous for its kites, but Paul remembers it for the kindness of the people."

Bill is ten years old. He says, ""I love my mum's cooking. Now I can cook better than her. The teachers make us laugh when we eat the food we made.""
Flora is twelve. She has trouble with onions. She says, ""I love cooking. I made a meal for ten friends, and they liked it. My mum told me to find a hobby for the weekend. I was happy at home, so I did not want to go at first. But now I am glad I came.""
Their teacher, Philippe, says, ""It is fun. Children pay attention and remember better than adults. The kitchen is not always clean when they cook! Adults keep learning about food. If parents teach their children to cook when they are young, the children can make food for themselves when they are older."""

PET_21,B1,"**MONEY**
What is money? Money is things like the pound, the dollar, or the franc. Money is different from a gram or a kilometre because you can use money to buy things. For example, a five-pound note can buy a book, a big bag of sweets, or two cinema tickets. But the note is just a piece of paper that does not cost much to make.
A long time ago, people did not have money like we do now. There were no banks or shops. Back then, Mr. Green, the farmer, gave corn to Mr. Hive for honey. This was a trade between two people. Each person had something the other wanted.
Over time, many societies made their own money, called ""currencies,"" so people could trade more easily. Now, most people use a national currency."

Grass is a very successful plant. There are more than 9,000 types of grass. You can find grass in every part of the world. Grass can grow in very cold places like the Arctic and Antarctic. 
Grasslands are home to many animals. There are small insects and birds, and also big animals like cows and lions. All these animals need grass to live. 
Grass grows back quickly after it is cut or hurt. New leaves grow from below the ground, not from the top. This is why many animals can live in one place. When they eat all the grass, new grass starts to grow again."

She did not tell her parents, who own a supermarket, that she wanted to work in fashion. She thought they wanted her to have a different job, so she went to university to study management.
After university, Kal moved to London and worked at an advertising company. She went to many events but could not buy the nice clothes she wanted. So, she started to make skirts and tops for herself. Her friends liked her clothes and asked her to make some for them too. 
Kal found a small shop in London that would sell her designs. The clothes were very popular, and none came back. This made her happy and gave her the courage to leave her job. She took a loan of £20,000 to start her own women’s clothing brand. 
Kal's parents were not angry about her choice. They said they would help her, and this made her very happy. Now, her clothes are in over 70 stores, and her business makes more than £500,000.

Mark Ottaway took a train called The Ghan. He traveled from Darwin in the north of Australia to Adelaide in the south. The Ghan train goes across Australia, from the warm north to the cooler south. Many people call it the ""famous Ghan,"" but it is often late.
In the 1920s, there was a train line from Adelaide to Alice Springs. Sometimes, floods made it hard for trains to go. A new train line was finished before Mark's trip. The Ghan train is not very fast, and it has few stops. Most people on the train are on holiday. The food on the train is very good.
The train was first built to carry goods, not people. It was thought that sending goods by train from Darwin to the south would save time and money. The Ghan is the first train in the world to go north to south across a continent.
When Mark waited to get on the Ghan, he saw that everyone was excited. Many older Australians were ready to board. The first stop was Katherine, where the train stayed for four hours. Some people got off to take a boat trip. Mark stayed on the train until Alice Springs. There, he went on a two-day trip to Uluru (Ayers Rock) with a small group. Climbing the rock is not popular now, so they just walked around it and watched the sunset.
From Alice Springs, there are two trains a week going south. Many people stop there. The view from the train after Alice Springs is not very interesting. There is a lot of flat land with cattle. But on the third day, they reached the hills near the Southern Ocean. Mark's journey was over. The train may not have done everything the ads said, but it took him to some amazing places in Australia. 
**Questions:**
1. Where did Mark start his train journey?
2. What is the name of the train Mark took?
3. Why is the Ghan train often late?
4. What did Mark see at Alice Springs?
5. What did Mark and his group do at Uluru?"
PET_31,B1,"Climbing Ben Nevis**
Every year, many people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland. It is the highest mountain in Britain. The weather can be very cold. Climber Keith Hewitt talks about his first climb on Ben Nevis.
It was February, and it was my first big winter climb. We climbed up the north side of the mountain to Tower Ridge. It is 600 metres high. We planned to camp for three days in a place called the 'Carries'. The 'Carries' are big bowls in the mountain, halfway up. We carried tents, sleeping bags, and metal spikes for our boots. You need these spikes because the snow is very hard, like ice.
Even though some people in my group were very good climbers, we took safety equipment. We had lights, hard hats, and extra clothes. The weather was good, but I still felt nervous when we started. Climbing Ben Nevis in winter is always hard.
The path went up, and my legs felt heavy. I was the weakest climber, so I had to rest more often. The others stopped to wait for me, but when I caught up, they started again. I promised myself to train better before my next climb.
After climbing 200 metres, we reached Tower Ridge. It is very narrow, only 1.5 metres wide, and the mountain drops down a lot on both sides. We had to stay calm and focus on every step as we walked slowly.
After seven hours of climbing, we reached the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and the island of Skye, which is 48 kilometres away. But it was misty when we got to the top. 
Going back down to camp can be hard too. You need to read a map well. A wrong turn can be dangerous in winter. I was happy we took turns reading the map. When I was safe in the tent, I could finally say I enjoyed the climb. But I was proud that I made it to the top!"
PET_58,B1,"**Anna's New School**
This week is very exciting! We moved to our new school building. It is a great place. The builders used wood to make it, like our old school. This new school is also good for the environment. 
The school took a long time to build. We watched the builders work. It was exciting to see them clear the land, but some nice land went away. The building machines were very loud. Sometimes, the builders had to stop because it rained a lot. We thought the building would never be finished.
Now, we have five big classrooms. They are much bigger than the old school next door. We share one room with people from the town for meetings. There is also a nursery, a nice dining room, and big changing rooms. We are excited to use the changing rooms when the new sports field is ready.
When you come into the school, you will see that there are no heaters! The heat comes from us - the children, the teachers, and the computers. The building keeps the heat inside. It also keeps the sound inside, so when we sing, it feels like a concert hall!
You will also see a tree on the roof! The builders put it there because it is a custom in Austria, where the roof was made. The electricity for lights and computers comes from a wind turbine on a hill behind the school. We went with our teacher to see it. It goes around very fast and is very big!
We took pictures to put on the website. We are already using the school, but some parts are not finished. We are putting on a play for our parents, but we have to go back to the old school hall to do it. The new hall will be ready next year.
We are very happy with our new school! Our teachers say we will learn better here!"

PET_2,B1,"A Fun Weekend**
A month ago, I did not know that I would be climbing high in the air on a Saturday in November. Now, I look down at the river below me and understand why people like rock climbing. My friend Matt and I arrived at the Activity Centre on Friday evening. The place was not very nice, but we had beds, blankets, and food. We were happy to be out of the city and in the fresh air.
On Saturday morning, we met ten other people in our group. Cameron came with his friends, Kevin and Simon. Sisters Carole and Lynn came with their friend Amanda. We all came from different places and did not know the area. We knew we would spend the weekend outside, but we were not sure how.
Half of us went caving in the morning, and the others went rock climbing. Then we changed activities at lunchtime. Matt and I went to the caves first. Climbing out was harder than going in, but after a lot of pushing, we got out at last. We were covered in mud but happy and excited about what we did."

**Letter to the Newport Evening News**
On Saturday afternoon, I left my handbag on the bus. In my handbag were my cheque book, address book, and my purse. My purse had about £50 in cash and some credit cards. When I realized I lost my handbag, it was too late. I was 72 years old, far from home, and I felt very worried. I stood by the road and cried.
A young man asked me what was wrong. I told him what happened. He gave me some money for my bus fare home. When I told the bus driver what happened, he said I could keep the fare. I got home safely. 
Soon after, the telephone rang. It was the manager of CityBus. He said they found my handbag and would bring it back to me. I got my handbag back, and everything was inside and safe. 
I want to say thank you to everyone who helped me that day. I appreciate their kindness and honesty.
Mrs. B. James, Newport"
PET_60,B1,"Sharks**
Sharks are big fish in the ocean. They can see very well and feel movement in the water. This helps them find food. Sharks can be dangerous for smaller fish.
Sharks are different from other fish. Most sharks must swim all the time to breathe. They do not sleep much. If a shark is turned on its back, it can stop moving. This helps scientists study sharks better."

PET_53,B1,"'Joining the Kirov Ballet
My name is Nathalie. Last year, I was one of the youngest foreign students at the Kirov ballet school in St Petersburg, Russia. At my first ballet class, I was nervous because I didn’t know anyone. Everyone came to me and asked questions in Russian. I tried to speak Russian, and then they talked to me in English. Now, six months later, everyone is very nice to me. My Russian is much better, and I understand my teachers.
For the first two weeks, my mum stayed with me. When she left, I felt a little sad. I even called her at night because I felt lonely. The ballet classes in Russia are harder than in England. I eat a lot to have energy. This helps me do well in class.
In the evenings, I watch my favorite films on my computer, but sometimes I fall asleep before the movie ends. Now that I feel at home, I like to walk around the city and visit the shops. In December, it was very cold. I bought a fur hat because it was minus 10 degrees Celsius, but the Russians said it was warm for that time!
Right now, we are getting ready for a new show, and there is a competition for young dancers that I will enter. I feel very lucky to be here.'"
PET_55,B1,"**THE ICEHOTEL**
The Arctic is a cold place. In summer, many people visit to see the midnight sun. In winter, there are not many people. In the winter of 1990, a French artist named Jannot Derit had an exhibition in a special igloo in Jukkasjarvi. This igloo was on the frozen Torne River. Many visitors came to see it.
One night, some guests decided to sleep in the igloo. They liked it very much. This is how the idea of the ICEHOTEL started. Now, it is famous all over the world. 
Every winter, a team of builders and artists come to Jukkasjarvi to make the hotel. They use snow and ice. The first part of the hotel is ready in December. Each week, a new part opens until January 7th when the hotel is finished. The hotel is outside, so it can change depending on the weather. 
In spring, when it gets warm, the hotel melts. Inside the hotel, it is never warmer than -5 to -8 degrees Celsius. Guests get warm clothes like overalls, hats, and gloves when they stay at the hotel. It is also good to bring sweaters, scarves, and thick socks. 
If you want to visit the ICEHOTEL, you can buy warm clothes on their website. They will bring the clothes to your room when you arrive. The hotel is in Jukkasjarvi, 200 km above the Arctic Circle. It is 15 km from Kiruna airport and 17 km from Kiruna train station. You can take a bus from the airport or train station to the ICEHOTEL."
PET_50,B1,"Shopping for Furniture**
A report by Dave Worthington
Homestyle is a new furniture shop. It opened at midnight last Thursday. Many people came to the shop. There were special offers. A leather sofa was on sale for £45, but only until 3 am. A bed was £30, but only from 3 am to 8 am. 
The shop's normal hours are from 9 am to 9 pm every day. Homestyle said it would stay open for 24 hours. But it had to close after only half an hour. 
A police officer said, ""We knew many people would come, but they were not patient. The shop was full, so the managers closed the doors. People outside were angry. They thought everything would be sold before they could go in. They did not want to wait in line. 
There was also a long line of cars trying to park. Many people left their cars in the road and walked to the shop. This blocked the road.
One customer, Jenny Smith, got into the shop. She said, ""I waited in line for three hours, but I did not have time to buy what I wanted. The staff were calm and explained what was happening. It was not safe. I will come back when they reopen, but I do not want to wait in line again."""

PET_34,B1,"Free-diving in the Caribbean**
Tanya Streeter is a free-diver. She has four world records. Free-diving is a sport where people dive deep into the ocean on one breath of air. In 2003, Tanya became the first person to dive 120 meters deep and come back up without help. She held her breath for more than three and a half minutes. This made her the only woman to break a man’s world record in any sport.
A team of fourteen safety divers watched her dive. Some people think free-diving is dangerous, but Tanya believes safety is very important. She also thinks training is important. Most free-divers focus on one or two events, but Tanya trains the same way for all her events. 
She spends two-thirds of her training in the gym and the rest in the pool and ocean. She uses an exercise bike to make her heart strong. She does not run because she does not want to hurt her knees. Instead, she walks fast to stay fit. 
When she practices diving, she usually travels away from home. She tries to do fourteen dives in four weeks, with a rest day between each dive. It is important for her to not get tired.
When Tanya is not training, she talks to people about sports and helps environmental groups. She grew up on the Caribbean island of Grand Cayman. She loved swimming and exploring the sea. Tanya says her life now is like her childhood dreams. Because she is famous in some countries, people listen to her about environmental issues.
In the future, Tanya wants to keep breaking her own records. She started free-diving when she was twenty-five years old, so she does not plan to stop for many years."
PET_12,B1,"**CARTOON FILMS**
Cartoon films can be very fun. If you can draw, you can make your drawings move on the screen. New ideas and computer programs make cartoons exciting for everyone. 
In the late 1970s, many people thought cartoons were only for kids. But some directors had new ideas. They showed that both adults and kids can enjoy cartoons together. 
Not all cartoon films were good. For example, ""The Black Cauldron"" was not successful. It was too scary for kids and too silly for adults. Directors learned from this, and soon, cartoon films made a lot of money again."
PET_26,B1,"Caroline Benson Talks About Her First TV Role**
Caroline Benson is a new TV star. She talks about her first job on TV. 
""I did not think I would be on TV in my first year at university. I only acted in school plays before, but I loved the book 'The Finnegans' since I was eleven years old. My grandmother said I was like Polly Finnegan, and I wanted to play her.
I took a year off to travel before university. While I was in Chile, my mother emailed me. She said they wanted to make the book into a TV show. I wanted to try for the part. My mother was surprised, but she sent my photo to the director. She asked him to meet me. I flew back home and got the part!
Filming started a week after university began. I asked the university for permission to be away for three weeks. When I returned, I woke up at 6:00 am to write my essays. I did not tell my friends, but they found out and thought it was great. It was an amazing experience, and I feel very lucky.
After university, I want to be an actor. My family is not in acting, but my grandfather was an opera singer. I have tried for other TV roles, but I have not received any offers yet. I had a busy social life too. When filming finished, I did not know what to do. I have acted in two college plays since then. 
I have not been home much, and now my first year at university is over. I am going to Greece for the summer with my friends."""

PET_30,B1,"HONEY**
Honey is a sweet liquid made by bees. It is made of water and sugar. Bees can fly very far, up to seventy-five thousand kilometers, and visit many flowers to make just half a kilo of honey. The color and taste of honey depend on the flowers. There are more than three hundred types of honey. Lighter honey is usually sweeter than darker honey.
A long time ago, honey was the main sweet food because sugar was hard to find. The ancient Egyptians valued honey and used it as money. Today, people all over the world make and eat honey. Some studies say honey can help with tiredness and make you better at sports. Honey is not just food; it can help with sore throats and is used in many skin and hair products."
PET_7,B1,"Norwich**
Norwich is a city in East Anglia, England. It has been a place to live for more than 2,000 years. It started as a small village by the River Wensum. In 1066, when the Normans came, it was one of the biggest towns in England. 
Norwich has two cathedrals and a mosque. The first cathedral was built in 1095. In 1994, Norwich celebrated 800 years as a city. This means it could govern itself. 
Today, Norwich is smaller than cities like London or Manchester. It has about 150,000 people. In the 16th century, it was the second city in England. For 300 years, it grew and became rich. It was famous for many churches and pubs. Now, there are fewer churches and pubs. 
In 1964, the University of East Anglia was built in Norwich. The city has many students and is a busy place for business. It has theatres, cinemas, nightclubs, cafes, restaurants, and arts centres. There is also a football team called 'The Canaries'. Their colours are green and yellow.
Norwich has a new shopping centre called 'The Castle Mall'. For over two years, builders worked on it. They made a park on the roof with water pools and trees. The old market is still there, and people are happy about it. Norwich has a nice mix of old and new things."
PET_43,B1,"**The Albuquerque Balloon Festival**
Every autumn, the sky in Albuquerque, a city in the south-western United States, is full of bright colours. This is the Albuquerque Balloon Festival. It is a nine-day event every year. The first festival was in 1972 for the 50th birthday of a local radio station. There were about twelve hot-air balloons that took off from a car park in Albuquerque. Now, many balloons come from many countries.
**What to See**
The pilots talk to each other on radios. They light up the burners of their balloons at the same time. This is called a ""balloon glow."" It is a great time to take photos. You should come just after night falls or before 5:30 am to see the ""glows"" as the balloons go up into the dark sky. During the day, you can walk around the balloons and talk to the pilots as they get ready to fly. The balloons are in many sizes and colours. Some look like animals or cartoon characters, and some look like popular drinks and fast food. Kids will love it!
In the afternoon, you can fly in a balloon over the desert with one of the companies that offer balloon rides. You can also take a cable car from the desert to the top of the nearby mountains. This is the longest cable car ride, and you can see the festival from above. There are many other fun things to do, like balloon races and fireworks on the first night and the last three nights of the festival.
**The Albuquerque Box**
This is a special wind pattern that helps balloon pilots. The Sandia Mountains protect the balloons from strong winds and create gentle winds at different heights. This helps pilots control their balloons by going up or down.
**Practical Advice**
Buy your tickets early online to avoid waiting in line. Wear several layers of thin clothes. It can be cool at night and in the morning, but during the day, you need sunglasses and sunscreen. Bring a flashlight for night events and don’t forget your camera. If you use film, bring high-speed film for night pictures."

Many things we use every day come from plants. For example, we get wood, rubber, fruit, rice, sugar, coffee, and chocolate from plants. There are more than 135,000 types of plants here.
Even if it is cold outside, the plants stay warm. There are electric heaters that keep the right temperature. In the Rainforest Zone, it is always wet because of a big waterfall. There is also a zone that looks like the Mediterranean, California, and South Africa. Soon, they will build a desert zone too."
PET_11,B1,"'No Title
Some people do not like this year's book, New Writing 3. I do not understand why. It has 500 pages of good writing for £6.99. Most of the book is fiction. This means it has parts of novels and short stories. There are nice stories by famous writers like Candia McWilliam and Rose Tremain. 
Some less famous writers write about food. For example, Jane Harris wrote a story called Those Nails. Do not read it after eating. It has some very bad scenes that can make you feel sick! 
There are also poems from nineteen poets, like R. S. Thomas and John Burnside. Some writers share parts of their new novels, like Jim Crace and Jane Rogers. There is a little non-fiction too. Alan Rusbridger wrote a funny article about newspapers, and Ursula Owen wrote an interesting piece about herself.

Margaret Porter is a violin teacher. She says the best age to start learning the violin is between three and six years old. This is when children learn about the world. Margaret lives in London. She likes to teach children who are three or four years old, but she also teaches some five-year-olds.
Margaret started teaching the violin in 1972. Her first class had her children’s friends who were five years old. Her students learn in groups. Each group has about twelve students. They have lessons for one hour, every two weeks. Each student also has one lesson alone with her every week. 
Parents must come to the lessons. It is important for parents to be interested in the lessons. In the first lessons, students learn to play music by ear. They do not read music for many years. At first, their playing is different from reading music. Margaret says her way of teaching is not to make great violinists. She tells students who play very well to study with other teachers."
PET_56,B1,"Moonshine**
The band Moonshine has a new CD. It is called ""Here Again."" This is their third CD. The last CD was ""The Waves."" 
There are some changes in the band. Tom Wilcott plays the bass guitar now. He replaces Simon McVee, who left the band last year. Tom Simpson is the new drummer.
The first song on the CD is a dance song. The band will play more dance songs now, not just slow songs. The second song is also a dance song and is very loud. Many fans will be surprised by these songs. 
Rob Letchford is the singer. He sings very well. Fans are happy he recorded the songs before he had problems with his throat. Because of this, the band had to cancel their next tour. If you bought tickets, do not worry. The concerts will be rescheduled when Rob feels better.
On this CD, Moonshine shows they can play different types of music. Some songs are slow, and some are fast. I think the best songs are at the beginning. The last songs are not as good. 
""Here Again"" will be a big hit and help the band become more successful."

San Francisco is a city in northern California. A Spanish explorer named Gaspar de Portola found this area in 1769. San Francisco Bay is a beautiful place, but it was found by land, not by sea.
In 1849, many people came to San Francisco to find gold. But the people who got rich were not the gold seekers. The rich people owned banks and law firms. They built big houses on a hill called Nob Hill.
Today, many tourists visit San Francisco. They want to see famous places like Chinatown and the Golden Gate Bridge. Some people take a boat trip to Alcatraz Island to see the old prison."

He had many important jobs. He was a Member of Parliament and President of the Royal Society. He is also known for his work with the British Navy.'"
PET_33,B1,"**The History of Shoes**
A long time ago, shoes were not very comfortable or stylish. People used animal skins to cover their feet. They tied these skins around their ankles when it was cold. 
Today, we still use leather for shoes, but we also use other materials like silk, plastic, and cotton. This depends on what is popular.
One hundred and fifty years ago, people started to wear different shoes for each foot. Before that, shoes were the same shape and could be worn on either foot.
In the past, all shoes were made by hand. Now, many shoes are made by machines in big factories. Sewing machines help make many shoes quickly and at a lower price."

When I hurt my back, I had to stop running for a while. I wanted to help more women enjoy running. I started a running club for women in my area. I was upset because many race organizers say there are not enough women in running, but they do not help by giving women places to change.
I put up posters, and 40 women joined the club. They were young and old, fit and not fit. Many wanted to lose weight, but they did not think about running before. They thought running was hard and painful. They did not know that running can be fun, with chatting and smiling in nice places, like by a river.
At first, they could only run for one minute. Now, they can run for thirty minutes! They also learned about healthy food and staying fit. I wanted to help women with running, and I am very happy to see how much they have improved."
PET_40,B1,"**The History of the Iditarod - The Last Great Race on Earth**
In the 1880s, people found gold in Alaska, the northern state of the USA. Many people came to find gold and get rich. New towns were built quickly. One town was called Iditarod, which means ""far place."" In 1909, Iditarod became the largest city in Alaska for a short time.
In summer, boats brought supplies to the towns. But in winter, rivers and the ocean froze, and boats could not come. So, in 1910, people built a winter path for dog teams with sleds. They took mail, food, and clothes to the gold miners. This path was called the Iditarod Trail. It took about three weeks for a dog team to travel across Alaska. They stopped at places called ""roadhouses"" to sleep and eat.
The trail was used every winter until the 1920s when planes replaced dog teams for transport. But in 1925, there was a disease called diphtheria in Nome. The medicine was in Anchorage, far away. Planes were new, and no one knew if they could fly in the cold. So, they decided to use dog teams to bring the medicine.
The trip was over 1,000 kilometers along the Iditarod Trail. It took twenty dog teams just six days to finish. Leonhard Seppala, a Norwegian, traveled the first 400 kilometers with his dog Togo. Togo was very good at finding the way in the snow. The last part of the trip was done by Gunnar Kaasen, who had worked with dog teams for 21 years. His lead dog was Saito. At one point, Balto, another dog, stopped and saved the team from falling into icy water. The medicine arrived, and Balto became a hero.
Now, every year, there is a dog sled race from Anchorage to Nome. This race follows the famous journey from 1925. It is called the Iditarod and is known as ""The Last Great Race on Earth."""

The bar is made of ice too. It is not good to put hot drinks on the ice. The bedrooms are cold, about -4 degrees Celsius. But guests get warm sleeping bags to help them sleep. They can also get warm clothes if they need them.
The Ice Hotel is new every winter because it melts in summer. It takes a lot of ice and snow to build the hotel."

In 1988, Maria Mutola was the only girl on a boys' football team in Mozambique. ""We won,"" she said. ""At first, no one cared that I was a girl. But then the other team was not happy."" A local newspaper wrote about her story. Jose Craveirinha, who helped African athletes, heard about Maria. He went to see her and saw her playing football. He knew she was very fast.
Jose talked to Maria about athletics. She did not understand. She only knew football. Then, he bought her running shoes and took her to train. It was hard work, and her legs hurt. Jose spoke to her parents and told them she could be successful. They agreed to let him help her train.
In 1991, Maria went to train in the United States. She was scared to go because she would miss her family. The girls in the US were different from her. They were good athletes, but Maria worried about food for her family. They worried about clothes and make-up. They did not know much about her life. But Maria felt lucky to be there. The trainers were great, and she learned a lot.
Today, Maria still runs. She lives happily in South Africa with her mother for most of the year."

The Skywalk is 1219 meters above the bottom of the Grand Canyon. It is a platform made of glass. You can see the rocks of the canyon through the glass. Up to 120 people can stand on the Skywalk at the same time. It opened in 2007, and many people have visited it since then. 
When you walk on the Skywalk, you must wear special covers on your shoes. This is to protect the glass. Walking on the Skywalk feels like flying high in the air."

Today, many cities have a zoo or wildlife park. Some people think zoos are good. They say zoos help us learn about animals and see them up close. 
But not everyone likes zoos. Some people think it is wrong to keep animals in cages. They say that in some zoos, animals live in dirty places and do not get good food."

My band wore black school uniforms, and other bands wore bright T-shirts. We did not look like professional bands, but we played very well. Everyone was young, but we were good at playing music. Players from each band made new songs on stage. It was fun to watch, but it was even better when my band played!  
My school has a great jazz band, but not everyone can join. Only about half of the people who want to play can be in the band. But anyone who wants to play can go to jazz practice before school. We also spend time together after school, listening to jazz and learning about it. We go on trips to jazz summer camps in different places. I have been to a few and learned a lot.  
Many adults are surprised that young people like jazz. My music teacher thinks it is because pop music is not hard enough for serious music lovers like me. I find jazz exciting because it is both new and old. You can make your own music, but you also feel part of its history when you play on stage like great jazz musicians did before. My school is lucky because we have great teachers and parents who help us. Without them, we would not be able to do well in music!"
PET_54,B1,"Watering the Desert**
In Marrakesh, Morocco, it can rain from November to March. It does not rain often. When it rains, the streets can have a lot of water. This can make the streets look like rivers. The people in Marrakesh are happy when it rains because many winters are dry.
Marrakesh has parks and gardens. These do not get water from rain. They get water from underground channels. These channels were made a long time ago, in the 11th century. They bring water from the mountains all year.
Places that are mostly dry but have water from channels are called oases. 
If you go south from Marrakesh, you will find Skoura. In Skoura, people use all the land to grow food. There are water channels that help with this. The Atlas mountains, which have snow in winter, look beautiful in the background."
PET_32,B1,"Gareth Ellis**
Gareth Ellis is 13 years old. He is the youngest son of Alan and Kath. Alan is an engineer, and Kath is a nursery teacher. Gareth has two older brothers. They work in banking and computers. But Gareth wants to be a clown.
Three years ago, Gareth and his family joined a circus. Kath says, ""People laugh when we tell them, but it is true. Gareth wanted to be a clown since he was three years old."" When Alan lost his job, he and Kath looked for jobs in the circus. They both found jobs, and Gareth started to train to be a clown. He calls himself Bippo.
In the summer, they travel with the circus. In the winter, they go home. Gareth's brothers take care of the house when they are away. Kath says, ""It was not easy. We had to think about many things. We had a small car and a small caravan to sleep in. We left our nice house. The only thing Gareth missed was his long baths.""
Gareth says, ""People ask about my school. But wherever we go, someone teaches me. I use the same books as my friends at school, and I have a computer. I do not fall behind my classmates.""
What about the future? Kath says, ""It was a hard choice, but it is the best way to teach Gareth about being a clown. We are happy, and we enjoy it."" Gareth says, ""I want to be the main clown in a circus one day, maybe Bippo's circus."""
PET_52,B1,"**Eight-eighteen News**
Eight-eighteen News is a news group for young people. You can join if you are between 8 and 18 years old. We collect news and write stories. We send these stories to newspapers, magazines, TV, radio, and websites. You can read or listen to the stories on the Eight-eighteen website.
We have three places in the country where young people can meet and work on projects. We want to open more places soon. Since we started in 1994, over 2,500 young people have joined. Sophie is one of them. She says: ""I heard about Eight-eighteen when they asked me about hip hop music. I met young journalists and saw what they did. Age did not matter. I went to the Eight-eighteen place in my city, got training, and was a member until I was 18. Eight-eighteen helped me a lot. I got a job at 19 and now I check articles for a big news website.""
**Join Us!**
When you join Eight-eighteen, you will get training. You will also have meetings every month to decide who will write each news story. Older members, called ""peer trainers,"" help new members learn basic skills. Some of these trainers talk to groups of young people and adults outside of Eight-eighteen. They always have support from older staff.
Eight-eighteen has training for new members three times a year. The next training is in February. If you or someone you know wants to join, call Director Den Ley at 01622 657874 for more information. You can join Eight-eighteen if you can read and write at any level. Membership is free, and there is no test to join."
PET_28,B1,"**Antarctica Sightseeing Flights Website**
Welcome to our website! Here is what you need to know before booking a flight.
In the summer, we take tourists on a big plane (Boeing 747) from Sydney, Australia, over Antarctica and back. The flight dates for next year are not ready yet, but if you book now, you can change your date if needed.
**Questions**
**How long is the flight?**  
The flight is about 12 hours. After about four hours, we see sea ice and icebergs. We spend four hours over Antarctica and then fly back home. During the flight, experts talk about Antarctica and answer questions. There is a camera next to the pilot that shows you what the pilot sees from take-off to landing.
**Will I get a seat next to a window?**  
All passengers get two boarding passes. Halfway through the flight, you will move to the seat on your second pass. Business and first-class passengers will have a window seat for half of the flight. Economy passengers will have a window seat or a seat next to a window for half of the flight and a seat at the end of the row for the other half. While over Antarctica, you can get up and move around the plane to see better. The pilot flies in big circles so everyone can see the sights.
**What happens if the weather is bad?**  
We have 17 different flight plans. The captain checks the weather on the morning of the flight and chooses the best way to see clearly.
**Will I see penguins and other wildlife?**  
Most wildlife is far below the plane, so we cannot see them well. We do not land in Antarctica because of environmental reasons. To see wildlife, you need to go on a boat tour.
**Can I take photographs?**  
Yes! You can bring your camera. We also have fun photo opportunities where you can wear cold weather clothes from Antarctica."
PET_35,B1,"Little Chefs**
Some children, aged ten to fifteen, learn to cook on Saturdays. They have fun and make good food. Many children want to join the class, so there is a waiting list of 30 kids. Parents pay £280 for the course.
Bill is ten years old. He says, ""I love my mum's cooking. Now I can cook better than her. The teachers make us laugh when we eat the food we made.""
Flora is twelve. She has trouble with onions. She says, ""I love cooking. I made a meal for ten friends, and they liked it. My mum told me to find a hobby for the weekend. I was happy at home, so I did not want to go at first. But now I am glad I came.""
Their teacher, Philippe, says, ""It is fun. Children pay attention and remember better than adults. The kitchen is not always clean when they cook! Adults keep learning about food. If parents teach their children to cook when they are young, the children can make food for themselves when they are older."""
PET_5,B1,"**Winter Driving**
Winter can be dangerous for driving. It is hard to know what will happen, and accidents can happen easily. Fog can be on the road, and ice can be under the snow. A car coming towards you can slide on the road.
**Rule Number One**: Drive smoothly. If you move the car too fast or too suddenly, it can be hard to control. When you turn the wheel, touch the brakes, or go faster, do it gently and slowly. Imagine you have a full cup of hot coffee next to you. Drive so you do not spill it.
**Rule Number Two**: Pay attention to the road. Look far ahead, especially if there is ice. Test how long it takes to stop by braking gently. You may be driving faster than you think. 
When the road is wet, allow double the time to stop. On snow, allow three times the time. On ice, allow even more time. Try to keep control of your car, and you will be safe."
PET_41,B1,"**Craigie Aitchison**
Craigie Aitchison is a painter. He was born in Scotland. He went to London to study law, but he went to art school instead. In art school, he found drawing hard, but he kept painting.
When he was in his late twenties, the Italian government gave him money to study art. He liked early Italian artists, and this is seen in his paintings. He loved the green and brown fields in Italy and the bright light there. He wanted to show this light in his paintings. He painted with thin layers of color, from light to dark. He said, ""It's a secret - because I don't know what will happen."" He does not start with a color and know what will come next.
Aitchison thinks painting is easy. He said, ""Anyone can do the colors - you can buy them. I just see what colors look good together."" He does not make drawings before he paints. He thinks if he draws first, he might get bored and not paint. He changes his paintings many times before they are done. He likes to paint people who do not want to see their picture while he is painting. He said, ""If they are worried and want to look, I can't paint.""
Since he moved to London, he does not feel part of the Scottish art scene. He does not want to follow any tradition. He just paints in his own way. His work still inspires young British painters."
PET_38,B1,"Rock Band**
Two years ago, our son Ben, who is 14 years old, asked us for drums for his birthday. At first, we did not want to buy them because of the noise. Ben said, ""It is better than watching TV or playing computer games. It will keep me out of trouble."" In the end, we agreed. We said, ""Okay, but you must think about the family and the neighbors when you play.""
After that, Ben's friends came to our house with their guitars and other music things. Now, our house is noisy with their music and singing for many hours each week. When they practice, my husband and I go for a long walk. 
Even if their music is a little strange, they are nice and polite. I do not know if they are good musicians, but they play at local clubs for young people. We worry that they will not do enough school work because of music, but this has not happened yet. I always tell Ben that his studies are very important. But one thing is sure: Ben was right. Playing music keeps him out of trouble and he is never bored."
PET_17,B1,"Atlantic College**
Last week, I visited Atlantic College. It is a good private college in Wales. The college helps young people learn about life outside the classroom and study for their exams. 
The students are between 16 and 18 years old. They come from many countries. In the morning, they study. In the afternoon, they do useful activities. They might help on a farm, care for people, or check rivers for pollution.
Atlantic College has students from different backgrounds. Many students cannot pay the fees of £20,000 for two years, so there are grants to help them. About 25% of the students are British. Many British students get help from the government to attend.
Barbara Molenkamp, a student from the Netherlands, said, ""I admire the college for helping young people understand each other. You learn to live with people and respect them, even if you don’t like them. My mother said I argued less with my sister during the summer.""
In short, Atlantic College gives students a great education with methods that work well."
PET_47,B1,"Being an Older Student**
I am 32 years old. I just finished my first year at university. I go to classes and I read books. I also write long essays. I decided to go to university after being away from school for fourteen years. 
Before, I worked as a secretary. I earned good money, but I was bored. I did not think much in my job. I felt sad because I thought I was stuck in that job. I saw students at the local university. They looked happy and full of hope. I wanted to be like them.
Now, I am a student, but it is hard for me to make friends with younger students. They often think I am a teacher and ask me questions I cannot answer. I also feel different from the teachers. We are the same age, but I know less than they do.
I am happy to study because I need a qualification to get a good job. This is very important to me. I like to spend my weekends reading books instead of going to parties. I also enjoy the long holidays and discounts for the theatre and cinema.
Sometimes, I worry about what I will do after university. But I hope that going back to school now is a good choice."
PET_48,B1,"Henry Ford**
Henry Ford was born on a farm in Michigan in 1863. He did not like farming. When he was fifteen years old, he started to work as a mechanic. In 1893, he made his first car. He drove it for 1,500 kilometers. Then, he sold it and made two bigger cars. In 1903, he started the Ford Motor Company. He used strong and light steel to make cars that were cheap for people to buy. 
In 1908, he made the first Ford Model 'T'. It cost $825. Soon, he was selling 100 cars every day. By 1927, the Ford Motor Company was worth $700 million. Early Ford cars were simple and cheap, but they had less choice. Henry Ford said about the Model T, ""You can have any color you like, as long as it is black."""

Rebecca Stevens was the first woman to climb Mount Everest. Before she climbed the highest mountain, she was a journalist. She lived in a small flat in south London. In 1993, Rebecca left her job and traveled to Asia with some climbers. 
Life on Everest is hard. Rebecca said, ""You must carry everything on your back. You can only take what you need. You can't wash on the mountain. I didn't even take a toothbrush. I am usually clean, but there is no water, only snow. Water is heavy, so you only take enough to drink!""
On May 17, 1993, Rebecca reached the top of Mount Everest. It was the best moment of her life. She became famous. Now, she has written a book about her trip. People often ask her to talk about it. She has a new job on a science program on television. 
Rebecca is well known today. She has more money, but she still lives in her small flat in south London with her pictures and books about mountains."

KET_13,A2,"CANADA GEESE**
Canada Geese are big birds. They are blue and white. In autumn, they fly south to find warm weather. It is very cold in Canada in winter. The birds can die if they stay there.
Last spring, a man named Bill Lishman found sixteen young Canada Geese on his farm. The young birds lost their parents. Bill thought, ""These young birds do not know what to do in autumn."" 
Bill had a small plane. He decided to help the birds. All summer, he flew his plane, and the young geese followed him. 
When autumn came, Bill flew to Virginia in the United States. Virginia is 600 miles south of Canada. The geese followed him all the way. 
Bill left the geese in Virginia and went back home. This spring, Bill waited for the geese to come back. They did not come, so Bill flew to Virginia to find them. He looked for two weeks but could not find them. 
When Bill got home, he saw the geese waiting for him. They found their way home without him!"
KET_16,A2,"**Esther's Story**
Esther left school when she was sixteen years old. Her aunt Flory gave her £500 for her birthday. Most of Esther's friends went to college, but Esther used the money to start her own business. She bought fruit, sugar, and glass jars to make jam. She sold the jam for £1 a jar to her friends and soon had £1,000.
At first, her parents did not want her to make jam. They wanted her to study and become a teacher or a doctor. But Esther did not listen. She kept making jam. After a few months, she sold it at the local market. Then she made orange juice and sold it to a school where her friend worked.
After two years, her business grew a lot. Her parents were very happy with her. She made many kinds of food and sold them to shops and supermarkets. She was very busy and needed to hire some people to help her."

KET_46,A2,"**Corryvale Farm**
Corryvale Farm is in the west of England. Stephen and Jenny Blackler have cows and chickens. They sell milk and eggs. Most of their money comes from Jenny's sheep. She has 50 sheep. Each sheep has enough wool for six sweaters. Every six months, Stephen cuts the wool from the sheep. This helps the sheep not to be too warm.
Five years ago, Jenny made sweaters with the wool. She tried to sell them at markets, but it was summer and hot. People did not want to buy sweaters. So, she made socks instead. Everyone loved the socks because they were cheap, strong, and easy to wash. This is how Jenny's business started.
At first, Jenny made the socks at home. Soon, she had many customers. She had to send the wool to a factory. Now, the socks are made on machines. There are six colors and five sizes for all ages. There are different socks for walking, sports, and skiing.
Jenny is very busy at Christmas because Corryvale socks are a popular gift. In her office, there are many letters from happy customers all over the world."

KET_10,A2,"'BURGLARS LIKE THE AFTERNOON'**
Many house burglaries happen between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m., say the police. Inspector Ian Saunders told us that house burglaries have gone up by more than 30% compared to last year. He said that 67% of burglaries happen when people go out and forget to close a door or a window. 
Night-time burglaries are not common because families are usually at home then. But winter afternoons are good for burglars because it is dark and they can’t be seen easily. Many houses are empty at this time because people are still at work.
Inspector Saunders said it is a good idea to leave lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when you go on holiday. This can help keep burglars away. He also asked neighbors to watch other houses when people are not home. They should call the police if they see something strange. 
Inspector Saunders said, ""We will also tell you how to make your house safe. This help costs nothing."""

KET_44,A2,"**The History of Farming**
Before farming, people looked for plants and fruit in the forest to eat. They moved a lot to find food. About 12,000 years ago, in the Middle East, people started to grow food. These people were the first farmers. 
Farming helped people stay in one place. Their villages became bigger. Some people in the villages could do other jobs, like making clothes, because farmers grew food for everyone. 
Sometimes, farming was hard when the weather was bad. Some people did not have enough food to eat. 
Today, farmers grow more food. The food travels a long way to reach our homes."

At work, the first thing I do is check plane times on my computer. Then, I talk with some air hostesses. Sometimes, I go on long flights to see how the air hostesses are doing. That is my favorite part of the job, but I like office work, too.

Many Indians like to watch films. Ten million people go to the cinema every day. Bollywood films often tell love stories, and there is a lot of singing and dancing in them. People outside India also enjoy Indian films. Last year, Bollywood made over $500 million by selling its films to other countries.
Indian actors make more films each year than American actors in Hollywood, but they earn less money. Most Bollywood films cost about $2 million to make. A Hollywood film usually costs more than $5 million to make.

Parrots are beautiful birds. They have nice colors and long tails. You can see them in the forest or in the zoo. Parrots live in countries like Brazil, Australia, and India. They like to live in big groups. Parrots eat fruit, and sometimes they can be a problem for farmers.
There are many types of parrots. All parrots have strong beaks and feet. They use their beaks and feet to climb and hold food. Some parrots can live for 80 years. They are very noisy, but they are smart. You can teach them to talk. Some zoos have shows with parrots. You can see the parrots do tricks they have learned."
KET_25,A2,"'HOWARD BONNIER
Bray is a nice village about fifty kilometers west of London. A young man named Howard Bonnier opened a restaurant called The Palace there three and a half months ago. Not many people in Britain know his name yet, but he is famous in France. He has written about many good restaurants in French magazines. He is 29 years old.
When Howard was a teenager, he went to restaurants with his parents. He liked this a lot. He decided to spend his money on visiting France and eating in good restaurants instead of buying clothes and CDs. He also has many cookbooks. He says he has more than two hundred and fifty!
Why did he open a restaurant? He loves cooking. Is it easy? He says it is expensive to start a restaurant. It is harder to cook for fifty people than for his family, but he thinks he did the right thing.'"
KET_34,A2,"John Pickering**
In a small park in England, John Pickering cuts the grass and waters the flowers. Last week, he was in Tokyo, Japan. Many people in Japan watched him on television because he is a famous singer there. 
John went to Japan a few months ago to sing in clubs in Osaka and Nagoya. A radio DJ heard his songs and played them on the radio. Many young people called the DJ to ask for his songs again. 
John sings under the name Jon Otis in Japan. He still works in the park in England. He does not know how much money he will make from singing. He says, ""I must keep my job in the park. I need to pay my bills!"" 
The other gardeners do not know he is famous in Japan. They have never heard him sing. John's wife, Denise, works in a hospital. She says, ""This will not change our life. I only know John Pickering, not Jon Otis!"""

KET_26,A2,"Line Dancing**
Many people in Britain have a new hobby: line dancing. In almost every town, there are clubs and classes for this fun activity. 
""Line dancing is easy to learn,"" says Fiona Lever, a teacher. ""If you can walk, you can do it!"" You do not need a partner because you dance in groups. It is a great way to make new friends. In my classes, there are young and old people. The boys like it because they can make a lot of noise with their feet when they dance!
When did line dancing start? Most people think it started about fifteen years ago when American country music became popular in Britain."
KET_8,A2,"**The Rhino**
There are five types of rhinos in the world. The Black and White rhinos live in Africa. The other types live in forests in Asia. Rhinos have big, heavy bodies. Their skin is hard and they have little hair. Rhinos stand on four short legs. Each foot has three toes. They walk slowly, but they can run fast, up to 50 kilometers an hour. Rhinos are quiet and calm. They eat grass and plants. A baby rhino weighs 40 kilos when it is born. It stays in its mother for about fifteen months. An adult rhino weighs more than 200 kilos and can live for 50 years."
KET_4,A2,"**THE HISTORY OF THE LONDON POLICE**
A long time ago, in 1700, there were no policemen in London. Only a few old men helped to protect the streets at night, and they did not get paid much. 
London was getting bigger, but it was very dirty, and many people were poor. There were many thieves who stole money, so people stayed at home. 
In 1750, a man named Henry Fielding paid some people to stop the thieves. They were like policemen and were called 'Bow Street Runners' because they worked near Bow Street. 
Fifty years later, there were 120 Bow Street Runners, but London was very big and needed more policemen. So, in 1829, the first London Police Force started with 3000 officers. Most of the men walked, but some rode horses. 
Until 1920, all the police in London were men. Today, London police get paid well, and the few police officers who ride horses get paid even more."

KET_7,A2,"'Visit the Edinburgh Festival! Every year, many people go to Edinburgh, the capital city of Scotland, for the Edinburgh Festival. This festival is in August and September and lasts for three weeks. The city has many actors and artists from different countries. The streets are full of music and dance from morning to night. You can see artists painting pictures on the streets. 
One fun part of the Festival is the 'Fringe'. Here, students do funny shows in small places like cafes. Many tourists come to see new films, plays, and listen to famous musicians. This year, there are over five hundred shows with actors from more than forty countries. The tickets are not very expensive, and it is often easier to see your favorite star in Edinburgh than in London. 
So, come to Edinburgh next summer! But remember, it can be hard to find a room, so it is a good idea to book your hotel now!'"
KET_43,A2,"**ICE-FISHING**
If you drive north from Toronto for three hours, you will find Lake Nipissing. In winter, the lake is covered with ice. Many Canadian fishermen go there every weekend. They build small wooden houses on the ice and paint them in bright colors. They sit inside to catch fish that swim under the ice.
Bob Marvisch has come here for twenty-five years. He says, ""You need light but warm clothes: two pairs of socks, gloves, thin sweaters, and a snow suit."" 
Catching fish is easy. First, you break the ice and make a small hole. Then, you take a fishing line and put some bread on it. You put the line through the hole and into the water. When the fish eat the bread, you pull the line up. The fish are between ten and twenty centimeters long. Some people like to eat them, but Bob prefers chocolate or snacks after he catches three or four fish. 
Today, he has caught twenty-five fish! It is a fun sport, and you can meet nice people here!"

KET_11,A2,"Madame Tussaud's**
Madame Tussaud's is a famous place for tourists in London. It is a museum. In this museum, people can see wax figures of famous people. 
Madame Tussaud was born in France in 1761. Her uncle was a doctor. He made wax figures of people and opened a museum in Paris. Marie helped her uncle.
In 1789, during the French Revolution, Marie went to prison. In prison, she had to make wax heads of famous people who were dead, like Queen Marie Antoinette.
In 1795, Marie married Francois Tussaud. In 1802, she came to London with her wax figures. She opened a museum in London. You can still see her figures today."
KET_14,A2,"**BICYCLES**
A bicycle is a cheap and clean way to travel. The first bicycle was made about 150 years ago. At first, bicycles were expensive. Only rich people could buy them. These early bicycles looked very different from today’s bicycles. Later, bicycles became cheaper, and many people bought them. People started riding bicycles to work and for fun. 
Today, many people use cars more than bicycles. Cars are faster, and you don’t get wet when it rains! But some people still like to ride bicycles to work. They say there are too many cars in town, and it is hard to find a place to park!"

The Elephant Show by Daniel Allsop, age 14
Last summer, I went to Thailand with my family. We had a beach holiday. One day, we went to a park near our hotel. The park had beautiful flowers, but we wanted to see the elephant show. 
We went to a big square with seats. Three elephants came in with their keepers. They stood in front of a big white card. Each elephant had a paintbrush. They started to paint on the card. The keepers gave them new brushes with paint and took the old ones away. 
The elephants painted pictures. One picture was of a river, one was of a tree, and one was of flowers. When the keepers showed the paintings, everyone wanted to buy one. We gave the elephants bananas that we brought for lunch. 
Twenty years ago, elephants worked in the forest. Now, they do not work there. The smartest elephants live in special places where people can watch them."
KET_56,A2,"Big Cats**
There are many kinds of cats. They are different in size and look. Tigers are the biggest cats. They can be 3.7 meters long. Most cats do not like water, but tigers like to lie in water when it is hot. 
Lions are the only cats that live in big family groups. Many lions work together to find food. They usually live in flat, open places where they can see far and follow other animals. 
All cats need good eyes to catch smaller animals for food. They also need to be fast and strong."

The ostrich is the biggest bird in the world. An adult ostrich can weigh more than 90 kilos. Most wild ostriches live in southern Africa, but there are not many left. Like all birds, ostriches have wings, but they cannot fly. They use their wings to help them turn when they run. 
Ostriches can run very fast, up to 90 kilometres an hour. This makes it hard for other animals to catch them. Baby ostriches are the same size as chickens. They take about 3 years to grow up. Ostriches eat plants and can live for many days without water."

KET_64,A2,"Mount Kilimanjaro**
Mount Kilimanjaro is the tallest mountain in Africa. Many people climb Kilimanjaro. Some are very young, like a seven-year-old boy, and some are old, like an 87-year-old man. There are different paths to the top. The Marangu path is five kilometers long and is the easiest. It takes about five days to climb and many tourists like it. 
Only half of the people who try to climb Kilimanjaro reach the top. This can happen because the weather changes quickly. At the start, it can be hot and rainy. But at the top, there is ice and snow, and it can be very cold, below 20 degrees. Climbers need to bring sunglasses and warm clothes!"
KET_29,A2,"Otters**
Not many people have seen an otter. Otters live near rivers. They make their homes from small pieces of wood. Otters usually come out at night. They are very good swimmers and can swim fast. Otters have thick brown fur. This keeps them warm in the water. An otter can close its ears and nose. This helps them stay under water for a long time.
Twenty years ago, there were not many otters in Great Britain. The rivers were dirty, and many fish and insects died. Otters could not find food. But now, the rivers are clean, and there is a lot of food for otters."

People have always made buildings. We need houses to keep us warm and dry. We build stadiums to watch football games and concerts. We have museums to keep beautiful things.
Many people work together on a building. The architect decides how the building looks and draws pictures of it. Engineers make sure the building is strong and safe. Then, workers build it carefully.

Today, people send postcards to friends and family. Postcards have pictures of beaches, mountains, or castles. You can write a message on the back. Many people send postcards when they are on holiday. Postcards are cheap, and the pictures are often nice.
The first postcard was sent a long time ago, at the end of the 1800s. It had a picture of a town by the sea. Later, postcards showed news, like an accident or a visit from an important person. People liked these postcards because they did not have pictures in their newspapers."
KET_5,A2,"Dinosaurs**
No one has seen a dinosaur. The last dinosaur died about 60 million years ago. This was a long time before people were on Earth. We do not know why they all died. The closest living relatives of dinosaurs are birds. 
Dinosaurs did not all look the same. There were more than 5000 kinds. Some were very small, but others were very big. The biggest dinosaurs were larger than any other animals that lived on land. 
For example, the Brontosaurus was twenty meters long. It ate plants. The Tyrannosaurus Rex was not as big, but it was very strong. It had sharp teeth for eating meat. It could run fast because it had long back legs."

Bears are big animals. They can be dangerous. An adult bear is very strong and can hurt a person. Bears can climb trees and run fast. But they do not see well. They find food with their noses.

You can see many crocodiles together in groups. They eat fish, birds, and small animals. Sometimes, they eat big animals or even people.
There are more than ten kinds of crocodiles. They have very sharp teeth. They can lose their teeth, but they grow new ones. Crocodiles are usually about 3.5 meters long, but some are bigger. They can live a long time. The oldest crocodile in a zoo was 66 years old."

They flew in this plane in the United States. In 1918, the US Post Office started the first airmail service. 
Aeroplanes changed a lot in the next thirty years. In the 1950s, aeroplanes became faster because they had jet engines. In 1976, Concorde was made in the UK and France. It is the fastest passenger plane in the world. It can fly at 2500 kilometres an hour. The trip from London to New York takes only four hours. 
Today, many people travel by aeroplane. It is hard to think of a world without them."

People who visited the theatre ate food, talked to friends, and walked around during the show. Some people even threw things at the actors!
