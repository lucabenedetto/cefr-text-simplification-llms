**Garbage in, garbage out**
Charging families for each bag of rubbish they throw away seems like a good idea for the environment and for saving money. However, it might not be. In many developed countries, the way we collect rubbish is similar. Rubbish bags or bins are picked up regularly by special trucks and taken to a dump. Economists find this strange because, in most places, this service is free. Families pay for it through local taxes, but a family that throws away a lot of rubbish pays the same as a couple that throws away very little. However, disposing of rubbish is not free. The more rubbish people throw away, the more trucks and workers are needed, and the more local governments have to pay to get rid of it. This creates a problem: if rubbish disposal is free, people will throw away too much rubbish.
One solution is to make families pay for the amount of rubbish they throw away. This would encourage them to throw away less and recycle more, as long as local governments provide places to recycle. But two American economists, Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman, found that this simple solution can have complicated and sometimes disappointing results. They studied several American towns that started charging families for their rubbish.
The most common method is to sell stickers or tags that families put on their rubbish bags or bins. Only bags with these tags are picked up. In a study published last year, Fullerton and Kinnaman looked at a program started in July 1992 in Charlottesville, Virginia, a town with about 40,000 people. Residents had to pay 80 cents for each tagged bag of rubbish. This seems like a good use of market forces. However, the authors found that the benefits of the program did not cover the costs of printing the tags, paying sellers, and the workers running the program. 
True, the number of bags thrown away dropped by 37%. But this was mostly because people started cramming more rubbish into each bag, a behavior first seen in Seattle when they introduced rubbish pricing. Instead of buying more tags, people just packed more garbage into their containers. This is not as effective as machines at landfills. The weight of rubbish collected in Charlottesville fell by only 14%. In 25 other Virginia cities without a pricing program, the weight also fell by 3.5%.
Worse still, some people began to dump their rubbish illegally instead of paying for collection. This is hard to measure, but the authors believe that illegal dumping might explain 30-40% of the reduction in collected rubbish. The only positive result was a 15% increase in recycling, suggesting that people chose to recycle (which is free) instead of paying to have their rubbish taken away. However, many people were already recycling in Charlottesville before the program started.
In a more recent study, Fullerton and Kinnaman looked at rubbish in more detail. They found that charging for rubbish does reduce the amount thrown away, but not by much. On average, a 10% increase in sticker prices only reduces rubbish by 0.3%. This is less than in other studies. To throw away a lot less rubbish, people would need to buy less of everything. A small tax on rubbish is unlikely to make a big difference. 
If this is true, we should think about whether other factors, like income and education, are just as important as price. For example, richer towns tend to throw away more rubbish than poorer ones, and people in richer towns have less time to recycle. Should we say that charging families for rubbish is a bad idea? Not really; free disposal is probably too cheap. But the effects of simple policies can be complicated. We often need complex economic models to understand them, and sometimes the results are not very good."
CPE_19,C2,"
Theodore Zeldin talks about how our work life might change in the future. Do you feel respected and appreciated at your job? Success in a career is not enough anymore. Many people feel that their work is not valued or understood. Even famous people can feel unhappy despite their success. 
In the past, loving your job was enough to feel special. Now, you need to think about how your job affects you as a person, your mind, character, and relationships. This is an important question. If your skills make you boring and unable to talk to others outside your job, then no amount of money or status can make up for that. 
Zeldin wants to find ways for work to be more fulfilling and to help us grow as individuals, not just as workers. Work should not only be about making money but also about living a meaningful life, discovering new talents, and meeting different people. However, just creating more jobs is not the solution. As more people get educated, they want jobs that are interesting and helpful.
Even jobs that used to be respected, like doctors and architects, can be stressful and unfulfilling. Many workers feel lost in their roles, and companies are not doing enough to keep their employees happy. In Britain, only 8% of workers feel that their values match those of their companies.
Zeldin is studying different jobs to see how they affect people. He is looking at important topics like happiness, love, friendship, and respect. He believes we need to think about what kind of people we want to work with and how we can feel more alive at work. Many people feel trapped in their jobs, working just to survive instead of to grow.
For example, many hotel workers are smart and capable but work long hours for low pay. Hotels could be more than just places to sleep; they could be cultural centers where people from different backgrounds meet and connect. Hotel staff could use their skills and knowledge to create better experiences for guests.
Zeldin believes that work is about relationships. Many people want to have more control over their jobs and choose their colleagues. This means they need to learn how to communicate well with others, even if they come from different backgrounds. Good communication is important, but it is different from real conversation. 
Real conversation creates a bond of respect and helps people understand each other better. Every time we have a meaningful conversation, we can change the world, even if just a little bit."
CPE_24,C2,"Broadcasting: The Social Shaping of a Technology**
The word 'broadcasting' originally meant to spread seeds widely by hand. This idea is not just about farming; it also represents hope for growth and success. It suggests that if conditions are good, we can expect a good outcome. The idea of broadcasting assumes that there are central resources to help spread information.
We need to understand why a new technology that sends words and pictures electronically was organized in a way that fits this farming idea. Television, as a technology, is connected to other forms of communication like the telegraph and the telephone. However, from the beginning, it was seen as a central 'mass' medium. This means that it was designed to send information from one central place to many homes. This way of broadcasting matched the social and economic structures of modern societies.
There were some attempts to create different ways of using television. For example, in the early 1930s, radio enthusiasts in Britain tried to develop two-way television, which could replace regular telephones. Many science magazines published articles on how to build television equipment, and many people experimented with it. However, big companies took control in 1938 by setting standards for television equipment, which pushed out the amateur inventors. This was a missed opportunity for television to become a more community-based form of communication.
In the early 1930s, television was mainly used for public shows in the USA and was seen as competition for the film industry. Most people in Britain and Germany watched television in public places rather than at home. The idea of community-based television was not successful, as manufacturers wanted to sell more home television sets. As working-class people improved their living standards from the 1920s, having a home filled with entertainment became a reality for many in Western countries. This trend is now happening worldwide.
There is a clear link between social changes and how broadcasting developed. As societies modernized, power and wealth became more concentrated, and traditional communities broke apart. People became more mobile, which made them feel more isolated compared to earlier, stable communities. Centralized broadcasting helped governments share important information with all citizens and created a sense of community in the nation-state.
However, broadcasting can also be seen positively as a way to support democracy. During the time between the World Wars, many countries recognized broadcasting as a way to ensure equal access to information for everyone, allowing people to participate in political, social, and cultural life.
Television is changing, and the term 'broadcasting' may become outdated. If that happens, it will only refer to a specific way of using audio-visual technology during a certain time of social change."
CPE_13,C2,"Clutter**
Sometimes, it feels like no matter how many things you own, you still do not feel secure. It is normal to want to create a home that meets your needs, but there comes a point when wanting more things becomes too much. Modern advertising is designed to make us feel insecure. The message we often hear is that if you do not have certain things, you are not as good as others. 
To see how much advertising affects you, try not to look at any billboards the next time you walk down the street. We are surrounded by advertisements on television, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, t-shirts, and the internet, all telling us to buy more.
**Caves**
Research teams and universities around the world have spent many years studying caves. They look at how caves form, how water moves in them, and the living things inside them. Caves are a small but interesting part of nature. They make us curious and have been studied for a long time, especially in places where caves affect our lives. 
However, visiting many caves requires physical strength, so cave research is often done by both scientists and people who explore caves for fun.
**Weather Watch**
Many people, using only their senses, started the study of weather, known as meteorology, which has become a complex science since the 17th century. Today, satellites and electronic tools give us a lot of weather information quickly. Computers can solve complicated math problems much faster than humans can.
Meteorology uses many difficult words that are hard for most people to understand. However, human experience is still very important for making weather forecasts. Observations from people can provide valuable information that helps professionals understand the weather better."
CPE_16,C2,"**MUSIC AND THEATRE**
Not long ago, I believed that opera is mainly theatre. Now, I think differently. After working at a national opera house, I learned that music is the most important part of opera. This is how it should be. However, I come from the world of theatre, where the words and the actors are the most important. In theatre, once the show starts, there is no one directing the action, and the performers and the audience usually speak the same language.
At any music performance, whether in a concert hall or an opera house, there are many people who, like me, do not know much about music. Some may feel embarrassed about their lack of knowledge. Most people are amazed by the talent of the performers. A great singer or a skilled musician is impressive. Even a good musician shows us the results of years of hard work. Watching top-class music is similar to watching a sports event. We know that athletes are doing something similar to what we do when we run for a bus, but we see how much better they are.
Theatre audiences have different expectations. They often do not understand the skills of actors and may not be very impressed by what they see. They might ask, ""How do you learn all those lines?"" when an actor finishes a long speech. This does not mean that theatre audiences are less demanding than music audiences; many of them are the same people. However, in theatre, the audience and performers meet on more equal terms, no matter how difficult the material is.
The question is, does music need to learn anything from theatre? I believe it does. I have seen how a different approach can change the experience for concert-goers. Live music is very theatrical, full of emotions like passion, humor, and sadness. It connects with the audience not just as individuals but as a group. The rules that still exist in music, like strict dress codes and showing too much respect to conductors and soloists, create a distance between performers and listeners that can feel uncomfortable.
On the other hand, when music audiences clap between songs or after a great performance, it can be a way to show appreciation, but it can also interrupt the flow of the music. Is there a solution? Yes, a lot is being done. Many projects are encouraging new audiences to attend concerts and operas and to break down the barriers that make people feel that ""serious"" music is not for them.
I remember a special event, the community opera ""In Search of Angels,"" which took place in different locations within a cathedral and then in the town. It was a wonderful musical experience where the skills of the musicians were very important, and it changed the lives of many audience members, who were not just there to watch and listen but also to take part.
What I hope for in music is a bit more of the excitement and boldness that the best theatre can show. Sometimes this can come from using unusual or challenging locations, which can surprise both performers and audiences. People may have to give up some comforts, like a good sound or warmth, but theatre audiences have learned to be brave and follow artists into unexpected places.
I know that most plays are performed in a traditional way, similar to concerts. However, I believe that something should change in how we experience music. I am just a fan of both theatre and music. I love them and spend as much time and money as I can enjoying them. I want both to succeed and for more people to enjoy the pleasure I get from being in the audience."
CPE_21,C2,"**Text:**
**Sand**  
I admire how sand can be changed into useful things like glass and concrete, but I do not like it when it is just sand. To me, it is mostly a problem that gets in the way between a parking lot and the sea. It blows in your face, gets into your food, and can hide important things like car keys and coins. When you are wet, it sticks to you and is hard to remove, even with a strong hose. But, strangely, when you step onto a beach towel, get into a car, or walk on a clean carpet, it falls off you easily. For days after, you find sand on the floor every time you take off your shoes, and even more when you take off your socks. Sand stays with you longer than many illnesses. So, I would rather not have sand.
**Lock and Key**  
People have always wanted a safe home where they can feel private and secure. A simple wooden beam behind a door has changed to a modern electronic lock that uses a plastic card. But people still want to keep out the ""bad guys."" The idea of a lock and key is partly about feeling safe. Some companies have tried using computer locks with smart cards, but many people do not like them. You might accept them at work, but at home, everyone wants to turn a real key in a lock. Because of this, when a locksmith company made a new electronic lock, they included a real metal key.
**Modern Art**  
I was nervous about visiting the new Tate Modern gallery because, like many people, I do not understand modern art. I know I like some of it, especially furry things, neon light sculptures, and big photographs. Maybe if I learned more about it, I would have more opinions. But art is not just about understanding; it is about feeling something. This is a nice idea, but it has not worked for me before. However, this new gallery tries to help visitors understand the art better. The first thing I noticed was the labels that explain the art and what it means. Instead of just looking at the pictures without understanding, these labels helped me learn more."
CPE_46,C2,"**Every Picture Tells a Story**
**Adapting Novels for Film**  
Turning a novel into a film often means cutting down the story. This can be frustrating for the writer, but it can also be helpful. While writing a script, I noticed that I could remove a lot of dialogue and descriptions from the book and still keep the main ideas. This does not mean that the original words were not important. It is about how each medium (book or film) asks the audience to pay attention in different ways. In a book, some details are repeated to help readers remember characters and their traits. For example, we might see ""he said"" often, which helps us understand who is speaking. In plays, the dialogue often mimics real conversations, but sometimes it can be too much, making it hard to understand the main message.
**Watching Movies**  
When we watch movies, we can feel like we are part of the story. It takes us away from our everyday lives, at least for the time the film lasts. However, when the movie ends and the lights come on, we return to reality. Many people do not think about the time spent watching a film, and some older generations did not see movies as art, but just entertainment. They enjoyed watching films but did not respect them as a serious art form.
**The Film Studios**  
The Leiper Film Company studios were made up of many different buildings. It was confusing to find your way around because there were many small rooms that looked the same. There were three main entrances, but none of them helped visitors find their way easily. Most people who worked there knew how to get around, and they created stories of romance and adventure that entertained audiences for hours.
**Film-Makers**  
Many people want to make movies. Bookstores have many guides on how to write scripts and produce films. Universities offer courses, and there are competitions for aspiring filmmakers. For example, Robert Rodriguez made his film *El Mariachi* for only $7,000, which helped him become a well-known director. He wrote about how he felt pressure to succeed before he turned 26, just like famous directors Orson Welles and Steven Spielberg did. In the past, filmmakers had to work for years in different roles before directing their own films. For instance, John Huston was 35 when he made *The Maltese Falcon*. Today, without the support of big studios, new filmmakers often have to find their own way."
CPE_3,C2,"In the past, the council houses were all over the western side of the city. They were rows of small, old houses made of orange brick or white plaster. In summer, the smell from a factory nearby filled the air, and in the mornings, a paperboy often looked disgusted as he walked past the houses. I have forgotten much of my early life, but I remember sitting near an upstairs window and looking at the houses in the distance. I also have memories of my mother ironing towels in a house that I don’t think was ours, and snow falling on a big mansion.
My mother was a small, precise woman who was often angry, and I never understood why. Even as a child, I noticed that she was very lonely, even in a room full of people. She had strict rules about how to behave, which I found hard to understand. For example, we were not allowed to walk into our neighbors' gardens or disturb their flowers. We had to sit quietly at the dining table, listening to the radio shows my mother liked. There were many rules like this.
Over time, I remember other people in our lives. My mother had a few friends: Mrs. Buddery, who loved the Royal Family; Mrs. Winall, who rarely spoke; and Mrs. Laband, who was more lively but not always liked by the others. Looking back, I see that they often talked about their problems, like bad legs and cold weather, and I sometimes felt like I was part of their complaints.
Growing up in West Earlham was not easy. Until I was five, I stayed at home and bothered my parents. I remember long days playing on the rug while my mother sat in a chair, looking unhappy. After I turned five, I went to Avenue Road infants school, which was half a mile away. Some children had mothers who rode bikes, but my mother usually let me walk with other kids.
I remember the summer holidays when I saw a little of the world outside West Earlham. There was an old man next door who told stories about his time at sea, and I once went to a charity event where a kind woman offered lemonade. My mother, however, did not like the charity and thought the people running it just wanted money. She often talked about how untrustworthy people were, especially politicians.
Despite her strictness, my mother cared about my education. Sometimes, she took me to the Norwich Castle Museum on the bus. We would look at paintings together, and she even started to have opinions about them. I remember one time she joked about a painting of a Roman soldier, saying she wouldn’t want to meet him at night. This was a rare moment of humor from her."
CPE_10,C2,"Philadelphia Avenue**
I walked down Philadelphia Avenue on the side with odd numbers. It was getting dark, and the air was humid with a light drizzle that made my walk feel secretive. I knew this side of the street very well; I remembered our neighbors, the Matzes and the Pritchards, and Han Kieffer's grocery store. The houses of my first friends, all girls, were also here. Even though I didn’t know everyone by name, each house was special to me, just like the little channels in the sidewalk that carried rainwater from the roofs to the street. 
As the street went down, the houses seemed to get simpler: the porches were lower, and the front yards were smaller. Over the years, things changed. Wooden porch railings were replaced with iron ones that looked a bit Southern or Spanish. In Shillington, some houses I remembered as homes became stores, and some stores, like Pep Conrad's and Han Kieffer's, became homes again. I wondered how people used those spaces and lived with the smells of the products that used to be sold there.
**Bachelor Fads Furniture Designer Rick Gilbert**
Rick Gilbert lives in a flat that used to be a curtain warehouse. It has the typical features of a loft, like exposed brick and big doors that used to let curtains in from the nearby train tracks. But Rick didn’t want a big empty space. He said it was hard to relax or work when everything was in view. So, he used a large piece of corrugated plastic to create a hallway and hide his office. He wanted the kitchen to be a neutral space where he could cook for friends or make coffee for clients. To make the flat feel warmer, he put light wood on the floors and mixed modern furniture with sentimental pieces from his parents or markets.
**Bruce Chatwin**
Bruce Chatwin was a unique writer known for his adventurous life. His first book, *In Patagonia*, published in 1977, changed travel writing. It was exciting and imaginative, like a thriller or a romantic story. However, Chatwin often mixed facts with fiction. He would change details to make his stories more interesting, suggesting that travel could reveal hidden histories meant to inspire future explorers.
**Swimming**
One summer day in 1996, it rained heavily, and I ran across my lawn to jump into the pool. As I swam, I watched the raindrops create little fountains that burst into bubbles. The best moments were when the rain got stronger, drowning out the birds and creating a mist over the water, as if the pool was rising to meet the sky. During this time, I thought about swimming across Britain, following the rain to the sea. I wanted to escape the frustration of swimming back and forth in the pool, like a tiger in a cage. 
Many places today are marked and labeled, which makes them feel less real. This is why walking, cycling, and swimming can feel rebellious. They help us connect with the wild and old parts of the world by getting away from the usual paths and the official stories. A swimming journey would let me explore the mysterious parts of our world, like dark woods or high mountains."
CPE_67,C2,"**Crying**
Charles Darwin thought that crying did not have a clear purpose in human evolution. However, he was likely wrong. Recently, scientists have shown that crying is important for social connections. Psychiatrist John Bowlby pointed out that crying helps create a bond between a mother and her child. Many people believe that children cry mainly because they feel helpless.
It is harder to understand why adults cry. The sound of crying is not as important as the way it looks. Crying may have helped early human groups build trust and connect with each other. 
People cry for different reasons. We might cry to show sympathy for someone who is suffering. Sometimes, we cry without meaning to, like when we hear beautiful music or moving speeches. We may also cry when watching a sad movie, and interestingly, this happens more often when we are with others than when we are alone. The social role of crying is clear, but research is still ongoing."
CPE_27,C2,"**The Heat is On**
We have all heard about global warming, but how much warmer will the Earth get, and how will it affect our lives? Most people know what global warming means, but not everyone understands its effects. A warmer climate will likely change the weather in many parts of the world. Since the atmosphere is connected to everything on our planet, any changes in the climate will have important effects on plants, animals, water, and soil.
Humans have learned to use natural resources to help us grow food, build cities, and support billions of people. Any changes to these resources are serious. The challenge we face is understanding how the world will change and what is causing these changes. Over the last 100 years, human activities have increased the amount of certain gases in the atmosphere, which are linked to global temperature. These gases are likely affecting the climate, but we do not fully understand how.
We know that the levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have changed together with global temperatures over the past 40,000 years. This suggests that they are related. Evidence shows that our planet has warmed by about 6°C over the last century. Most scientists believe this warming is not just a natural process but is partly caused by human pollution.
Many scientists are researching what will happen because of higher global temperatures. They use computer programs called general circulation models (GCMs) to predict climate conditions. These models use the laws of physics and chemistry to analyze temperature, pressure, sunlight, and other factors. However, these models are not perfect and can be slow and expensive to use. We do not fully understand all the processes in the climate system, but we know it is complex.
Despite these challenges, most people agree that climate change will happen faster than we have seen before. The predictions from GCMs suggest that by the year 2100, the average global temperature will rise by 1°C to 3.5°C, and sea levels will rise by 15 to 95 cm. We can also expect more extreme weather, like heatwaves, floods, and droughts, in some areas. These changes will likely impact the natural environment and human life.
Climate change can affect where ecosystems, like forests and grasslands, are located, the types of species in them, and their ability to provide resources we need. This includes food, water, and places to live. Some effects may be harmful, but not all changes will be bad. In some places, climate change may even have positive effects. For example, in Australia, wheat production has increased because of warmer temperatures, which have led to fewer frosts and less damage to crops.
However, many predicted effects of climate change are concerning. Even small changes in climate can affect water availability, especially in dry areas or places already facing water shortages. The Mediterranean region is one example where rainfall patterns have changed, leading to less water in some seasons.
Another serious effect of climate change is the melting of ice in glaciers and the Arctic. This will impact wildlife and human structures. The most visible effect of global warming will be rising sea levels. Warmer water takes up more space, and melting ice adds to this problem. Since many people live in coastal areas, rising sea levels could lead to severe flooding, especially in cities like London, New York, and Tokyo. Many people could lose their homes, creating millions of environmental refugees.
The worst effects will be felt by small, low-lying island nations, which could disappear if sea levels rise too much. This would be devastating for the people and cultures of these islands, as well as for the countries that would have to take in those who are displaced."
CPE_66,C2,"Mission to Mars**
A middle-aged, married couple is needed for a 501-day trip to Mars. The people who apply must be strong both physically and emotionally. This will be the first group of astronauts to go to Mars if Dennis Tito's plans succeed. He wants to launch a spacecraft on January 5, 2018. 
The spacecraft will take the crew to about 160 kilometers above Mars. It will use Mars' gravity to help it return to Earth without using extra fuel. Saving fuel is very important because the next time Mars and Earth will be in the right position for a launch is not until 2031. 
This is a big challenge, and new technologies need to be developed quickly. If these technologies are ready in time, the spacecraft might be able to go. Even if the mission does not happen, the work done will help future space missions."
CPE_44,C2,"**AESTHETICS**
Sometimes, the existence of art makes it hard to understand art itself. This is because art is something we can see and touch, like a building, a book, a painting, or a statue. People often think of art only as these objects, not as what they mean or how they affect us. 
When a piece of art becomes very famous, it can be hard to see it in a new way. People may forget the human experiences that created the art and the feelings it brings to life. When art is seen as separate from everyday life, it becomes difficult to understand its true meaning. Art is then treated as something special and different from other human activities.
A key job for anyone writing about art is to connect these beautiful works with everyday experiences. Just like mountains are part of the earth, art is part of our daily lives. Those who study the earth, like geographers and geologists, show how it works. Similarly, those who study art must also show how it connects to our lives.
To understand art better, we sometimes need to forget about the art itself and focus on ordinary experiences that we usually don’t think of as art. We can enjoy flowers without knowing much about plants, but to understand how they grow, we need to learn about soil, air, water, and sunlight. 
To truly appreciate art, we should start with simple experiences that catch our attention and make us feel good. Many people enjoy things like movies, jazz music, and comic strips, but they don’t always see these as art. When people think of art as only what is found in museums, they miss out on the joy of everyday experiences. 
Often, people who dislike the idea of art being only in museums still believe in this idea. The common view separates art from everyday life, but when art is connected to our daily activities, we appreciate it more."
CPE_22,C2,"**Observing Lions**
Many people think that lions hunting for food is a beautiful sight. In the evening, a group of lions quietly comes out of the shadows and surrounds their prey. They seem to work well together, showing that they are social animals. However, after studying lions in the wild for many years, we have a different view. When we began our research in 1978, we wanted to understand why lions hunt together, raise their young, and scare off other animals with their loud roars. 
If we measure an animal's success by how many babies it raises, then working together does not always help. If one animal is too generous, it may lose out while others benefit. So, why do lions seem to ignore this rule of nature? We thought we would find the answer in two or three years, but lions are very good at doing nothing. It has taken us many different research methods to learn about their behavior. Since wild lions can live up to 18 years, we are only now starting to understand their actions.
**Pop Music Review**
The release of Bedrock's third album was an important moment for the band. ""New Life"" changed rock music in this country for many years. It moved away from the serious and dull music of the past and introduced a lighter mix of sounds. The album combined social observations with humor and included sounds from fairground organs and brass bands. 
Bedrock showed that they were skilled at collecting different styles and writing songs. They wrote about traditional English themes like sunbathing and Sunday afternoons. However, the best songs on the album, like ""So Low"" and ""To the Brink,"" had deeper feelings. ""New Life"" is special because it has 16 high-quality tracks with no bad songs, which is rare for long CDs.
**Extract from an Autobiography**
As a child, I was always interested in stories about 'The Sibyl,' wise women from ancient times. I first learned about one from a story my mother told me. An old woman from Cumae offered King Tarquin of Rome nine books for 300 gold pieces. When he refused, she burned three books and offered him six for the same price. He still refused, so she burned three more. In the end, he bought the last three for 300 gold pieces. I understood that there was an important lesson in this story about sales and life.
I was often lonely as an only child. I would ask to play with other kids, but they would say no. My mother advised me to do something interesting so that the other children would want to join me. It worked, and I have never forgotten that lesson. 
When I had the chance to write a travel book, I looked for a topic that mattered to me. I am not a big traveler, and I sent my editor a long list of places I did not want to visit. I prefer to explore ruins because I enjoy traveling through time in my mind.
**What Happens to Your Manuscript?**
When you send your manuscript to a publisher, it will likely join a pile of other manuscripts waiting to be read. This pile is called the ""slush pile."" Usually, a junior member of the editorial team or an experienced freelancer will look at it. They do not have much power, but they want to find something new and interesting. 
If they think your novel is good, they will pass it to a senior editor. This editor will have to explain why they should accept your novel based on its quality and potential sales. They will also consider if you, as an author, seem like a good long-term choice. It is important for publishers to know how marketable you are, as they want to promote new novels effectively. Because of this, publishers often like to meet potential authors before making an offer."
CPE_39,C2,"Advertising on Trial**
If you work in an advertising agency, the early 1990s were very tough. The economy was in a recession, which was worse than expected. This affected many countries, including Britain. In 1991, the economy shrank, interest rates were very high, and many people lost their jobs. Over half a million people were unemployed, and many homes were taken back by banks. All businesses suffered, especially the vehicle and building industries, which saw a 30% drop in work.
People in advertising were not the only ones losing their jobs, but those who kept their jobs felt a lot of pressure. They were expected to help their companies make money, and they felt their work was being closely watched. At the same time, they had to do more work with smaller budgets. They were told that they needed to do more with less money.
Despite these challenges, marketing became more important. Companies started to focus on what customers wanted instead of just what was easy for them to provide. In the last ten to fifteen years, many companies began to take marketing seriously. This change helped marketing professionals gain more respect, but it also made their jobs harder.
About half of marketing budgets go to advertising, so advertising people felt the pressure. The 1980s were good for advertising, but the early 1990s were the worst for the industry in a long time. The bad economy made companies cut their advertising budgets and question the value of advertising. They wanted to know what they were getting for their money and if advertising was worth it.
Companies wanted better strategies, better targeting, better creativity, and better media placement. They wanted the best people from advertising agencies to work for them and to be motivated to create great ads. While this situation is tough for advertising professionals, it also means they face the same problems as their clients: how to do more with less.
Several factors made creating effective advertising difficult. The recession caused problems with production costs and made companies less willing to take risks, which are often necessary for good advertising. Other changes, like shifts in population, the power of retailers, changing consumer needs, and new legal restrictions on advertising, also made things harder. Some companies even had to start advertising in other countries.
Because of the economic situation and these changes, advertising professionals had to think about the saying: ""Only half of my advertising works. The trouble is, I don’t know which half."" Now, there is more pressure than ever to make sure that advertising is effective.
Unfortunately, help for those who want to improve their advertising is not easy to find. Companies and advertising agencies are too busy dealing with these challenges to share their experiences. Those who have managed to succeed often keep their successful strategies to themselves. While some conferences and seminars can provide useful information, many books on advertising do not help much. They often suggest that all advertising work is of high quality, which is not true and does not help the employees who are responsible for the advertising."
CPE_18,C2,"**The Lure of the Kitchen**
When I was in university, I decided I wanted to be a chef. This was not a common choice among my friends. Most people wanted different jobs. Cooking seemed like a hard and unattractive job. Chefs work long hours, face a lot of pressure, do simple tasks, and do not earn much money. However, these reasons did not stop me. I was not happy at university. The work was difficult, and the social life felt closed and self-important. Being a chef seemed like a good escape from the serious atmosphere of college. It promised a sense of purpose that I was missing in my student life.
My wish to cook was not just because I was unhappy. It also came from my love for beautiful food. I first felt this when I had a meal at a famous restaurant in London. It was amazing. I remember my starter very well. After that meal, I wanted to learn everything about cooking. I changed my student life to prepare for becoming a chef. My history degree felt unimportant, and I focused on cooking instead. I learned by reading cookbooks, visiting markets, and cooking special meals.
**Extract from a Novel**
The swimming instructor at my school was a tough man, small and strong, with tattoos on his arms. When I asked him to teach me how to dive, he told me to sit on the edge of the pool, put my hands above my head, and roll forward, pushing off with my feet. I practiced this until my time was up. The next time, he had me stand up and dive off the edge. He was strict, and every time I came up from the water, he looked at me with disapproval: ""Don't look down, look up!"" ""Keep your legs straight."" ""Point your toes!"" 
The following week, I went up to the high diving board. It felt very high as I stood there, trying to gather my courage. Slowly, the noise around me faded, and I felt like I was in a quiet bubble. I moved my arms like I had been taught, tried to look up, and jumped into the air. For a moment, I felt like I was flying. When I hit the water, I fell awkwardly, and my legs were everywhere. The instructor looked at me with disappointment and shook his head. But even he could not take away my happiness. I thought, ""This is what they mean by 'free as a bird.'""
**The Traveller**
For people who value a comfortable bed, running water, and safety, the idea of a traveller can seem strange and fascinating. These are people who choose to take risks, like climbing dangerous mountains or sailing alone on rough seas. They might eat insects if there is nothing else to eat and can live for months in uncertain conditions. It is easy to see them as unusual or eccentric, like hermits or extreme sports enthusiasts. While they exist, their world is very different from ours, and we often think it is not important. We can feel relieved to return to our lives with microwaves and phones, happy that our risks are more predictable, like crossing a busy street.
**SAILING**
Jonathan Raban is afraid of the sea, which is probably why he spends so much time on it. He does not say he is a top sailor, but he is skilled. He sails because, as a writer, he enjoys writing about his sailing experiences. Sailing gives him stories to tell. Raban's small boat has a device that tells sailors their exact location anywhere in the world. While he likes this tool, he also believes that using a compass was a mistake. He thinks it changed how people relate to the sea. Since the compass was invented, sailors do not pay as much attention to the waves and the ocean. The sea, which used to be full of life, is now just a space to cross. Because of this, a sailor can let an autopilot steer the boat for long periods, which is why Raban has time to observe the waves closely."
CPE_62,C2,"**Holiday Reading**
Summer gives us two great joys: escaping home and reading books. These joys are closely connected. Books can help us feel more at home in the world. We can relate our own experiences to those in great books written long ago or in faraway places. In the stories of others, we find our own thoughts and feelings. Authors can express what we feel but in a clearer way. What we feel shy or confused about is clearly written in their words. This connection is even stronger when the author is from a different time or place. We feel thankful to these writers for reminding us of who we are.
Through reading and traveling, we can break free from our daily routines. Our eyes are most open during the first few days in a new place, just like when we read a great book. A good book can show us things we might have ignored before. Our minds become more aware of the details around us, like the colors of the sky, the expressions on people's faces, or feelings we didn’t know we had.
**Author's Note**
These travel thoughts were published as articles in the Observer newspaper over seven years. I have made some small changes to fit the articles better, but not much else. I corrected a few mistakes, but only small details. If I were to rewrite some parts, I would have to change the meaning, and that would not be true to the moment I was writing about. Like any traveler, I was there, not knowing what would happen next, just trying to understand what had already happened. This is the story of modern travel: the world opening up to people who can afford a ticket. But I believe that my fellow travelers were not completely unaware. Even a simple postcard can have a purpose.
**Ecotourism**
If there were awards for tourism phrases that have been misused, ""ecotourism"" would win first prize. This term started in the early 1980s when people became more aware of the environment. Tour operators realized that many travelers wanted to make sure their trips would not harm the places they visited. The term quickly became popular. Now, ""ecotourism"" can mean anything from living with remote tribes for two weeks to a one-hour boat trip in Australia. Any tour that includes cultural experiences, beautiful nature, wildlife, or a bit of adventure is likely to be called ecotourism. While the original idea was good, the lack of rules and clear definitions has confused many travelers.
**Transylvanian Journey**
I lost my notebook about my journey in Transylvania for 50 years, but I found it again a few years ago. It has helped me remember that time, but it was not always perfect. In Transylvania, I had a much easier time than I expected, staying in friendly country houses for weeks. When I stayed in one place for a long time, I stopped writing because I thought there was nothing to record. I was slow to start writing again when I moved on, and sometimes I only wrote short notes instead of full stories. I worried that some details might be out of order when I started writing this book, so I added many warnings. But then I realized that this book is not a guidebook, so it didn’t matter much. I let the story tell itself without too many worries."
CPE_49,C2,"Fashion and Writing**
**Fashion**  
Fashion is often thought of as something new, mostly created by capitalism in the 19th and 20th centuries. However, many historians say that fashion, especially in terms of style and design, has a long history. They often start their studies in the 16th and 17th centuries when trade and markets began to grow. As societies became more complex and populations grew, new technologies were developed to make different types of clothing and accessories. Because of this, the meanings of what we wear have also become more complex. For example, a man's suit might seem very similar everywhere, but it can mean different things in different situations and to different people.
**Writing**  
Stories in newspapers about famous authors getting big book deals can give a wrong idea about what life is like for most writers. For many of us who are not best-sellers, there are two main ways to earn a living. The smartest writers work full-time jobs and write in the evenings. Others, like me, do different jobs, such as teaching and writing articles. I have heard about a writing job at a chocolate factory, but I have never found anything like that. Still, by balancing part-time jobs and using credit cards, and often thanks to the help of friends mentioned in the Acknowledgements, I manage to write my novel.
**Sudden Fame**  
When we started performing at small venues around the country, they began to sell out, and we needed extra security to manage the crowds of excited fans. We had to use secret entrances to avoid being overwhelmed by our followers. On the few nights we were not working, it was hard to go out without being chased by fans. In just a few days, we became celebrities. Our fans watched our every move, and our management took care of everything we needed. Even though I was still shy, I felt a strange confidence that many shy people can understand when they suddenly become famous. In short, I felt completely out of my comfort zone."
CPE_31,C2,"**Music - The Challenge Ahead**
Technology is changing our lives at work, home, and during our free time. Susan Hallam talks about how this affects music in Britain. In the late 20th century, there were many new ways to listen to music, like radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, and videos. However, there has been a decrease in live music performances and full-time jobs for musicians.
It is clear that more people will have access to music, which meets many human needs. Music is important for national events and for personal activities. A society without music is hard to imagine. The question is not if there will be music in the 21st century, but what kind of music it will be and if people will still want to learn to play instruments.
I believe that people will continue to want to learn instruments. The music industry is a big part of the economy in Britain, and musical skills will be important for many jobs, especially in media. Also, there is evidence that playing an instrument can help develop skills early in life. Research in the USA shows that listening to or making music can improve spatial reasoning, which is a part of intelligence. While these results need more study, other research in Europe suggests that group music lessons can help improve social skills and concentration in children, especially those with behavior problems.
Current research is looking into how playing an instrument can help develop useful skills. For example, regular practice can help with good study habits and focus, while playing in concerts can teach punctuality and organization. Because of this, there will likely be a continued need for music lessons in the near future.
What about the future? Will there be changes, and what will they be? I think there are two likely possibilities. First, the types of music people listen to will become more varied, with new styles mixing together. Second, technology will be used more to create and perform music. This will make it easier for people to compose music without needing a lot of technical skills, but it may also reduce the need for live performances.
At the same time, more people of all ages will want to make music together. These activities will likely be based in communities and reflect their musical traditions. If we want this future to happen, the music profession needs to prepare. Music lessons will need to change to help more people learn different instruments throughout their lives. This will require changes in the music curriculum and how progress is measured.
Musicians will need training to inspire and teach learners of all ages, work with diverse groups, and develop skills for community work. This is a big change from traditional methods and will require accountability. However, this is a chance for music education to show the high quality of music teaching available.
Finally, we need to raise awareness of the importance of music in our lives. Music is essential, but it is often taken for granted. Everyone in the music profession needs to work together to make sure this changes."
CPE_58,C2,"**The Actor's Craft**
Sometimes, people make fun of actors. This often happens when actors talk about their work in interviews. Instead of sharing their true feelings, they often use boring phrases or gossip. The actor Paul Scofield once wrote to a friend that an actor's work is only interesting when they perform. Talking about it makes it feel less real. Each time an actor performs, they start fresh, learning about their character and the story. After a play ends, they feel empty until they perform again. This emptiness is clear when people talk about acting.
**A Review of Hamlet**
Adrian Lester plays Hamlet in a way that shows he is between being a boy and a man. His performance is simple but strong. He controls his body and emotions well, showing both anger and humor. This makes his character both scary and lovable. You can see his talent in how he moves. Another actor, Handy, plays Horatio in a way that also shows a strong inner feeling. 
So, what is acting? Is it just copying real behavior, or is it something deeper? This is a big question in theatre.
**One Director's Approach to Rehearsal**
This director has a special way to start rehearsals called ""dropping in."" The stage manager shows the script on a screen. While someone else speaks, the actors listen carefully. When it’s their turn, they look at the screen, think about the words, and find the right moment to speak. For example, if the line is about waiting in the rain, they might remember a time they waited in line. They should not plan too much but trust their feelings and the moment.
**The Perfect Theatre**
The perfect theatre should make you feel important. Going to see a live performance is special, and the staff should feel this too. It’s not nice if the workers seem bored. The theatre should connect the actors and the audience. People in the audience should be able to see and hear everything clearly. The size of the theatre is important; it should fit the human voice and body. If the theatre is too big, it feels wrong because drama is about people. Many theatres built in the late 1800s got this right because they created a cozy space for the stage. 
I like theatres that feel old and have a history, like churches with worn steps. When you go to the theatre, you want to see something surprising and new. If not, you might as well stay home."
CPE_37,C2,"Paul Simon and Rock and Roll**
In the 1950s, rock and roll was mainly popular with young people, but it also had a big effect on older people and the middle class. This music influenced the next generation of rock stars, who listened to it and knew it would be important in their lives. For Paul Simon and other young people in the US, the best way to hear this exciting new music was through Alan Freed's radio show called Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party. Many young musicians listened to this show. For example, John Lennon, who lived in Liverpool, listened to Radio Luxembourg, the only station in Europe playing rock and roll. Paul Simon was also very interested in the music from Freed's show and wanted to move from just listening to making his own music.
**Snow**
I could not see a clear path, but I thought I would be okay if I was careful. The wind was strong and pushed me over as I tried to walk on the slippery ice. Suddenly, the snow that looked safe gave way, and I fell into a hole about four feet deep. The snow had covered a gap between two rocks, and I fell through the thin layer on top. I climbed out, feeling shaken and worried about what would have happened if the hole had been much deeper. I sat against a pine tree that was sticking out of the snow to think about what to do next. After an hour, I had only gone about half a mile. It was clear that I had to change my plans.
**Qualitative Research**
There are many books that help researchers understand qualitative research. While there is a lot of information about collecting data, these books often do not explain how to analyze the data. Many people find it confusing to understand how researchers analyze their data. To help with this, we asked different social scientists who have worked on qualitative projects to talk about their methods. The goal was to share their experiences and understanding of analyzing qualitative data, not to create a guidebook for new researchers. This task is not easy, so we allowed our contributors to present their work in different styles, including personal stories and more formal writing."
CPE_2,C2,"Screen Learning**
A few days ago, I saw my six-year-old son eating noodles in a funny way. He was pulling them up with his teeth and pretending to be a dinosaur. ""I'm a little dinosaur,"" he said. He was acting out a scene from a TV show. I asked him what he remembered about dinosaurs, but he didn’t know much.
Many people are excited about learning through the internet and computers, but is this a good way to learn? One writer shared his experience with an interactive program he tried with his son. The father read the words while the son played with the pictures. The father thought that if his son had spent ten minutes reading a book, he might have learned something.
Research shows that learning happens best when there is conversation with teachers or parents. It is important to have guidance. Using new technology to teach our children is good, but traditional education is still very important.
**Hollywood**
By 1918, most of the world’s film-making had moved to Hollywood. The local people did not like this change and thought their neighborhood was being taken over by new people. However, in the end, they accepted it because success is important in America. Success is measured by how much money a film makes.
Hollywood has changed a lot in less than a hundred years. It went from a small village to a famous town, like New York, Rome, or Paris. A hundred years ago, you would walk through orange groves to get to the village store. But in some ways, it is still a small village, with a focus on films. People talk about how much money films make, who is dating whom, and who is working on which project. Many successful people try to leave Hollywood to live somewhere else, but it is still the main place for anyone in show business.
**Photography**
Photography was created by artists in the 1800s as a way to capture images. They wanted to make a lasting record of what they saw. The new technology of light, lenses, and chemicals made pictures that were more real and detailed than paintings. This surprised other artists. Some art critics said photography could not be considered art because it relied on machines and did not show human creativity.
Despite the critics, photographers believed they had created a new art form. They used photography to show their view of the world, just like other artists used brushes and pencils.
**Book Illustration**
In the past, every children's book needed illustrations. This also included many novels for older children, but fewer books were printed over time. There was still a lot of activity in children's publishing, but it was often low-budget, which led to some average work. However, the best artists always did their best.
The collection of black-and-white illustrations is a mix of both valuable and less valuable works. It is a great place for research and finding interesting pieces. The best illustrations will be shown to the public again, either through new editions of old books or exhibitions of original artwork. There are signs that this is starting to happen, and soon, a creative publisher will likely produce a series of classic children's book illustrations from this time."
CPE_68,C2,"**Blogging: Sharing with the World**
Some time ago, a website talked about the risks of telling everyone where you are online. The website's message was clear: when you say, ""Hey, I'm here,"" you are also letting many people know your location, including some you might not want to meet. This shows that sharing everything online can have negative effects.
The internet gives us many chances to share our lives with a large audience. We might think this will bring us wealth or fame, but we can also get lost in the chaos of the internet. It can feel overwhelming. However, we should not lose hope. There are lessons to learn from those who came before us.
In the early days of the internet, a group of people, now known as bloggers, explored this new space. They faced many challenges, like losing jobs and friends, long before social media existed. These early bloggers have valuable experiences that we can learn from.
In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started sharing his life online. At that time, the web was mostly used by students and scientists. Hall saw a chance to share his personal stories. He created a blog where he wrote about everything in his life. In January 1996, he began posting daily, and many people became interested in his adventures.
Hall was open about his life, and he wrote about any topic. Some people thought he was just showing off, but his work also had a special quality that many appreciated. However, one day, visitors to his blog found a video called ""Dark Night"" instead of his usual posts. In the video, Hall explained that he had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it, his partner told him to choose between the blog and the relationship. Hall felt that sharing his life online made people not trust him. In the end, he stopped the blog, but the question of sharing online remains.
Sharing online can be fun, but if you think it will make people want to be around you, you might be disappointed. In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a young woman in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job. One day, a coworker sent her blog link to the bosses at her company, including some she had made fun of, and she lost her job.
Experts call this the ""online distribution effect,"" which means people often say things online that they would never say in person. Our online lives are connected to our real lives, and pretending they are separate can lead to big mistakes. 
Armstrong's story had a happy ending. After taking a break from blogging, she got married and started a new blog about her family. Today, she is a well-known ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing helps support her family. She learned an important lesson: the internet lets us say anything, but that doesn’t mean we should."
CPE_23,C2,"Enough Sleep?**
Many people today feel tired all the time. In richer and busier countries, not getting enough sleep and feeling anxious have become common problems. Research in the USA shows that 40 million Americans have serious sleep issues. Some popular novels in Britain even have characters who cannot sleep or are set in sleep research labs. 
One important idea is that ""People need more sleep,"" says a sleep expert. When people are busy, they often sleep less. They wake up early to avoid traffic. A sleep researcher did an experiment where he let people sleep for up to 14 hours a night for a month. After three weeks, they found they needed about eight hours of sleep. This shows that people need to catch up on sleep they missed.
In Europe, a university sleep research lab studies how tiredness affects people. They have looked at how tired sailors are, how airport noise affects sleep, and how tired drivers can be dangerous. They find volunteers by advertising in student newspapers. Volunteers are paid £5 an hour and are asked to change their sleeping habits.
Dr. Louise Reyner helps the volunteers feel comfortable. Some are worried because they wear electrodes on their heads, thinking the researchers can see their dreams. But the lab is more interested in how the body works. In a dark room, there is a driving simulator where volunteers drive while answering questions. They come in the afternoon when they are naturally sleepy, often after not sleeping well.
During the test, the volunteers try to stay awake, but many start to blink and nod off. Dr. Reyner has videos showing how they struggle to stay awake. After a while, they may even drive off the road. She suggests that drinking coffee can help. Two cups can make someone a safer driver for a while. She also recommends energy drinks and other products to help people stay alert.
Scientists know that humans sleep in cycles, like other mammals. When we sleep, we go through four stages, from light sleep to deep sleep. Dreams usually happen during light sleep, and the brain keeps the body still to prevent injuries. Scientists believe sleep helps repair the body and rest the brain, but they are not completely sure how it works.
It is known that women sleep about half an hour longer than men, and older people need less sleep, but the reasons are unclear. Some researchers say sleep helps us travel through time safely. 
In the past, people had different sleep patterns. A history professor studied British sleep habits from 1500 to 1850 and found that people went to bed early, woke up after midnight, stayed awake for a while, and then went back to sleep. This time was used for thinking, remembering dreams, or even stealing. Poor people benefited the most from this quiet time.
By the 17th century, with more artificial light, rich people started to sleep in a more efficient way. The industrial revolution made people work longer hours in lighted buildings. However, in some non-western cultures, people still have flexible sleep patterns. They may sleep for a few hours, wake up, and then sleep again. In some tribal societies, noises and the need to watch for danger make it hard to sleep continuously. It seems that people everywhere need more sleep."
CPE_60,C2,"""We are talking about big cowboy boots. I stood in my expensive designer cowboy boots on the rocks in the Arizona desert. Money was not a problem. I wore a full cowboy outfit, and if you had the outfit, you might look like a cowboy. But I was not a cowboy. I looked into the morning sun at the Arizona mountains and realized I did not belong there. I flew in from Denver early in the morning, thinking I might look like a cowboy coming from the sky. But that feeling went away when I saw a real cowboy at the Phoenix airport. He was wearing a dirty shirt and carrying a bag. When he saw my new cowboy boots, he raised an eyebrow and left without saying anything.
I thought there should be clothes for someone like me, an ex-racing driver, that would make me feel comfortable. I loved being a racing driver and driving fast cars. But I don’t do that anymore. I wondered what I should do now. A racing driver should have other jobs ready for when he stops racing. I thought I had some ideas, but they didn’t work out. 
One idea was to be a commentator at races, but there were many former drivers who wanted that job. Another idea was to sell classic cars, but that didn’t work either because nobody was buying them. So, I decided to step back before I lost everything. 
Being an 'ex' anything can be sad. Who wants to hear about how I almost became the World Champion? Nobody wants to hear a story that ends with 'almost.' Even if I had been the champion, people would only listen for a short time before getting bored. Last year’s champion is last year. I don’t want sympathy, and I don’t get any. I had a good career, made money, and saved some. But I miss the excitement of racing, the powerful cars, and the thrill of going very fast. 
I miss the bright people and reporters who cared about what I said. Being somewhat famous had its perks. Businessmen and politicians liked to say they knew me. Kids would sneak under fences to get my autograph. Now that I don’t race anymore, I have a lot of free time. Just last week, my phone rang twice. I have time in the morning and afternoon, and tomorrow looks free too. 
I looked up at the blue sky. There were no buzzards flying above. Maybe Arizona doesn’t have buzzards. But I saw some little brown birds in a cactus nearby, and they seemed to be telling me to leave their nest alone. I never thought the desert had songbirds. I realized that a fake cowboy in fancy boots still has a lot to learn."""
CPE_1,C2,"Vancouver**
In the last ten years, many people from around the world have moved to Vancouver, in western Canada. In the evenings, residents walk around the city, and if you join them, you will likely hear different languages being spoken. People come to Vancouver for its mild weather, beautiful location between the ocean and mountains, clean and safe environment, and good education and job opportunities. Although some people complain about how quickly new buildings are being built, it is clear that new residents and tourism have helped the city grow. 
Vancouver was once called 'Terminal City' because it was a gateway to other places. Although this name is not used as much now, Vancouver is still a gateway to many destinations.
**Putting Pen to Paper**
Journalists like me are often not good at writing letters. Some say this is because we do not like to write for free, but I think it is more about how we try to make our writing perfect for our jobs. A true artist, who writes without thinking too much about the effect, does not have this problem. I believe that understanding the impact of words is what makes someone a real artist. For example, when Shakespeare wrote his famous lines, he probably did not think about how the sound of the words made them powerful.
**Supermarket Opening**
Opening a new supermarket used to be a big event in Britain. A celebrity, like a soap star or a member of the royal family, would usually come to cut the ribbon. Now, new supermarkets are opening all the time, so there is no need for a famous person. Last week, people waiting to enter the new Superbuy store did not care who opened it, as long as they were at the front of the line. According to someone who worked there, the first five men to enter would get a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women would receive a bunch of flowers. This news spread quickly among the crowd, making those at the front feel proud and those who arrived late feel jealous."
CPE_53,C2,"**Citizen Kane**
When the film *Citizen Kane* was released in 1941, there was a lot of excitement around it. However, it did not do well at the box office. It was only when it was shown on television that people started to remember it. This film has inspired many people to become filmmakers. This is surprising because it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles believed that its success came from the fact that he did not know the rules of filmmaking; he just made the film the way he wanted. He had a great team, including cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and special-effects expert Linwood Dunn. When Welles and Mankiewicz decided to create a story about a newspaper owner who was similar to William Randolph Hearst, Welles realized he had found a great opportunity for himself as both director and actor, and he worked very hard on it.
**Dermot and Carmel**
That morning, Dermot thought Carmel was acting a bit strange. He had mentioned twice that he might be late and that he might stop at the golf club on his way home. He wanted to talk to someone, and he thought that was the best place to do it. Carmel had nodded her head as if she did not really hear him. ""Will you be okay? What are you going to do today?"" he asked. She smiled and said, ""It's funny you ask. I was just thinking that I have nothing to do today, so I will walk downtown and look at the shops. I feel like it would be a waste to just relax all day."" Dermot smiled back and said, ""You deserve to enjoy yourself. And if I am late, I won’t need anything to eat, so don’t worry about it."" ""That's fine,"" she replied.
**Title Race**
""Tea boy? Do you mind? I am a mobile lukewarm beverage resource facilitator."" 
A recent study showed that job titles can cause jealousy and problems at work. A survey by a well-known recruitment company found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees believe that job titles create divisions among coworkers. Surprisingly, 70% of office workers said they would give up a pay raise for a better job title that sounds more motivating or professional. This shows that people care a lot about how they are labeled at work. In the early twenty-first century, no one wants to be called ""subordinate."" The job titles being discussed focus on skills (like specialist or coordinator), but they are really just fancy words."
CPE_55,C2,"**The Vienna Assignment**
I was in Vienna to take photographs. This was usually why I traveled. Taking photos was not just my job; it was my passion. I loved how light fell on different surfaces and how one picture could capture a moment in time, a city, or a person. I always hoped to take the perfect photograph. As long as I had film in my camera, I could keep trying. My rule was simple: finish one roll of film, load another, and keep looking for new pictures.
Once, I took a photo of a smoke plume from a burning oil well, and it became very popular. Many newspapers and magazines wanted it. It was a brief moment of success, mostly due to luck. They say you create your own luck, both good and bad. After that, I decided to work freelance. I thought it was a smart choice, but life had other plans. The mid-nineties were not as successful as I had hoped, even after my photo was on the cover of Time magazine. That’s why I found myself in Vienna instead of a more exciting place. But I was still taking photographs, and I was getting paid for it, which was good enough for me.
My assignment in Vienna happened by chance. I had taken photos for a book called ""Four Cities in Four Seasons,"" which included London, Paris, Rome, and Vienna. I had received a good payment for my work in London, capturing the beauty of the city in different seasons. I knew that some of my best photos would not be used because it was just a picture book, not something that would change people’s views.
After I submitted my winter photos of London, I learned that the Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, had left the job in Vienna for reasons I didn’t know. Instead of hiring someone new, they asked me to take his place. The Austrian publishers liked my work, and I was available, while other photographers were not. I was happy to go because things were not good at home. A week in snowy Vienna sounded perfect.
They put me up at the Europa hotel in the old city. I had visited Vienna before with my wife, but it was a busy and hot trip, and I didn’t take many photos. This time, alone in the cold January, I felt it would be different. As soon as I arrived and saw the beautiful light over the snowy roofs, I knew I would enjoy my time there and take great pictures.
On my first day, I didn’t take any photos. Instead, I rode the trams around the Ringstrasse, getting on and off to feel the city’s atmosphere. The weather was cold and still, just like the grand buildings from the old empire. I didn’t want to see what Schussner had done in the other seasons. This was going to be my Vienna, and I wanted to experience it for myself.
A photograph captures a moment, but you have to wait for the right moment. So, I took my time to look around until I was ready. The next morning, I woke up early. The snow from the night before made Stephansplatz look beautiful and almost empty. I struggled to find a way to capture the cathedral in one photo. Its tall spire reached into the sky, but at ground level, it was huge and heavy. I realized I might have to take a partial photo instead. In that weather and at that time, it could still be magical.
Photography has always had a sense of magic. Even in the past, when people didn’t fully understand how it worked, they felt its mystery. You can watch a blank piece of paper turn into a photograph in a dark room. Even when you know the science behind it, the magic remains. Maybe that’s why what happened at Stephansplatz that morning didn’t surprise me in the way I expected."
CPE_50,C2,"Kinetic Art**
Kinetic Art is a type of art that focuses on movement. A new exhibition at the Hayward Gallery in London shows the history of kinetic art over the last 60 years. This exhibition is special because it does not use a lot of text to explain the artworks. Instead, visitors can enjoy the art and make their own discoveries.
One famous artist featured in the exhibition is David Hockney. Many people like Hockney's work because it is easy to understand and often shows everyday life. Some people think he is popular for the wrong reasons, but others believe his art has a serious purpose. Hockney himself knows that he is not a ""great"" artist, and he believes that only time will tell how important his work really is.
In recent years, there have been many contemporary art exhibitions. Some are very good, while others are not. Sometimes, exhibitions try to show a common idea among different artists, but this can feel forced. To challenge this, a curator created an exhibition called ""Window-shopping"" with seven artists. This exhibition showed different artworks that were connected only by the fact that they were all art. For example, one artist made knitted cats that chased each other on a toy train track, while another artist broke a video camera on purpose. These artworks were different, but they worked well together.
People who enjoy art sometimes worry that analyzing it will ruin their experience. Some art historians focus too much on theory and forget the joy of simply looking at art. Understanding art can actually make the experience more enjoyable. Our feelings about art are influenced by the society we live in, not just by our personal tastes. While it is important to enjoy art, thinking about it can also add to our appreciation."
CPE_25,C2,"**Metals**  
A long time ago, people in the Stone Age became interested in metals, possibly because they wanted to decorate themselves. While sitting by a river and waiting for fish, one of our early ancestors might have found a shiny yellow stone. This stone felt different from regular stones and was very attractive. This could be how gold became important to these early people. Gold is easy to shape, so it quickly became a popular material. Copper might have also been found by chance. Once people realized that copper could be used to make tools, they began to look for copper ores and ways to extract the metal. This led to the development of metalworking, which helped improve their lives.
**St Ives**  
We walked slowly down a narrow, cobbled street towards the town, struggling with our heavy bags against the strong wind and trying to avoid the cold waves that crashed over the walkway. The streets were empty, and all the windows in the houses by the water were closed tightly against the storm. We had seen the weather get worse as we arrived in St Ives on a small train. With the dark clouds above, visiting Cornwall in the off-season without a car did not seem like a good idea anymore. I had convinced my friend to come with me by promising beautiful walks along the coast and cozy evenings by the fire.
**Computer Modelling**  
Studying the past is difficult because it is already gone. The people who lived in times of peace and times of trouble are no longer here. We cannot know exactly why they settled in certain places or how they lived together as families and communities. Archaeology gives us some clues, but we cannot test our ideas with experiments on past cultures. We cannot go back in time to see what happened. However, computer modelling helps us recreate ancient landscapes and environments. We can create virtual communities that act like real people. We can set rules for them and create social groups. Then, we can change things like the amount of rain or the number of people and see how these virtual communities respond."
CPE_34,C2,"
**Vervet Monkeys**  
Cheney and Seyfarth studied vervet monkeys. One day, the dominant male monkey saw a strange male nearby in another group of trees. The stranger wanted to join the group. If he did, the current male might lose his position. To keep the stranger away, the dominant male made an alarm call that vervet monkeys use when they see a leopard. The stranger quickly went back to his trees. This happened many times throughout the day. However, the dominant male made a mistake. He called out the alarm while walking across the open ground himself. 
**What Cats Catch**  
In a village in England called Felmersham, people collected what their cats caught over one year. Seventy cats caught over 1,000 animals. A professor in America calculated that all the cats in Britain might kill 100 million birds and small animals each year! However, this number is not realistic. Most cats live in towns and catch fewer animals than the cats in this study. The important question is whether these numbers are sustainable. The answer seems to be yes. In winter, many people feed birds, and there are many places for birds to nest. This helps keep the bird population healthy. The study found that cats do hunt birds, but they are not destroying the bird population in Britain.
**Buffalo's Day**  
Buffaloes are very important to the marshmen, and they are cared for with love. Every morning, the buffaloes leave their sleeping places slowly and tiredly to go to the reed beds. They stand at the edge of the platform, groaning about how tired they are, until the leader finally steps forward and goes into the water. Once in the water, they seem to forget their purpose and relax. They move slowly away from the house, swimming low in the water, looking tired. They spend the day among the reeds, eating the green plants they can find.
**Picasso, Pablo**  
In 1940, Picasso painted several pictures of fish while he was in the fishing port of Royan. One painting shows a fishmonger’s table with a crab and some soles. The fish look alive, even though they are in a difficult situation. The painting is not easy to understand because Picasso used a flat pattern with overlapping shapes. The light colors and soft brush strokes make it look calm and peaceful, like being underwater. However, there is a feeling of tension because the fish seem to be ready to fight the crab. The sharp shapes in the painting add to this feeling of danger."
CPE_12,C2,"Photography**
For the last 150 years, photography has been used to capture many parts of human life. In this short time, photography has improved in showing moments in time and space. It allows us to see both big and small things. Photography has given us images from faraway places, different parts of the solar system, and the complex social issues of modern life. It is one of the most important ways to express what it means to be human.
However, the idea of recording events with images is much older. The first pictures were made about 35,000 years ago during the Upper Paleolithic period. We are not sure why early humans made cave paintings. They might have shown real hunting events, been used in religious practices, or just been made to make homes more colorful. But these images are closely connected to human culture.
Throughout history, people have questioned how accurate images are and what they mean in society. The saying ""seeing is believing"" has given special importance to visual images. When photography was invented in the mid-1800s, it seemed to promise a true visual record of reality. The camera worked like the human eye and was thought to create images that looked very similar to what we see. The chemical process used in photography allowed for capturing natural moments.
At the same time, photography was seen as a great achievement of culture. It produced images that artists had worked hard to create. Some believed that because photographs looked real, everyone could easily understand them. For example, in 1933, photographer August Sander said that even the most isolated person could understand a photograph of the sky.
However, as global communication grew in the late 20th century, we must ask how well photographs can cross cultural differences. Is photography limited by cultural rules like language? Has our familiarity with photographs made us overlook the details and skills needed to create them? Photography is often seen as strong evidence, making it seem like there is no difference between what we see in real life and in photographs. It is common for someone to show a photograph and say, ""This is my grandson.""
Since its invention in 1839, photography and how people view it have changed a lot. This change is partly because photography has moved from being just a record-keeper to something that tells history. Photographs now often show more about the people and society that created them than about the subjects in the images.
I want to show that the camera is not just a tool that records events. Photography can also inspire social and political change. For example, it is hard to think about the cultural changes during the Italian Renaissance without recognizing how the development of perspective changed how people represented images. Similarly, photography has played a big role in creating the media culture we have today, while also showing the harsh realities of the world."
CPE_26,C2,"**How to Write Poetry**
Writing poetry can be tricky. It is important to be creative, but making mistakes can lead to problems. Instead of pretending to know everything, I believe that if you are just starting to write, the best advice is to read a lot, write often, and let your imagination flow. Some people need a stable life to write poems, while others can write even when they are sad. Some writers follow a schedule, while others wait for inspiration. All these ways are valid, as long as you are not just copying someone else’s style. 
Finding your own voice is important. You should listen to your inner thoughts and let them grow. With time, your voice will become strong enough to stand on its own.
**The Short Story**
In a short story, it is important not to have too many characters or long descriptions. Flashbacks should be brief and only used when necessary to explain something. A memory from the main character can help move the story forward, but it should not slow down the action. 
Dialogue is very useful in short stories. When two characters talk, they can show different sides of a situation quickly, which keeps the reader interested. Writing too much can ruin a short story, but being brief does not mean you should just summarize the story. 
Conflict and action are important in short stories, just like in novels. However, in a short story, every word must count.
**Screenplays**
Writing a screenplay for a film is similar to playing chess. Chess players often make moves without knowing what will happen next. At first, we might only see a few moves ahead, but as we learn more, we start to understand the game better. We begin to see the overall strategy, not just individual moves. 
In both chess and screenplay writing, the more you practice, the more you understand the details and patterns.
**Looking at Writing**
Humans naturally want to speak, as we see in young children. However, writing is not something we are born knowing how to do. Charles Darwin said that language is a natural instinct, but writing is not. All children learn to speak without lessons, but writing systems were created only in a few advanced societies. 
In the past, many children did not learn to read or write, and even today, some struggle with it. Children are good at learning to speak, but learning to write takes time and effort. We need to understand how writing works and how to help children learn it."
CPE_8,C2,"""I have never started a novel with so much doubt. If I call it a novel, it is only because I don’t know what else to call it. I don’t have a big story to tell, and I don’t end with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave my reader wondering. This book is about my memories of a man I met only a few times, and I don’t know much about what happened to him in between. I could make up stories to fill in the gaps and make it more interesting, but I don’t want to do that. I just want to write what I know. To protect the people who are still alive, I have given the characters names that I made up, and I have tried to make sure that no one can recognize them. The man I am writing about is not famous. He may never be famous. When his life ends, he might leave no more trace than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the water. If my book is read, it will be for its own interest. But maybe the way he lives and his strong and kind character will influence others, and long after he is gone, people may realize that he was a remarkable person. Then it will be clear who I am writing about, and those who want to know a little about his early life may find something useful in my book. I think my book will be a helpful source of information for people who want to write about my friend. I do not say that the conversations I wrote down are exact. I never took notes of what was said, but I remember well what matters to me. Even though I have put these conversations in my own words, I believe they represent what was said. I mentioned earlier that I have not invented anything, but I have taken the same freedom that historians take to create speeches for the characters that I did not hear. I did this to make the scenes more lively and interesting. I want people to read my book, and I think it is okay to do what I can to make it enjoyable. A smart reader will see where I have done this, and they can choose to ignore it. Another reason I feel nervous about this work is that the people I write about are from a different culture. It is hard to really know people, and I think you can only truly know your own countrymen. People are shaped by where they were born, the places they grew up, the games they played, the food they ate, the schools they went to, the sports they liked, and the poets they read. All these things make them who they are, and you can only understand them if you have lived through those experiences. You can only know them if you are one of them. Because you cannot fully understand people from another country except by watching them, it is hard to make them believable in a book. I have never tried to write about anyone but my own countrymen, and if I have done so in short stories, it is because you can describe characters more briefly there. You give the reader some ideas and let them fill in the details. In this book, I do not claim that my characters see themselves as they really are; they are seen through my own eyes."""
CPE_4,C2,"**POETRY RECITALS**
At any time in history, the world of literature can seem confusing to people living in it. However, later on, it is easier to see clear patterns and important writers. Right now, there are many different styles of poetry, many types of poets, and many ways to present and teach poetry. There are also different opinions about what poets should do in society.
In general, the current discussion in poetry is about the disagreement between serious 'literary' poets, who write poems to be read on the page, and 'popular' poets, who prefer to perform their poems for an audience. This division is not strict. Over the last twenty years, public poetry readings have become more common in many forms. Small literary groups in towns hold readings in village halls or members' homes. Schools and colleges invite poets to read and talk to students. Arts festivals often include poetry readings by famous poets.
These events have many effects, and it is not clear if they help poets. For 'pop' poets, who write poems to be performed live, public readings are beneficial. Their poems are usually simple and can be understood easily in one listening. However, when these poems are read on the page, their weaknesses in thought and creativity can be seen.
On the other hand, poets who are serious about their craft try to create deep and meaningful work. They want to express strong feelings and ideas in a small space and use different rhythms. These poets may not be appreciated by audiences who are hearing their work for the first time. The risk is that they might only read their simplest poems to connect quickly with the audience, which may not represent their best work.
Attending poetry readings cannot replace reading poetry from a book, but it can be enjoyable and helpful. Hearing good poets read their work, even if they are not great speakers, can show the audience how to understand the poems better. It is best if the audience has the text in front of them or knows the poems beforehand.
The main reason for popular poetry readings, which sometimes include music, is to help audiences enjoy poetry and see it as an art form for everyone, not just a few special people."
CPE_30,C2,"**Oral History**  
Historians often use oral evidence, which means they listen to people's stories about the past. However, this can be tricky. It is not always true that what someone says is a clear and true memory of their experiences. When a historian interviews someone, both the historian and the person being interviewed influence each other. The historian chooses who to talk to and what to ask about. Even if the historian just listens, their presence can change how the person remembers and talks about their past. The final story is shaped by the historian's background and how they understand history. This means historians have a role in creating new evidence. 
But there are more challenges. The person sharing their memories is also not completely connected to the past. Their memories can be mixed with information from other places, like the media. They might remember the past with feelings of nostalgia, thinking that ""things were better back then,"" or they might feel upset about their childhood. These feelings can make their stories seem more convincing, but they might not reflect the true past.
**Animal Science**  
There are two main ways to study animal science: the physiological approach and the whole animal approach. Physiologists focus on how the body works, like how nerves and muscles work together to create behavior. Those who study the whole animal look at the animal's behavior and what affects it. Within this approach, there are psychologists and ethologists. Psychologists usually work in labs studying a few types of animals, like rats and pigeons. Ethologists study animals in their natural environments and look at their natural behaviors. 
Although these two areas are different, they are starting to work together more. Physiologists often think their methods are the most important. However, even if we understand how every nerve cell works, we still need to study behavior as a whole. Behavior has its own structure that we need to understand. Trying to explain a bird's nest-building by only looking at nerve cells would be like trying to read a book with a very strong microscope.
**The Social Sciences**  
Students studying social sciences for the first time face a challenge. They need to learn both the content of their new subject and the methods used to study it. This means they must understand not only the facts and research in textbooks but also how this knowledge is gathered and organized. These two parts are closely connected. 
Even though we all experience social life every day, social sciences go beyond common sense. Each social science looks at different parts of society, uses specific methods, and has its own important ideas. These ideas form the foundation of the subject and help social scientists understand society better, distinguishing one discipline from another.
**Classical Architecture**  
In Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building structures. The Roman architect Vitruvius said that architecture includes order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, propriety, and distribution. He also provided Greek words for some of these ideas, which likely came from earlier Greek thinkers whose works we no longer have. 
Vitruvius did not include utility and function in his definition, but he later described the best designs for different types of buildings. At first, he focused on the artistic side of architecture. The beginnings of classical architecture are complicated. There was a long history of simple buildings, like huts, in Greece and Italy that did not meet Vitruvius' artistic standards. Even though these early structures were not artistic, they still contributed important elements that influenced later architectural ideas. In essence, a classical temple is a simple, single-roomed hut, even if it looks more complex from the outside."

The two sisters kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for a while. Lily would drive around the gardens and the railway, jumping over a small bridge with all four wheels in the air. This was Lily's only mistake. When Chen found out, he was actually happy about what Lily had been doing. ""So you can really drive, Lily? Well done!"" he said. Mui thought men were strange. Chen should have been upset, but he was excited and made plans with Lily for a trip. They decided to go on a Monday at the start of next month, which was the quietest day. They planned to leave early in the morning and come back by noon so they wouldn’t lose any customers. In the meantime, Lily would practice driving. Mui, even though she was worried, bought a road map. She got a ten percent discount, which impressed Chen, but Lily felt a bit insulted because Mui didn’t trust her to find the way.
After leaving home, they soon saw the English Channel. Lily drove very well. Even Mui, who was in the back seat ready to give directions, had to agree. On the road, Lily passed a couple of slow cars with great skill. Chen even clapped for her. After passing the gasworks and the lagoon with small boats, they drove smoothly along the empty seaside road. Lily parked in a small street with empty spaces. She wasn’t sure about the road signs, so she decided to pay for parking instead of risking a ticket. 
Lily often looked at her sister's worried face in the mirror. She thought it was better not to add to Mui's worries. Lily locked all the van doors and checked them carefully. ""Don't worry,"" Chen joked. ""No one will want that old van."" The sisters were upset. Lily told Chen he was ungrateful, and Mui scolded him for being too quick to judge. Surprised, Chen took Man Kee to see the sea. He held his son close. Man Kee was warm and soft, and he put his tiny hand on Chen's sleeve. At that moment, Chen decided to raise his son his way. He wanted Man Kee to learn about numbers, which Chen was not good at, and to own many restaurants one day.
Looking at the sea made Chen feel thoughtful as he planned Man Kee's future. He saw smoke on the horizon and then a ship shining in the sunlight. Chen put a coin in a telescope and tried to find the ship. At first, he couldn’t see it, but then he found it. It was a small, old, rusty ship. Chen lifted Man Kee to the telescope. ""Do you see the ship, Son?"" he asked gently. ""It is a special ship for people like us. It may look old, but we know it will take us back home when we are done here. It will take you to your homeland, Son, which you have never seen."" Chen kissed Man Kee's head. 
Lily and Mui came up behind them. Lily put her arm around Chen's shoulders. ""The little old ship,"" Chen said. ""Let your mother see, Son."" Man Kee didn’t want to let go of the telescope, and when he finally did, the telescope stopped working. By the time Chen found another coin, the ship was gone, and Lily could only see seagulls flying over the water."
CPE_43,C2,"**THE WELL**
I had read that if you dig a deep enough hole, you can see the stars on a clear day. I convinced you to help me with my idea. You watched with wide eyes as I pulled up the well bucket, steadied it on the wall, and then climbed in. I told you to let me down. I didn’t think about how heavy the bucket was or that you might not be strong enough to hold it. You held the handle while I pushed the bucket off the side of the well. As soon as it was free, I fell down. You screamed and tried to stop it, but then you let go. I fell into the well and hit my head. At that moment, I didn’t realize I had achieved my goal. I saw strange lights, like the stars I usually saw in cartoons when a character got hurt. At first, I was confused, then scared, then relieved, and finally angry at you for letting me fall. I was also worried about what my mother would say. 
You called down to me, asking if I was okay. I opened my mouth to shout, but then I heard panic in your voice, and I couldn’t speak. I lay still, peeking at you through my eyelashes. You disappeared, calling for help. I waited a moment, then climbed back up and pulled myself over the edge, landing on the courtyard stones. I heard loud voices coming from the castle. I ran the other way, down to the passage by the moat bridge, and hid in the shadows. 
My mother and father came with you and old Arthur. My mother was screaming and waving her hands. My father shouted for Arthur to pull on the winch handle. You stood back, looking pale and shocked. I was hidden in the shadows, feeling a strange excitement. Then I noticed the drops of water I had left from the well to where I stood. I looked in horror at the dark spots of dirty water on the dry stones. At my feet, the water had made a small pool. I looked back into the courtyard, where my father was shining a flashlight down into the well. The drops sparkled in the sunlight. I couldn’t believe no one had seen them. My mother was now screaming loudly, a sound I had never heard before. It shook me. What should I do? I had gotten back at you, but now things were more serious than I thought. What started as a fun prank was turning into something that would lead to punishment, probably for me. I regretted not thinking this through. 
Suddenly, I had an idea. I gathered my courage and left my hiding place, staggering out and blinking. I called out softly, then yelled louder when no one heard me. I stumbled a bit further and then fell dramatically on the stones. Sitting up, with my mother holding me, I sighed and said, “Oh dear,” and smiled bravely. I claimed that I had found a secret tunnel from the bottom of the well to the moat, and that I crawled and swam through it until I got out. I thought I was almost getting away with it until my father squatted in front of me. He made me repeat my story. I hesitated. His eyes narrowed. I thought I was filling in a gap, but I was only making things worse. I said the secret passage had fallen in after me, and that the well was dangerous. I had barely escaped with my life. 
When I looked into my father’s eyes, it felt like looking into a dark tunnel with no light. It was as if he was seeing me for the first time, and I was seeing how adults view the world. My words got stuck in my throat. “Don’t be ridiculous, boy,” he said, sounding more disappointed than I expected. He stood up and walked away. Arthur looked down at me, looking sad and worried. He seemed to understand that I was lying, and he felt sorry for me. His pity hurt more than my father’s words. It made me realize that my actions were being judged, and I couldn’t ignore that."
CPE_51,C2,"**REMOVAL DAY**
Susan is a widow with grown children, and today she is leaving her family home. A van with the words ""Removers of Distinction"" is parked outside, and inside, a man named Fred is carefully packing her belongings. He is wrapping everything in newspaper and putting it in boxes. The house is beautiful, a four-story building with a view of a small harbor. Susan remembers the years she spent there, watching her children grow up. 
When they first bought the house, her son Robert, who was five at the time, asked, ""Mum, how do you get a house home?"" Now, Robert is helping her move, making sure she doesn’t forget about the piano. Francesca, her daughter, is also there, being bossy and insisting that she will take care of the piano because it is very special.
Fred, the removal man, notices that Susan is not crying. He tells her that some people cry when they see their things being taken away. Susan can understand why. If she were alone, she would have warned the movers about the piano before they started. But Robert said it was the movers' job to notice any problems.
The piano is in the best room of the house, and they plan to move it last. Sitting on the bottom stair, Susan remembers the day they moved in. It was a difficult day because the piano got stuck on the stairs. The movers worked hard for almost two hours to get it inside. Robert watched with excitement, while Francesca cried, saying they couldn’t live without a piano. They found a way to get it in, thanks to her late husband, Peter. He had a builder take out a window, and they used a crane to lift the piano inside. The children were so happy to see it.
Now, many years later, the children are busy and don’t come home often. Susan is finding it harder to move around the house. She thinks about the stairs and remembers that the banister was never fixed properly. She wishes she had told the movers about it, but it is too late now. 
Fred asks if she is okay, reminding her that the piano is the last thing to move. Susan feels nervous as she watches Robert and Francesca come to see. Fred talks to her casually, but she is close to tears. It is strange how moving things makes her feel emotional. 
Just then, the piano appears at the top of the stairs, and Fred is guiding it down. He tells them to be careful. They bring it outside and place it behind the van. Robert laughs first, and soon they are all laughing together, relieved that the move is almost over. As they walk down the path for the last time, Susan realizes that her tears are tears of laughter."
CPE_11,C2,"Online Literary Criticism for Everyone**
**Do-it-yourself literary criticism: Is it just for fun?**
From the beginning, one of the main ideas of the Internet was to allow open access. This means that anyone could publish their thoughts or share music online. In the early days, some technical skills were needed, but there was one area that became open to everyone: literary criticism. 
By visiting Amazon.com, the first popular online bookstore, anyone could write a book review. Amazon allowed anyone to share their opinions about books and give them up to five stars. This was a great idea because it let readers see what others thought about a book, not just what the publisher said or what professional critics wrote. Other online bookstores also had similar features, but Amazon was the biggest, with over 80% of the online market. This meant they had the most customers and the most reviews, but it also led to some problems.
Every day, thousands of reviews were submitted, and Amazon could not check them all. They had a team of editors who looked for reviews that did not follow the rules. For example, one-word reviews or personal attacks on authors were not allowed. Reviews that gave away the ending or used bad language were also removed. However, since reviewers could remain anonymous, it was easy for some people to write fake reviews. 
For instance, a writer named Lev Grossman was upset by the bad reviews of his first novel. To fix this, he wrote some good reviews under a fake name. His trick worked until he wrote an article about it, and then Amazon removed his fake reviews. Authors could also comment on their own books by clicking a link that said, ""I am the Author, and I wish to comment on my book."" Most authors used this to encourage readers to buy and enjoy their books. Some even shared their email addresses for direct communication. However, Amazon did not always check if these comments really came from the authors, except for famous writers.
The real excitement came from readers, not writers. When James McElroy's book about a cheerleading team was published, it received good reviews from the press. But many people mentioned in the book felt hurt and wrote angry reviews on Amazon. These negative reviews disappeared after a few days. Despite this, Amazon thought it was good for business that so many people were writing and reading reviews.
Amazon wanted reviews to be a place to discuss books, not just a chat room. They paid special attention to bestselling books to make sure all reviews followed the rules. This meant that silly reviews were more likely to appear on pages for less popular books. For example, a classic children's book called The Story about Ping inspired some funny reviews because ""ping"" is also a term used in technology. One long review compared the book's story to how the Internet works.
Most reviews on Amazon were serious, and they helped readers decide if a book was worth buying. The writer George Orwell once said that reviewing too many books made it hard to have real feelings about them. This is why making literary criticism available to everyone is a good thing."

In modern times, especially over the last two hundred years, people often think that every artist must go against the art of their time. Art is often praised for being unique, new, or even shocking. We feel good when we admire artists whose work was not appreciated in the past. However, when we look at art today, we sometimes think that an artist has gone too far and that their work is not really art anymore. The media often shares this opinion, and many people agree because they find it hard to understand the new styles of art. We expect artists to be different from us, with special talents that make them stand out. In the past, people asked artists to create specific works of art for their everyday lives. Today, we let artists work on their own and sometimes get upset if they try to connect with us.
**Picture This**
I want to describe a situation and then ask an important question. An artist picks a piece of text from an art book. The text talks about the many kinds of pictures and asks, ""What are they all about?"" It then says, ""There is no end to the different kinds of pictures."" This sounds simple, but stay with me. The artist then asks someone to prepare a canvas for him and to write the chosen text on it in plain black letters. The sign painter follows the artist's instructions carefully. My important question is: is this finished work a painting?
**Underground Encounters**
At the Mercury Gallery in London, there is a rule that successful painters should stick to one style. Collectors want artists to keep creating similar works, and if they try something new, people often feel disappointed. I am not sure why this happens. Gallery owners like to play it safe, and art buyers may feel more comfortable with familiar styles. However, some artists, like Picasso and Hockney, have successfully tried new things. Eric Rimmington is another artist who is now trying something different. He is moving away from the still lifes that made him famous to paint scenes from the London Underground. Rimmington finds the railway fascinating. His sketches from the 1980s of King's Cross Station led him to explore what happens underground. His new exhibition, ""Underground Encounters,"" features 40 paintings and drawings that show the unique beauty of this hidden world.
**Extract from a Novel**
I have come to this island with a few books. I do not know why I say ""escape."" The villagers joke that only a sick person would choose such a lonely place to live. I am here to heal myself, if you want to see it that way. Besides an old woman who comes from the village to clean my house, I am alone. I feel neither happy nor sad; I am like a feather floating in the clouds of my memories. I talked about the uselessness of art but did not mention how it can comfort us. The comfort of my work as an artist is that in the quiet moments of painting or writing, I can change reality and show its true meaning. Our everyday actions often hide the deeper meaning of life. For artists, art allows us to deal with the pain and struggles of daily life, not to escape from it, but to fulfill our true potential through imagination. Otherwise, why should we hurt each other?"
CPE_63,C2,"**Family Business**
""Look, this isn't good!"" said my Dad. We were in the car going back to London. My father, with my brother Maurice, had just picked me up from the fancy girls' school I attended. He had also just been to Parent's Day, where I received a Latin prize and a prize for doing well in my exams. He had a long talk with my headteacher, and now we were on our way home for the holidays.
""What isn't?"" I asked, even though I had a feeling I knew what he was thinking. My father usually talked a lot, but now he was quiet. ""You can't fool me. You will do what you want now,"" he said. ""With all those certificates, I heard you might get a scholarship to Oxford.""
""So?"" I replied, trying to act tough. ""Isn't that useful?"" 
""I also heard,"" he continued, and I knew he was going to confront me, ""that you want to be a barrister. A barrister!"" My father knew a lot about lawyers and the law. 
""I just said that,"" I explained. ""I couldn't think of anything else!"" 
""And apparently,"" he went on, ""you have the right personality. You can understand a lot of information quickly, you are good at talking, and you enjoy performing."" 
""I don't know about that,"" I said. ""I only know what I see on TV."" 
""Anyway,"" he said, getting serious, ""I feel like your heart won't be in the family business. You will go to Oxford University, and after that, I can't see you wanting to join us."" 
The problem was that, like many children in family businesses, I felt trapped by my father's expectations. I saw many job options for myself, and I wanted to explore them. But I also didn't want to upset my father. I wasn't as scared of him as Maurice was - I was his favorite - but I still found him intimidating. 
""It's too soon to know,"" I said weakly. 
""I tell you, you won't want to join us,"" my father said, who often turned out to be right about these things. ""It's a pity because you have the talent - the brains, the courage, and the vision."" 
""There's still Maurice,"" I said, feeling down. My father laughed. We both knew Maurice didn't like the business. 
""Anyway,"" I continued, ""you could always use me as a consultant."" My mother had died when I was young, and my father raised me and Maurice. Maurice was two years younger than me, and I took care of him because he didn't have a mother. I loved Maurice, and it was not a burden. 
Because the business was successful, we lived comfortably - in a big house in London, went to nice schools, wore good clothes, and enjoyed parties, theaters, and operas. My father knew many interesting people - politicians, actors, and businessmen - and our house was always lively.
""I have an idea,"" my father said. ""You can help us during the holidays until you leave Oxford. Then, if you want to leave, you can. It will give you some pocket money and help me."" 
""Okay,"" I said, relieved to avoid making immediate choices, especially since my father would be upset if I disagreed. This was how he controlled us. 
So, it happened. In my last term at school and during university breaks, I helped out, but only a couple of times a year and with easier tasks. I became one of the smarter students, had a small house, a nice car, designer clothes, and a black dress from Paris for my final exams.
In my last term, my father came to visit me and took me to a village for a meal and a talk. There were only a few weeks left. My tutor said I would get a First Class degree in Law, and I knew that if I focused, he might be right. I felt ready and confident. 
But then my father told me that he needed me to do one last important job for the family business. He said it was the most important task they had ever done, and it would be worth my time. 
""But Dad,"" I protested, ""I have my final exams soon, and I need to focus on that. It's really important, and I don't want to think about anything else right now."" 
I could tell my father didn't understand how important my exams were, and he would see my refusal as a betrayal. As he explained the job, I saw how determined he was, how clearly he worked, and how much energy he had. In his way, he was a genius, and I respected that. It made my own plans seem less important. 
""All right,"" I said. ""I'll do it."""
CPE_56,C2,"
Simon Costello realized that buying the house in Pembroke Square was a mistake within a year of moving in with Lois. He thought it was a good idea at first because he had been successful at work, and Lois had returned to her job after having twins. She even got a raise, making her salary thirty-five thousand. Lois wanted to move because their flat was too small for their family. They needed more space, a garden, and a place for an au pair. They could have found a bigger home in a less expensive area, but Lois wanted to live in a nice place. 
Lois decided that one of them should save money by using public transport. Since her office was far away, Simon had to take the crowded tube every day. This journey made him feel unhappy and resentful. He often thought about his grandfather's house in Hampstead, where he felt comforted as a child. His grandmother took care of everything and made sure his grandfather could relax after work. 
Lois had made it clear that her career was just as important as Simon's. They both needed their jobs to afford their lifestyle. However, Simon felt threatened by Venetia, a colleague who seemed angry and upset. He wished he had left his office earlier to avoid her. 
Venetia confronted Simon about a case he worked on years ago. She accused him of knowing that a client had bribed jurors but not doing anything about it. Simon denied it, but he felt guilty and nervous. He remembered feeling scared when he was punished in school. When he looked into Venetia's eyes, he saw that she did not believe him. 
He wished he had said something different to defend himself. He felt that Venetia was unfairly judging him and worried that her anger could ruin his career. He didn’t know how far she would go, but he knew that if people heard rumors about him, it could be very damaging."
CPE_36,C2,"
I chose to live in this place because I thought I could be anonymous among people who didn’t care about the worn-out rented houses and messy gardens. But I was wrong. People in the shops soon start to recognize you, even if you don’t know them. The beautiful roses from next door remind me that gardens used to be loved. Usually, I stay inside to forget about the summer outside, but tonight I am watching the swifts flying between the trees and roofs. I have trimmed some plants to make space for a chair, and my arms are stinging from scratches. It is a small garden in London, where plants have to grow tall to survive.
“Been doing some cleaning, I see,” says my upstairs neighbor, Jaz, leaning out of her window. She is a writer, and I sometimes help her with her work as an English teacher. I have her latest manuscript with me. “How’s the work going, Jaz?” I ask. “In no other job do people ask you about your work so many times a day,” she replies. Then she says, “I have something to drink in the fridge. I’ll bring it down.” I don’t want Jaz in the garden, and I realize it looks messy. She knocks on my door. “So, you’re on holiday now, lucky you.” She sits in the chair while I put a cushion on what used to be a small lawn. “Cheers,” she says, “I should have become a teacher – writers don’t have holidays. But you know what they say, those who can, do, and those who can’t, teach.” 
“What are your plans for the holidays?” she asks. I feel a wave of dread about the empty days ahead. “Actually, I’m going to Stonebridge tomorrow. Can you feed my cats?” My heart races as I ask. “Of course,” Jaz says, knowing she will be around. “Where will you stay? A nice bed and breakfast?” “No, I’ll stay with my oldest friend, Ruby, at the Rising Sun. We’ve known each other since we were eight.” This isn’t true, but I often deal with fiction. 
“Going back to your roots. What do you think of my work?” Jaz asks about her manuscript, The Cruelty of Red Vans, which I haven’t read much of. I like the title and tell her so. I can see how red vans could be cruel, always bringing gifts to other houses. I decide to be honest for once. “Let me give you a little tip,” I say. “What?” she asks, surprised. “Try writing about nice people for a change, people who want to be good.” “Teachers!” Jaz replies, acting like a rebellious student. “I keep a journal where I write something good about each day,” I say. My words sound a bit old-fashioned. “Keep a journal! Nice people! Get a life, Ann.” I do have a life. I work, go out sometimes, and read on the tube. 
When we finally go inside, my calm kitchen makes me feel better. Then I suddenly remember my old geography teacher, Miss Tarrantine, who was about my age now. She used to wink at us and say, “I’ve had my moments.” We almost died laughing."
CPE_6,C2,"**Heritage**
Heritage means the connection people have with their past. We often feel connected to our personal heritage because we know about our grandparents and have heard stories about their lives. However, we also have a need to learn about our wider past to understand our future. Heritage helps us feel secure about where we come from, which can give us confidence about our future. Just like we inherit our genes, we also inherit a culture that has been passed down through generations. There may be parts of our national heritage that we do not like, but it is still a part of us, and it can be comforting to feel connected to something bigger. Heritage teaches us a lot and is important for our well-being. It influences our customs and material culture. In the past, we learned about our heritage through stories from our ancestors. However, in modern society, many of these stories have been lost. Now, we can learn about our past through places and buildings. It is very important to protect and restore these links to honor our ancestors.
**The Fens**
Some time ago, I started writing a novel called *Waterland*. I did not know then that the landscape of a place in England called the Fens would be very important in my story. After the book was published, people asked me why I, a Londoner, chose to write about a place I did not know. The simple answer is that I chose the Fens because they seemed simple and empty, a good setting for my story. However, I learned that the Fens are not flat or empty at all. They are very English but also strangely different. It is interesting that in the middle of England, there is a place that many English people find unusual, especially since many other unique areas of Britain have become part of the national culture. The Fens are both empty and full, both farmed and wild, seeming open yet very mysterious. I have not visited places like Wisbech or Prickwillow, but as a fiction writer, I prefer to imagine places rather than seek proof. This way of imagining the Fens is important because, as shown in Edward Storey's book, the Fens are not just a landscape but also a way of thinking.
**Museums**
Museums need to make their collections easy to access. In the past, this meant just putting items in display cases with long labels that were hard to understand. Now, museums should do more than this. They can create interesting displays that capture visitors' attention and emotions. Museums should also reach out to the community. For example, some museums provide loan boxes of objects for teachers, and they have started to offer similar materials for elderly people with memory loss. Museums focus on real objects, not copies. They exist to help people connect with history through items that were used and had meaning in the past. This is their strength and what makes them different from heritage centers and theme parks. Museums that create exciting displays and programs will find that their competition in ""virtual history"" can actually help them by making people want to see real history.
**Architecture and Environment**
The desire to preserve things is not new, but changes in our towns happen quickly and affect many people. This can make some people very focused on preservation and encourage others to think more about the nature of towns today and their future. People who have lived through major events, like world wars, may care more about preserving things because stability is important to them. If there is a need to preserve, planners should consider this. Change is not bad if we learn how to manage it. Changes in our towns reflect changes in society, such as population growth, welfare, and our needs."
CPE_33,C2,"Einstein**
If you stop anyone in the street and ask them to name a scientist, they will probably say Albert Einstein. His face is used to sell many products, like computers and encyclopedias. Most people do not know much about what Einstein did, except that he created some complex theories called 'relativity'. These theories are famous for being hard to understand and for making strange predictions that do not match our everyday experiences.
Einstein was part of a big change in scientific thinking, which started the modern science of the twentieth century. Physicists and mathematicians were trying to explain the universe better by studying how matter and natural forces relate to each other. Einstein made important contributions by looking closely at basic ideas: time, space, matter, and energy. Before him, scientists followed Isaac Newton's idea that stars and planets moved in a fixed space and time. Einstein changed this idea, saying that time and space are not fixed but relative.
**Young Readers**
When we were children, Lydia and I did not trust any book that won a prize because we thought they would be boring. Our mother often looked down on our dislike for these books, but our father would give us small coins for each chapter we read to encourage us. He would also give us some special books for Christmas and birthdays, marked with 'This Book is NOT Literature'. Even though we thought most of his books were for boys, he did help us read some good short stories and, once, a famous collection of poems.
**Language**
Jacob Grimm wrote in 1851, ""The origin of human language is truly secret and marvellous."" This secret has led to many strange ideas. For example, Charles Caller said in 1928 that early humans made sounds like ""meuh"" when they felt danger. This sound is sad. The early human who walked in dangerous places made desperate noises, and some words today still show this, like ""malaria,"" which means ""fever,"" or the Latin word ""mors,"" which means ""death."" 
Many people avoided talking about how language started because they thought it was silly, but now, studying the origin and evolution of language is very important. Language likely began in East Africa about 100,000 years ago. At first, speech was mainly used for friendly communication and was important in struggles for power. Sharing information was probably not the main purpose of language, which is different from what philosopher John Locke said, who thought language was mainly for sharing knowledge."
CPE_20,C2,"Writing Reviews**
Frank Kermode talks about how to write reviews from the perspective of someone who does it. Most reviews are written quickly and do not last long. They have deadlines and strict limits on how long they can be. Once published, they are usually only read for a short time, like a day or a week, and sometimes a month at most. Because of this, many people think that writing reviews is not very important. They believe that writers only do it because they need money or because they cannot spend all their time on a novel or a serious book.
However, writing reviews is a skilled job. It is different to write a short review of 600 to 800 words for a newspaper than to write a longer review of 6,000 to 8,000 words for an international journal. A review in a weekly magazine is usually about 1,500 words and has challenges from both short and long reviews. 
Reviewers must think about their audience. Some readers just want a quick summary, while others want a detailed analysis. Reviewers also need to know a lot about different topics and write in a way that is clear and enjoyable for smart readers. This means that most reviewers also write other things besides reviews.
The American writer John Updike, who does not think highly of criticism, still enjoys writing reviews between his novels. He collects all his reviews, no matter how short, into books with modest titles. Some people might think that less famous writers should accept that their reviews will not last long, but it is understandable if they want their work to be remembered, especially if they feel their best writing is in reviews.
I feel this way about my own writing. My main job has been in academics, and my serious books are often academic works that professors write as part of their jobs. In the English-speaking world, there is not a strong difference between reviewing and literary study, so it is common for the same people to do both. 
In the past, some academics criticized professors who wrote reviews for showing off or wasting time. But now, it is less common for non-professors to complain that professors are taking opportunities away from them. This is partly because there are many more reviews today, so almost everyone can write one, and also because there are fewer opportunities available.
I believe this situation is good for both readers and professors. Readers can trust that reviewers know what they are talking about, and it helps professors stay connected to the public. Professors sometimes forget that they need to explain their ideas clearly to non-professors. When they talk to each other, they might use complicated language, but they need to communicate effectively with everyone else.
In conclusion, reviewing is important but is often a secondary job. You can only write good reviews if you are also doing something else well."
CPE_40,C2,"Ralph unlocked the door to his apartment. As he entered the dark hallway, he felt a brief sense of ownership, which still surprised him after three years of living there. When he first bought the flat, he would come home excited and curious, wondering what had happened while he was away. The flat felt like a welcoming place, a space where he could be himself. 
He thought he should worry about things like intruders or broken pipes, but his flat always seemed to be waiting for him, either looking tidy or messy, depending on how he had left it. Over time, he began to see it as a part of himself, a place where his thoughts and feelings spilled out. He often felt frustrated that he couldn’t change it. 
There were always a few letters by the door and the answering machine would sometimes blink with messages when he got home. He was thankful that his windows were safe and not broken, but he often wondered what would happen if they were. From his small, dull office on the third floor, Ralph looked forward to his quiet evenings at home. 
After leaving the busy office, he felt a little more like himself on the bus ride home. He wanted to be alone, but he often felt lonely instead. At his desk, he craved time to himself, but when he finally escaped, he felt empty. He suspected that his job, which he didn’t enjoy, was changing him and taking him away from who he really was. 
He would read or listen to music at night, but he started to wonder why he did these things. His thoughts became unclear, and he felt lost. He remembered a time when he felt more in control of his life. He had wanted to improve himself after university, but he found that he only wanted to get by. 
He applied for jobs that his friends talked about, following them as they moved forward in their careers. He went to one job interview for a position at a local newspaper. He was happy to have a good conversation with Neil, his potential boss, and didn’t think much about the job itself. Neil offered him the job right away, saying he was the only graduate who had applied, which Ralph took as a compliment at the time."
CPE_45,C2,"**Goat Racing**
I was about to see goat racing on Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. I was pushing my way through ice-cream vans, many people, food stalls, and loud music. Even though everyone was moving towards the racecourse, I tried to get a good spot. An area was blocked off to create a course for the goats. It was not like a normal racecourse, but people were standing on both sides of the ground where the goats would run. It was hard to keep a few special goats in line because goats are known to eat almost anything.
**Canoe Trip**
As the day ended, I started to worry about the night. The canoe was too wet to sleep in, there was nowhere to stop, and we hadn’t seen any villages or huts since early morning. In the dim moonlight, we used our flashlight to see the cliffs, but the batteries were dying. We changed the batteries, but they didn’t work. We couldn’t find a place to camp. A little later, Lesley shouted that she saw a distant light, and we felt hopeful. But the light was just the moon shining on the waves. Soon, we heard the loud sound of rushing water, but we couldn’t see what was happening. Time felt like it stopped as we continued on.
**How to Be Presentation Perfect**
I am not good at making presentations, but as the managing director, I have to present to my colleagues and to important shareholders. How can I get better at presenting and feel more confident? You are not alone. Making a presentation is different from running a company, but many leaders need to be good at it. If you want to convince your audience, you must believe in what you are saying. Show your belief with passion and enthusiasm. This means you need to prepare well. Test your ideas before the presentation. Ask your colleagues what tough questions the audience might ask. You should also create a positive atmosphere from the start. Begin with something everyone can relate to and then lead to the conclusion you want to share."
CPE_64,C2,"
Some activities cannot be rushed. They take the time they need. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you are impatient with mayonnaise and add the oil too quickly, it will not turn out right. If you pull hard on a tangled fishing line, the knot will just get tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some things happen very quickly, while others take seconds, minutes, hours, days, or even years. We can get faster at some tasks, like solving puzzles or doing math. But some things cannot be rushed. If you try to hurry them, they can break down, like the mayonnaise, or get tangled, like the fishing line.
Sometimes, saying ""Think fast; we need results"" is not helpful. We learn and think in different ways, and these ways work at different speeds. There are three main speeds of thinking. The first is faster than normal thought. Some situations need a quick reaction. For example, when my motorbike skidded on a wet road, my body reacted quickly to help me stay safe. This quick reaction is like our ""wits.""
The second speed is normal thinking. This is when we figure things out, weigh options, and solve problems. For example, a mechanic trying to fix a car or a student working on an assignment uses this kind of thinking. We often call this ""intellect."" People who are good at solving problems are called ""bright"" or ""clever.""
The third speed is slower and more relaxed. In this mode, we think about things in a more playful or dreamy way. For example, when we are sitting by the sea, listening to the waves, we are in a different mental state than when we are planning a meal or writing a letter. This slower way of thinking is just as important as the faster ones. Taking time to think slowly is necessary, especially when life gets busy. 
Some problems are better solved with a slow mind. Recent studies show that a patient and relaxed mind is good for understanding complex situations. Fast thinking works well for simple problems. But when we are unsure about what to consider, we need to take our time. For example, if we are trying to manage a difficult group at work or deciding whether to change jobs, it might be better to sit and think rather than rush for answers.
This slower type of thinking is linked to creativity and wisdom. Poets and philosophers have long understood that slow thinking has its own value. Recently, scientists have started to study these slower ways of knowing. They have found that the unconscious mind can do many interesting and important tasks if given enough time. It can learn patterns that our conscious mind might miss and understand complex situations better than quick thinking can."
CPE_29,C2,"Surviving in a Foreign Land**
I have been welcomed warmly. It is a friendly place with many supplies, but it is very isolated. There are about forty people here, including scientists, students, weather experts, and satellite trackers. We all work together as a close community. My school French is just enough to communicate, but not enough for casual conversation. I miss the small details in conversations, and my phrasebook does not help me at breakfast. This is not a big problem, but at first, I felt unsure of myself. I was a bit scared of mealtimes. I would hesitate, worried about which table to sit at, and I felt anxious when I spoke. I still smile awkwardly or feel nervous when people talk to me. I think this feeling of sadness is not about missing people or communication, but because I have lost the confidence I used to have when talking.
**Elliot**
When I first met Elliot, I was just a young writer, and he did not pay much attention to me. He remembered faces, though, and when I saw him, he would shake my hand politely but did not want to be friends. If I saw him at the opera with an important person, he would not notice me. But then I became successful as a playwright, and I noticed that Elliot started to be friendlier. One day, he sent me a note asking me to lunch, and I thought he was testing me. After that, as I made more friends because of my success, I began to see him more often.
**Alfred Hitchcock**
The film director Alfred Hitchcock always said that he did not care about the story of his films or the acting. What he cared about was the photography and the music. For Hitchcock, it was not the message or the acting that moved the audience; he believed that people react to the film itself, no matter where they come from. So, if a film is made well, the audience in Japan should react the same way as the audience in India. Hitchcock was very clear and logical about his work. He was a genius who liked to hear the audience scream. He did not focus on ideas or deep meanings, and he did not explore his characters in a complicated way. He focused on film itself and how it can affect the audience in a powerful way."
CPE_57,C2,"**Amateur Astronomy**
Many things have changed in astronomy in the last fifty years. Until about thirty years ago, there were not many charts and catalogues available. Telescopes were limited, and there were few books about practical astronomy. Today, there are many types of telescopes and equipment that people can buy. Electronic calculators and computers have made it easier to create charts and analyze observations. This is a great time for amateur astronomy. 
However, some things have also been lost. Now, you may have to travel 80 kilometers to find a dark sky, which was easier to find in cities fifty years ago. During the day, the sky is often filled with trails from airplanes, which can last for hours and make it hard to see the sun and stars.
**Too Much Choice**
Today, people have too many choices. There are too many things to do and too many options. In our modern economy, people want the newest products and services, and technology makes this change happen faster. New products come out all the time, and it can be overwhelming. More choices can lead to more stress and less time. Because of this, many people are looking for ""simplexity"" – simple things that bring meaning to their lives in a complicated world. But it is not easy to simplify life when there are so many products available. There are more brands of detergent and breakfast cereals than we really need, and it can be hard to keep track of all the software updates and plans.
**McAndrews Hotel**
Every summer, my family spends two weeks at McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. This is a family tradition started by my grandmother, and it is very important to us. Nothing can change this tradition. The guests at McAndrews Hotel are often old-fashioned and some might say snobbish. I do not like the bad manners of shop assistants today, and I do not enjoy the overly friendly behavior of waiters. I know many of the other guests because they have been coming here since they were children, just like me. When I see them in the hotel, we usually just say hello and do not talk much. This respect for privacy is hard to find in hotels these days."
CPE_9,C2,"**Text:**
**Othello**  
A great production of Shakespeare's play *Othello* has moved from Stratford to London. I want to correct an unfair review I wrote when the show first opened last spring. I said that Ray Fearon was too young for the main role, and I was wrong about his acting. I still believe that changing the age difference between Othello and Desdemona changes the story, but I take back my words about Mr. Fearon's amazing performance. The whole cast is wonderful. Some memorable scenes include when Cassio's games with other young officers become dangerous, and when Iago starts to lose control and struggles to keep himself together. I challenge anyone not to cry during the scene where Emilia helps Desdemona get ready for bed. The pace and tension in the play are excellent. Do not miss this production.
**Lake Vostok**  
In the middle of Antarctica, there is nothing alive. On the edges of the continent, there are many penguins, seals, and birds. But in the deep white area in the center, there is no life. However, there is a large hidden lake called Lake Vostok, which is under almost 4 kilometers of ice, right below the coldest place on Earth. The water has been cut off from air and sunlight for up to 25 million years. Biologists are very excited to explore its mysterious waters and find out what strange life forms might be there. Geologists and glaciologists are also interested. For two years, researchers around the world have been trying to find ways to discover the secrets of the lake. If they succeed, we will see many discoveries about Lake Vostok in the next few years.
**Scientists**  
Last week, I heard something interesting on the radio. A group of scientists is discussing what makes them want to be scientists. The phrase ""because it's there"" comes to mind. We all know that scientists want to gain knowledge and understand everything from tiny atoms to huge black holes. But these scientists want to know why we have this desire for knowledge and why science cannot explain this desire. I think it is more important to know if what scientists are doing is right, rather than getting stuck in debates about why we want to know things. The key point is that science is a tool, and we should decide how, when, and why to use it."

**Food**  
Food is very important and satisfying in our lives. Many people who love cooking buy cookbooks like this one. Sometimes, we think that we should only cook for special occasions or when making complicated dishes. But that is not true. You can make a delicious soup just by putting some chopped carrots, a leek, celery, and herbs in water. This is much better than buying soup in a packet or a can. Instead of buying a sweet chocolate mousse full of chemicals, you can make a tasty dessert in just five minutes that both adults and kids will enjoy. Cooking is also a way to show care and love. Sharing food is important to us, which is why we celebrate special events like birthdays and anniversaries around a table. No one would want to have takeout for a wedding or anniversary party, and most people wouldn’t discuss business over canned soup.
**In the Elevator**  
This morning, Alistair tried to clean his office, but there were still papers everywhere. Tax forms were sticking out of drawers and boxes, waiting for a day when he felt like organizing them. He also had a lot of paperwork from owning an apartment building. As the elevator took him to his floor, he knew that Mallory would arrive on time for their meeting. She would knock on his office door exactly at the hour. She was very strict about time and cleanliness. He wondered how she would react to the mess. She might think someone had broken in. He could walk in after her and pretend to be shocked. His cleaning lady, Mrs. Wilson, had come while he was trying to clear some space on the floor. When he peeked out of his office, he smiled at her, hoping she would help. But she looked at him with a hard expression and seemed to say she didn’t want to go in there. He knew she thought he was someone from a different place, not from her own neighborhood in Brooklyn.
**KAREN**  
Karen wanted to be different from her mother, so she created her own story. In her story, there were important moments, like when she was twelve years old and her brother accidentally hit her in the eye with a golf club. At first, she thought she would go blind, but the bone protected her. The doctor later told her that the club had missed her eye, and she only needed a few stitches. When she opened her eyes in the doctor’s office and saw her mother talking about miracles, she felt that she was saved for a reason.
**Miss Fogerty**  
Miss Fogerty was walking quickly back to her work across the wet grass of the village green. She felt both excited and sad about what she had just seen. It is always thrilling to be the first to know something important, especially in a small town where life is usually quiet. However, she was very sad about Dr. Bailey’s health. He had been her doctor for many years, and she remembered how he cared for her when she had laryngitis, which was the only health problem she had. Miss Fogerty thought his best quality was that he always made patients feel like he had plenty of time for them and really wanted to listen to their worries. This is why the villagers loved him so much. He always gave his time, knowledge, and humor to others, and in return, he received their loyalty and affection."
CPE_59,C2,"**Joanna's Lessons**
Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist. She performs a lot, but she has also started writing books for young children who want to learn the piano. Joanna's performances are exciting and impressive. Even a child who does not know much about music can enjoy her playing. At one concert for kids, a small boy asked her, ""Can you play Match of the Day?"" This surprised many musicians, but Joanna found it funny. She thought that until she played that song, the boy did not think she was a real pianist. She played it and made a note to remember this moment for her next concert for children.
Joanna is different from many famous pianists because she cares about how young children learn music. She has just published a beginner's piano book called *Joanna MacGregor's Piano World*. She wrote this book even though she has a very busy schedule. This summer, she is performing at many festivals and working with young composers and artists. She also runs her own music label called Sound Circus. Joanna loves to work with other artists and often suggests new projects.
She believes that the first lessons in music are very important. Many music teachers focus only on talented children, but Joanna thinks that most people enjoy music in a more everyday way. She wants to make music accessible to everyone. When she was younger, she taught many beginners how to play the piano. She also grew up with many children coming to her home to learn music from her mother. This experience helped her understand that music should be for everyone, not just for those with special talent.
Joanna thinks that just like everyone should learn to swim or speak a little French, everyone should try to learn the piano. Some children learn quickly, while others take their time and sometimes give up. This can happen for many reasons. Some kids find it hard at the beginning, while others feel pressure from their parents to be like the talented children they see on TV. Joanna worries that some parents use music to push their children to achieve, instead of letting them enjoy it.
When asked if she thinks other piano books are not good, Joanna says she does not want to criticize them. She believes her books are colorful and fun, but they are not the only ones that help children learn. To make her books interesting, she includes stories and music on CDs. She wants learning to be fun. She encourages children to play freely and explore the piano.
As children learn, they need to practice reading music, not just playing by ear. Joanna understands this because she relied on her ear when she was young. She believes that practice is very important. She knows it can be hard to get children to play the same piece many times. Joanna did not practice a lot until she went to the Royal Academy of Music, where she learned to play more difficult music. Now, she enjoys practicing and spends many hours doing it. 
Joanna wants to help children who find practicing difficult. She suggests that whether you practice for twenty minutes or five hours, it is important to have a goal. She also gives tips like playing through a piece, even if there are mistakes, and mixing easy pieces with harder ones."
CPE_54,C2,"Writing by Hand and on Screen**
Dr. Johnson said that ""what is written without effort is usually read without pleasure."" This means that good writing takes hard work. When I look back at my handwritten school essays, I see that I made very few mistakes. Today, I would rewrite them many times. I think this is because writing by hand was hard. Writing slowly helped me think carefully. When we use computers, it is easy to make mistakes. Many writers spend just as much time fixing their work on a computer as they did writing it by hand. 
Emails are different from handwritten letters. Many people now write love letters through email, which is good. At least these emails are written in English and have some grammar. However, words on a screen can feel boring. People often do not understand the power of writing and can exaggerate their meaning. Words typed quickly do not have the care and personality of handwriting.
**The CD**
I put down my cup and looked at the CD. The case was not very nice, but the shiny disc inside looked interesting. ""Wonderful little things, aren't they?"" Mr. Warriston said when he came back into the room. I agreed and carefully handed him the disc. ""It's amazing that they can fit seventy minutes of music on them,"" he said, turning on the music player. Lights turned on, and he pressed a button to open a small drawer. He put the disc inside and pressed the button again to close it. ""Some people say they sound cold, but I think they..."" 
""Do you have to turn them over, like records?"" I asked. 
""What? No,"" Mr. Warriston said, standing up. ""You only play one side."" 
""Why?"" I asked. He looked surprised and then thought for a moment. ""I don't know. I don't see why you couldn't play both sides and double the music..."" He looked at the machine. ""You could have two lasers, or just turn it over by hand... hmm."" He smiled at me. ""Yes, good point."" He pointed to my wooden chair. ""Anyway, come on, let's find you the best spot for the sound, okay?"" I smiled, happy to have asked a question that Mr. Warriston could not answer.
**Books vs. Electronic Text**
Malcolm Bradbury said that if matches had been invented after cigarette lighters, we would have thought they were amazing. Many people say that electronic text is as important as the invention of printing. They believe it is almost finished. But they forget that changes in how we think take a long time. 
In 1979, a book said that by the 1980s, books would slowly disappear. So far, this has not happened. Reading long texts on a screen is often not enjoyable, so many people do not do it. Computers make it easy to read only parts of a text. Some people say this is good because it leads to new ways of telling stories. But many books have always been read in parts, like religious texts and dictionaries. The real problem is that computers do not encourage us to read everything from start to finish.
**The Office**
Charles walked into the office and saw everything was in order. The carpet was clean, and the dark wooden desk looked just like it did at the auction five weeks ago. Neat file holders were in their drawers. Twelve years of trade journals filled one wall. Kathleen struggled to close the filing cabinet and then looked at him. ""You have to use computers, Charles. This is too much."" 
""Hello, Kathleen. Oh, this is amazing,"" he said, admiring the room and its antique furniture. He did not think about computers or any machines in the room. ""Simply amazing,"" he said, avoiding the topic of computers. They had talked about this many times over the two years he had known her. She could not understand why he did not want to use technology, even though he was good with computers and had published an important paper about them. She had inspired that paper. She could use any software to create something new that could do amazing things."
CPE_32,C2,"""You don’t take sugar, do you?"" shouted his secretary. She was not really asking; she was stating a fact because she had been making Lancelot coffee for many months. She often forgot small details because he was not usually supposed to be there. But now, he was there all the time. He realized that staying away from work only caused more problems.
He thought about how he had changed from a respected advisor who met authors and playwrights for lunch to someone who was always rushing to avoid problems and had trouble finding a parking space in the mornings. ""This came,"" she yelled, waving a manila folder before putting it in front of him. ""From that guy in Los Angeles. You said you wanted to see it."" A label on the folder read: ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert."" Below that, it said ""An Expanded Synopsis."" Lancelot did not want to see the word ""synopsis."" He wanted to see a label that said ""A First Draft."" He had already seen a synopsis of this book and did not want to see another one, even if it was revised.
Ian Cuthbert had received a large advance for this book when Lancelot bought the company. Ian was one of Lancelot's old friends, and he had made a mistake by asking him to write books. Ian was known for being unpredictable, and Lancelot felt that he was becoming even more difficult to work with. Lancelot quickly skipped the introduction he had read many times and looked at the synopsis. He recognized almost every phrase. He closed the folder and pushed it aside. It was clear that Ian's manuscript would not be ready anytime soon. The synopsis lacked the brilliance that Ian was known for, and it felt like he had lost his passion for writing.
Lancelot remembered stories about a famous author whose last book was published after his death, chapter by chapter, with payments made one at a time. In that case, the payments were small amounts that had never been given. Ian had received a huge advance, which was against the usual rule that authors must deliver a manuscript before getting paid.
Lancelot, who studied modern languages at Oxford, remembered when Ian was seen as a great talent in Cambridge. Ian's friends wanted to take over British theatre, and they succeeded quickly. But Ian seemed lazy compared to them. He wore his overcoat like a cape and talked about famous French writers as if he had met them. For some reason, Ian's creative talent remained hidden. While others became successful, Ian became more reclusive.
At the height of his influence, Ian was very hard to work with. He was supposed to edit a magazine about the arts, but it never got published. His contract with a fashion magazine was renewed three times, but it only created stories about how much he was paid, which kept increasing to try to make him work more. At meetings, Ian would criticize other people's ideas. Ten years later, he was so unreliable that Lancelot thought that ""A World History of the Short"" had been a mistake from the beginning."
CPE_65,C2,"England's Breakfast Revolution**
Health experts agree that a good breakfast is very important. However, breakfast is a relatively new meal in England. In medieval times, people rarely wrote about breakfast. There are a few mentions of travelers eating a meal at dawn before long journeys and sick people having breakfast for health reasons, but most people did not eat breakfast unless they were kings or nobles.
In the sixteenth century, breakfast started to become common for everyone. Some writers say this happened because food became easier to get. However, they may not have thought about other important changes in society. For example, new jobs meant that people had to work set hours, often starting very early. Because of this, eating a meal in the morning became necessary for many people, and it was no longer just for the rich."
CPE_61,C2,"**Photography**
When a photographer takes a picture, they choose what to show based on their skills, personal views, and experiences, as well as social and cultural rules. In this book, we will see how these factors affect the style and meaning of a photograph, and how viewers understand and react to these images. For example, a person reading a newspaper will usually understand the photos printed in it. However, instead of just accepting the photo as it is, we might ask if it really shows what happened at that moment. Does it show the photographer's opinion? Is the exact moment captured important, or should we see the photo as a symbol of something bigger in the world?
**More than a Game**
For me, sport is more than just a game. The most successful athletes believe in themselves completely. To succeed in sports, you need to focus only on that goal. There is only one way to be the best, and you must put everything else aside. Sports can be tough, and no one will do the hard work for you. It’s a matter of survival. Sports have taught me discipline and determination, but they also show the importance of teamwork. My sport allows me to shine individually, but it is still a team effort, and I must balance both. This is similar to life – you can achieve personal success, but you should always remember the people around you. Sports have given me a lot, not just money. They have opened doors for me and shown me things in the world that many people will never see. However, you also have to give up a lot to enjoy these benefits.
**Tuning In**
Some experiences stay in our memory very clearly. For me, one special moment happened many years ago in California. One night, I was awake listening to a beautiful mockingbird singing from a tree in my neighborhood. I don’t have trouble sleeping, but the bird's amazing song kept me awake. As I listened to its complex melodies, I felt like I was in a special musical world. To understand the bird's patterns, I used my knowledge of jazz and Indian classical music. The bird made me feel like I was enjoying a fantastic live performance. I reacted with joy as I listened to its surprising musical changes until I finally fell asleep."
CPE_52,C2,"
People have always had strong feelings about birds. They love them, fear them, and even worship them. But what does this say about us? Paul Evans shares his thoughts.
In a greenhouse, a little brown bird called a wren is bumping against the glass. Some people think the wren has a special message, while others see it as just a bird that is lost. Both ideas could be true. Wrens have been part of British culture for a long time. In medieval times, people believed that the way wrens flew could tell them about their luck. Today, wrens are still seen in pictures and decorations in many British homes. Even if old beliefs about them are not as strong now, people still care about wrens. A place without wrens feels sad.
This connection to birds comes from a time when people relied more on nature for survival. They developed a way to understand the importance of different animals. However, people's views can change over time. For example, the red kite bird was once seen as a helpful scavenger in London. But later, people thought of it as a pest, and it almost disappeared from many areas. Now, red kites are protected again and are seen as important birds for conservation.
Our relationship with birds goes back to the beginning of human history. Early humans watched birds closely because they could warn them about danger or changes in the weather. Birds also connected them to their dreams. When we think about why birds matter to us, we are also thinking about what it means to be human. Birds can fly, sing, and represent freedom. Our interest in them reflects our own identity and connection to nature.
Some people might think our feelings for birds are not important anymore. But these feelings are still part of who we are. Losing this connection would be difficult. That is why, in recent years, birds have become important indicators of environmental health. In Britain, 30 bird species are now endangered. This is sad not only because we are losing these birds but also because we are losing part of our culture. Birds like the skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing represent love and magic in stories and poems. Losing these birds is a loss for our culture.
Folklore, which includes stories and legends about birds, is very important. These stories connect us to the past in a way that scientific facts cannot. They help us feel emotions that are often hidden in our busy lives. Whether we watch birds on TV or in our gardens, the joy we feel cannot be fully explained by science. Birds engage us in ways that are hard to describe, and the stories we tell about them help us understand their significance. The wren in the greenhouse connects our present with a rich history, reminding us of the mystery and beauty of nature."
CPE_28,C2,"**Maps**
The purpose of a map is to show the relationships between different places and features on the earth. These relationships are based on distance and direction. In the past, people often measured distance in time, like saying ""it takes so many hours to walk"" or ""a day's journey by river."" This way of measuring helped people understand how easy it was to travel through different areas, rather than giving exact distances.
Direction is also important, but for most travelers, the main questions were ""Where do I go from here?"" and ""How far away is it?"" Because of this, written directions were often just as important as maps. Even today, some maps, like those for train systems, do not always show true directions. In the past, important landmarks along a route were marked by signs that varied in size to show their importance.
The way maps are made has changed a lot over time. Cartography, the study of making maps, has improved in how accurately it shows distance and direction. Other sciences have helped in this process. For example, instead of using shadows or stars to find direction, people started using compasses and tools to measure angles accurately.
As explorers learned more about the world, they tried to create better maps. Astronomers found out that the earth is not a perfect sphere, which helped improve large area maps. The needs of map users also changed. Soldiers, especially after the invention of cannons, needed accurate maps to understand the land better. This led to the creation of contour maps.
Other people, like archaeologists and historians, also needed maps for their work. Today, cartographers create maps for many different purposes, including geology and land use. The importance of maps in many sciences has led to a new interest in cartography.
It is important to understand that the development of maps has not always been smooth. There have been times when progress slowed down, and old ideas stayed alongside new ones. Cartographers have often had good ideas but had to wait for better tools to use them. Since it is easy to copy old maps, many map publishers have been slow to accept new ideas. Therefore, we should not always trust maps as the best evidence of current knowledge and techniques.
The many maps we have today are the result of a lot of human effort and thought. They are valuable records for studying human history. This is what makes the study of historical cartography interesting and important."

**Tim Rice**
I was taken into a young man's living room. It was a nice and calm place, very different from the messy rooms where the other family members were. Moving from the kitchen to his room felt like going from economy to business class. This room had the biggest collection of records I had ever seen, the first stereo record player I had come across, and it was surprising to see a teenager who had bought nice wine glasses, pictures, and furniture. His name was Andrew Lloyd Webber. He had a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford, to study history, and he had nine months before starting school. During this time, he wanted to become a famous composer like Richard Rodgers.
I also had big dreams. I wanted to be a pop star for the usual reasons: women, money, and fame. But my dreams were not as important to me as Andrew's were to him. When Andrew suggested that I try to become a famous lyricist like Oscar Hammerstein, I was happy to give it a try. This was partly because, within ten minutes of meeting him, he played me three of his own songs on the piano. I could tell he was very talented. As he played more songs from the shows he had written at school, I remembered some of the best albums from my parents' collection.
He needed a new lyricist for his music. I didn’t have much to show him, except for my praise for his music and a single I had written with a pop group that had not done well. We said we would meet again and write something together. I was still more interested in pop music than in theatre, but on the bus back to my flat, I thought I had met someone special who would be very successful in musical theatre.
Even if we didn’t become famous composers, we could try to write songs for popular bands like the Beatles and Rolling Stones later. The Everly Brothers had just made a comeback and would need new songs. The next day, back at my office where I was training to be a lawyer, I felt less sure about my future in show business with Andrew. I would still look for ads in Melody Maker for groups needing a singer and write more simple songs. But it was likely that I would finish my exams and become a lawyer by the time I was twenty-five. My father thought I would stop enjoying pop music by the time I was twenty-one, which worried me. I felt I had only a few months left to enjoy it.
But I thought it would be fun to see Andrew again. We could go to a musical together and write lyrics for musicals instead of pop songs. Andrew was an interesting person who talked about good food and old buildings, and he supported Leyton Orient football team. I wasn’t sure about the musical idea he had been working on for a year, but in 1965, I often doubted things. His talent was clear, and he said he had many important contacts.
I went back to his living room. The idea was about Dr. Thomas Barnardo, a man from the 19th century who started orphanages. His story was important, but it didn’t excite me. The hero seemed too perfect, and the idea felt unoriginal, similar to the popular show, Oliver. However, Andrew was very confident about his music, and his excitement was contagious. I didn’t know much about musicals, but I thought there could be room for more than one musical.
I started working with a lot of enthusiasm, especially for the funny songs. Andrew explained the story, played me the tunes, and often gave me the titles, which were probably thought up by his friend from school. I even skipped a day at the law office, pretending to be sick, to write my first lyrics for the musical. I didn’t know it then, but I was changing my career."

**Language**  
You and I are part of a species that can communicate in a special way. Language is very important in our lives, and it is hard to imagine life without it. When people are together, they usually talk to each other. If there is no one to talk to, people often talk to themselves, their pets, or even their plants. I think of language as an 'instinct.' This means that people know how to talk, just like spiders know how to make webs. Spiders do not need to learn how to spin webs; they just do it naturally.
**Climate and Weather**  
Climate and weather, which are created by the air around us, greatly affect animals and plants. Climate can change how landscapes look. For example, warm and wet weather all year allows tropical jungles to grow, which have many different types of plants and animals. In contrast, cold and windy areas have fewer living things. Daily weather changes, which together create the climate, happen because of large air movements. The air moves because the Earth spins, and the sun also causes a lot of this movement.
**Coffee**  
As a barista, my job included serving drinks, but I was also responsible for making coffee. In Lygon Street, Melbourne, a restaurant's success can depend on how good its coffee is. I spent several days learning how to make coffee and how to clean the espresso machine. I learned the important steps to make a great cappuccino. By the end of the first week, I realized that making good coffee was harder than it seemed, and I thought I might have to go back to cleaning ashtrays. Fortunately, my boss was patient. He told me, ""Making coffee is both an art and a science, and you need time to learn it."""
CPE_41,C2,"**Art on TV**
Why does television often have problems with programs about visual arts? Painting and sculpture are good subjects for the camera because it can show the whole artwork and then zoom in to see the details. However, there are not many TV series that show the joy and complexity of looking at art. A good example of this is Robert Hughes's series called *American Visions*. Hughes is a trusted critic with a strong personality, and he had almost eight hours to introduce British viewers to American art, which is often ignored in British galleries. I thought the series would focus on great artworks, but instead, it looked at how American history and culture are shown in its art and buildings.
**Dealing in Metals**
For 20 years, I worked as an international metals dealer and became known as a speculator. The metals market is not as regulated as other markets. With some luck, a willingness to take risks, and a good understanding of the market, it is possible to make a lot of money. Taking risks is part of this industry. This adventurous culture fits well with a free-market global economy. However, the free-trade economists who believed that the market would keep the prices of rare metals high have found that the opposite is true. More minerals are being mined, and the cost of raw materials is going down. When considering inflation, the prices of most metals are about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to investigate claims against a large company that benefits from these cheap raw materials.
**Extract from a Holiday Brochure**
Abaco and its nearby cays are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas, which stretch from Florida to Cuba. Each island has its own character and something special to offer. To get around the islands and cays of Abaco, you need a boat. If a boat is not included with your room, don’t worry. There are many ferries and water taxis available. You can also rent boats if you want to explore on your own. Sailing is the most popular way to travel here. Abaco is called 'The Sailing Capital of the World' for good reasons. The calm, protected waters are perfect for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The cays and their beaches stretch for 200 miles like a string of pearls. At night, the lights of the restaurants and cafes in Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay shine brightly."
CPE_69,C2,"Build Your Own Bamboo Bike in the UK**
You can build your own bamboo bike at the Bamboo Bike Club, the first workshop of its kind in the UK. This course is run by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan. When you join, you get a custom bike frame designed by a computer and a fun weekend of bike-building.
It is Saturday morning in Hackney Wick, east London. The Bamboo Bike Club is busy with people working on their bikes. Bamboo is becoming popular for making bikes. Companies like Calfee Design from California and Bamboo Bikes from Yorkshire have been making bamboo bikes since 1894. However, many cyclists find these bikes too expensive. A ready-made bamboo frame can cost around $2,995 or £1,868.
James and Ian wanted to create a bamboo bike business that everyone could afford. They spent years working in a shed in Brecon, Wales, to develop their idea. They realized they did not just want to sell bike frames; they wanted to help people enjoy making something special and sustainable. So, the Bamboo Bike Club was born. James works on wind turbines, and Ian is a civil engineer, but they run the club in their free time.
The club offers monthly courses where you can build your own bike. The price includes a custom bike frame and a fun weekend. On the first day, James and Ian teach you how to choose strong bamboo and how to make strong joints. You start by building the front triangle of the bike with thick bamboo, and then you add thinner pieces for the seat and chain. Some metal parts are used for the handlebars and wheels because they need to be strong.
James and Ian help everyone during the building process. They check every cut and joint to make sure everything is correct. If someone has trouble, they step in to help. Many people in the course are engineers, but Ian says that everyone makes mistakes sometimes. If you mess up, you can just try again with a new piece of bamboo.
On Sunday, you spend time building the lugs, which are the parts that connect the bike frame. You wrap the joints with hemp and glue them to make them strong. After adding a waterproof coating, your bike is ready for wheels, brakes, and other personal touches. James and Ian say their bamboo bikes are just as strong as metal bikes. Ian has been riding his bike for over a year, and James has tested his bike off-road for three months without breaking it.
The bamboo bikes may not look as polished as metal bikes, but they are unique. James and Ian believe that the special look of bamboo is part of the charm. I think bamboo bikes are great for relaxed rides rather than racing. I choose a 'Classic English' frame for a comfortable ride. When I try James's bike, it feels light and smooth, even on bumpy roads.
James says that the best part of the workshop is when you ride the bike. They are light and fun to ride. The price for building your own bamboo bike is less than £500."

**Self-help Books**  
Diane Reverend was an editor at Random House in New York when she first saw a book by a new pop psychologist, Dr. John Gray. She thought the title was great and believed it would be a bestseller, and she was right. Dr. Gray became very successful, and Diane started her own company. Dr. Gray's book helps people understand each other better in relationships and is very popular in the self-help industry. This industry tries to meet people's desires for improvement in their lives. However, it also creates many new desires and supports the publishing industry in New York. In Britain, people are seeing that many self-help books can be strange and exaggerated, but there are even worse ones. For every self-help book published, many others are rejected because they are too similar or too specific. This is a good thing. Editors are now looking for the next big hit, and they care more about how marketable a book is than its writing style. Diane says that if someone has a catchy title, it makes it easier to attract readers.
**Autobiographies**  
When someone writes an autobiography, there is an unspoken agreement that they will tell the truth. However, this agreement is often not fully kept. Writers may leave out things they feel are too shameful or not important. Sometimes, they might invent stories that express the truth better than just sticking to the facts. They might even call their book an autobiography just to make readers believe it is true, even if it is mostly fiction. This can happen without any bad intentions.
**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**  
People who study detective stories say that this genre reflects the problems of society in the late 1800s and early 1900s. A detective story often shows a crime that represents human desires like greed or lust. Solving the crime helps bring society back to order. In Hammett's stories, society is shown to be corrupt. The detective and the criminal are two sides of the same person. The detective understands the criminal, and they have a strange connection. The detective is seen as too honest by criminals and too shady by the law. His job is complicated because he feels connected to both sides.
**Science Writing**  
Stephen Jay Gould is a well-known science writer. I met him at the Grand Hotel while he was promoting his new book. We both felt out of place there. Gould said he could not write well in such a fancy place because understanding the culture is important for a writer. Science is its own world, and only scientists can explain it well. If you don’t know the community and its rules, you will struggle. Gould believes that writers should not talk down to their readers. He says, ""You can make the language easier, but you must keep the ideas strong. If readers feel you are treating them like they are less smart, they will not enjoy your writing."""
CPE_17,C2,"**Air-conditioning**
At Cannons Gym, a popular place for City of London workers during lunch, it is very cold inside. To handle the high temperatures this summer, the gym has used a lot of air-conditioning. Sometimes, when it is quiet, the gym feels like the Arctic. This shows how we often misuse air-conditioning today. It is now a common part of our work and leisure, showing how we try to control the climate. However, many buildings with air-conditioning could use other ways to stay cool. They could use natural light and fresh air, and have thicker walls that keep heat out during the day and let it go at night. These ideas may seem simple, but they can really help and would reduce the need for air-conditioning.
**Sundials**
It is interesting that as we start a new millennium, more people are interested in sundials. Sundials are tools that tell time by using the sun's position. A hundred years ago, they were very important for keeping time. But as clocks and watches became better, sundials were mostly seen as garden decorations. Now, they are being taken seriously again. David Harber, who makes sundials, thinks people like them because they connect us to the planets. He says there is a special moment when a sundial starts to work. They are calm and beautiful objects that remind us of our place in the universe.
**Paint Your Own China**
My idea of china-painting came from a visit to an arts and crafts show a long time ago. There, I saw serious-looking older women showing how to paint flowers on a teacup with careful brushstrokes. It was amazing to watch because each stroke created a perfect petal or leaf. Their hands were steady, and the paint never smudged. I thought these women must have practiced for many years or had a special talent. Because of this, I wondered what kind of people would join a china-painting class. Would beginners be good at it? When I attended a class, I found out that the atmosphere was friendly and fun. The students were there to enjoy themselves, and even the teacher did not want to paint like the women I had seen before."
CPE_47,C2,"The Wrong Country**
Uncle chose a package holiday for Keith and Dawne at a good price. They had a flight from Gatwick Airport and twelve nights in Venice, in a hotel called Pensione Concordia. When they went to the travel agency to book the trip, the clerk told them that the other people in their group were students from the south coast who were learning Italian. 
But something went wrong. They ended up in a hotel called the Edelweiss, in Room 212, in Switzerland. At Gatwick, they gave their tickets to a girl in a yellow-and-red uniform. She checked their tickets and said everything was fine. An hour later, they were surprised to hear older people on the plane speaking with accents from the North of England. Keith thought there might have been a cancellation or that the Italian class was on another plane. They ordered drinks and then heard a woman say, ""The coach will take us on,"" when they landed. 
There was no mention of an overnight stop in the brochure, but when the coach arrived, Keith realized that they were staying there for the night. It was close to midnight, and they were tired, so they did not question the beds they were offered. The next morning, they found out they were supposed to stay there for their whole holiday, and they became worried. 
The receptionist smiled and said, ""We have the lake and the water birds. You can take a boat to Interlaken."" Keith calmly told him, ""There has been a mistake. We were meant to be in Venice, at the Pensione Concordia."" The receptionist did not know that hotel. 
Dawne added, ""The man who booked our trip was bald, with glasses and a moustache."" She gave the name of the travel agency in London. A woman named Mrs. Franks, who was with a man with a bad leg, came over and smiled at Keith. She said, ""I noticed you at Gatwick."" 
Keith explained, ""We got into the wrong group. We reported to the Your-Kind-of-Holiday girl."" Dawne said, ""We should have known when they weren't from Dover."" Keith wished she would let him talk. 
Mrs. Franks explained that there are many different holidays that the travel agency offers. She said, ""All tickets look similar, with yellow and red labels. If you followed others with the same label, you might think you could end up anywhere!"" 
Keith insisted, ""We are not meant to be in Switzerland."" Mrs. Franks then walked away, leaving them confused. The receptionist was gone, and they could hear typing. 
Dawne whispered, ""She seems nice."" But Keith was not listening. He thought about everything that had happened: giving the tickets, waiting, and getting on the plane. An old man interrupted his thoughts, saying, ""Nice to have some young people here."" 
Keith and Dawne walked outside the hotel. They did not say anything to each other about the strange situation. This was their first holiday since their honeymoon, and they had ended up on a trip with older people when they wanted to escape from that. Uncle had said so himself when they tried to convince him to join them."
CPE_48,C2,"'HE WAS A PEOPLE PERSON'**
American business leaders are looking to the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a good example of management. Eluned Price reports.
Most people in Britain know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and what he did. However, America has only recently discovered him. The Wall Street Journal called Shackleton ""an Antarctic explorer whose achievements went mostly unnoticed for most of the 20th century,"" which is not entirely true. Now, Americans are showing great interest in him. Many books and stories about Shackleton's journey on the Endurance are being published quickly. The American Museum of Natural History is planning a big exhibition, and a film about Shackleton's life is being made.
Some American managers see Shackleton as a role model. They talk about his actions with great respect and find lessons in his leadership and communication skills. They even refer to each other as ""speaking Shackleton."" Shackleton, known for his determination and resourcefulness, has become a model for modern management consultants.
Jim MacGregor, a managing partner at Abernathy MacGregor Frank in New York, has looked up to Shackleton for many years. His firm focuses on communication during mergers, acquisitions, and crises. For example, they help companies when there are serious problems, like when a factory explodes or when many employees must be let go. MacGregor believes that even if a company handles a crisis well, it can still cause problems if it communicates poorly. He says, ""Shackleton is a model for management because of his qualities as a leader and communicator. He had strong values and was at his best when he and his team had a lot to lose, like their lives.""
One of Shackleton's most interesting decisions was to turn back when he was only 97 miles from the South Pole. This choice showed his credibility for the next journey: the safety of his men was the most important thing. In a crisis, people want to know who is in charge. While many managers today avoid responsibility, Shackleton was willing to take charge.
His 1914 expedition became legendary. His ship, the Endurance, was trapped in ice for nine months and eventually sank. When the ship went down, Shackleton told his men, ""We should all reach safety if you do your best and trust me."" From the diaries kept during the journey, it is clear that Shackleton was always in control. MacGregor says, ""Shackleton thought everything through, planned for every situation, kept his men informed, and asked for their opinions. He was flexible and ready to change plans if needed.""
Shackleton believed that an explorer needs optimism, strength, and patience. MacGregor adds, ""One of the hardest things to do in tough times is to wait, especially in America, where people want quick solutions. If you invest money and make a mistake, it is better to wait and get your money back than to sell and lose a lot. Also, don't be afraid to change your plans if they are not working.""
Shackleton led by example. On the way back from the Endurance, he saw Hurley, the expedition photographer, without gloves. He gave Hurley his own gloves, saying he would throw them overboard if Hurley did not wear them. Someone else remembered Shackleton doing something similar with a biscuit when they were very hungry on a previous expedition. He said he would leave the biscuit in the snow because it was so valuable.
As Caroline Alexander, the author of ""Endurance,"" says: ""People are increasingly interested in heroic efforts. Shackleton shows that there is not much heroism today. He stands out as a true example of the ideals we long for now."""
CAE_15,C1,"'Finding Food in Madagascar'**
In the forests of Madagascar, there is a special animal called the aye-aye. This animal has a way of finding food that is similar to how a woodpecker does. Both the aye-aye and the woodpecker look for insects inside wood. The woodpecker uses its beak to make holes in the wood and its long tongue to get the insects out. The aye-aye, however, uses its sharp front teeth to chew into the wood and its long third finger to reach inside and get the insects.
Scientists have studied the aye-aye's feeding habits for many years. Dr. Carl Erickson from Duke University has been watching two male aye-ayes named Nosferatu and Poe, and a female named Samantha with her baby, Annabelle. He wanted to find out how they find insects hidden in the wood. 
Dr. Erickson first checked if the aye-ayes could see signs of insects, like holes in the wood where insects might have laid eggs. He gave them logs with holes he had made. Some holes had mealworms inside, while others were empty. The aye-ayes went straight to the logs with food, showing that they did not need to see the holes to find the mealworms. 
Dr. Erickson thought the aye-ayes might be using their sense of smell or hearing to find the insects. However, he found that they could still find food even when the smell was blocked or when the mealworms were dead and silent. This made him wonder how they were able to locate the insects.
He discovered that the aye-ayes could feel the empty spaces inside the wood. When looking for food, an aye-aye taps the wood with its long middle finger and listens carefully with its big ears. Dr. Erickson believes that the aye-aye is using a method called echo-location, where it listens for sounds that tell it there is a hollow space in the wood. It can also hear insects moving when they are disturbed.
Some scientists think that the aye-aye might take the place of woodpeckers in Madagascar, but there are also birds like the Sickle-billed and Nuthatch Vangas that look for insects in wood. So, the woodpecker role may not be empty. 
The aye-aye is not only like a woodpecker but also like a bat that uses echo-location. It also behaves like a squirrel. Its front teeth keep growing, just like a squirrel's, and it has been seen in the wild chewing through nuts and using its long finger to get the nut meat out."
CAE_19,C1,"'Ordinary People, Ordinary Lives'**
Many of us have pictures of our grandparents, but how many of us really know what their lives were like when they were young? Sometimes, we can learn a little from old diaries or family stories, but these are often not enough. And what will our grandchildren know about us? We often plan to write down our stories, but we don’t always do it. We might leave videos instead of photos, but videos can only show a part of our lives.
Hannah Renier has found a solution. She writes autobiographies for other people, creating a book of at least 20,000 words, with pictures if needed. She focuses on the lives of ordinary people, not famous ones. The idea started when she spoke to her family and realized that many stories from the past were being forgotten. 
""When I began, I didn’t take it as seriously as I do now,"" she says. ""I have met many people who have interesting stories to tell. They often say they are doing it for their children or for future generations, but they enjoy the process too.""
People feel safe to share their stories with her because she keeps everything private. A 62-year-old man who shared his life story said, ""I felt free to be honest. I talked about painful things, like my divorce."" He wanted to share his experiences with his family, but he hasn’t let his children read it yet because he thinks some details might hurt them. He believes it might be better for them to read it after he is gone.
Hannah has noticed that many people are influenced by their parents throughout their lives. ""It’s surprising how much childhood experiences affect adults,"" she says. ""People often repeat the same patterns in their lives, whether they marry someone their parents liked or choose a partner to rebel against their parents.""
Many people still feel regret about things that happened long ago. Even after many years, they may still struggle with issues from their childhood. They often try to impress parents who were never satisfied, and some even want to express their dislike for their parents.
Hannah listens carefully and does not push people to share more than they want. ""I’m not here to judge or be nosy,"" she explains. ""Sometimes people tell me something and then worry if it should be included. I usually keep it in, but they can change it later if they want.""
Her work is not about showing off interesting lives. She believes that as life moves quickly, we are losing touch with our past. Writing these stories helps people connect with their roots and understand their family history. 
Each book is created from about 30 hours of recorded interviews, which Hannah uses to write the life story. She organizes the information and writes it well. The final book looks professional and costs nearly £3,000, with extra copies available for £25 each. Although she gets about 10 inquiries a week, the price stops many people from using her service. 
""I thought more people would want this service,"" she says. ""But most of my clients are from wealthy backgrounds, who are used to preserving their family history."""

The collection has over 400,000 air photographs taken by university staff over the last 45 years. The university has its own aircraft at Cambridge Airport and takes photographs all over Great Britain. These photographs are interesting because they show the landscape year by year, including the natural environment and how humans have changed it from prehistoric times to now. There is a small display in the entrance hall, and the library staff can help with questions. The photographs cannot be borrowed, but you can usually buy copies, which take about a month to prepare.
**E. Cambridge Medieval Brass Rubbing Centre**  
The Cambridge Brass Rubbing Centre is the second oldest and longest-running center of its kind in the world. It is a unique tourist attraction where you can enjoy making wall hangings by rubbing over one of more than a hundred different brass plates from the tombs of medieval knights and ladies. The center creates resin copies, called facsimiles, to protect the original plates while allowing everyone to enjoy brass rubbing. These brass plates were used as memorials and spread from Germany to medieval Europe and Scandinavia. Many beautiful brass plates were destroyed during various revolutions, but most of the remaining ones are in Britain, and you can see the largest variety at the Cambridge Centre."
CAE_13,C1,"**From Here to Fatherhood**
**A. The Theatre Director**  
I have had a strange personal life, but I have enjoyed 35 years with small children. I loved feeding my baby this morning, and that is what being a father means to me. I feel very lucky with my children. We all enjoy the same things: opera, theatre, books, and music. This has created a strong bond between us, especially now that they are mostly grown up and I feel more like a friend than a father. I do not believe in hitting children. I have slapped my kids when I was angry, but I do not think it is right. I may not have been the most attentive father, but I have always tried to be there for them. I wait for them to call me instead of chasing them for contact, as I do not want to make them feel guilty.
**B. The Advertising Executive**  
I was young when my children were born, around 25 years old. I found the responsibilities hard at first, but they also kept me feeling young. As my kids became teenagers, they introduced me to music, youth culture, and fashion, which helped me in my job. I missed some important events like their first concerts and sports days because I was busy starting my business. I feel sad about that, but now I can take them on holidays to nice places like the south of France. They get along well with my friends and come to parties and work events without feeling nervous. I think it helps that my job is seen as interesting.
**C. The Politician**  
My first child was born just before I was elected to the Greater London Council, and I had more children soon after. My wife and I promised to spend time with them, but my political work has made it hard to find time. I only accept weekend meetings and events where my kids can come with me. This way, they can see what I do when I am not with them, and they do not feel like I am disappearing. I have noticed that more politicians are bringing their kids to work, which shows we are becoming more aware of including our children in our lives.
**D. The Writer**  
My first marriage ended when my daughters, Kate and Bonnie, were young, so I had to think more about being a father. I worked hard to stay close to my children. My ex-wife and I even tried living next to each other for a while, so they could visit easily, but I think it confused them. Kate has said I was always there for her, but I am not sure I was a good father. I was around a lot, but I treated my kids like adults too soon. Kate recently said we were too relaxed with rules. I wish I had set more structure for them. I still worry about my older daughters just as much as my youngest. In that way, your children always stay with you.
**E. The TV Presenter**  
I was ready to have kids when I turned 30. I met my wife, and we had a nice home, so we thought, ""Why not have a child instead of just buying new things?"" Having my daughter, Betty, has helped me understand who I am. It feels special to have a child, but it also makes you just one of many parents. Sometimes I feel frustrated, but just one smile from her makes everything better. A baby's smile is the best way to feel happy again."

CAE_46,C1,"'Science and Weightlessness'**
Journalist Tom Mumford joins students who are testing their ideas in weightlessness. The aircraft looked normal from the outside. The pilot told the 13 students from Europe and America that it was built in 1964 and was a Boeing KC-135 refuelling tanker, based on the Boeing 707. But inside, it was very different. The inside was a long white tunnel with few windows and bright lights on the padded walls. Most of the seats were removed, except for a few at the back where the nervous students sat.
For a year, these students had competed to join this flight, which was offered by the European Space Agency. They had to suggest creative experiments to do in weightlessness. The best ideas won a place on this special flight, which was like a thrilling roller-coaster ride. For the next two hours, the Boeing would fly up and down, creating moments of weightlessness. 
When the pilot cut the engines at 3,000 meters, the aircraft would go higher for a moment before falling back down. During the few seconds of weightlessness, the students would feel like they were closer to the moon than to the Earth. The flight started smoothly, but soon the pilot put the plane into a steep climb for about 20 seconds. The engines roared, and we felt the pressure in our heads. Then, the engines stopped, and we experienced weightlessness almost immediately. 
For 20 seconds, we floated in silence. The floor felt like a trampoline, and just one step could send us flying to the ceiling. We floated around, and directions like left or right didn’t make sense anymore. After ten seconds of falling, the pilot pulled the plane up. Gravity returned, but it was not as sudden as before, and some students landed hard.
After the first curve, some students felt sick thinking about the 29 more to come. The flight included thirty curves, giving the students ten minutes of 'space time' for their experiments. The Dutch students studied their robotic cat, Leonardo, to see how cats always land on their feet. They released a device to test this, and one student managed to turn it over using a remote control. 
Another team from Germany looked at how metal joints are affected by weightlessness, which could help build future space stations. A group from Utah State University tried to create solar sails from thin liquid films that harden in sunlight. They believe that if they succeed, satellites could use solar sails like yachts use wind.
After two hours of flying, the students felt excited rather than sick. One student said, ""It was an unforgettable experience. I wanted to be an astronaut before, but now I want it even more."""

**With the Trees, I Planted My Stake in New Zealand**  
**JONATHON PORRITT TALKS TO DANNY DANZIGER**
Jonathon Porritt is the author of *Seeing Green - The Politics of Ecology*. 
I had a strange time in my life when I didn’t have any summers. I went to New Zealand every summer, which is actually winter there. So, I had nine winters in a row, which was great because I like winter. My parents had the idea to buy a small piece of land for my brother, sister, and me to take care of. My mother said, “If you can plant trees on it, then you can have it.” The idea was that we would always have a connection to New Zealand, which is nice because my father grew up there. They found a piece of land about 20 miles north of Auckland in a place called Rangitoupuni. The land was not very good, but it was good for planting trees. I have always loved land. I spent a year in Australia working on farms, so the idea of planting trees excited me. I think my family became more interested as we went along. 
I started planting in 1968, and by the end of 1972, we had planted the whole 70 acres. In New Zealand in 1968, it rained a lot during that winter. It is funny to think of it as a happy time because it rained almost every day we were planting. I don’t think I have ever been so wet and cold for such a long time. Every morning was a challenge: getting ready to plant again. I would come out of the Land Rover warm and dry, but then the rain would start, and I would feel cold and wet. 
In that first year, I had a helper who was an experienced tree-planter, which was very helpful because I had never planted trees seriously before. You wear a planting bag around your neck and fill it with as many trees as you can. When the bag is full, it is heavy, but it gets easier when it is lighter. The hardest part was getting the lines straight for planting. You decide how far apart to plant the trees and then use three poles to make a straight line. Once you are in line, you plant all the way down and then come back. 
I enjoy hard work, and it made me fit. After a while, you can plant trees almost automatically. You get used to a rhythm and use the least number of movements to dig the hole. This rhythm is important in many farming jobs. You learn to take the tree out of the bag, dig a hole, put it in the ground, stamp it down, and move on. 
Mentally, it was interesting. My mind started to think about many things, including nature and our place in it. These thoughts have influenced my life since then. I have been back to New Zealand four times and watched the trees grow, which is very satisfying because I planted them. I always worry when I read news about strong winds or droughts in New Zealand. Such news makes me feel anxious. However, everything worked out well, and those trees are now 20 years old and healthy. 
I should add that I took a break from teaching and went back in 1984 for three months by myself. I wrote my first book there, *Seeing Green*. There is a simple cabin on the tree farm with just a bed, a table, and a chair. In the mornings, I wrote; in the afternoons, I pruned the trees; and in the evenings, I did research. My connection to that area is still very strong. It is the place I feel most connected to in terms of the bond between people and the earth."
CAE_10,C1,"'CARING FOR BADGER CUBS'**
""What now?"" was my first thought when one of my helpers brought a cardboard box to me. My husband Derek and I have run an open farm in Somerset for six years, where we take care of orphaned animals. But the noise from the box—a mix of a cackle and a bark—was strange to me. I looked inside and saw three small grey badger cubs, each about eight inches long. Their soft coats were like velvet, and their milky eyes looked up at me from their black-and-white striped heads. I had never seen badger cubs before. Most badger cubs are born between January and March and live underground. If they lose their mother, they often die from hunger. 
These three cubs were found by builders who accidentally disturbed their home while working. Their mother was dead, but the cubs were still alive. I could see they were healthy but cold and whimpering. After removing fleas from them, I took them into the kitchen to warm them by the stove. There were two females named Primrose and Bluebell, and a male named Willow. At first, I fed them with a syringe, but I had to wipe them with a warm cloth first to make them feel like their mother was licking them. This helped them go to the bathroom. For the first few days, I fed them every four hours. After a week, they learned to drink from a bottle and started to move around, although a bit unsteady. They were happy together with a heated pad to keep them warm.
Three weeks later, I noticed that Willow seemed tired, but he was still eating. This was a warning sign. I should have acted quickly, but I didn’t realize how serious it was. The next morning, I found him dead. The vet said he died from a lung infection. When feeding animals with a bottle, it is important not to let them drink too fast, or the liquid can go into their lungs. In Willow's case, this caused an infection that was hard to treat because he was so small. I felt sad about losing him, but I continued to care for the other two cubs.
Then, a local farmer came to see me. He had found another male cub, abandoned by its mother. He knew she would not return, and the cub was cold and hungry. I named him Willow II. He was about two weeks younger than the females. Feeding him was very difficult. I had to keep moving the bottle and squeezing it to get him to drink. After ten minutes, he would finally latch on as if he hadn’t eaten all day. By the end of April, the females were eating creamed rice and anything else I offered. Willow II was happy to stop using the bottle, but he had trouble eating without making a mess. Eventually, I gave him a sausage, which he slowly learned to eat.
At nearly five months old, they were all eating cereals for breakfast, meat and vegetables for lunch, and fruit, nuts, cheese, hard-boiled eggs, and sunflower seeds in the evening. Badgers usually eat 60% earthworms, plus beetles, baby rabbits, mice, and plants. My badgers were better off than others that year because it was very hot, and finding food was hard.
By August, my badgers started to be active at night. We often walked through the orchard, and they would chase each other and play. I learned to avoid their playful nips, but Derek sometimes got caught and ended up with bruises. During these walks, I saw other badgers in our field. They were looking for food because their own areas were disturbed. We were warned that they might come into our badger pen and harm the cubs, so we put metal over the gate to keep them out.
The local press took pictures of me walking the badgers, and many people wanted to help build a home for them on our farm. With advice from others, we designed a new home for the badgers. Our son Daniel drew the plans, and we built a sett with tunnels and a special gate. It had three rooms, one larger than the others, with a glass side so people could see inside. As we built it, the badgers explored the new home before going on their walks. Soon, they were more interested in the tunnels than in walking.
The building cost more than we expected, but a local bus company helped pay for it, and local businesses donated materials. Everyone wanted to see the badgers have a home. One evening, they finally moved in. After watching them for a while, we left them to settle. Half an hour later, I checked on them and saw three badgers curled up and sleeping.
Now, I don’t walk with them as often because they don’t wake up until midnight. We see Primrose only sometimes because she has joined another sett, but Bluebell and Willow II still come to say hello before running off into the night. This is their home now, and they have made it their own."
CAE_67,C1,"In Search of True North - The Man Behind Halley's Comet**
Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, wants to follow the journey of Sir Edmund Halley, who studied compass variations. Anjana Ahuja reports.
Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is famous for the comet named after him. However, one of his important achievements was to study the ""variations of the compass"" during his sea voyages on the warship Paramore. These variations are now called ""declination,"" which is the angle between magnetic north and true north. Sailors needed to know this to correct their compasses and navigate the oceans accurately.
Halley was one of only two men in England at that time who were paid to do scientific research. He set out for the Cape Verde Islands to study declination in the North and South Atlantic, but his first trip ended early because of problems with the crew. He tried again and traveled to Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, Newfoundland, and back to England. From this journey, Halley published a map in 1701 showing the compass variations in the Western and Southern Oceans. This map helped sailors for over a hundred years until changes in the Earth's magnetic field made it less accurate.
Dr. Clark wants to celebrate the 300th anniversary of Halley's journey by retracing the route of the Paramore. He needs to raise £70,000 before he can start, and Sir Vivian Fuchs, who led the first expedition across Antarctica, is helping him.
Dr. Clark became interested in Halley while he was at Halley Station in Antarctica, where he read about Halley's life. ""Halley had an amazing life,"" Dr. Clark says. ""He was a respected scientist and led many expeditions. He was not only an astronomer but also studied geophysics. While he was Astronomer Royal, he mapped the stars and worked on other projects.""
During this time, Halley created a diving bell and helped Sir Isaac Newton with his famous book, Principia Mathematica, which is important in physics. Dr. Clark believes that retracing Halley's journey will give him the recognition he deserves. His expedition, called ""In the Wake of the Paramore,"" will also have scientific value. They will take measurements like Halley did, but with better tools. These measurements are important because the Earth's magnetic field is always changing.
Dr. Clark explains, ""We usually measure the size of the magnetic field, but not its direction. To measure direction, we need to know true north."" On this expedition, they will use satellites to find true north. The British Geological Survey and the United States Navy will provide instruments for the trip. A Danish satellite will also be taking similar measurements, and Dr. Clark hopes his data will help fill in any gaps in the satellite's coverage of the Atlantic Ocean.
Halley's journey was significant because it was the first scientific expedition at sea, and he was the first civilian to be appointed as a naval captain for this purpose. 
Does Dr. Clark have what it takes to succeed in his journey? He has spent two years in Antarctica and worked in the geomagnetic group at the British Geological Survey. He has also sailed the 13,000 kilometers from Rio de Janeiro to England. He plans to complete the expedition in four stages with different crews.
Does he share Halley's passion? ""I am ready to give up eight months of my life for this, so some might say I'm obsessed. But I wouldn’t want to sail across the Atlantic again without a good reason. Halley and his interesting life have given me a real sense of purpose."""

**POWER DRESSING**
Every summer, the peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show off their beautiful tail feathers to the hens. This behavior makes us think about a question that Charles Darwin wondered about: how can birds have such fancy features in a world where survival is tough? How do they manage to do this?
Zoologist Marion Petrie and her team from the Open University are studying the peacocks at Whipsnade to find answers, more than 100 years after Darwin's death. Darwin believed that living things change over time through evolution, not by special creation. He thought that the strongest and best-adapted individuals survive and have babies. However, he also thought that being the ""fittest"" usually means being tough or smart. In contrast, the peacock's tail seems to be a burden rather than an advantage. So, Darwin suggested another idea called ""sexual selection,"" which means that females choose males based on their beauty.
Darwin's friend, Alfred Russel Wallace, had a different view. He believed that if peahens liked the males with the most beautiful tails, it must mean those males had some other important quality that helped them survive. So, the tail was not just for show; it was a sign of something valuable.
Today, scientists still debate this topic. Studying peafowl behavior is not easy, but the 200 birds at Whipsnade, which live like wild birds but are used to people, provide a good chance for research. Marion Petrie and her team have two main questions: Do peahens really prefer the males with the most beautiful tails? And do these males have other advantages, or is it just about looks?
The adult male peacocks show off in groups, and the hens compare them. Long observations and photographs suggest that the hens do prefer the males with the most eye spots on their tails. The more eye spots a tail has, the more mates the male attracts. However, it is still unclear if these attractive males are better in other ways.
William Hamilton from Oxford University has a theory that showy male birds are usually free from parasites, and their beautiful feathers show that they are healthy. There is some evidence for this in other bird species. However, Dr. Petrie and her team have not yet been able to check for parasites in the Whipsnade peacocks.
This year, Dr. Petrie is comparing the young of attractive males with those of less attractive males. Do the offspring of the attractive males grow faster? Are they healthier? If they are, it would support Wallace's idea that females choose males for practical reasons.
There is also an interesting idea from mathematician and biologist R A Fisher. He suggested that if a female chooses a male with a slightly better tail, her sons will inherit that tail, and her daughters will prefer long tails. This could lead to a situation where males with the longest tails have the most mates, and the preference for long tails continues to grow. Modern computer models show that this could explain how peacocks developed their impressive tails. Interestingly, this would also support Darwin's idea that females might eventually choose males just for their beauty."
CAE_66,C1,"**THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS**
Tom Cunliffe believes that the best boat design should mix old and new ideas. He showed this with his own boat, 'The Westerman'. This week, the Summer Boat Show in London is full of beautiful yachts with new technology. Most of these boats come from a big change in boat design that happened 25 years ago. In contrast, my boat is quietly resting in a tidal creek on the south coast. It was designed last year, but when you see it, you might think it is 100 years old. You might also think that I am a romantic person. Maybe I am, but I’m not sure.
My boat uses the best parts of old boat design, but modern technology has made it easier to build. However, even though technology is important in boat design, it often keeps sailors away from the real challenges of life at sea. These challenges are often what sailors want to experience when they go to sea. I don’t think sailors should go back to suffering through every difficulty. I believe it is important for my boats to have a coal stove for warmth and comfortable places to sleep. But why go sailing if every sail works by itself? Dealing with sails that flap in the wind is part of being a sailor.
Also, why should we change the steering position from a safe place at the back of the boat to a less safe spot in the middle? This change makes the inside of the boat feel like a big house, with a bed bigger than the one at home. For me, a boat should be a boat, not a house on the water.
When I bought my first boat, Hirta, to sail around Britain for a TV race, the previous owner said it had all the comforts but no luxury. During my time with Hirta, I learned how true this was. She had heavy sails, no running water, no electricity, no fridge, no central heating, no winches, and no electronics for navigation. Yet, she was the easiest boat I have ever sailed.
However, classic boats like Hirta need a lot of care. When I hurt my back, I realized I could not keep her anymore. I looked for a younger boat but could not find one, so I decided to build a new boat from scratch. The Westerman has never let me down. Although the designer, Nigel Irens, and his assistant, Ed Burnett, use computer programs, Irens first drew this boat on a paper napkin and then moved his ideas to the computer. After creating a model, we worked together to improve the design. The final version was perfect.
The completed boat has crossed the North Atlantic and won four out of her first six races. She looks timeless, moves beautifully in the sea, and has a peaceful atmosphere inside, much of it made from reclaimed pitch pine. This is because she was designed only as a sailing boat, without thinking about furniture. This is the best way to design a boat. In her calmness, she shows that you don’t need to follow trends to be happy, and sometimes it is good to learn from the past. Made from wood treated with special glue, she does not take in water. So, she has the advantages of a fiberglass boat but looks, feels, and sails like a real boat."
CAE_44,C1,"**RETREAT, RELAX, RECHARGE**
Health farms and country house hotels with spa facilities are becoming very popular. We asked five journalists to visit some of these places.
**A. HENLOW GRANGE**  
I was happy to go to Henlow Grange for six days because I was tired and needed to relax. My room in the big 18th-century house was very comfortable, and I felt calm right away. On the first day, I did nothing and slept a lot. From the second day, I started to join classes like yoga and body conditioning. The instructors were very skilled. I was surprised at how flexible I became during the week. They offer many treatments, including aromatherapy, seaweed baths, manicures, and pedicures. The facial treatment, which lasts an hour, made me feel like a new person. The staff were very friendly and professional. The atmosphere was full of energy and enthusiasm. Henlow is planning to make some big changes this year, including a new swimming pool and a Light Diet Room. You can also ride bicycles around the grounds. If you want to relax, you can read a magazine or take a peaceful walk in the garden. During my stay, I felt happier and had a better appetite. I left feeling wonderful and full of energy. I would love to visit again. This is a perfect place for busy women. Save Room 5 for me!

**B. SHRUBLAND HALL**  
The calm and relaxing feeling of this stately home was clear as soon as I walked into the reception area. The Hall has a beautifully decorated library, a lovely conservatory, and lots of space, so you can be alone if you want. When you arrive, everyone gets a medical check-up, which includes checking your weight and blood pressure. They called us patients, which felt strange because I am healthy. However, I was impressed that they quickly helped me with a shoulder problem found during the check-up. Each patient follows a specific diet. I lost weight without starving, but I was still hungry and got a headache on the second day. My daily menu included grapefruit and honey for breakfast, salads for lunch, and a mix of fruit, yogurt, and hot broth for dinner. If you are not on a diet, you can eat in the main dining hall, where the food is tasty. You can have a massage or water therapy every other day. All extra treatments are reasonably priced.

**C. CAREYS MANOR**  
Careys is not a health farm, but it is a lovely old manor with cozy log fires and a big lounge. If you are counting calories, you might want to skip the gourmet food. The French chef makes rich sauces and delicious desserts. Luckily, the hotel has a gym and a soft-water pool, so I could exercise after enjoying the food. There is also a spa bath, steam room, sauna, and treatment rooms. A big attraction is the sports injury clinic. I got advice on an old shoulder injury. The physiotherapist suggested good posture, exercises, and massage. Careys is comfortable and luxurious, but also relaxed. If you want to explore, there is beautiful countryside around.  
*Beverly D'Silva*
**D. CLIVEDEN**  
Cliveden is a grand country home and a five-star hotel that treats guests like royalty. It offers health and beauty treatments, a gym, saunas, a swimming pool, tennis, horse riding, and more. There are beautiful walks and gardens in the 376-acre estate. Waldo's is a famous restaurant with amazing dishes. It took me a long time to read the dinner menu because there were so many choices. The meal was fantastic, especially the sticky-toffee pudding with banana ice cream. I went to bed very happy! The next morning, I spent some time in the gym to burn off some calories before my next meal. In the Pavilion, I enjoyed a facial and an aromatherapy massage. I thought about the other journalists who would write about fitness and beauty treatments. Cliveden has everything you need if you want to stay fit before enjoying a meal at Waldo's.  
*Kay Letch*
**E. SPRINGS HYDRO**  
The best and worst thing about Springs Hydro is the carrot cake. It is the best because it is the most delicious I have ever had. It is the worst because it has 360 calories, which is a lot if you want to lose weight. You have been warned! The second best thing is the wonderful aromatherapy massage. I chose relaxing oils and fell asleep twice during the massage. I had the best sleep in years. The place is modern and well-organized, with great facilities and comfortable rooms. There are many therapists and beauty rooms, so it is easy to book appointments. They offer many treatments, from manicures to deep-cleansing facials. The guests are a mix of people, including football teams, mothers and daughters, friends, and singles. I would love to take a break here every month.

CAE_22,C1,"**NATURAL TALENTS**
In the seven million years since humans separated from chimpanzees, we have not changed much. Genetically, we are still more than 98% similar to chimps. This means that the differences between humans and animals are very recent. Our ability to create art and other things we think are unique to humans comes from just a small part of our genes. 
Recent studies show that many traits once thought to be only human are also found in animals. For example, both humans and wild chimpanzees use tools. Chimpanzees use sticks to eat and as weapons, while sea otters use rocks to open clams. Monkeys also have a simple form of language, with different sounds for 'leopard', 'eagle', and 'snake'. This means that there are not many clear differences between humans and animals, except for art.
If human art comes from a special genetic ability, it is strange that our ancestors did not create art for almost seven million years. The earliest forms of art might have been wood carvings or body painting, but these materials do not last long. We only have clear evidence of human art from about 35,000 years ago, with famous cave paintings, statues, necklaces, and musical instruments.
If we believe that our recent creativity makes us different, we need to think about how our art is different from animal art. Three main differences are often mentioned: human art is not useful, it is made for enjoyment, and it is learned rather than instinctive.
First, as Oscar Wilde said, ""All art is quite useless."" This means that human art does not help us survive or pass on our genes, unlike many animal behaviors. While some human art communicates ideas, this is not the same as passing on genes. For example, birds sing to defend their territory or attract a mate, which helps them pass on their genes. So, by this idea, human art does seem different.
The second idea is that human art is made for enjoyment. We cannot ask birds if they enjoy their songs, but they mainly sing during the breeding season, so they might not be singing just for fun. Again, this makes human art seem unique.
The third idea is that human art is learned, not instinctive. Each human group has its own art styles that are learned. For example, songs in Tokyo are different from those in Paris. People can learn each other's songs. In contrast, some birds are born knowing how to sing their species' songs, even if they have never heard them before.
Human art changes quickly. For example, people can easily tell that a painting from the 20th century is different from the famous Mona Lisa. Art experts can often tell when a painting was made and who made it. However, two chimpanzees named Congo and Betsy created paintings that could confuse even experts. Congo made up to 33 paintings in one day and was upset when his pencil was taken away. They had an art show in London in 1957, and many of their paintings sold, which is something many human artists cannot do.
These chimpanzee paintings make the differences between human art and animal behavior less clear. Like human art, the chimpanzee paintings were not made for practical reasons; they were created for the enjoyment of the painter. Some might argue that human art is different because it is meant to communicate with others, while the chimpanzees did not care about sharing their art. However, some famous human art was also made for personal satisfaction, not for communication."
CAE_39,C1,"An Amazing Adventure**
The Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last unexplored places on Earth. It is also very dangerous. Charles Blackmore crossed it and lived to tell his story. There are not many big adventures left and not many heroes. In the past, children's stories were about brave explorers with sunburnt skin and narrow eyes from looking far into the distance. Today, we do not see such people in stories or in real life. Or so I thought until I met Charles Blackmore.
Blackmore's big adventure was leading a group across the Taklamakan Desert. Its name means ""once entered, you never come out,"" but local people call it the Desert of Death. He remembered the dangers and excitement of that amazing journey while sitting in his family home. The team he led had four Britons (one was a doctor), an American photographer, four Chinese experts, 30 camels, and six camel handlers. It turned out that the camel handlers had never worked with camels before; they were long-distance truck drivers. This misunderstanding could have put everyone in danger and made the trip very difficult.
This mixed group set out to cross 1,200 kilometers of the world's toughest desert, and Charles Blackmore wrote a fascinating story about their journey. At that time, he was about to leave the Army after 14 happy years. He started the expedition for fun, to find something new in his life, and to learn more about himself. ""I always thought I would spend my whole life in the Army. I was offered a promotion, but suddenly I wanted to see who I really was outside of that. It was a big risk. My wife, Tina, was very worried that I wouldn't come back because nobody had ever done that route before; we went into it without knowing what would happen. In the end, it took 59 days to cross from west to east, and the desert was very good to us.""
Anyone reading his amazing story will be surprised by the word ""good."" The team faced many hardships: sickness, extreme temperatures, severe thirst, and losing part of their water supply. ""But,"" Blackmore explains, ""when we were at our limit and the camels had not had water for seven days, we found some. We did not experience the desert's famous sandstorms. And we never felt the freezing cold that could have stopped us. That does not mean we did not face challenges all the time. The fine sand got into everything, especially our blisters and wounds. The high dunes were hard to climb for us and for the heavy camels, which often fell over onto us.""
""What pushed me on more than anything was the need to survive. We had no backup plan. Our budget and time did not allow for one. No aircraft ever flew over us. Once we got into the sandhills, we were completely alone. I knew I had the mental strength for the trip, but I was very scared about my physical ability to do it. I remember the first day — we sat at the edge of the desert, and it was so hot that it was hard to breathe. I thought, 'We have to do it now!' At that moment, I was very scared.""
If it was like that at the beginning, how did they feel at the end? ""After walking for 1,000 kilometers, you are not going to give up. You have gone through so much; you have come so far. We were very thin but also very strong despite being tired. My body was fit, and my legs were strong. I could walk over anything.""
In the middle of the book, Blackmore describes lying in the desert, looking up at a full moon, and thinking about his family. How did he feel about what they must have gone through? ""Inside me, there is someone trying to find peace. When I have doubts about myself now, I think back to the image of the desert and remember that we managed to do that together. I feel prouder of that expedition than of anything else I have done. But when I think about my life, I think of my family and the happiness we share. Compared to that, the desert does not measure up.""
Has Charles Blackmore found peace? ""I long for the challenge — for the open spaces — the excitement of it all. We were lifted by our sense of purpose. Now, I find it hard to be part of the sameness of modern life."""

Life was getting too busy for Susan Harr, so she decided to unplug her gadgets and enjoy doing things by hand. Many people love technology because it gives us useful devices that make life easier and give us more free time. However, Susan feels that we have become too dependent on technology. 
She had a bad experience with her broken word processor, which cost her a lot of money to fix. This made her think that gadgets are often not worth the trouble. She started to let some of her household gadgets break down without replacing them. This made her question what ""free time"" really means. Does it just mean we have more time to buy and use more gadgets? 
When her broken gadget started making strange noises, she decided to leave it outside. Now, she enjoys taking her time with her sewing. She feels free from noisy machines and can carry her sewing supplies anywhere. 
There are some gadgets she still finds useful, like her washing machine. But she also found joy in giving up some devices. For example, she returned her rented color TV and went back to a small black-and-white one. This change helped her family spend more time walking their dog, reading, talking, and enjoying hobbies. 
Susan used to think she needed her sewing machine, but now it is just a table for plants. Since she cannot afford a new one, she has started sewing by hand. She realized that doing things by hand is not boring; it can be enjoyable. She can listen to the radio or talk with family while sewing. 
Sewing by hand gives her a nice feeling, especially when she sits by the fire with a cup of tea. She used to think that sewing by hand was hard work, but now she finds it relaxing and satisfying. She enjoys watching her work become better and faster. 
Now, she feels less rushed and has more control over her time. She even enjoys washing the dishes while daydreaming. Because of this, she is starting to think about what gadgets she really needs in her home. Do they really need a freezer, a microwave, or an electric lawnmower? She wonders if they could save money by not using electric lights!"

Charles Hurst is a cabinet-maker who makes beautiful furniture. Joanna Watt meets him in his workshop, which is under a railway arch in East London. When I arrive, he shakes my hand quickly and says, ""Well, fire away then!"" He seems busy, and his workshop is full of furniture pieces and wooden planks in many colors.
Hurst has been a cabinet-maker for ten years and has a good reputation. He always has many orders, even though he does not advertise himself. People know that if they want a good cupboard, table, or bookcase, Hurst is the right person to contact. 
It is not hard to find a furniture-maker, but it is harder to find one who makes high-quality furniture with simple designs. Hurst says, ""There are few real cabinet-makers now. Many people just call themselves furniture-makers."" He is often disappointed by the quality of modern furniture. He does not like cheap, mass-produced items and believes that wanting perfection is important for his success.
Hurst is confident in his skills. He says, ""I have a huge natural ability. I have always been good at making things."" He learned his craft by asking questions and practicing. Most of his work comes from private clients, and some come back to him for more furniture. He enjoys making furniture for their whole house, but he finds it frustrating when clients do not know what they want.
Hurst is also kind and praises others when they deserve it. He says, ""There are people far better than me."" He believes that some craftsmen try to be artists and take too long to make one piece. He does not like degree shows where students show their work but focus too much on fashion. He thinks furniture should be useful, not just a statement.
Even though Hurst is confident, he is not pretentious. As I leave, he says, ""After all, I am only making furniture,"" showing that he is humble about his work."
CAE_49,C1,"**Three Theories About Sleep**
People spend about one-third of their lives sleeping. This shows that sleep is very important. However, scientists do not fully agree on why we need to sleep. There are three main theories.
The first theory says that sleep is important for our bodies. It suggests that while we sleep, our bodies repair themselves and get ready for the next day.
The second theory focuses on learning. It says that sleep helps us process the information we learn during the day. Without sleep, we might not be able to learn well.
The third theory talks about energy. It claims that we need to sleep to recharge our energy, so we can feel good and be active the next day."
CAE_31,C1,"**ECCENTRICS**
An eccentric is someone whose behavior is unusual. They do not follow the accepted rules of their society. This raises the question, ""What is normal?"" Most of us have our own quirks and strange habits. For example, someone might love entering newspaper competitions, collect beer mats, or write angry letters to the press about different topics. Eccentricity shows our individuality.
Inside us, there is often a struggle between two forces. One is called individualism, which is the desire to be unique, and the other is conformity, which is the desire to fit in. For many people, the need to be accepted and liked is stronger than the need to stand out and be different. 
People with unusual hobbies or strong opinions often come together. They form clubs and hold meetings to share their interests or problems. The key word here is 'common.' They look for others who understand what their friends and family might see as odd. Being part of a group can be comforting.
Most of us feel a tension between wanting to be ourselves and wanting to fit in. Even when we follow the crowd, we might not like being told that we are doing so. For example, a man at a bar might say, ""I say what I think,"" to show he is different. 
Anyone can choose to be more individualistic at any time. Many people succeed in their careers by being true to themselves. Bob Dylan, an American singer, once said, ""When you feel strongly about what you are doing, pursue it without giving up. This may confuse others."" However, being unique is not the same as being eccentric at first. 
If a pop singer wears strange clothes just to get attention, or a socialite makes shocking comments to be noticed, that is not eccentricity. But if they continue these behaviors until they become part of who they are, then they can be considered eccentric. The most important part of eccentricity is that it is natural. 
Eccentrics do not try to be odd; they simply are. They do not care much about what others think. They act based on who they are. This makes eccentrics different from enthusiasts, practical jokers, criminals, exhibitionists, and recluses. These people are aware of society and often react to it. Some want to impress others, while some want to escape from society. But eccentrics go about their lives without worrying about what others think."
CAE_58,C1,"**Natural Books**
We asked four naturalists to share the wildlife book that has influenced them the most.
**A. Geoffrey Lean**  
It was easy for me to choose the author. As an environmental journalist, I have met many important people in this field. One of the most important is Barbara Ward. She was a small, frail woman, but her ideas about the environment were very strong. She helped me understand many environmental issues in Europe after the war. Choosing her book was harder. It could have been ""Only One Earth"" or ""Progress for a Small Planet."" But I believe her most important book is ""The Home of Man."" This book talks about the fast growth of cities and important themes in her life. It is a strong call for what we now call ""sustainable human development."" I have read many books since, but none are as good as this one.
**B. Linda Bennett**  
When I read ""Signals for Survival"" by Niko Tinbergen, I can hear the calls of herring gulls and remember the smell of the sun on the guano. This book explains the amazing world of animal communication with words and pictures. After reading it, if you watch a gull colony, you will see how their chaos turns into a well-organized social structure. You can see which birds are partners and recognize families later in the season. Niko Tinbergen was a great behaviorist who wanted to share his findings with everyone. His work with talented wildlife artist Eric Ennion made this book interesting for anyone who loves wildlife. Ennion's paintings show how one gull can be aggressive while another is calm. This is the art of a true naturalist.
**C. Lee Durrell**  
The book that has influenced me the most is ""My Family and Other Animals"" by Gerald Durrell. This book not only led me to a wonderful husband but also to a great career in conservation. It made me love the natural world. I was doing research on animal sounds in Madagascar when I first read it. After two years of challenges, this book made my world brighter. It shows animals and people together, creating a beautiful world worth saving. Some people think humans are the worst because of the harm we have done to nature. But I remember Gerald as a boy in the book, seeing all living things as a family that is connected. This is an important idea for everyone to understand.
**D. Bruce Pearson**  
I found ""The Shell Bird Book"" by James Fisher in my school library soon after it was published in 1966. I was immediately attracted to it, especially to the 48 colorful bird paintings by Eric Ennion. These images caught my attention. I already had other bird books and had spent holidays learning to identify birds. They inspired me to start sketching what I saw. But ""The Shell Bird Book"" had so much more. It included beautiful paintings, chapters on bird migration, the history of birds in Britain, and even a chapter on birds in music, literature, and art. This book helped me appreciate birds and nature in a broader way. It showed me that my emotional and creative response to nature is just as important as a scientific one. Since art was my stronger subject, I began to see new opportunities for myself."
CAE_37,C1,"**DO REVIEWS SELL BOOKS?**
We asked five British publishers about how book reviews affect sales. Here is what they said.
**Publisher A**  
Reviews are very important for publishers. They are the first thing we look at in newspapers. A study showed that many people said they bought a book because of reviews, more than because of ads or recommendations from friends. Authors feel differently about reviews. Both authors and publishers are upset when there are no reviews, but publishers often think that even bad reviews can help sales. They believe that both good and bad reviews can make readers want to try the book for themselves. Publishers like it when a review matches their own opinion about a book because they often read it first.
**Publisher B**  
Publishers and newspapers both care about book reviews, but they have different needs. Newspapers want to entertain their readers, while publishers want to see their books reviewed positively. Book reviews today are better than they were 40 years ago; they are more varied and less exclusive. However, many paperback books still do not get enough attention. Publishers need reviews because they are a cost-effective way to promote a book and an author. A good review from a trusted source can really boost sales, especially if there are several positive reviews.
**Publisher C**  
Reviews are essential for publishing. Without them, we would struggle to promote our books. Most of our books are not by famous authors, so we rely on reviews from literary editors. Good reviews are often more valuable than ads because readers trust them. Publishers say they care more about the size of the review than its content. Good reviews can help a book and an author succeed, but they need support from other factors like recommendations from readers and good marketing.
**Publisher D**  
I wish I understood the relationship between publishing and reviewing in Britain! In the U.S., a single review from the New York Times can make or break a book. Here, bookshops often ignore reviews. Sometimes, it takes many years of good reviews for people to notice a talented writer. Interestingly, some poorly reviewed books still sell very well. It is unpredictable, but non-fiction reviews often focus more on the subject than the book itself.
**Publisher E**  
All publishers and writers hope for great reviews. But do they really help sell books? I once published a biography that received excellent reviews, but it did not sell well because people thought they could just read the reviews instead of buying the book. Does the name of the reviewer matter? Thirty years ago, if certain reviewers liked a book, people paid attention. Now, sometimes an unexpected reviewer or a clever review can encourage people to buy the book."
CAE_2,C1,"**WEATHERVANE MAKER**
Making weathervanes is an old skill that goes back to ancient Egypt. Today, this craft is still alive in the workshop of Graham Smith. He is one of the few people in the country who makes hand-cut weathervanes. Graham creates unique designs based on what his customers want. He says, ""This way, I can make a special item just for them."" Many of his customers are women who want to buy gifts for their husbands. They look for a special gift that shows the man's job or hobbies.
Graham's work is very different from the traditional cockerel design, which is the most common type of weathervane. The first weathervane he made was not a cockerel, but a witch on a broomstick. His friends liked it and asked him to make weathervanes for them. He realized that there were many different subjects he could use for his designs. So, he decided to start a weathervane business.
Before this, Graham trained as a precision engineer and worked in that field for 15 years. Then, he and his wife, Liz, decided to change their roles. Liz went to work as an architectural assistant, and Graham stayed home to take care of their children and grow the business. This was five years ago, and he is happy with his new path. He says, ""My old job was not creative, but this work is exciting and artistic. I really enjoy designing.""
Graham has now created over 100 original designs. He pays close attention to detail and always gets the customer's approval for the design before he starts cutting it by hand. He also keeps many traditional designs in stock because they are still popular. Graham believes that people like handmade items because they want something different.
He does not plan to expand his business because he wants to keep it as a rural craft. He says, ""I have found my place in the market. People love unique items, and I feel satisfied when I see a simple shape turn into something beautiful."" For many years, weathervanes have helped people understand the weather by showing changes in wind direction. Now, more people are moving to the countryside and want to add a special touch to their homes. This has helped crafts like his.
Graham is now busier than ever, sending weathervanes to customers all over the world. He has many buyers from America and Denmark. He explains that the price depends on how detailed the design is. His latest request was for a weathervane shaped like a curly-coated dog. No matter the occasion, Graham can create a special gift."

**Beginner Takes All**
Before it was published, *The Horse Whisperer* was already a very popular book. It is the first novel by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans, and it made him a lot of money. He talks about his inspiration and success.
At the beginning of the year, Nicholas Evans was having a hard time. A film project he had worked on for months fell apart suddenly. He was worried because he had not earned any money for two years, and he was in debt to the bank. A smart person in his situation would have found a job, maybe returning to television. But instead, he made a surprising choice. He bought a ticket to America to spend three months researching for his first novel.
Even though he acted on impulse, he had an idea for the story for a while. He got the idea from a farrier he met while visiting a friend. The farrier told him about a calm horse that suddenly became aggressive. The owners were desperate until they heard about a gypsy who could calm the horse just by talking to it. These people were called ""horse whisperers."" This story inspired Evans.
He started to research horse whisperers to write a screenplay since he was a filmmaker. But after his film project failed, he decided to write a book instead. During the spring, he traveled across the US, visiting ranches and learning about horses and the people who work with them. He said, ""It was a funny time. I was watching people, but I felt alone and worried about my life. I had tried for ten years to succeed as a filmmaker, and now I was in debt and worried about my family.""
By the end of August, he had returned home and written the first half of the book. He was still worried about money and needed to know if he should continue. He showed the book to a friend who was a literary agent. The agent said it was ""fine"" and thought Evans could get $30,000 as an advance for the book. Evans needed more money to pay off his debts, and he had spent seven months on *The Horse Whisperer*, with more work to do.
In October, he sent the first two hundred pages of the novel and a 12-page summary to seven UK publishers just before the Frankfurt Book Fair. Soon, his agent called to say he had turned down an offer of $75,000. Evans was shocked and asked, ""What?"" The agent felt something good was happening.
Within a week, the novel was sold to Transworld Publications in the UK for £550,000 and to Delacorte in the US for $3.15 million, both record amounts for a first novel. Evans and his team were amazed. They had not sent the manuscript to New York, and they did not know how it got there. They also did not send it to Hollywood, but soon major studios were interested in it. 
Evans's UK agent worked with an agent in the US, and when they said they could get $3 million, Evans and his team could not believe it. They decided that the studios should each present their ideas to Evans. One night in October, he sat in his study while four famous filmmakers called him, asking to pay $3 million for his unfinished novel.
Evans shared this story while we drank coffee on his porch overlooking his garden. He said he had turned down an offer to write the screenplay for *The Horse Whisperer*. He felt it was like a fairy tale and did not want to ruin it. Writing for movies is very hard, and he did not want to become just an employee of the studios. He wanted to stay involved but keep some distance.
The success of his novel led to new support for his film project, but he was not sure if he wanted to make it anymore. He said, ""I think it would be foolish not to write another novel."""

**Young Masters**
Bobby Fischer is trying to come back to chess, but age is against him. Chess is now more of a young person's game. After being away from chess for 20 years, Fischer is playing against his old rival, Boris Spassky. Fischer won the first game, which was very impressive. However, he is not the same player he was in 1972. He is now 49 years old, not in good shape, and has not played much recently. Spassky is even older than Fischer.
Chess has changed a lot in the last 20 years. Fischer helped make chess popular, and now there is a professional chess circuit. Today, the main goal for chess players is to win. In international chess, a player’s nerves and stamina are just as important as their intelligence. The pressure in chess has always been high. Players use a chess clock to make sure they finish their moves in time. If they don’t, they lose the game. Now, games can last longer, and many are played without breaks. This has made it harder for older players.
In the last 30 years, every new world champion has been younger than the last. Of the ten best players in the world, eight are under 30. The way chess is played has also changed. Many players prepare before matches, especially because computers can store many chess games. A small computer can hold one million games and help players study their opponents. In recent matches, players have had teams of helpers to find weaknesses in their opponent's game. The beginning of a chess game is now studied very carefully. Being well-prepared can be the key to winning.
Today, there are more great chess players than ever before. Many grandmasters compete for small prizes around the world. Success in chess requires both physical and mental effort. A single game can last up to eight hours, and players must stay focused. If they lose concentration, they can lose the game. The chess clock adds to the stress. At the end of a game, players often rush to make their moves, which can be very intense. In these moments, the game becomes a battle of nerves and willpower.
For top chess players, losing is very painful. Winning brings great joy and a chance to recover from the stress. But one win is not enough to win a tournament. Players must be ready for the next challenge. Most chess tournaments last 9 to 11 days, with games every day. World championship matches can be even tougher. For example, a match in 1984 between Anatoli Karpov and Gary Kasparov had to stop after several months because both players were exhausted. Karpov lost a lot of weight during the match.
Can Bobby Fischer overcome these challenges? He once said, ""All I want to do is play chess."" This makes his long absence from chess even more surprising. If he has come back for money, he will do well, as both he and Spassky will earn millions from their match. But if Fischer believes he can prove he is still the best player, the outcome could be very disappointing for him."
CAE_60,C1,"**Fame and Fortune**
Imogen Edwards-Jones talks to some new British talents, from poets to pop stars, who are becoming famous.
**A** Nick Grosso is in his early 30s and has written three successful plays. He is now turning his first play, Peaches, into a movie script. ""It's low budget, but we don't know how low,"" he says. ""It won't be over £30 million, but it could be as low as £30."" Nick is very talented, but the surprising thing is that before he wrote Peaches, he had never been to a play or read one. ""When I wrote the play, I never thought it would be performed,"" he says. ""It's set in a car. I probably wouldn't do that now because I know it would be hard to manage. I knew nothing back then."" He left school at 16 but returned a year later. After finishing A-levels, he joined the Young People's Theatre. ""I realized I wanted to write for actors. I wanted my writing to be heard, not just read, because of the rhythm and rhyme,"" he explains. ""Suddenly, I was with people who thought like me. It was the first time I enjoyed being in school. It was very inspiring.""
**B** Comedian Simon Pegg, 28, has made great progress in his career since studying drama at Bristol University. He is now writing a TV comedy series and has just finished a tough tour with comedy star Steve Coogan. He has always worked hard. Even in Bristol, he was practicing his comedy in clubs. ""University was very theoretical,"" Simon remembers. ""It made me realize I didn't want to be a serious actor; I was always more interested in comedy. People think comedy is the hardest job, but it really isn't. If you have courage and good material, it's wonderful to make people laugh."" He has performed with the comedy group Funny Business, but his work with Steve Coogan has been the most successful. ""He saw my show, and since I was a big fan of his, he probably noticed I was copying him,"" Simon admits.
**C** Ciaran McMenamin, 24, became well-known when he danced into homes as the lead in the show The Young Person's Guide To Becoming A Rock Star. The response was very positive, and his career has taken off quickly. ""It's been a great opportunity for me,"" he says with a smile. ""Now I can choose what I want to do, which is what I've always wanted."" This is a comfortable position for him, especially since he just graduated. Ciaran's early career shows that he was always meant to be recognized. Encouraged by his mother, he went from leading roles in school to the Ulster Youth Theatre, where he stayed for four years. ""I was using acting to avoid doing homework,"" Ciaran laughs. ""But then I decided I wanted to take it seriously because I had a talent and passion for it."" Now he is waiting for praise to come in, but when asked about fame, he becomes thoughtful. ""When you're 18, you think you'll love the photos and interviews, but you soon realize that's not why you act. It's about getting respect for doing good work.""
**D** Neil Taylor, 25, is the lead singer of the pop band Matrix, which has just signed a deal for three albums with Domino Records. Neil and his bandmate Rick Brown are expected to be very successful when their single, Chimera, is released soon. ""The record company has a different idea of good sales than I do,"" he says. ""They want a big hit, but I just want two people to buy it."" Unlike many new pop stars, Neil has worked hard for his success. He left school at 16 and has been trying to enter the music business ever since. ""It's funny how things happen,"" he says. ""I was doing student gigs for eight years and was about to give up when I met Rick Brown, who had contacts at Domino, and we formed Matrix. It couldn't have happened at a better time. There were times when I was very depressed, and I was in some terrible bands. But hopefully, it will all be worth it.""
**E** Poet and author Stephen Richards is 27 years old and has won many awards and honors. He is well-known in the poetry world, where he has been touring and giving readings for the past six years. His first novel, Hidden, will be published in March. ""It's a story about obsessive love. It was a strong idea that I couldn't write as a poem."" Stephen loved creative writing in school but lost interest in education later. ""I decided not to go to university, but I became bored stuffing envelopes at a theater and decided I should go."" After university, he published his first work, a children's book, in 1992. ""I don't think my parents expected me to be a writer; they thought I would just be a reader because that's all I did as a child."" With his poetry getting great reviews, moving to novels is a brave step. ""My poetry has a structure, but a novel can be any length, so there are more chances to make mistakes. My main goal is not to just write a lot without caring about the quality."""

Isabel is looking for Mr. Right, and she stays hopeful, which helps her and others in the story. The author writes in a lively style, using chapter titles like ""Our Hero Feels Inspired.""
B. This story is about a local radio station in America that almost fails. It is told from the perspective of a smart, shy boy named Francis With. He works for WLT Radio, which was created by two brothers to promote their sandwich shop. The station plays a mix of music, sermons, and soap operas. The author uses humor and simple writing to take readers back to the 1940s and 1950s, a time of old stores and classic cars.
C. In this story, it is normal for a second husband to talk to his wife's first husband. Professor Richard Vaisey falls in love with a beautiful Russian poet. He shares his feelings with his wife’s ex-husband. The poet writes bad poetry, which bothers Richard, and she wants his help for her brother who is in prison. The author skillfully tells the story with humor and insight into relationships, making it an enjoyable read.
D. In 1960s London, two sets of best friends—two women and two men—are connected for 25 years. At the beginning of the story, James Hudson, a wealthy American, is starting a newspaper with his friend Richard Blake. The newspaper launch is important, but so is the fact that a woman they both loved was killed years ago. The story includes themes of murder, ambition, love, and jealousy, and the writing is engaging. This book allows readers to really get to know the characters.
E. This story, written by a great American author, is about Ian Bedloe, who feels guilty about something he did. To make up for it, he becomes a father figure to his brother's three orphaned children. At 40, he is becoming a quirky bachelor. The story explores many emotions and shows the special bond Ian forms with the youngest child, Daphne. It is a warm and funny book that balances sadness and joy."
CAE_53,C1,"**Volunteer Tourism**
Four writers talk about international volunteer work.
A. It is difficult to say that volunteer work really helps development a lot. Volunteer tourists can help build homes or schools, but they usually pay a lot of money to do this work. If this money was given directly to a local community, it could pay for more help than one volunteer can provide. This is especially true for gap year volunteers, who often do not have special skills or experience. Many studies question whether gap year volunteering is mainly about wanting to help others or if young people want to improve their own careers. However, these projects might help develop people who will act ethically and help those in need in the future.
B. Volunteering can lead to better understanding between countries, help solve conflicts, and create international social networks. In this way, both volunteers and local communities can benefit. But if volunteering is mostly done by wealthy people, it may help them gain experience and improve their careers without really helping the communities that need it. Those who volunteer may continue to benefit personally while using local organizations and communities to advance their own goals.
C. At its worst, international volunteering can be seen as a form of charity that benefits wealthy Westerners more than the communities they aim to help. However, it can also provide important technical help for development. When done well, international volunteering can benefit both volunteers and the organizations they work with, while also sharing skills and knowledge with developing communities. Most importantly, volunteering can raise awareness about poverty, injustice, and the need for sustainable development.
D. Volunteer tourism fits with the idea of helping others. These small efforts to ""make a difference"" can seem positive, especially when people are frustrated with big governments and businesses. However, this approach can ignore the need for democratic government and reduce development to individual acts of charity. While volunteering is often a good thing, when it is promoted as a way to achieve sustainable development, it can show a misunderstanding of the real issues of global inequality and poverty faced by many in developing countries."
CAE_55,C1,"**Sound the Alarm**
Stuart Harris reports
Many people listen to the radio in the morning, and most of us need an alarm to help us get out of bed. This is why we have clock radios. But how do you choose a good one? A group of us, including inventor Tom Granger and broadcaster Paul Bridges, tested five different models.
One model has a 'dual alarm function'. This means you can set two different wake-up times, one for work days and one for weekends. However, it is not very useful for most people. This model costs about the same as another one we tested, but it has a cassette player. You can listen to your favorite tapes to fall asleep and wake up to music instead of news. We all thought the radio quality was excellent, but the clock radio is very big, like a rugby ball. Paul Bridges said, ""Any clock radio I buy must leave enough space on my bedside table for my keys, wallet, glasses, and phone. I always book a wake-up call just in case the alarm doesn’t work.""
This model was voted the best-looking and overall winner. Paul Bridges said he was ""in love with it,"" even though the clock he tested sometimes got stuck at 16:00. I liked the digital display with its nice grey numbers on a soft green background. The snooze button is wide, so you can easily tap it while still in bed. However, the buttons felt nice to touch, and I ended up pressing them too much, which made it hard to understand the instruction booklet. 
The clock has a backup battery, so you don’t have to reset it if the power goes out. Everyone liked this feature. However, we found it difficult to set up. Once we figured it out, we felt cool and sophisticated. Tom Granger thought this model, which has a built-in lamp, looked cheap. He said, ""You have to pull the light out of its socket to make it work, which makes me question the quality."" He had to read the instructions twice to get it to work because the clock kept changing from 12:00 to 02:00. The light was hard to position, and you couldn’t read by it because it only shines on the clock, which is already lit.
Paul Bridges found the lamp idea funny but agreed that the radio was hard to tune. The buzzer sounded like an alarm on a submarine, and it made me want to throw the clock across the room. Interestingly, this model is the third most popular on the market. It is aimed at young people, with bright colors and a fun strap. Tom Granger and I liked it because it stands out. He said, ""I would choose this one because it doesn’t blend in like the others."" The controls were easy to use, and we could set it up without reading the instructions. However, the alarm can be off by 20 minutes, which is funny. Paul Bridges laughed and said this model was ""very difficult to use"" and ""completely useless.""
The simplest and cheapest model we tested was liked by Tom Granger because it was small and had old-fashioned dial tuning. He said, ""It’s easier to set up. With modern buttons, you’re never sure if you pressed everything correctly."" He agreed that companies had to improve radio quality because of button tuning. I thought the tuning was not very good, and Paul Bridges agreed, but we both thought the radio quality was fine. The buzzer on this model worked well; it got me out of bed in just two beeps!"
CAE_50,C1,"**Hedgehogs**
A hedgehog is a small animal with sharp spines on its body. Hedgehogs live in many parts of the world, but they are not found in America or Australia. All hedgehogs can roll into a tight ball when they are in danger, so their spines point outwards. This helps protect them. The number of spines a hedgehog has can affect how well this works. Some hedgehogs that live in deserts have fewer spines because they have adapted to their environment. These hedgehogs may try to run away from danger instead of rolling up.
Hedgehogs are mostly active at night and sleep during the day. They often sleep under bushes or in holes in the ground. Although all hedgehogs can hibernate, not all of them do. Some hedgehogs can stay awake all year if the conditions are right."
CAE_25,C1,"**Great Sportswomen on a Winning Streak**
It is hard to be good at any sport, even for men, but women have to work even harder. Training and competitions take a lot of time, so they have to make sacrifices. Despite this, they are overcoming challenges and breaking records. Here, we talk to some amazing British sportswomen who are reaching their goals.
A. **Jill, 27, Skier**  
""It's a great feeling to fly through the air and land safely, but it can be scary. Sometimes I don’t feel well or it’s windy, and I can’t see, but I keep going. It’s hard to have a life outside skiing because we train for ten months each year. I give up a lot of my social life and friends, but it was my choice. There are six men and three women on the British team. We all compete on the same courses and get treated the same - it’s a young sport.""
B. **Caroline, 22, Cyclist**  
""Two years ago, I borrowed a bike to join a charity race. I won because I cycled faster than everyone else, which was amazing since I had never cycled before! I earn good money as a professional cyclist, and there are many opportunities for sponsorship. However, I worry that people might think I am successful because of my looks, not because I am a good cyclist. So, I focus on cycling now. I train for at least four hours every day, plus I do some stretching, swimming, and running. My boyfriend is also a cyclist, so he understands how much time it takes.""
C. **Annabel, 26, Rower**  
""Rowing is hard for girls because very few girls' schools offer it. Most girls start rowing when they are 19 or 20, which makes it harder to succeed internationally. Also, coaches often leave after a year, so the women’s team lacks stability. But it’s a lot of fun, and I love being fit. There is also a good social life.""
D. **Ffyona, 24, Long-Distance Walker**  
""When I was 13, I dreamed of walking around the world, not knowing how big it was! I felt trapped in Britain and didn’t like anyone controlling me. Now, I am more careful. Each walk is different. Walking across Australia was the hardest experience for me. I walked 50 miles a day with only three hours of sleep in very hot weather, and I had many blisters on my feet. But I set a record! I had to because my sponsorship money would run out after 95 days. Some men think women are more likely to fail, so they see sponsoring women as a risk.""
E. **Lisa, 26, Saloon Car Racer**  
""Some men have big egos when they drive. When I do well, they often ignore me. Being a woman has its challenges. When I reach a corner, some men think, 'I have to beat her,' so I have had many tough moments! You need to be competitive and strong. It’s hard to earn money, and what I do make goes back into racing. Women have been racing since the 1920s and have often been seen as unusual. It’s great that more women are starting to race every year. I love saloon car racing because I always aim for perfection.""
F. **Alison, 28, Triathlete**  
""I wake up at 5:30 three mornings a week to swim. I need Tuesday and Thursday mornings to catch up on sleep. In the evenings, I either cycle or run. Yes, I sometimes fall asleep at my desk! There is a lot of pressure before a race, and when I compete, I really push myself. I feel bad if I don’t. I have asked myself why I do this. The answers are: a) I am happier when I stay fit, b) I would be lazy if I didn’t push myself, and c) racing is very social. Men and women usually compete together, but when events are reported in the news, 90% of the article is about the men’s event, and only 10% mentions the women’s event. The prize money is not as good for women either. But now we have formed an International Triathlon Women’s Commission to help improve this."""

The day I met Picasso
Richard Cork remembers how, when he was 78 years old, he met one of the greatest artists of the century, Pablo Picasso. Even from a distance, I could see him eating lunch at an outdoor restaurant in Cannes. I was an 18-year-old student traveling around Europe and Morocco in an old van. I had run out of money and found a job painting boats by the water. But I spent a lot of time drawing and was lucky to have my sketchbook with me when I saw Picasso.
Picasso was known to be a private person who usually stayed away from others to work. So, I was very surprised to see him sitting at a table with his wife, Jacqueline, and some friends. I would not have had the courage to go over and ask for his signature if my friend had not encouraged me. I nervously introduced myself and offered my sketchbook, and to my surprise, he agreed. He wrote his name at the top of the page and then added some lively lines below. These lines might have represented a cloud, the sea, or the shape of Cannes harbour.
I thanked him and started a shy conversation. Since Picasso's English was not very good and my French was not great either, an American woman at the table helped us talk. She kept calling him ""the Maestro,"" which made it hard for me to speak. But I told Picasso that I loved art and admired his work. After a while, I went back to my boat and showed my friend what I had. He saw that Picasso was still having lunch and said, ""Is that all? Why don’t you go back and talk to him more? You won’t get another chance like this!""
So, with my sketchbook under my arm, I returned to Picasso's table. I thought it was better not to ask if I could draw his portrait, as he might say no. Instead, I stood by the table, put my pad against a screen, took out a crayon, and started to draw. When Picasso noticed, he smiled and made it hard for me to draw. He acted out funny faces and silly movements, making me laugh. I wanted to stop, but his playful spirit made me want to keep going. 
After a while, Picasso finally sat still for me. For a few amazing minutes, I could study him closely. He looked strong and alert, wearing a blue-and-white striped shirt. He seemed younger than his age, with bright, dark eyes that were very expressive. Even though he was with friends, he seemed a bit alone and focused on his own thoughts. 
When the American lady told me that Picasso wanted to see my drawing, I felt shy and said it wasn’t good enough. But Picasso insisted, and when I showed him my sketch, he nodded in approval. Then, to my surprise, he said it was his turn to draw. I quickly gave him my crayon, and he made a few quick strokes on the paper. In seconds, he drew a face that looked very different from my careful drawing. He had moved one of my eyes and captured my smile in a lively line. 
I looked like a character from one of his fun stories. I thanked Picasso and asked if he could sign my drawing. The American lady explained that he said I already had his signature. So, he was not going to give me another one! Still, I feel very lucky to have met Picasso and to have received his attention. It meant a lot to me."
CAE_12,C1,"**Talking Shop**
Have you ever gone into a store and bought more than you planned? This text explains how shops encourage you to spend more money.
**A. Freshness First**  
Supermarkets know that people like fresh food. They often put fruits and vegetables at the entrance to make the store look fresh. They might also have a bakery that makes the smell of fresh bread fill the store. The colors in the store, like green, can also make you think of fresh food. However, most of what supermarkets sell, like frozen foods and cleaning products, is not fresh.
**B. Smart Displays**  
Where products are placed in the store is very important for sales. Supermarkets use computers to find out which areas shoppers visit the most. They put high-profit items in these areas. Products at eye level are more likely to be bought. Special offers in 'dump bins' attract bargain hunters. Sometimes, they place related items together, like ice cream near dessert toppings.
**C. Spreading Essentials**  
Supermarkets often place low-cost items like bread and sugar far from the entrance. This way, shoppers pass by more expensive items on their way. Stores may also put popular products far from the entrance, hoping customers will look for them and see other tempting items.
**D. Less is More**  
Chain stores have changed how they display their products. For example, the Next chain shows fewer items on the shelves, making them look special. Even though their clothes are mass-produced, their store design makes them seem exclusive.
**E. Total Costs Matter**  
Shoppers care more about the total cost of their shopping than the price of each item. Supermarkets mix low-cost staples with more expensive items. They sometimes sell certain items at a loss to attract customers, which are called 'loss leaders.' They also get discounts from manufacturers by buying in large amounts.
**F. Price Tags**  
Shoppers in chain stores often buy fewer items and pay more attention to prices. For example, pricing a blouse at £14.99 instead of £15 can make a difference. This pricing strategy can also help reduce theft by employees.
**G. Lighting**  
Both supermarkets and chain stores think carefully about lighting. Chain stores try to use natural light so customers can see the true colors of clothes. Supermarkets use special lighting to make fresh fruits and vegetables look more appealing.
**H. Store Layout**  
Many chain stores use different types of carpet to guide shoppers. One pattern shows the paths through the store, while another marks the sales areas. This design encourages shoppers to explore the sales areas.
**I. In-Store Promotions**  
When you enter a supermarket, you often see large pictures of delicious food, which can make you hungry. In some U.S. supermarkets, shopping carts have screens that show ads for products as you shop. These ads aim to encourage impulse buying and can increase sales significantly."
CAE_26,C1,"Sea, Ice & Rock**
Chris Bonnington, who is 58 years old, is famous for climbing Mount Everest in 1985. He has also created new climbing routes in Britain and the Alps and has written many books, such as *Quest for Adventure* and *Everest the Hard Way*. Robin Knox-Johnston, who is 53, started his career at sea in the Merchant Navy. In 1968-1969, he was the first person to sail around the world alone in his yacht, Sunhaili. He also set a record for crossing the Atlantic Ocean, taking just 10 days to sail from New York to the Lizard in England.
Chris and Robin worked together to sail and climb in Greenland, and they wrote about their trip in their new book, *Sea, Ice and Rock*. In 1979, Chris was working on *Quest for Adventure*, which looked at adventure after the war. He called Robin to ask for an interview, and Robin invited him to join him for a sail. Chris could teach Robin some climbing skills, and Robin could teach Chris how to sail. This was Chris's first time on a yacht.
They sailed for a while and then stopped. Robin's wife and daughter stayed on the boat while Chris and Robin paddled to the shore to practice climbing. The route was hard, but Chris was impressed by how steady Robin was in difficult conditions. When they reached a big drop, Chris asked Robin if he had ever climbed before. Robin had not, so Chris showed him how to do it. Robin asked if he could climb down using the ropes from his boat, which made Chris a bit worried, but Robin did it safely.
During their trip to Skye, Chris and Robin became good friends. Robin suggested they combine their skills for a trip to Greenland, which was a big step from their Skye trip. Chris admired Robin as a leader. Normally, the captain makes all the decisions, but Robin asked everyone for their opinions first. Most of the time, people were too shy to give advice, but it felt good to be part of the decision-making.
Chris found sailing difficult and boring. He preferred climbing mountains. He felt a bit useless at times because Robin was a natural sailor and enjoyed fixing things on the boat. The crew was also very close together: six people on a yacht meant for four. When they reached Greenland and it was Chris's turn to lead the expedition, he felt nervous about being responsible for Robin's safety. Climbing together was risky, and Chris had to be careful.
The first time they tried to climb Greenland's highest mountain, the Cathedral, they worked for 24 hours. On the way down, they were so tired that they almost fell asleep on steep slopes. Robin trusted Chris completely and followed him. When it became too hard, Chris decided they had to turn back, and Robin accepted this. Chris knew that Robin was worried about their boat and whether it would be okay, but Robin still wanted to try climbing again.
The only time they had a problem was on the way home. They were taking turns to keep watch on the yacht. Chris was supposed to wake up at 4 am for his shift, but Robin did not wake him because he thought he could manage alone. Chris felt that Robin did not trust him, which made him feel insecure. Robin quickly reassured him that he was wrong to think that.
While they enjoyed their trip to Skye, they really got to know each other during the Greenland expedition. Chris discovered that Robin, who seemed tough, was actually a kind and sensitive person."
CAE_8,C1,"**A History of the Apple**
Apples have been part of our lives for a very long time, in many different colors, shapes, and sizes. However, in the late 20th century, we risk losing this important part of our history.
**Prehistoric Times (8,000 BC)**  
People have been eating apples since ancient times. In Britain, they threw away apple seeds. About 10,000 years ago, they found apple remains near lakes in Switzerland and Italy. In these areas, early humans even stored apple halves to eat in winter. But these apples were wild and small, very different from the apples we eat today.
**Norman Times (1000 AD)**  
The Romans taught the French how to grow fruit, and this knowledge spread to Britain. They brought different types of apples, but many did not grow well in Britain. British monks started to create new apple varieties, which are the ancestors of most apples we have now.
**Medieval Times (1200)**  
In the 13th century, several apple types became popular in Britain. The Old English Pearmain was a well-known dessert apple, and the Costard was used for cooking. However, bad weather and diseases reduced apple production, and more apples were imported. In the 16th century, King Henry VIII sent a man named Richard Harris to France to learn about apple growing. Harris returned with many new apple types, including the famous Pippins.
**Settlers and Apples (1750)**  
By the 17th century, apples were so popular in Britain that settlers took them to Canada, Australia, the US, South Africa, and New Zealand. Captain Bligh took apples to Australia, and the Pilgrim Fathers brought them to America. A famous apple planter in North America was John Chapman, known as 'Johnny Appleseed'. He planted many apple trees and was seen as a kind man.
**Modern Apples (1850)**  
Around this time, a farmer named Jesse Hiatt found a new apple tree in Iowa. He named the apple 'Delicious', and it became very popular. Another famous apple, the Granny Smith, was discovered in Australia by Maria Anne Smith. She found a small tree growing from old fruit and started to grow green apples, which became famous worldwide.
**Uniformity in Apples (1950)**  
Today, apples are grown all over the world, but most come from only a few types that are chosen for their looks and how well they travel, not for their taste. Many old apple varieties are disappearing, especially in the US. However, people are starting to want more variety. It is important for us to protect the diversity of apples and other foods for everyone’s benefit."

Richard Nerurkar is a long-distance runner from Britain. He is one of the best 10,000-metre runners in his country. He visits a training camp in Kenya, which is located ten miles south of the equator. The camp is near Mount Kenya, the highest mountain in the country. This beautiful and quiet place is called Nanyuk. For three years, Richard has trained here during the winter, but he had never trained with Kenyan runners before.
On his fourth trip to Kenya, Richard decided to change this. He ran in his first race in Kenya and stayed at the national team training camp. This camp is where the best Kenyan runners prepare for important competitions. Richard was invited by the national team coach after he finished fifth in the World Championship 10,000 meters race. This was a great opportunity for him.
Training at high altitude helps runners produce more red blood cells, which helps them carry oxygen better. This is one reason why many Kenyan runners are successful. Richard's first race in Africa was also special because it was the first international cross-country race held in Africa, in Nairobi. He finished behind 41 runners, most of whom were Kenyan, but he felt he did well.
Richard believes that Kenyan runners are not just successful because of the altitude. They have a simple and relaxed approach to running. They enjoy competing and have a straightforward training style. During his time at the training camp, Richard learned how the Kenyan runners train.
The national team training camp is at St Mark's College, which is 6,200 feet up the mountain. The camp is basic, and the athletes live with regular students in shared rooms. Their daily schedule includes three workouts: a morning run, interval training in the middle of the day, and a steady run in the late afternoon. They start their day at six in the morning. The coach tells them to run easily because they have a tough day ahead. They run about 40 kilometers each day, except on Sundays when they only run 20 kilometers.
Life at the camp is simple. They wash their faces and brush their teeth before breakfast, which includes tea, bread, and boiled eggs. Lunch and dinner are similar, with ugali (a maize dish), stew, cabbage or spinach, and tea. After running, they drive to a stream to wash off in the evening.
By the end of his stay, Richard understood more about why Kenyan runners are so successful. It is not just about genetics or altitude. He thinks that the simple lifestyle, hard training, and love for running are important reasons for Kenya's success in long-distance running."
CAE_7,C1,"The Problems of Mass Marketing**
Almost everyone knows that advertising is not doing well. This is not just because of the recession. Advertising started to decline in early 1989, before the recession really affected the economy. The problems with advertising are more serious and are happening all over the world. The sad truth is that advertising has not kept up with changes in the economy. Advertisers like to think about large groups of people and big media, but as more brands and media appear, the target audiences have become smaller and more specific. Even big brand campaigns should focus on smaller groups, but they usually do not.
Think about your own shopping habits. When you go to a supermarket, you might buy 30, 40, or even 50 items. Most of these items are not from advertised brands. You might buy a few well-known brands, but you will not buy many of them. In a year, you probably buy only a few hundred different brands. For things like cars, you might only buy one every three years. You do not buy many clothes either, and most of them are not from advertised brands. Even if you include snacks, medicines, and other services, you likely do not buy more than 400 different brands in a year. 
Now, compare that to the 32,500 brands that are advertised. If we ignore the 23,000 brands that spend very little on advertising, we can focus on the 9,500 brands that are listed and analyzed. The average person buys about 400 of those 9,500 brands, and not all of them because of advertising. This means that about 4 percent of advertising is effective. You could say that 96 percent of advertising is wasted, but no one knows which 96 percent.
When you watch TV tonight, count how many commercials are for brands you buy or might buy in the future. Most people find that only about one in 16 commercials (6 percent) are for brands they are interested in. This means that the commercials for the other 15 (94 percent) are likely wasted. You might think you are different and that you do not pay attention to advertising, but most people feel the same way. The truth is that most people do not buy the brands they see advertised.
There is always some waste in advertising. The idea that everyone who sees an ad will rush out to buy the product is unrealistic. People only remember a small number of ads and ignore the rest, so waste is unavoidable. However, this does not mean that advertising is not effective. Many ads have shown that they work. Advertising needs to reach a lot of people to find the few who will respond, because advertisers cannot know in advance who will be interested.
Even with careful targeting, advertisers cannot know exactly who will respond to their ads. For example, a direct mail campaign will never get a 100 percent response rate. This is different from face-to-face selling, where a salesperson might succeed with every customer they talk to. If advertisers knew exactly who would respond, they would not need to use mass media at all; they could contact those people directly.
Any advertiser who can attract one million new customers (about 2 percent of adults) is doing well. The top two brands of soap powder in supermarkets would be very happy with a million extra customers. So, any advertising campaign that can reach 2 percent of the population is very successful, and that is a small number of people. The best way to reach them may still be through mass media, but if advertising wants to improve, it needs to be more focused than ever before."

**Solar Survivor: Charles Clover Visits a Green Home**
Charles Clover goes inside one of the most environmentally-friendly homes in Britain. This house is in Southwell, Nottinghamshire, which has some interesting surprises. The first surprise is Southwell Minster, a little-known ancient cathedral. It is famous for the 'green' men figures carved by medieval craftsmen in its chapter house. The second surprise is the 'autonomous house,' built by Robert and Brenda Vale. 
The Vales use rainwater for washing and drinking, recycle their sewage into compost for the garden, and heat their house with waste heat from their electrical appliances and their own body heat, along with that of their three teenage children and two cats, Edison and Faraday. The house looks traditional, with a clay tile roof, and is located 300 yards from the Minster. It was designed to match the orange brick of the town's old buildings and was approved by planners, even though it is in a conservation area.
When you ring the solar-powered doorbell, it is very quiet inside. The house is well-insulated, with special windows that keep out noise. Inside, it feels calm and peaceful. On a sunny summer day, the windows are closed, and the conservatory warms the air before it goes into the house. Robert opens clever ventilation shafts and windows to create air movement because the house is very well-sealed. Even the cats have their own small air-locked door.
The Vales, who teach architecture at Nottingham University, cared about the environment long before it became popular. They wrote a book about green architecture in the 1970s called *The Autonomous House*. They first designed a building that did not produce carbon dioxide. Then they decided to also not use mains water. They created composting toilets, put rainwater tanks in the cellar, and used copper gutters to keep the drinking water clean. They filter the water before using it. Water from washing goes into the garden, and they do not have a dishwasher because they think it is wrong to use strong detergents.
Robert says, ""We wanted people to see that it is possible to design a house that is better for the environment, without living in the dark."" The only old-fashioned part of the house is the hall, which has a fireplace and a staircase that goes up to the top of the building. The Vales do not pay water bills. Last winter, the house used only nine units of electricity a day, costing about 70p, which is much less than what other four-bedroom houses use.
Soon, they will install solar panels in the garden, which will help the house use even less electricity. The house will still use mains electricity for cooking and appliances, but it will also generate extra electricity. One day, there will be enough to charge an electric car. The only heating is a small wood-burning stove in the hall, which they only use in very cold weather. 
When I visited in February, Robert said it was too warm to light the fire. The temperature on the first floor was 18°C, which is lower than what is usually expected, but he said it felt comfortable because there were no draughts and everything was at the same temperature. He mentioned that a woman from the early 1900s felt comfortable at 12.5°C because of her warm clothing. He suggested that people living in old houses should go back to how people lived in the past, but it is hard to imagine many people agreeing with this idea.
The secret of the house is that it is simple and low-tech, so there is little that can go wrong. Most materials were bought from a local builder's merchant and installed by local workers. This made the house cheap to build, costing the same as low-cost rental housing. It is not surprising that commercial building companies do not want this idea to become popular."
CAE_51,C1,"The Camera Can Lie**
Arthur Conan Doyle, who created the Sherlock Holmes stories, thought he was a rational man and a scientist. In 1920, he saw photographs of fairies taken in a garden and believed they were real. He published these photos with an article, saying that fairies were real and magical. 
However, in 1939, the two women who took the photos admitted that they were fake. They had cut out pictures of fairies from a book and placed them among flowers. The photos looked beautiful, but the trick was simple. This shows that a common belief about photography is not true: that the camera cannot lie. 
In fact, the camera can lie, and it always has. Today, we can use computer software to change our digital images. Photography has never been completely honest; from the beginning, people have changed what cameras show."
CAE_11,C1,"Blacksmiths**
Throughout history, iron has captured the human imagination, and blacksmiths, the people who work with iron, have often been seen as more than just skilled workers. Before the Industrial Revolution, blacksmiths were as respected as doctors and astrologers because they made weapons, armor, and farming tools. They were also considered artists. In the 18th century, blacksmiths created beautiful ironwork for places like St Paul's Cathedral. The elegant metalwork in French and Belgian Art Nouveau buildings was also made by talented blacksmiths.
However, by the late 1960s, the number of blacksmiths in Britain had greatly decreased because heavy industry no longer needed their skills, and modern architects rarely used beautiful wrought-iron designs. In the last 10 years, there has been a revival of interest in blacksmithing, thanks to a growing appreciation for decorative architecture and new ideas in interior design. Still, much of the work looks similar, with many manufacturers advertising their products as ""classical"" or ""Victorian-style."" You can find trendy design stores filled with rusty candlesticks and other similar items.
Fortunately, there are new events to promote the blacksmith's craft. The first event, an exhibition of forged ironwork by members of the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA), opened last week at the Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey. Alan Dawson, the secretary of BABA, says, ""We could be starting a new Iron Age because both the public and blacksmiths are seeing things differently now."" Power tools have made it easier for blacksmiths to work with metal, allowing them to bend, twist, and weld it more easily. Dawson adds, ""These artists now have a material that lets them express themselves.""
About 250 pieces of work are on display, including bookends and a spiral staircase. Prices start at £90 and can go much higher. Most of the money will go to the individual makers, but a part of each sale will be used by the Association to promote good ironwork. Dawson has created an eight-foot gate and a lamp with a glass shade. He explains, ""My style comes from letting steel bend and take shape when it’s hot. It’s like drawing with metal in space.""
Many artists are fascinated by iron. Unlike other metals, which are soft when cold, iron and steel are tougher and more challenging to work with. Susan May, a jeweler, says, ""It’s magical because it’s very soft when hot, but when it cools, it becomes hard and unmovable."" Ann Catrin Evans makes door knockers and handles from mild steel, inspired by the dark castles often seen in horror films. One of her designs looks like a ball and chain, and another looks like a Celtic cross. She says, ""I love that steel is cold and hard, and it feels like it will last forever.""
No other metal has given people as much visual pleasure or a greater sense of security. It is likely that iron will continue to be used for decoration for many years to come, as long as we don’t have to see any more rusty candlesticks!"
CAE_14,C1,"'THE DAY I GAVE UP SMOKING'**
I thought everyone would be happy when I stopped smoking, but one of my coworkers was very angry. She shouted, ""What do you mean? If it was that easy, why didn't you stop years ago?"" I found it hard to explain how I went from being a heavy smoker to not smoking at all in just a few hours. It was strange for me too. 
I stopped smoking two months and three weeks ago. I did not plan to stop, and I did not really want to. I felt pressure from people who are against smoking, and I still feel that way. I also had good health and did not often get sick. On that Thursday afternoon, I went to a stop-smoking session in Birmingham to write an article about it. I said, ""I won’t try to stop because I am here to write, not to quit."" I thought this was a good reason. I enjoyed smoking and it made me happy.
During the session, we were allowed to smoke as much as we wanted, and the room was very full of smoke. I noticed that when I was told to smoke, I didn’t want to. The messages about stopping smoking started to make sense to me. As I thought about stopping, it began to feel good. I felt powerful thinking about not being a smoker anymore. 
Stopping smoking was not very hard. The cravings for nicotine, which felt like hunger, went away after a few days. I thought working without cigarettes would be hard, but it was not a problem at all. However, I found that doing things at home on weekend mornings was the hardest part. I realized that smoking helped me deal with boredom; having a cigarette was something to do. 
I do miss smoking a little, but not too much. Every new experience as a non-smoker is something I have to get used to, like eating out, waiting for a plane, checking into a hotel, or during a break at the theater. These are moments when I would have smoked before."
CAE_63,C1,"
Dorothy Hodgkin is the only British woman scientist to win a Nobel Prize, but many people in Britain do not know her name. For the past four years, I have been asking friends if they know about her. If they do, they pass my test. 
Why should people in Britain know about Dorothy Hodgkin? She won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1964 for her work on important substances like penicillin and vitamin B12. She was a remarkable person and her life shows important changes in the 20th century, like the growth of women's education and the global sharing of science.
When I started my research, I wanted to read biographies of scientists. A friend suggested a biography of Linus Pauling, who was a close friend of Hodgkin. I went to a bookshop but found no biographies of Pauling. I was surprised because he was a very important chemist and also won Nobel Prizes for chemistry and peace. 
Some scientists think that biographies of scientists are not interesting. Peter Medawar, another Nobel Prize winner, said that the lives of scientists are often boring. If scientists think this way, it is not surprising that publishers and bookstores feel the same. 
Many people believe that scientists lead less interesting lives than artists or writers. Some scientists do not want to be seen in the media because they do not want to seem like they are promoting themselves. This can make young people less interested in science.
However, things are changing. Scientists are now appearing more in public. For example, Professor Richard Dawkins gives prizes on a TV quiz show, and geneticist Steve Jones advertises cars on TV. These activities help people see scientists as real people.
The world of publishing is also changing. Scientific biographies used to be very serious and not very interesting. They often did not talk much about the personal lives of scientists. This changed with Richard Feynman's book, ""Surely You're Joking, Mr Feynman?"", which is funny and touching. Now, even famous scientists like Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein are shown with their flaws.
Dorothy Hodgkin loved her scientific work. She solved the structures of important substances like penicillin and insulin. She also had three children and a husband who was often away for work. Her personal life is not the main focus of her science, but it shows how she balanced everything in her life.
There is much to learn from her life, but her scientific work is also very important. Understanding science can be as challenging as reading Shakespeare or learning a new language. It is sad that many educated people do not know about great scientists like Dorothy Hodgkin, even though they would feel embarrassed if they did not know famous writers or artists."
CAE_56,C1,"Margaret and Her Water Finding Skills**
Margaret Wilkins is known for having a special ability. She can use a forked hazel stick to find water underground. Many farmers need her help because their wells have dried up. Margaret and her husband run a well-drilling business. They use machines like drilling rigs and air-compressed hammers, but to find water, she only needs her hazel stick. They have a success rate of over 90%.
This ability to find water is called dowsing. There are different ideas about how it works, from science to spiritual beliefs. One idea is that everything on Earth vibrates, and water vibrates more than other things. Some dowsers believe they can feel these vibrations, while others think they can smell water.
Recently, Margaret has been very busy because of droughts. Many of her customers are farmers with dry wells. She says, ""We usually see customers only once because wells last a long time."" Other customers have holiday homes where it is too expensive to run water pipes. Some are building golf courses.
Margaret looks for water between 50 and 70 meters deep. She explains, ""You can't drill where there is a risk of waste getting into the water."" The water she finds is usually clean, but she has to be careful because some areas have iron in the water.
To find water, she first checks a map of the area with a pendulum. She holds the pendulum still, and it swings over places where there might be water. After that, she walks over the fields with her hazel stick. When she is above water, she feels a strange sensation. She uses the stick to find the exact spot to drill. If the stick rises, it means water is below. It is important to drill in the right place; otherwise, they might miss the water.
Margaret's husband also checks the area. If they do not agree on where to drill, they keep looking until they do. Margaret is not alone in her work; many people are interested in how she finds water. She calls it an ""intuitive perception of the environment."" This special ability helps her family run their well-drilling business successfully year after year."
CAE_36,C1,"'We Changed Lives for a Day!'**
Have you ever thought about living someone else's life for a day? It could be fun to try something different! We helped four people do this. Here are their stories.
**A. Amanda's Story**
I had never been to a place like the restaurant where my friend works. It was dark, noisy, and full of people. It was very different from my quiet hometown, and I was nervous! Being a mother is busy, but working as a waitress was even harder. I had only fifteen minutes to learn how to carry drinks on a tray. The other waitresses made it look easy, but when I tried, the drinks fell and spilled everywhere. I felt so embarrassed, but the other waitresses laughed and said it happens to everyone.
When the restaurant opened at 11:30 am, there was already a line of customers. I was worried about remembering their orders, but luckily, everything was done with computers. After a few hours, my feet hurt, and the loud music was hard to handle. I had to keep asking customers to repeat themselves, which was embarrassing. By the end of my shift at 5 pm, I was very tired and wanted to soak my feet in hot water. One waitress told me it was a 'quiet' day, and I couldn't believe it! I never knew waitressing could be so tiring. I thought it was an easy job, but you need to be friendly and calm, especially when it gets busy. I am shy, and I don’t think I could handle a Saturday night when it is really crowded. I was also not happy with the pay. Even the rich customers didn’t tip me! I was very glad to go back to my children. Taking care of them seems easy after waitressing!
**B. Cindy's Story**
I was a bit nervous about being a mother for a day, but I was also excited. I knew Amanda's daughters were lively, but I thought I could manage. When Amanda left for the restaurant, I had to get the girls dressed and fed. After dropping off Sophie at school and Katie at nursery, I thought I would have some quiet time. I was wrong! Amanda reminded me I still had to clean the house and do the laundry.
At 1 pm, I picked up Katie, went shopping, and then took her home for lunch. But when I brought Sophie home from school, things got crazy. They turned the couch into a trampoline and screamed loudly while playing! I thought they would tire out, but I was wrong again. I tried to get them to sleep by 8 pm, but then they kept asking for water so they could come downstairs and watch TV. I realized they were just trying to trick me, but it was tiring to negotiate with them all evening. I never knew taking care of two small children could be so exhausting. You don’t have time to think about yourself, and it feels like a big responsibility. Still, I really enjoyed the day.
**C. Rosemary's Story**
On the farm, I wake up at 5:30 am, so sleeping in until 7 am felt great! I was nervous about how to dress for school. I didn’t want to look too much like a farmer. At school, I saw about 400 students and hoped I wouldn’t stand out. I helped in a math class where children worked in groups, which was different from my school days. I also helped with a nature project about snails. By lunchtime, I was tired and looking forward to a break, but teachers only have about five minutes to eat. There is so much to do before classes start again.
I went to a staff meeting and helped with sports trials. After lunch, we had a silent reading time, which was nice, and then a fun French lesson. The children wanted to practice their French with me, which showed me how rusty I was! Finally, we had Physical Education, and I was exhausted, but the children had so much energy. The hardest part was speaking in front of the class, even for just two minutes. Teachers may have more holidays, but I think I will stick to farming!
**D. Hilary's Story**
I arrived at White House Farm at 8:30 am, but Rosemary had already been up for three hours! She has a big farm with many cows and sheep. She makes ice cream, yogurt, and cream, which she sells. I spent most of the morning in the ice cream shop, filling milk containers and making ice cream. It was hard not to eat some!
At lunchtime, I checked the sheep. I had to help a sheep that had fallen over because it could die if left too long. After feeding the calves, I started milking the cows, which took two and a half hours. Rosemary does this twice a day, every day of the year! I found the day lonely and missed being with children because animals don’t talk back. The hardest part of farming is that you can’t take time off. The cows need to be milked twice a day, so it is hard to plan a break. Farming seems nice, but it is very hard work, and the money can be unpredictable."

A trumpet isn't just for Christmas. It is interesting how many musicians, even famous ones, come from families without music. Hakan Hardenberger, the only son of parents who do not play music, grew up in a small town in southern Sweden. At the age of 30, he has become a unique trumpet player in the world. His recordings introduce new music, including concertos by composers from the baroque and classical periods, as well as new pieces.
When you meet him, he looks young and has a bright personality, just like the sound of the trumpet. Recently, he played the Hummel Trumpet Concerto in one of London’s top concert halls. A television program was also made about his work, filmed in London and Sweden.
Hardenberger was born near Malmo. His music career started when he was eight years old and received a trumpet as a Christmas gift. His father, who liked Louis Armstrong's music, decided to buy him a real trumpet instead of a toy. The gift was a success, and the boy played the trumpet all the time. His mother found a trumpet player from the Malmo Symphony Orchestra to give him lessons. Bo Nilsson, the teacher, saw that Hardenberger had natural talent. Hardenberger is grateful to have had such a passionate teacher from the beginning.
Hardenberger explains that the trumpet is a simple instrument, and it is impossible to make a perfect one. Each mouthpiece is different, and he believes it is important to understand these differences and work with them. From the start, he had a special sound that people could recognize. Unlike John Wallace, another famous trumpet player who played in orchestras, Hardenberger always saw himself as a solo artist. He admired the French trumpeter, Maurice Andre, and bought all his records. His parents supported his dream of becoming a trumpet player.
At 15, he needed to decide where to study. His teacher thought America was too far away, so at 16, he went to Paris to study with Pierre Thibaud. Thibaud told him that playing in an orchestra was not as exciting as being a soloist. Hardenberger knew he played better than many of his peers, but it was only after entering a competition at 17 that he realized he had a special ability to connect with the audience. Thibaud suggested he join the competition for experience. Hardenberger learned the first round of pieces and made it to the second round. He knew most of the pieces in that round too, but in the final, he faced a concerto that made him nervous. He did not win first prize, but he enjoyed performing and realized that people listened to him, even if he felt he did not play perfectly.
Hardenberger is realistic about his talent and career. He does not want to analyze what makes his communication special because he believes it might ruin it. He thinks the power of music is that it can always touch people's hearts."

Rebecca Cripps meets five women who talk about their different jobs: the good parts, the bad parts, and what a typical workday is like for them.
**A. THE BRAIN SURGEON**  
**Name:** Anne  
**Age:** 34  
**ANNE'S DAY**  
""I wake up at 6:30 am, go to the gym at 7 am, and get to work by 8 am. I start surgeries at 8:30 am. I do surgeries all day on Mondays and Wednesdays, and sometimes on Friday afternoons. Most brain surgeries take about three hours, but some can take all day. Sometimes, I work for ten hours without eating or taking a break. Deciding when to do surgery can be stressful. I don’t feel stressed while I’m operating, but I sometimes worry about what I will do the next day. Brain surgery is usually a last option for patients, but when it works, it feels amazing. From 10 am to 1 pm, I see patients to explain their surgeries. I enjoy this and find it easy to talk to them. If they get upset, I try to comfort them, but I have to be quick because of time pressure. I leave work between 6 pm and 8 pm. Some nights and weekends, I am on call, and I always carry my pager. When I am on holiday, I worry about my patients for the first few days, and I often dream about operating. I find it hard to relax.""
**B. THE SENIOR DESIGNER**  
**Name:** Marita  
**Age:** 31  
**MARITA'S DAY**  
""I wake up at 7:45 am, leave home by 8:20 am, and take the train to work, arriving at 9:15 am. On Mondays at 10:30 am, we have a meeting to discuss our work and any problems. I work in a team with three senior designers, a partner, and a junior designer. My job is mostly about production, with some design work. I get a brief from the client about what they want. I spend three to four weeks designing and developing the project. After that, I present my ideas to the client. If they like my ideas, we work on budgets and I hire photographers and illustrators. I also work with printers to make sure everything is done on time. I spend a lot of time managing people and need to communicate well. I often have to work on several projects at once, which can be very stressful. I have lunch at 1 pm for an hour, and we usually go to a pub. If the client likes my designs, it feels great, but it’s disappointing if they don’t. I usually get home by 7:30 pm, but sometimes it’s much later. I find it hard to relax after a busy day.""
**C. THE CHAUFFEUR**  
**Name:** Linda  
**Age:** 42  
**LINDA'S DAY**  
""I usually wake up at 7 am, but on some days, I have to get up between 4:30 am and 5 am for long flights. At 10:30 or 11 am, I might go for a bike ride or swim. Since chauffeuring is a sitting job, I have to be careful about my diet and exercise. I usually have a big breakfast and snacks during the day. People often ask me for restaurant or shop recommendations, so I need to know the area well. Most jobs are pre-booked, which helps me plan my routes. Not all passengers are polite; some can be rude. But most are nice, and I have good relationships with my regular clients. I work seven days a week, up to fifteen hours a day, so I have to be careful not to get too tired. I try to go to bed by 11 pm.""
**D. THE LANDSCAPE GARDENER**  
**Name:** Tracy  
**Age:** 27  
**TRACY'S DAY**  
""I wake up at about 7 am, leave home at 7:30 am, and go to my first job. My assistant and I mostly take care of gardens we designed. We do some commercial work, but most is in private gardens. We spend about an hour and a half at each place. At around 11 am, we get hungry and go to a café for breakfast. In summer, I might work until 10 pm; in winter, until 4:30 pm. I have an office at home, so when I get back, I check messages and return calls. If someone wants a new garden, I usually meet them in the evening. We like to use old materials to make gardens look historic. Sometimes, clients have strange ideas, but it’s very satisfying to see a garden we created bloom. I find it hard to relax in the evenings because I can hear the phone ring. I sleep well because my job is very physical, and I am always tired at the end of the day.""

**Name:** Zena  
**Age:** 27  
**ZENA'S DAY**  
""I arrive at the site by 8:30 am. I am an assistant engineer, and I help build bridges and a wall to keep cars safe. I check that the workers are following the plan and safety rules. I also help solve problems. The workers start at 6 am, so my first job is to find out what happened since I left the day before. I usually have paperwork to look at or questions to answer. I have lunch for about half an hour between 2 pm and 2:30 pm, but I often eat while I work. The workers have set meal times, so I check things while they eat. Because I check their work, we need to have a good relationship. I see the main engineer once a day, but if something important happens, I act quickly. I usually leave the site at about 6 pm and I am always on call."""

I wake up at 6 am and get to the office by 7:30 am. I manage programs for our credit card users. My job includes starting and managing the Membership Rewards program in Europe. I keep in touch with current card users, find new ones, and build relationships with partner companies. I spend the first 45 minutes organizing my day and then check my emails. I work with marketing staff and advertising agencies to plan our advertising strategy. I have many meetings during the day, but I keep my door open for anyone who has questions. I travel to different markets in Europe once or twice a week. When I am in London, I leave work between 6:30 pm and 7:00 pm.
**B. Record Company Executive**  
I arrive at work by 10:00 am and check the mail, which includes demo tapes, letters from producers, and concert information. The phone starts ringing around 10:30 am with calls from producers and publishers. I have meetings throughout the day to discuss projects for artists. When I listen to demo tapes, I know that these are very important to the artists, so I try to give helpful feedback. Once I sign a band, we start working on their first album, choosing songs and a producer. I also manage budgets and spending. I usually leave work by 7:00 pm and often go to concerts in the evening, sometimes seeing up to five new bands. I often don’t get home until 1:00 am, when I listen to music to relax.
**C. Sales Director**  
I wake up at 8:00 am and drive to work, arriving by 9:30 am. I check the mail and my schedule for the day. I enjoy showing customers around the showroom and selling furniture. We sell antiques that cost between £1,000 and £6,000. I spend time working with restorers and other specialists to fix the items we buy. I read the Antiques Trade Gazette while drinking coffee to stay updated on the business. I do the accounts once a month and tax returns every three months. I go home at 5:30 pm, and it usually takes me about an hour to relax.
**D. Air Traffic Controller**  
I work on a set schedule. When I have an early shift, I leave home at 6:00 am. I start my shift at 7:00 am, taking over from the night shift. I work at different control positions in the tower, usually for about an hour and a half at a time. My team controls aircraft movements, and we handle about 1,000 movements a day in winter. Night shifts are quieter, and I can read about new air traffic rules. This job is stressful, and I find it hard to relax after work. I hope to become a watch manager and then a general manager of the airport.
**E. Shop Manager**  
If I have an early shift, I leave home by 8:00 am. I start by getting the electronic sales system ready. I make sure someone is watching the cash register and help coordinate breaks for staff. I spend the morning helping customers find and order books. I enjoy serving customers, but it can be challenging when they expect me to gather many books quickly. From 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm, publishers’ representatives visit, and I discuss new book titles with them. I need to ensure new titles arrive on time. My early shift ends at 5:45 pm. On two days a week, I work late and close the shop.
**F. Financial Analyst**  
I listen to the news at 7:00 am, then get up and take a taxi to work, arriving by 8:45 am. I contact freelance reporters to find out what is happening in my area. I assess financial risks for companies working abroad, trying to warn clients about possible problems. I provide three services: an online news preview, a security forecast, and a travel information guide. From 9:15 am to 9:30 am, I meet with editors to discuss the stories I will follow. I have deadlines for my reports, so I need to work quickly. I travel to Africa about three times a year to report on events. I leave work around 6:00 pm, but I often find it hard to relax and stay awake until 1:00 am."

A. **What Makes a Good Leader?**  
A good leader inspires others and helps them change for the better. Leadership is not about being tall or very smart. Pat Dixon, who wrote the book *Making the Difference: Women and Men in the Workplace*, says that leadership is about ""making things happen through people who are as enthusiastic and interested as you are."" Enthusiasm is very important. A good leader should be able to speak clearly and confidently. Dixon says, ""It's having the confidence to say 'I believe' instead of 'I think.'""
B. John van Maurik, who teaches a Leadership in Management course, says, ""Most people have more potential for leadership than they know."" To become a leader, you need to recognize your talents, develop them, and use them. In a way, we are all born leaders; we just need the right environment to grow. While it is easy to see leadership in famous people like Emmeline Pankhurst, Mahatma Gandhi, or Richard Branson, it can be harder to see it in our own jobs. However, leadership is very important for good management.
C. Think about the best and worst boss you have had. They might have been good at setting goals and meeting deadlines. But how did they achieve these goals? The best leader motivated you and supported you. The worst leader made you feel unimportant and kept information from you. When things went wrong, they blamed you. The first boss led well; the second one managed badly.
D. Leaders and managers are different. Managers like to work within set rules. Leaders create new opportunities. Micheal Shea, who wrote *Leadership Rules*, says, ""A good manager can keep a company running smoothly, but a good leader can change a discouraged organization, whether it is a company, a sports team, or a country.""
E. Whether you are the boss or a middle manager, you can improve your leadership skills. Here are some lessons to learn:  
- Leadership works best when you choose to do it. Find out what you are passionate about. When you feel inspired to lead, use that energy and take action.  
- Start thinking of yourself as a leader. Your ability to lead is an important part of you. Recognize it.  
- Working together is good, but sometimes strong leadership is needed. Try different styles. If you usually ask others for their opinions, try taking the lead instead. See how this changes the results.  
- Set goals and try to achieve them. Look at your job and see where being a leader can help you do better and advance in your career.
F.  
- Leadership does not just happen. It develops when you take the lead, take risks, and learn from mistakes. Learn to delegate tasks, motivate others, organize, and give praise.  
- Don’t think that your way of leading will always be accepted by your colleagues. Keep improving your communication skills. You don’t have to be liked, but your ideas and achievements should be respected.  
- Be visible and approachable to important people. Remember, you don’t have to lead all the time. Know when your contribution is important and how you can help others become leaders."

**Film critic Nick James reviews some recent movies.**
**A. Abyss**  
Before Titanic, director James Cameron made a tense Cold War thriller about oil workers and navy experts trying to save a nuclear submarine deep underwater. The friendly jokes and brave actions of foreman Bud and his team remind us of tough heroes in movies by Howard Hawks. The special effects and set design are very impressive, but the dialogue and characters are not as strong. Even though the film is well-made, the story feels like a simple B-movie.
**B. The Thin Red Line**  
This video release of the James Jones novel about the battle for Guadalcanal, directed by Andrew Marton, is interesting compared to Terrence Malick's new film. Malick's version is mystical and poetic, while Marton's film is more traditional but often closer to the book. He focuses on one soldier and his difficult relationship with his tough sergeant. Malick's film is richer and more complex, but Marton's version has some strong moments. The flashback where the soldier dreams of his wife is done in a way that some may find more effective than Malick's softer images.
**C. On Guard**  
This fun swashbuckler is loosely based on Paul Feval's 1875 novel. It is better than most musketeer movies. Fabrice Luchini plays a clever villain who causes trouble behind the scenes. Vincent Perez is a lively hero, even if he doesn't last long. Daniel Auteuil is a bit too serious for a fun movie, but he has his moments as a swordsman. The filmmakers use classic costume drama ideas with so much humor and charm that it works well.
**D. Character**  
This serious story is set in Rotterdam at the turn of the century. The detailed production and costumes make the film look like a museum piece. Jan Decleir plays the harsh bailiff Dreverhaven, who is cruel when evicting tenants. His difficult relationship with his son is the main part of the story, but the filmmakers focus too much on the details and not enough on the dark story.
**E. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly**  
This newly re-released video shows off director Leone's skills. The sound editing is especially good; every step, creaking floorboard, and barking dog is clear. The story is very harsh, and whenever it slows down, Morricone's great music brings excitement back. Morally, there is not much difference between the good (Clint Eastwood), the bad (Lee van Cleef), and the ugly (Ell Wallach), as they all act selfishly in the post-Civil War West.
**F. The Longest Day**  
The publicity for this three-hour war epic boasts ""Forty-eight International stars."" With four directors and 23,000 extras, it feels too big. The early scenes, where the experienced soldiers wait for news about the invasion, are slow for both the audience and the soldiers. While it is impressive in terms of logistics, it is better suited for the big screen. Watching it on video does not give the same experience."

**BOOK A** Steve Martin's *Compelling Evidence* is very interesting. The main character is a lawyer who is trying to start a new job after leaving a big law firm. He has to defend his boss's wife when she is accused of killing her husband. The trial scenes are exciting, and the ending has a surprising twist. This is a great first book in a popular genre.
**BOOK B** *Curtains for the Cardinal* starts with a lot of action. It follows Sigismondo, a problem-solver for rich people in the Italian Renaissance. He gets involved in politics, church secrets, and a serious murder case. Even though the story is complicated and a bit too long, it is still very enjoyable.
**BOOK C** *File Under: Deceased* introduces a new detective, Leah Hunter, who is a tax inspector. She finds herself in a mystery when a strange man dies in front of her. Despite facing challenges and the disapproval of a local detective, Leah is brave and smart, making her a great character.
**BOOK D** *Double Deuce* by Robert B. Parker features Spenser, a private investigator. He helps his friend Hawk get rid of drug dealers in a poor area of Boston. The dialogue is quick and clever, and while there are not many deaths, there is more thinking than usual. It is always high-quality entertainment from Parker.
**BOOK E** *False Prophet* by Faye Kellermann has detectives Pete Decker and Marge Dunn looking into a robbery at the home of a famous actress's daughter. The author's easy writing style and focus on unusual human behavior make this an enjoyable mystery.
**BOOK F** *Blood Red, Snow White* is written by husband and wife team Diane Henry and Nicholas Horrock. It features another lawyer and a female client, but most of the action happens outside the courtroom. The lawyer becomes a victim as the story unfolds. It has all the classic elements of romance, money, and violence, making it a gripping suspense novel.
**BOOK G** *Dead for a Ducat* by Simon Shaw features actor Philip Fletcher as a target. A funny group of characters comes together to film a story about Robin Hood, but Philip feels this is not the right direction for his career. Simon Shaw usually entertains well, but this time the story is not as strong as his other works.
**BOOK H** *Fall Down Easy* is Lawrence Gough's best book in a while. Canadian police are searching for a clever bank robber who targets female bank tellers. The story builds tension slowly and shows the smart but troubled robber, making it much better than an average detective novel."

I might be too old for this, but here I go! At 34, Tim Pozzi has left a good job to go backpacking. He thinks about why he and others his age are making this choice. This summer, I quit my job and decided to rent out my flat to travel in South East Asia for a year. You might think I’m lucky, but I’m 34 years old and I feel nervous. I have traveled before. After university, I spent two years backpacking in North and South America, and I wanted to do it again someday. But then I fell in love, started a career, bought a flat, and got used to earning money. I realized I was giving up my own happiness for my salary. When I quit my job, it felt like I was taking control of my life again. 
I have no ties now. Many of my friends are married with children. They wouldn’t want to change places with me, but they envy my freedom. I’m not in a relationship, and I don’t have big career goals. I feel like I should make the most of my freedom, at least for my friends! But why am I so nervous? First, I have to make all the arrangements. How can I let someone else live in my home? How do I organize renting it out? And I need to decide where to go. I tend to put things off, and I’m already behind my plan. I thought, “I might as well enjoy the summer in England,” and then, “Why not wait for the start of the football season?” 
It’s hard to cut emotional ties. I’m delaying because I wonder if I can still handle backpacking. Will I be able to live a simpler life? Will I feel out of place among younger backpackers? Maybe not. More and more people in their late twenties and thirties in Britain want to leave their current lives and travel. Jennifer Cox from Lonely Planet says that many people who always say, “I wish I had that chance” are realizing they can have it anytime. They just need to be brave, organized, and confident.
For Danny, a 30-year-old accountant, and his girlfriend Tammy, a 28-year-old teacher, this trip is a chance to have fun before settling down. They bought a round-the-world ticket for a year. Danny says, “I’m ready to give up job security for this trip.” He knows he might return to the same job position, but he thinks it’s a risk worth taking. When he left his office, he threw his calculator into the river as a sign of freedom!
For Matt, who just left the Army, traveling for a year was a big change. He needed to change his way of thinking to live a normal life. There are many reasons for people my age to travel. Angela Baron from the Institute of Personnel Development says that more people are working on short-term contracts. If your contract ends, you have nothing to lose. Some big companies even allow career breaks. They want their trained employees to come back instead of going to work for a competitor.
Dan Hiscocks, who runs a company that publishes stories of travelers, says many people in their thirties are thinking about their lives. If you’re not happy with your job, it’s not just about sticking with it anymore. People know there are opportunities, and a job isn’t forever. Traveling gives a chance to think about life. 
Is wanting to travel just a sign that my generation can’t handle being adults? Jennifer Cox doesn’t think so. She believes it shows we are better educated and more stable. We care less about just paying bills and more about living a balanced life. We are asking ourselves, “Is this what I want?” Ben, a 32-year-old picture researcher going to Central America for a year, doesn’t think he’s running away. He wants to find things for himself. But he feels nervous about leaving his comfortable routine, like going to the office every day and chatting with everyone over coffee.
I understand Ben’s worries about leaving a stable life. I’m not sure I would be going on this journey if I hadn’t found my boss so difficult. Jennifer Cox says this is common. Often, something happens, like a breakup or losing a job, that pushes people to travel. It took a little push for me to start, but now I feel excited about the next 12 months. No matter what happens, I will be happy that I took this chance. I believe many of us older backpackers feel the same way."

Georgina McGuiness took a long break from her job as a journalist and felt lost with all the new technology. In this text, she shares how she changed her home into a good place to work.
The Christmas before last, I turned 37 and realized that I needed to restart my career in journalism. I felt like my skills were old-fashioned, stuck in the 1980s when typewriters were common. I saw that many job ads wanted experience with desktop publishing, which I did not have. I thought it would be easier to host a seminar on nuclear physics than to use a computer for layout. I was not good with technology; even calculators confused me, and I didn’t know how to use the timer on the video.
I knew I had to change quickly. I thought leaving home before my children would be hard, but then I entered a competition in a local newspaper. To my surprise, my family and I won a computer package. We received a laptop for my husband and a personal computer for the family. We jumped into this new world of the Internet and started chatting with people from around the world. The children stopped watching TV, and I set up a small office in the kitchen with a phone, a fax machine, a CD-ROM, and a modem to connect to the Internet. I had everything I needed to work from home while still taking the kids to school.
My children were already good with computers from school, but I was nervous. I thought I would lose my work if I pressed the wrong button. I was wrong. I learned the basic skills I needed, and it was easier than I thought. With practice, I got better every day. I started writing articles for a magazine, contributing about two articles a month. I felt proud that I could balance work and family life.
How has the computer helped me? In school, my desk was always messy, and I often lost important papers. Now, the computer helps me stay organized. I can keep track of my income and expenses with spreadsheets, and I save time with ready-made invoices and letterheads. As a journalist, being online allows me to research stories, ask for information, and discuss working from home with people worldwide.
However, working from home has its downsides. I can feel lonely without face-to-face contact. There are also distractions, like household chores, and sometimes my children argue about who gets to use the computer. Still, many people in my neighborhood are buying computers, not just for learning and fun, but also for work. 
A report called PC Usage in UK Homes shows that home workers are often well-educated, around 38 years old, and most own a personal computer. Many have a CD-ROM, a laser printer, and a modem. I feel like I am doing well with my technology skills. One day, I might even send an article to a newspaper in Melbourne or publish my own magazine from home. The possibilities seem endless!"
CAE_59,C1,"**The Tartan Museum**
The Tartan Museum is located in Edinburgh, Scotland. Its modern buildings look very different from the historic area around it. Sally Varlow visited the museum just before it opened to see what it was like inside.
You cannot miss the new Museum of Scotland. It is on the corner of Chambers Street in Edinburgh, with a big yellow tower and unique buildings. Last winter, people had mixed feelings about the building. Some called it a ""masterpiece"" or ""stunning,"" while others were not so sure.
Now, as the inside is almost ready, people wonder if the exhibitions will be interesting. The museum tells many stories through its historic objects, and there is a timeline to help visitors understand. However, it does not let national pride take over the display of important items, like Mary Queen of Scots' jewels.
Dr. David Clarke, who is in charge of exhibitions, believes that visiting the museum should be enjoyable for everyone, not just experts. He wants to show the truth about history, so there are no fake scenes or displays. Visitors will see what experts know about the past.
The challenge is whether the stories of the objects can be told well with just explanation panels and multimedia displays. With less than three days before the opening, it is hard to tell. However, some things are clear. The views of Edinburgh Castle are amazing, and the galleries are designed to flow into each other, with pale walls and deep display cases. Natural light comes in through special windows, making it a pleasant space to explore.
The museum also has a Discovery Centre, thanks to a group of children aged 9 to 12 from all over Scotland. They wanted to create a fun experience, and while they could not have rides through the displays, they did get a hands-on area for kids.
On the top floor, there is a gallery that changes every three years. It features objects chosen by Scottish people that have had a big impact on life in Scotland during the twentieth century. Suggestions included an electric guitar, televisions, and favorite toys. While this idea is fun, it may not address more serious topics.
Overall, Dr. Clarke believes that objects can tell stories about the past better than anything else. The modern architecture of the museum looks great from the inside and the top, but whether it fits well in its location is still up for debate."

The end of print newspapers may take a long time. ""Transition"" is a nice word that means moving from one place to another. Change can be scary for some people, but it can also be a good thing. However, the change from print newspapers to online news is not easy. Many people believe that this change will happen eventually because print newspaper sales are going down, while visits to their websites are increasing. For example, newspapers like The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian have seen their print sales drop by 8% to 10% each year, but their websites are getting more visitors.
However, there are some things that do not fit this picture. A recent survey showed that the total number of newspapers sold around the world actually went up by 1.1% last year, reaching 512 million copies a day. While sales in Western countries have dropped, sales in Asia have increased. News magazines, which many think are struggling, also saw a 5.4% increase in sales.
The same is true for books. E-readers like Kindle are very popular, and their sales have increased a lot this year. But when bookstores looked at the sales of physical books, they found that the sales were only down by 0.4%. This shows that people are buying both e-books and physical books.
Many people think that young people are not reading newspapers anymore, but this is not completely true. The latest survey shows that nearly 5 million people aged 15 to 35 still read the main national newspapers. Different countries have different trends. In Britain, newspaper sales have dropped by 10.8%, but in Germany, the drop is only 7%, and in France, it is just 3.1%.
Media experts in America used to think that online advertising would help newspapers succeed online. But now, online advertising is actually going down. Many US newspapers have started charging for online access. The best way to get people to pay for online news seems to be to offer both a print copy and online access together. This means that print newspapers are still important for selling online subscriptions. Print ads also make much more money than online ads.
However, it is hard for newspaper companies to manage both print and online versions because it is complicated and expensive. But print newspapers still have a strong presence, and it is harder for them to be noticed online."
CAE_32,C1,"**Photographing People**
People are the most interesting subjects for photographs. A picture with a person is usually more engaging than one without. However, taking good photos of people can be challenging. The photographer must pay attention to actions, gestures, and expressions. Sometimes, just having a camera can make people act differently.
**A. Grouping People**  
When taking group photos, avoid straight lines. Ask people to stand at different angles and distances. You can also have some people sit or kneel in front so that all faces are visible.
**B. Posing for Pictures**  
People often feel stiff in front of a camera. Help them relax by suggesting comfortable positions, like folding their hands or putting them in their pockets.
**C. The Right Approach**  
Do not pretend you are not taking a picture when it is obvious you are. This can make people feel tense. Most people will agree to have their picture taken, but they might feel self-conscious. You may need to guide them to look at the camera.
**D. Eye Contact**  
A photo looks better if the subject is looking at the camera. Ask them to look into the lens, but they don’t have to smile. If they seem distracted, remind them just before you take the picture. You can also say something funny to get a natural reaction.
**E. Candid Concentration**  
Instead of looking directly at the camera, the subject can focus on something else in the picture. This can make the photo feel more natural, as if you are capturing a moment without them noticing.
**F. Expressions and Gestures**  
Expressions and gestures tell us a lot about a person. A laughing child can make viewers smile, while a sad face can create sympathy. Look for common expressions like shrugs, winks, or smiles; they are a quick way to communicate feelings.
**G. Situation Interest**  
While close-up shots of a person can be powerful, the background can add more context. When including a background, make sure it does not distract from the subject. A wide-angle lens can help make the subject stand out.
**H. Interaction**  
Good photos often happen when people are interacting, like talking or laughing together. Look for moments of connection, such as eye contact or a friendly gesture.
**I. People and Places**  
Many photos of people are taken during trips. To improve these pictures, use a wide-angle lens and step back to include the background, like a building or a mountain. Make sure the people are close enough to be the main focus without hiding the background.
**J. To Pose or Not to Pose?**  
Decide why you want to take the picture. If it’s to remember someone you met on holiday, a clear posed picture is good. However, family photos can be more fun if they capture real moments instead of stiff poses. Candid shots often bring back memories better than posed ones."
CAE_65,C1,"Under Sarah's Spell**
Sarah Janson is a trompe-l'oeil artist. This means she creates paintings that trick the eye and look very real. In this interview with Joanna Watt, we learn more about her.
Not many artists do not sign their work unless someone asks them to. Sarah Janson is one of these artists. She does not care about being seen as a great artist. She believes, ""It's not the artist who is important, but the work."" Sarah is very humble and would like people to think her paintings create themselves. This makes it hard for her to do an interview. She says, ""I just don't like to shout about myself,"" and she gets nervous when asked to be photographed.
After a little time, Sarah feels more comfortable, and the interview becomes fun and interesting. She has been a trompe-l'oeil artist for sixteen years. Before that, she studied drawing at art school for two years and worked in graphic illustration. However, she was not happy with illustration and started working with a decorator named Jim Smart. He asked her to create one trompe-l'oeil painting, and that changed everything for her. She decided to work on her own, not knowing exactly what would happen, but feeling it was the right choice.
Sarah's skills in observing details helped her become a good trompe-l'oeil artist. She says, ""People often ask me where they can learn trompe-l'oeil. But no one can teach you. Trompe-l'oeil is the school of life. It's all about observation."" She believes that you are always learning. She is honest about her weaknesses, saying, ""I can't paint bread; it always looks like grey concrete."" She also struggles with math, especially when she had to measure for a big project at Lulworth Castle. She thought, ""You're not Michelangelo. Who do you think you are?""
Sarah often talks about herself in the third person. After finishing a big ceiling, she thought, ""Well, I didn't do it, she did."" Her trompe-l'oeil paintings are very special and different from others. She has many important projects for companies and private clients. Much of her work is inspired by buildings. For example, she created a trompe-l'oeil dining room based on a Venetian palace and a painting that makes it look like you can walk into two more rooms.
However, there is a risk with trompe-l'oeil art. Once people understand the trick, they might lose interest. Sarah knows this and says, ""Trompe-l'oeil has to do two things. First, it must draw you in; it's got to trick you. Secondly, it has to hold you and engage your imagination."" She believes that trompe-l'oeil art should also be personal for the client. ""I love the interaction with clients; that is where the ideas are born,"" she explains. Some clients have clear ideas, while others do not. She listens to them and tries to understand their imagination. Many clients become friends because she spends a lot of time with them while working.
Sarah appreciates her clients, saying, ""I am very grateful for the mad ones who have let me loose on their walls."" They are happy with her work, which is why she is always busy, even if she does not like to talk about her talent. ""I really don't like to shout about myself,"" she says again. ""Like my work, I am very restrained. I don't want it to shout. You become bored with things that shout."" This may be true, but you could never get bored with Sarah or her art. Her work deserves to be more well-known, and I am happy to share it."
CAE_61,C1,"**Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success**
Daniel Goleman talks about the important ""people skills"" needed to succeed in our jobs.
A. The rules for work are changing. We are now judged not only by how smart we are or how well we are trained, but also by how we manage ourselves and interact with others. This new way of judging is used to decide who gets hired and who does not. It helps to show who is likely to be a top performer and who may not do as well. These new rules are important for our future job opportunities. They focus on social skills and personal qualities, like being proactive, understanding others, being flexible, and convincing people. These skills are part of what we call emotional intelligence.
B. In a time when job security is low, personal qualities are becoming more important at work. For many years, people have talked about these qualities using different names, like ""character"" or ""soft skills."" Now, we have a clearer understanding of these skills, which we call ""emotional intelligence."" This means being aware of and managing our own feelings and the feelings of others, and using these feelings to guide our actions. In the workplace, emotional intelligence includes self-awareness, self-control, motivation, empathy, and good social skills. Some people think it just means ""being nice,"" but sometimes it means being honest, even if it is uncomfortable. It is not about expressing all our feelings freely, but about managing them so we can work well together.
C. More businesses are realizing that encouraging emotional intelligence is very important for good management. The more complicated the job, the more emotional intelligence matters. If someone lacks these skills, it can affect their ability to use their knowledge and skills. Many people have succeeded despite having low emotional intelligence, but as work becomes more complex and requires teamwork, companies that work well together have an advantage. In today’s workplace, where teamwork and good customer service are important, emotional intelligence is essential for success in every job around the world.
D. Unlike IQ, which does not change much, emotional intelligence can grow as we learn from our experiences. Studies show that most people become better at managing their emotions, motivating themselves, and understanding others over time. This growth in emotional intelligence is often called maturity. We can learn these skills and use them to help us in our careers, especially when job stability is uncertain. Emotional intelligence is not a magic solution for companies that are not competitive, and it does not guarantee success. However, if we ignore the human side of work, nothing else will work as well as it could."
CAE_52,C1,"'Should the media make money from content they do not own? Digital cameras and camera phones have made it easier to take pictures of important news events. Social media has changed how people share these photos. Now, some journalists look at social networks for images when news happens quickly. However, some reporters have used photos from users without asking for permission. There are rules that say images on social media can be used without permission in special cases or when there is strong public interest, but people still argue about whether this is right. Research shows that about one in ten people would take pictures or videos of a news event, which means user-generated content (UGC) is important for the future of the media. To keep a good relationship with the public, the media should make sure that people are paid fairly for their work and that they always ask for permission.'"
CAE_28,C1,"Ancient Chinese Medicine in the West**
Acupuncture is a practice that is over two thousand years old. It comes from traditional Chinese medicine, which also includes herbal medicine, massage, diet, and exercise. Acupuncture is often used to help with pain, and many doctors in the West use it for this purpose. 
**A. What is it about?**  
Traditional Chinese medicine believes that health is when the mind, body, and spirit are in balance. They say that energy, called Qi (pronounced ""chee""), flows through the body along paths called meridians. There are twelve main meridians connected to different organs, and many smaller ones that carry Qi to every part of the body. If the flow of Qi is blocked or weak, a person may feel weak or become ill. When you visit an acupuncturist, they will check your pulses, look at your tongue, and ask about your health, feelings, and habits. They use very thin needles that go into the skin and may also use heat from herbs or pressure on certain points to help the flow of Qi.
**B. Over three hundred points**  
The points where needles are placed are connected to the meridians and may not be near the area that hurts. People often feel a mild ache or tingling when the needle is moved. This can be done by hand or with a machine. Acupuncturists believe this feeling means the needle has reached the Qi. There are over three hundred points on the main meridians and many more that are used less often.
**C. Science explains it**  
Even though not all doctors believe in traditional Chinese medicine, many accept that acupuncture can help with pain. Scientists have found some reasons why it might work. For example, they think that stimulating certain nerves can block pain signals from reaching the brain. Some believe that acupuncture can release natural pain-relieving chemicals in the body.
**D. What type of pain can be treated?**  
Many people with long-term pain try acupuncture when other treatments do not work. It is often used for back pain, sports injuries, arthritis, headaches, and pain after surgery. Acupuncturists also say they can help with menstrual pain, facial nerve pain, and pain in terminally ill patients.
**E. Modern use for an ancient treatment**  
Although acupuncture has been used in China for a long time, using it instead of anesthesia during surgery started in the 1950s. This helped convince some doctors outside China that acupuncture is effective. In China today, acupuncture is used in many types of surgeries, including tonsillectomies and heart surgery. It can be used alone, with electrical stimulation, or with medicine. Some people say it reduces pain, but results can vary. Acupuncturists say that acupuncture does not have the side effects of regular anesthesia, and recovery is faster.
**F. Always effective?**  
Like many alternative therapies, it is hard to study acupuncture. However, studies show that 50 to 80 percent of people find it helpful for chronic pain. Acupuncturists agree with this success rate. They know it may not work for everyone, and some people respond better than others. For long-term pain, it usually takes six to seven visits to feel real relief, but some improvement can happen after just two or three visits.
**G. A different approach to pain**  
Western and Chinese medicine see pain differently. Acupuncturists look at the whole person, not just the pain. They spend time diagnosing the problem and looking for weaknesses in the Qi. They also consider outside factors that may affect the pain, like weather or the type of pain (sharp, dull, constant, etc.). This is different from how most doctors approach pain.
**H. Traditional or not?**  
Some doctors have training in traditional acupuncture, while others, including many general practitioners, prefer scientific explanations. Traditional acupuncturists believe that using traditional methods can lead to better and longer-lasting results, but this is hard to measure in studies. It is important to choose a qualified acupuncturist, who should refer you to a medical doctor if needed."

P.D. James is a famous crime writer. Her full name is Phyllis Dorothy James. She seems calm and confident, but she is actually quite shy. She says that Adam Dalgliesh, the detective in her books, is like her, or how she would be if she were a man. Dalgliesh likes to solve crimes alone, just like P.D. James prefers to write alone. She needs privacy to write and can do it anywhere as long as she is alone.
P.D. James does not agree that she is the best-known crime writer in Britain, even though many people read her 12 detective novels. She admires her friend Ruth Rendell and enjoys her books, especially those written under the name Barbara Vine. She also likes books by women writers like Iris Murdoch and Anita Brookner, but she also reads male authors like Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh, who she thinks were great writers.
P.D. James became successful later in life. She was 42 when her first crime novel, Cover Her Face, was published. She was born in Oxford and grew up in Cambridge. She met her husband there, who was a student. She chose Cambridge as the setting for one of her books, An Unsuitable Job For A Woman.
Her life has not always been easy. Her husband, Connor Bantry White, returned from World War II very sick. She had to work long hours to support him and their two daughters, Clare and Jane. Even though she had many ideas for stories, she did not have time to write. Her husband’s parents helped take care of the children during this tough time.
While working full-time for the National Health Service, she used her strong organizational skills. She managed five clinics and then worked for 11 years at the Home Office, first in the Police Department and then in the Criminal Law section. While working in forensic science, she became used to seeing dead bodies. However, she was not interested in death itself; she liked the challenge of writing a crime novel. She has always enjoyed reading detective stories and wanted to be a writer.
P.D. James did not want to write about her own difficult life. She thought writing detective stories was a good way to learn how to be a serious novelist. She realized that she could follow the rules of a classic detective story and still write a meaningful novel about people. She believes that writing detective stories helps to bring order to chaos. Solving a crime shows that life is important, even if the person is not likable. She thinks that nobody really likes violence."

**The Pen is Mightier than the Psychoanalyst**
The study of handwriting to understand a person's character is becoming more popular. In some countries, if you apply for a job, you will likely be asked to provide a sample of your handwriting. This handwriting sample can help decide if you are suitable for the job. Handwriting analysis, also known as graphology, is considered a real science in many places. Researchers believe it can help show certain health problems, like heart disease and cancer, and can reveal emotional issues.
More companies are using handwriting analysis to help with job interviews. Many big companies now hire graphologists to look at the handwriting of job candidates. However, many doctors and psychiatrists are not sure about the value of graphology. Patricia Marne, a professional graphologist for over 20 years, thinks they should take it more seriously. She believes handwriting can show psychological traits and some medical conditions. She says, ""Handwriting can indicate social class and intelligence. It can also help decide if a person should focus on arts or sciences and if they are honest or tricky.""
According to Ms. Marne, graphology can help identify possible criminal behavior. She says, ""Criminals often have disturbed handwriting, which can be poorly shaped. Many criminals come from difficult backgrounds and have emotional problems. This can show in childish handwriting or in writing letters multiple times."" 
Ms. Marne claims she can tell if people are honest or manipulative just by looking at their handwriting. She says young male offenders often have high letters, which means they live in a fantasy world and dream of success. Graphologists can also see if someone is under a lot of stress or has violent tendencies. Handwriting can even help predict if someone might think about suicide. 
She explains that heart and lung problems can sometimes be seen in handwriting. ""You cannot make a diagnosis from just one sample unless the writing is very shaky. But if the handwriting changes over time or if the signature looks different, it could mean something serious is happening."" A big emotional upset can also change a person's signature for a short time.
Ms. Marne says handwriting can show other psychological traits. For example, people whose letters connect in a thread-like way may be clever but tricky. Those who write mostly in capital letters might be hiding their true selves. Light pressure in writing shows sensitivity, while unique handwriting shows confidence and creativity. Disconnected writing often means a person is a loner. Very small signatures can show insecurity, and circles over the letter ""i"" can mean someone wants attention.
Ms. Marne believes it takes six years of study to analyze handwriting well, along with empathy and intuition. She thinks more research is needed to make graphology a proper science. She believes this will happen soon. ""It is actually more accurate than psychoanalysis because you can learn a lot about a person’s history and emotional problems without asking them questions that they might not answer truthfully.""
However, even though this information is interesting, there is not much strong evidence to support these claims. Some psychiatrists are very critical of graphology. They say handwriting is just a result of education and the way writing is taught, and it does not have any other meaning."

**Is your office working well?** Fresh air and good chairs are important for a happy and healthy workplace, according to a new survey. We visited four different offices to see how healthy and happy they are. We had three experts with us: a building health consultant, an ergonomist (who studies working conditions), and an occupational psychologist. Here are their opinions.
**Office A: Advertising Agency**  
*Building Health Consultant:* This office is very simple; it has no central heating and no mechanical ventilation. The windows open to the street. It is surprising that this office works well, but the small team of seven people seems happy. They change the environment by opening doors or using electric heaters, just like at home. This may be the reason they are happy; they have created a comfortable working space without too many rules.  
*Ergonomist:* The furniture is mismatched and some pieces are not good for sitting. Many chairs are old and broken. However, the workers have different tasks, like meeting clients and making presentations, which helps them avoid boredom and tiredness.  
*Occupational Psychologist:* The staff enjoy the variety of work and the size of the office. It is small enough to know what others are doing but big enough to work alone. The office looks nice and is fun, showing both efficiency and creativity.
**Office B: News Service**  
*Building Health Consultant:* This office is not very exciting, but it is comfortable and the staff do not dislike it. The air quality is good, partly because there is a No Smoking policy.  
*Ergonomist:* The company has hired an ergonomist, so the chairs are good and the lighting and computers are fine. The space is okay, but the layout could be better. However, the office feels impersonal with plain grey walls.  
*Occupational Psychologist:* The walls are mostly bare, except for some planners and a poster about maternity rights. Most staff have worked there for at least five years and relationships are good. The office could be better if desks were arranged to help share information.
**Office C: Bank**  
*Building Health Consultant:* This office gets mixed reactions from workers. It feels like being in a glass box, where people can see each other. The air is not stale, even with smokers nearby.  
*Ergonomist:* The office is very standard and not inspiring. The desks are okay, but some chairs are not good for computer work. The computer screens are not set up well for modern use.  
*Occupational Psychologist:* The staff support each other and have good technology. There are many awards on display. The office has a serious look with wood paneling and brown carpet, but it is busy with activity.
**Office D: Newspaper**  
*Building Health Consultant:* This office has many problems. The air conditioning does not work well, causing big temperature changes. The space is messy, and many people do not have enough desk space. It is very dusty, and the roof collects dust that falls on people below.  
*Ergonomist:* The furniture looks more like it belongs in a workshop than an office. Many chairs are not good for people using computers, especially shorter people. Most chairs are old and do not adjust well.  
*Occupational Psychologist:* The office has old brown chairs and dirty carpets. It needs a good cleaning, and individual successes should be recognized more. The air conditioning needs to be fixed because there are many smokers. When we visited, there were not many conversations; everyone seemed stressed and focused on deadlines. The company should encourage teamwork."
CAE_38,C1,"**Chewing Gum Culture**
Chewing gum is popular and people in America chew about 12 million sticks every day. This ancient habit has become a big business. Each stick of gum has less than ten calories, but it is considered food and must follow the rules of the American Food and Drug Administration.
Today, most gum is made from synthetic materials, which means it is not natural. These materials include pine resins and softeners that help keep the flavor and improve the texture. However, this was not always true. The ancient Greeks chewed a gum-like substance from the bark of the mastic tree, which grows mainly in Greece and Turkey. Women in Greece used mastic gum to clean their teeth and freshen their breath.
American colonists learned to chew resin from spruce trees, following the example of the Native Americans in New England. In the early 1800s, pieces of spruce for chewing were sold in the eastern United States, making it the first commercial chewing gum in the country.
Modern chewing gum started in the late 1860s when chicle was discovered. Chicle is a milky substance from the sapodilla tree found in Central America. Gum made from chicle was smoother and more enjoyable to chew, leading to the growth of a large industry. However, it has been hard to grow sapodilla trees in large amounts. As the chewing gum market grew, companies began to use synthetic alternatives.
Today, only a few chicle gatherers, called chicleros, still collect chicle. They have a difficult and dangerous job, walking for miles in very humid conditions. They face dangers like poisonous snakes and insects. The chicle fly is especially troublesome because it lays eggs in the gatherers' ears and noses. Despite these risks, experienced chicleros climb trees to collect the sap, which they carry back to a camp. There, they boil the sap until it becomes sticky and forms bricks.
Life at the camp is not easy. The workers eat a boring diet mostly made of maize and drink a local alcohol made from sugar cane. Even though their work is hard, chicleros worry about losing their jobs. Not long ago, the United States imported 7,000 tonnes of chicle each year from Central America. Last year, only 200 tonnes were collected in the whole Yucatan peninsula in Mexico.
As chewing gum sales have increased, manufacturers have turned to synthetic materials to save money and meet demand. Gum producers are also finding clever ways to sell their products. They claim that chewing gum helps people relax, gives them energy, and reduces stress. During both world wars, soldiers were often given gum. One of the biggest claims is that chewing gum can help reduce tooth decay. 
When we eat, plaque acid forms, which can harm our teeth. Our saliva helps protect our teeth by neutralizing this acid and providing minerals. Gum makers say that chewing for 20 minutes can increase saliva flow. Research is ongoing to create new textures and flavors. Glycerine and other vegetable oils are now used to make the gum base. Most new flavors are artificial, but some still use natural ingredients. In America, 137 square kilometers are used just to grow mint for the two most popular chewing gums in the world."

Sue Brown is a hotel inspector. Christopher Middleton watched her during an inspection. One minute into the inspection, things are already going wrong for the Globe Hotel, but the staff do not know it yet. The receptionist is busy talking on the phone and does not notice Sue and Christopher. Sue whispers, ""She hasn't even acknowledged us. Very poor."" This is a common mistake that Sue has seen many times in her 11 years as an inspector. She expects better from a hotel with three red stars, which means it is one of the best hotels.
Before they even enter, Sue feels something is wrong. The entrance is through a door with a buzzer, and the hallway is long and empty. ""This is not what I expected,"" she says. Things get worse when the receptionist says, ""We have no record of your booking."" There are 15 rooms in the hotel, but only three are occupied. The room they are offered is not good. It is stuffy, and there is a big hole in the wall behind the wardrobe.
When Sue started her job, people called her ""The Woman in Black,"" even though she never wore black. The next morning, after paying her bill, she tells the hotel manager, Robin Greaves, who looks scared when he sees her. He quickly apologizes for a bad smell in the lounge. ""We think there’s a blocked drain,"" he says. Sue suggests that he should guide guests to another lounge instead of the one with the smell. Greaves takes notes and looks worried. He has only been at the hotel for five months and finds it hard to believe Sue when she says her feedback will help the hotel in the long run.
Not everything is bad. Sue praises Emma, the assistant manager, and Trudy, the waitress, who shared interesting information about the hotel’s 400-year history. The dinner was also good enough to keep the hotel’s two-rosette food rating. Greaves asks, ""What do we need to do to get three rosettes?"" Sue replies, ""Don’t serve a pudding that collapses."" Greaves looks disappointed.
Sue's job is to tell the hotel what is wrong, even if it is hard to say. She remembers a time when a woman complained that Sue got her son fired. All Sue could say was that he served her apple pie with his fingers. Sometimes, she gets letters with false complaints about her. ""You get used to it, but it still hurts,"" she says.
Sue must tell the hotel her findings verbally and also send a written report. The hotels pay for her advice. Even though it is a tough job, being recognized with red stars makes it worth it. Greaves is relieved to hear that Sue will not recommend taking away the Globe's red stars. The bad news is that another inspector will come back in two months to check if the problems have been fixed. ""Good,"" Greaves says with a forced smile. ""We’ll look forward to that."""

Doug Scott is a mountaineer who shares his experiences of climbing the highest mountains on each continent, known as the Seven Summits. He started this journey later in life and will tell his story in the order he climbed them.
A. **Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)**  
Doug and his climbing partner, Dougal Haston, were in a snow cave below the summit. Dougal started talking about sleeping bags, which Doug found strange since they were alone. He thought it was because of low oxygen. Doug began talking to his own feet, which were getting cold. They were worried about how to survive well. Over the next two days, Doug remembered their time on the summit ridge and felt confident climbing with Dougal. He focused on finding a good rhythm to reach the top.
B. **Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)**  
This mountain is known to be very dangerous. In April 1976, Doug and Dougal arrived at the Kahiltna Glacier and spent four days carrying equipment and food. After the first day, they realized how hard their climb would be. They followed a route from 1967 but decided to take a new path to the summit. They climbed with everything on their backs, which was a new way to climb this mountain. After three days, Doug's sleeping bag was wet, and they were both struggling. Because of the low air pressure, it felt like they were much higher than they really were. Finally, they reached the summit and felt victorious.
C. **Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m)**  
In September 1976, Doug and his friend Paul Braithwaite flew to Nairobi to climb Mt. Kenya. However, they ended up climbing Kilimanjaro instead. They got lost in the thick jungle and were worried about finding water. On the second day, they found some arrows on trees and a rock pool, which made them very happy. They tried to climb a steep wall but decided to take a safer route to the summit.
D. **Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)**  
In January 1992, Doug and his wife, Sharu, arrived at Punta del Inca. They met a guide named Phil who invited them to join his group to climb Aconcagua. After waiting for bad weather to pass, they started climbing. The Polish Glacier was icy and windy, so they chose to take a different route to avoid the glacier. They walked with many other climbers to the summit. The wind was strong, and they camped outside before heading back to base camp. There, they met a group planning to climb the Seven Summits, which made Doug think about doing the same.
E. **Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)**  
Doug learned that climbing Vinson Massif could be funded by guiding others. In November 1992, his team traveled to the South Pole. During this time, the sun never sets, and the air is very fresh. On December 7, they started their climb. Despite strong winds and very low temperatures, they all reached the top in eight hours. However, they could only see a few meters because of a storm.
F. **Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)**  
In the summer of 1994, Doug's team gathered in St. Petersburg. When they arrived at Elbrus, they had to pay a fee to their guide. After a few days of getting used to the altitude, they took a cable car up to 3,900m and then walked to a refuge at 4,200m. Two days later, they faced strong winds while climbing. They thought they reached the summit but found there was more to climb. They returned to the refuge and then descended the volcano.
G. **Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)**  
On their trip to Carstensz, Doug and his team wanted to create a new climbing route and spend time with the local Dani people. They were warned about possible dangers, but they continued their journey. On May 12, the weather got better, and they climbed. Doug reached the summit by 11 am and received a standing ovation for completing his seventh summit. Mission accomplished!"

**Style Merchants**
Style is important in our lives today, from our clothes to home decoration and accessories. Jo Foley shares some fashion trends for this year.
**Ned Ingham: Dress Designer**  
Ned Ingham creates beautiful and romantic wedding dresses. He suggests that people should avoid traditional, stiff dresses and the frilly style. Instead, he recommends simpler designs. Ingham has been drawing and designing wedding dresses since he was a child. At 16, he went to fashion school to learn how to make clothes. You don’t have to be a bride to wear an Ingham dress; he also designs long evening dresses in modern colors and fabrics. For those who prefer classic styles, he offers a navy-blue summer suit, which has been popular for many years, but he makes it look fresh and new.
**Sally Quail: Jeweller**  
Sally Quail used to work for an art dealer but has no formal training in jewellery. She started designing her own engagement ring when she couldn’t find one she liked. This led her to become a designer in 1990. Now, many famous people wear her jewellery. Her style features large semi-precious stones set in gold, creating beautiful necklaces, bracelets, and rings inspired by the 18th century. Recently, she has started using diamonds. ""I wanted a diamond, and that is when I began working with them,"" says 36-year-old Quail.
**Lily Grimson: Handbag Designer**  
Lily Grimson has been in the fashion business for four years and has already had two of her bags chosen for a big design exhibition. All of her bags are handmade in the UK. A Grimson handbag is not just a bag; it is stylish and made from high-quality materials like calfskin and silk. Her bags are special because they combine style and care.
**Peter Little: Hairdresser**  
For over 20 years, Peter Little has styled the hair of many famous people. He believes that most women want hair that looks natural and is easy to manage at home. His goal is to make sure his clients look like they haven’t just come from a salon. However, his services are expensive, costing £250 for the first appointment, and there is a long waiting list. Peter has also created his own line of hairdryers and styling tools, so people can style their hair at home.
**Penny Pratt: Florist**  
Penny Pratt runs a small flower shop and also works as a flower consultant for supermarkets and restaurants. She has no formal training in floristry and left her teaching job 10 years ago to try something new. Her modern flower arrangements have won many design awards, helping her start her own London Flower School. She has also given successful lectures in Japan and the USA. She believes that flower arrangements should be simple but strong, with fewer leaves. For wedding bouquets, she advises that all flowers should be the same type."

**Five-Star Luxury and Modern Technology**
The Merrion Hotel is a new five-star hotel in Dublin. It was created by changing four large old houses into a hotel. This took a lot of research and nearly two years of work. The hotel has the latest technology to help both the staff and the guests.
Peter MacCann, the General Manager, wants his staff to know the guests' names. For more details about what guests like, he uses the hotel’s computer system. This system helps the hotel give special service to returning guests. It cost £250,000 to set up, but MacCann believes it will be worth it over time. He is happy with how well it works and the services it provides. For example, if a guest asks for certain music CDs during their first stay, those CDs will be ready for them when they come back.
Many hotel guests often complain about room temperature. The hotel has a high-tech system to control this. Guests can change the temperature in their rooms by three degrees around the normal 18°C. The front desk can also adjust the temperature anywhere between 14°C and 25°C.
Business guests will find the technology in their rooms very useful. MacCann thinks that about 65% of the hotel’s business will come from this group. To meet their needs, the hotel has put a business center in each room. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that can also copy and print, and a video-conferencing system.
Technology changes quickly, so the hotel has prepared for future improvements. They have added extra cables for new technology. The televisions are rented, so they can be replaced with newer models when needed. DVD recorders can also be updated.
Even with all this technology, MacCann wants guests to feel comfortable. The hotel has 145 large and well-furnished bedrooms that are welcoming. There is also a swimming pool, a gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a beautiful garden.
The food at the hotel is very important. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, who has two Michelin stars, moved his restaurant to the Merrion. He has designed a new kitchen and improved the restaurant. The hotel also has better parking than before. This partnership is good for both the chef and the hotel. With great technology and a skilled staff, the Merrion Hotel is likely to be successful."
FCE_24,B2,"An Eye for Detail**
Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. The large garden around her house gives her many ideas for her art. It is full of her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wildly and spread all over the garden. The two long flower beds along the path in the garden have a beautiful mix of colors and shapes. This is partly because the previous owners were good gardeners and left plants that Susan liked. She also kept the gardener, Danny. 
Susan says, ""In fact, it was really his garden."" She and Danny got along well. At first, he would say some of her ideas were not worth it, but when she told him she wanted to paint them, he understood her vision. 
Susan likes to focus on painting individual plants instead of the whole garden. Sometimes she paints a group of plants, but usually, she picks one flower and takes it to her studio. ""I don't set everything up at once,"" she explains. ""I take one flower out and paint it, which can take a few days. Then I bring in another one and build the painting that way. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.""
Her busiest time is spring and early summer when the tulips bloom, followed by the poppies. ""They all come out together, and you're so busy,"" she says. But she also finds beauty in how flowers change as they decay. For example, with tulips, ""you bring them in and put them in water, then leave them for a day, and they change shape. They open up and look amazing. At first, they seem boring, but they change all the time.""
Susan has always loved plants. ""I studied botany in school and collected wildflowers from the countryside,"" she says. ""I didn't like garden flowers back then; I thought they looked fake, like silk or plastic flowers. I was fascinated by how wildflowers could grow in tough places, like cracks in rocks.""
Today, her garden has many plants from faraway places, but they look at home there. She has a relaxed attitude towards her garden, like a caring aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don’t break anything. 
With two art exhibitions coming up and plenty of inspiration in her garden, Susan has found it hard to spend time working in the garden. She now has an extra gardener, but she knows that to stay connected to her art, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""
FCE_13,B2,"**Text:**
Many trees in the Brackham area fell during the strong storms in March. The town lost two big lime trees from the old market square. This change made the town center look very different, which upset some of the older residents. One of these residents was Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, who was the head of the local police. However, during the storm, Pelham was not in a good condition to notice the changes because he was very sick with bronchitis for the first time in his life.
When he first felt pain in his head and tightness in his chest, his wife, Molly, wanted him to see a doctor. But Pelham thought the police needed him and did not listen to her. This made him forget things and made him more irritable. Eventually, his colleague, Sergeant Lloyd, took him to the doctor. By then, he was too weak to argue. Soon after, he got his medicine and went home, where Molly sent him straight to bed.
On Thursday morning, when Molly told him that the walnut tree in their garden had fallen during the night, Pelham could not believe it. Later that evening, he asked if the house was damaged. He was relieved to hear it was not and then covered himself with the sheets. It was not until Saturday, when the medicine started to work and he felt better, that he noticed the living room looked different without the walnut tree.
The Pelhams' house was large and had a big garden. Pelham was happy he bought it because the garden felt private. But now, the storm had changed how he saw things. Before, the walnut tree made the living room look nice with interesting light and shadows. But without the tree, the room looked too bright, showing the old furniture they had brought from their last house. The view from the window was not nice either. The tall house next door, which was hidden by the tree, was now visible. It had ugly purple bricks and many windows that seemed to watch the Pelhams.
""Doesn't it look terrible?"" Pelham said to his wife. But Molly, standing in the doorway, seemed more happy than upset. ""That's what I've been saying since we moved here. We need to buy a new sofa, no matter the cost."""
FCE_16,B2,"Living in the Valley**
We had been living in our valley for sixteen months when we first noticed the dangers in the hills around us. It was the year when the storms came early, even before November ended. Until then, we felt safe in our valley, protected by the hills. Soon, snow began to fall. Within a day, it was about 15 centimeters deep. It almost blocked our lane and made the path by the stream slippery and dangerous. But in the hills, the snow was much deeper and stayed longer. The wind was very strong up there. In our valley, we only felt sudden gusts of wind; the trees swayed, but their branches stayed strong. Still, we knew we had to be careful.
The snow and wind were annoying, but they did not really worry us. The river, the Ryburn, which usually flowed gently, was what we feared the most. It reminded us of what could happen if the water from the hills was not controlled by the dams built many years ago. Soon, the snow started to melt. Day by day, we saw dark clouds gather over the hills to the west. These clouds looked dangerous and warned us of what was coming. We had watched the sky enough; now we began to watch the river, which was getting fuller and wilder every day. The snow melted as more rain fell from the clouds, but the reservoir in the hills was filling up and getting close to overflowing.
Then it happened - for the first time in years, the reservoir overflowed. It was like a small Niagara Falls, as the water rushed over the dam and into the stream below. The river looked wild as the water poured down towards our cottage. Just a couple of meters from our home, the stream was deeper than we had ever seen, rushing angrily at its banks. For three days, we hoped it would stay below its edge. Luckily, our hopes were answered as the dam held, and the water began to go down.
In the past, before the dam was built, the river had flooded nearby villages many times. Now, the dam controls the river, and usually everything is fine. The water from the hills, caused by snow and heavy rain, stays behind the dam, with only a little overflow sometimes. Because of this protection, we can enjoy the big clouds over the valley and feel safe in our home."

Film critic Mark Adams looks back at his ten years of work as a film critic for a newspaper called The Front Page. Writing articles about films for The Front Page was my first real job. Before that, I wrote reviews for novels in other newspapers, films for a magazine, and did some work for the radio. That is how I met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page. He also worked in radio and television. He hired me, but Tom was not mainly a journalist, so he was not very careful when choosing his staff.
At first, Tom wanted a team of critics to cover different art forms like books, TV, theatre, film, and radio. We would have a weekly lunch to choose what to write about from the artistic material Tom wanted us to cover. There would also be guests to make it more social. It felt like a dream to be part of a new newspaper. I thought it was strange that a new paper could start in a busy market. I even thought a rich person wanted to help me and was pretending to hire me because I lacked confidence. The first time I saw someone reading the newspaper on the London Underground with one of my reviews, I felt very shy.
Tom's idea for a team of critics did not work out. It was a good idea, but we did not meet as planned, so we communicated by phone. It turned out that people preferred to have one reviewer for each subject, so I chose to focus on film. Without Tom's help, we would not have the current setup, where I write a long weekly piece about one film. I like this way of working. I would not enjoy the usual film critic job, which means watching every new film. That routine would make me bored quickly. I would not want to sit in a screening room on a Monday morning thinking, ""What terrible film do I have to watch now?"" 
The time I have allows me to develop my ideas or, if the week is not interesting, to create something from nothing. But what is my role in the public eye? I think people choose films based on the stars, the advertising, or the director. Some people are loyal to certain types of films. It is rare for someone who dislikes westerns to buy a ticket for one after reading a review, or for a romantic film lover to avoid a love story because of a review. So, if a film review is not really a guide for consumers, what is it? I do not feel I have to be ""right"" about a movie. I also do not think there should be a set number of ""great"" or ""bad"" films each year. All I need to do is present my opinion. I am not a judge, and I do not want to be one."

Why would a schoolgirl want to swim 1500 meters, cycle 40 kilometers, and then run 10 kilometers? Because ""it's fun."" 
Melanie Sears is a teenager who loves endurance sports. She is looking for a training partner for triathlons, preferably another girl. The partner should enjoy running long distances (like 15 kilometers), swimming in cold water, and cycling long distances (100 kilometers). It is important to be able to do all three sports without taking a break.
Triathlons are becoming very popular in the Olympics. Many people watch athletes swim 1500 meters, cycle 40 kilometers, and then run 10 kilometers without stopping. It looks hard, but why do triathletes push themselves so much? Melanie, who is 17 and does well in school, has not yet learned the usual answers about personal satisfaction and mental challenges that many athletes say.
""You swim 1500 meters, then run out of the water and jump on your bike, still wet. Of course, then you freeze. After the 40-kilometer bike ride, you have to run 10 kilometers, which is long when you are tired. But it's great fun, and it's all worth it in the end,"" she says.
Melanie entered her first triathlon when she was 14. ""I won the junior section, but I was the only junior there. It seemed easy, and I waved at my friends as I went around."" Feeling confident, she entered the National Championships. She had the second fastest swim and the fastest run, but she did not win. ""I was following a man, and suddenly we ended up in the sea. We realized we had gone the wrong way. I ended up cycling 20 kilometers too far. I cried while running."" But she did not give up and is determined to keep trying. ""Sometimes I wish I could stop because then the pain would be over, but I am afraid that if I stop once, I will want to stop again.""
Steve Trew, the sport's director of coaching, admires her determination. ""I tested her fitness, and she worked so hard on the running machine that it finally threw her off into a wall. She gave it everything, but most people stop when they can't go any further. She just kept going.""
Melanie was the top junior in this year's European Triathlon Championships, finishing 13th. ""I was almost as good as the top three in swimming and running, but much slower at cycling. That's why I'm working hard on it."" She is trying to convince her parents to buy a special bike for £2,000 (with a £1,000 discount) so she can compete in national 25 km and 100 km races later this year. 
However, her tough training has made her a bit of a recluse. ""I don't have a social life,"" she says. ""I'm not a party person. After two hours of hard swimming on Friday nights, I just want to sleep. But I call and write to the other girls on the team."" What do they talk about? Boys? Clothes? ""No, we talk about our times in races.""
Where will all this focus lead her? Melanie has tried other events, like the triathlon ""sprint,"" where you only swim 750 meters, cycle 20 kilometers, and run 5 kilometers. She wants to enter even tougher events than the triathlon. ""The big problem is, I have no one my age to train with,"" she says."
FCE_70,B2,"The Collectors**
Amanda Roy writes about collecting and why many people enjoy this hobby. I have always loved collecting, and one in three adults also collects things. Collecting is a world of passion and excitement. However, if you want to collect something, remember: you should love the object. 
People have collected items for a long time. In the past, early humans collected pebbles and wore them as necklaces. They liked the shapes and colors of the pebbles. Today, children still collect stones and seashells because they are beautiful. 
I have been collecting all my life. I collect many things, from flowers like tulips to pottery and paintings. My first collection was stones from my parents' garden. When I was six, I went to a school in a cold, windy place in England. When my parents visited, they took me to a local museum full of interesting objects collected by people in the past. I found these objects fascinating. 
Many adults share my interest in collecting. The reasons people collect are interesting. Some people collect because it is the only part of their lives where they feel in control. For me, I just enjoy it. 
One famous collector was the Duc de Berry in France. He had a ""room of wonders"" with many curiosities, like cups made from coconut shells and pieces of china. Another collector, Catherine the Great of Russia, had more than 4,000 paintings. But you don’t need to be rich to start a collection. I have collected different items, like tulip bulbs and china cups, with great determination. 
I remember when I convinced another tulip collector to sell me a special tulip. I planted it and took care of it, but one year it disappeared – stolen by another collector. I also collected 350 American rag dolls. I searched all over the USA for them, but my collection was destroyed when my house caught fire. The next morning, I saw the remains of my furniture and my collection. I was very sad. 
I find it interesting how collections change hands. A silver spoon that belonged to a king or a poet can be very valuable. As small objects become popular, their prices go up. For example, toys from the 1950s are now worth a lot, especially if you still have the original boxes. (I threw mine away, along with the toys!)"
FCE_3,B2,"**My Line of Work**
Four people talk about their jobs.
**Lisa - Exhibition Programmes Organiser, Science Museum**  
I organize temporary exhibitions. This means I plan and design the exhibition and promote it. I read about the exhibition topic and talk to important people to find out the main ideas and goals. I decide what objects and pictures to show. I also make sure the public understands the exhibition by planning interactive displays, workshops, and performances. I work with engineers and electricians to ensure the display is safe for visitors. Before the exhibition opens, I help create brochures and leaflets to inform people about it.
**Janet - Teacher of London Taxi Drivers**  
When I arrive at 7:30 a.m., I first check the accounts. Then, I see what new maps and documents we need to help students learn the taxi routes for the London taxi-driver test. By midday, about 50 students are in class, figuring out the best routes. I help when there are disagreements, like whether a right turn is allowed at a certain junction. When they are close to the test, I give them a simple route, but I tell them they must take a different route because the road is closed. This helps them think of other options.
**Sarah - Marine Conservationist**  
I live by the coast and work from home. My job includes answering phone calls, creating educational materials, and setting up training courses. Sometimes, I go to our main office, but I mostly work on the coast. I collaborate with schools and study centers and run courses for coastal managers. I take them out to sea in a boat to help them understand the life in the ocean better. This often changes their opinions because it is very different from just using a computer. I feel lucky because conservation is my hobby, so I enjoy my job. However, I work for a charity, which means I always need to find more money, and I cannot do everything I want.
**Chris - Map and Atlas Publisher**  
My job is quite varied. I make sure our publishing program meets market needs and that we have enough stock of about 300 books. We have high standards for information and content. We receive many letters from readers about issues like international boundaries, and I must respond carefully. I discuss future projects and current sales with my co-publishers. I work with a great team, which makes the job enjoyable. However, like many jobs, there is too much administration, which takes time away from more interesting tasks like product development and design."
FCE_10,B2,"A Holiday in Ireland**
Every June, we go to Ireland. Since the four of us started going on holidays together, we have spent the first two weeks of June at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. It is a big house by the sea, not far from the village of Ardbeag. The English couple who own the house, the Malseeds, have made some changes to it, but they did it carefully. Strafe found Glencorn for us. He saw an advertisement when the Malseeds were still advertising. One evening, he said, ""How about this?"" and read the details. 
Last summer, we went to a hotel that friends recommended, but it was not good because the food was terrible. The four of us have been playing cards together for a long time: Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia, and me. My name is Dorothy Milson, but they call me Milly. Dekko got his nickname at school, and Strafe is called by his last name because he and Dekko were classmates. We are all about the same age and live near the town where the Malseeds lived before moving to Ireland. We think it is a funny coincidence.
""How nice,"" Mrs. Malseed said, smiling to welcome us again this year. She seems to know when guests are arriving because she is usually waiting in the large hall that smells of flowers. ""Arthur, take the luggage up,"" she told the old porter. She named our rooms after flowers: Rose, Tulip, Lily, and Geranium. Instead of numbers, Mrs. Malseed painted flowers on the doors. In winter, when few people come to Glencorn Lodge, she takes care of small details like that, while her husband handles repairs and decoration.
""Welcome!"" Mr. Malseed said as he came into the hall from the kitchen. He was smiling, and his dark brown eyes sparkled, making us feel special, not just another group of guests. Everyone smiled, and I could tell the others felt that our holiday had really started. Nothing had changed at Glencorn; everything was good. Kitty from the dining room came out to greet us. ""You look younger every year!"" she said, making everyone laugh again. 
Arthur took us to our rooms, carrying as much luggage as he could and coming back for the rest. After dinner, we played cards for a while, but we didn’t play too long because we were still tired from the journey. In the lounge, there was a man alone and a French couple. There were other people at dinner because Glencorn Lodge is always full in June. From our table by the window, we could see some guests walking on the lawns and others going down the cliff path to the beach. 
In the morning, we would walk along the beach to Ardbeag and have coffee at the hotel there, returning in time for lunch. In the afternoon, we would drive somewhere. I knew this would happen because we had followed this pattern for years. Since we first came here, we have all fallen in love with the beautiful landscape."
FCE_67,B2,"Keeping Holiday-Makers Happy**
Sarah Sutherland-Pilch is a chalet girl in Val d'Isere, France. She is 24 years old and comes from West Sussex. This is her second year in this job, where she cooks and cleans for visitors who come to ski and stay in wooden houses called chalets. Sarah studied French and History of Art at Oxford Brookes University and graduated last summer. She thinks being a chalet girl is a fun way to spend a year or two before starting a more serious job. She meets many interesting people every week.
Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to work. The chalet can host up to 18 guests each week. She has her own breakfast before making breakfast for the guests. They enjoy a big breakfast with porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants. After breakfast, which ends around 9:30 a.m., Sarah cleans up and either prepares afternoon tea or cleans the rooms, which she finds the least enjoyable part of her job. By 11 a.m., she is ready to ski. On good days, she can ski until 4:30 p.m.
After skiing, Sarah returns to the chalet to prepare dinner. She takes a shower first but does not sleep because she thinks it is not good to do so. Dinner is served at 8 p.m., and coffee is ready by 10 p.m. After dinner, she cleans the kitchen because she does not like coming back to a messy place. Sometimes she talks with the guests, but other times they prefer to be alone. She enjoys good guests who make her week better, but some weeks are not as fun.
Sarah lives in a chalet with her friends, and they usually go out around 11 p.m. They often start at a place called Bananas, then go to G Jay's, and maybe finish at Dick's T-Bar. However, she does not stay out too late on Saturday nights because Sunday is her busiest day. She calls it a ""frightful day"" because she has to wake up early to cook breakfast for guests leaving at 7 a.m. After they leave, she cleans quickly, strips the beds, and prepares for new guests.
If she has not done the shopping on Saturday, she does it on Sunday. By around 3 p.m., after cleaning, she prepares tea for the new guests who arrive around 4:30 p.m. Sometimes the new guests are confused and have many questions. Between tea and dinner, Sarah helps guests who need ski boots or skis and then gets a ride back to the chalet. Soon, it is time for dinner again, and sometimes she has a drink afterward, but if she is too tired, she goes to bed early."

Miss Rita Cohen was a small girl with pale skin. She looked much younger than Seymour's daughter, Marie, but she said she was six years older. One day, she came to Seymour's factory. She wore overalls and big shoes, and her curly hair framed her pretty face. Seymour was surprised that she was studying at the University of Pennsylvania and doing research about the leather industry in New Jersey for her Master's degree.
A few times a year, someone would contact Seymour to ask if they could visit his factory. Sometimes, he would help students by answering their questions on the phone or giving them a short tour if they seemed serious. Rita was very small, almost like the children from Marie's third-grade class, who had visited the factory years ago to see how gloves were made. Marie loved to watch the workers shape and press the gloves using hot brass hands, which she called ""pancake hands.""
Seymour heard Rita ask, ""How many pieces come in a shipment?"" He replied, ""Between twenty and twenty-five thousand."" She took notes and asked, ""Do they come directly to your shipping department?"" He liked that she was interested in every detail. He explained, ""They go to the tannery first. The tannery is a contractor. We buy the material, and they prepare it for us. My grandfather, father, and I all worked in the tannery here in town. Have you ever been inside a tannery?"" 
""Not yet,"" Rita said.
""Well, you should visit a tannery if you want to write about leather. I can help you set that up. They are old places. The technology has improved, but it is still similar to what it was hundreds of years ago. It’s hard work. Tanning is one of the oldest industries. They found tanning tools that are six thousand years old in Turkey. The first clothing was made from animal skins that were tanned by smoking them. It’s an interesting subject once you learn about it. My father knows a lot about leather. If you talk to him about gloves, he could talk for two days. Glovemen really love their work. 
""Have you ever seen anything being made, Miss Cohen?"" he asked.
""I can't say I have,"" she replied.
""Never seen anything made?"" he asked again.
""I saw my mother make a cake when I was a child,"" she said.
He laughed. She made him laugh. She was innocent and eager to learn. His daughter was much taller than Rita, but Rita reminded him of Marie. She had the same good-natured intelligence that filled their home with what she learned in school. 
""I have an idea,"" he said. ""We will take you through the whole process. Come on! We are going to make you a pair of gloves, and you will watch them being made from start to finish. What size do you wear?"""

Chris Arnot talks to four people with dream jobs to see if they are as great as they seem.
**A. Raquel Graham**  
Raquel Graham calls from a taxi on her way to the airport. She cannot meet us tomorrow because her boss wants her in Los Angeles instead. As a personal assistant to a pop star, she has to travel around the world quickly. Raquel loves her job and gets along well with her boss. However, she has one small problem - she does not like flying. ""On a nine-hour flight to California, I usually take sleeping pills to help me relax,"" she says. Her worst experience was flying on Concorde. ""It felt so closed in with those tiny windows."" When she is not traveling, she works in offices in Manchester and London. She has to do some boring paperwork, like organizing schedules, attending meetings, and making travel plans. She did not apply for this job. A chance meeting with a pop group manager led to her getting this job. She also took a secretarial course in the evenings. Five years later, she was ready when her boss needed a personal assistant.
**B. David Brown**  
David Brown has worked as an accountant and a golf caddy, which means he carries a golfer's bags. He prefers being a caddy because golf is his passion. However, there are some downsides. He earns a small flat fee plus a percentage of the winnings, which usually totals between £25,000 and £35,000, but much of that goes to travel and hotels. He started caddying for golfer Greg Norman when he was 31. ""You are not just carrying bags. You give advice and try to understand the course,"" he explains. Recently, his skills in accounting were recognized, and he became a statistical data administrator for European Tour Productions. He collects and analyzes statistics from the caddies, which are used by TV commentators, golf magazines, and the golfers.
**C. Martin Fern**  
Martin Fern is the editor of the ""Food and Drink"" section of a daily newspaper. One of his easier tasks is to taste food at the best restaurants. What does he think about expensive restaurants? ""If people can afford it, that’s their choice,"" he says. ""I would rather spend £120 on a meal I will remember than buy a microwave."" His friend, who was an editor, offered him a food column because of his cooking talent. At that time, Martin was working in advertising and it was a good extra income. When he was 42, another newspaper offered him a full-time job. ""It meant I would earn 50% less money,"" he says. ""But it was a chance to turn my passion into a job."" He still cooks at home and tries to stay healthy by cycling a couple of miles to the nearest tube station.
**D. Dick Prince**  
""I started writing children's stories about 20 years ago,"" says Dick Prince, one of Britain's most popular children's authors. ""Before that, I loved words and wrote mostly poems. Then I had an idea for a story. I had been a farmer and knew about chickens being killed by a fox. So, I wrote a story called The Fox Busters, which became my first published children's book."" Where do his ideas come from? ""It is not easy; I have to work hard on them,"" he says. ""I usually write in the mornings. I do not wake up at dawn, though. After lunch, I spend a couple of hours typing what I wrote in the morning. I use an old typewriter instead of a laptop. I get between 50 and 100 letters a week, and that is the part of being a writer that I enjoy the most. I try to answer them all, but now I have some help with that."""

In the lumberyard by the lake, trees were cut into boards for building. There was an old two-story brick building, and outside, there were big piles of soft sawdust. These golden piles of dust covered the area down to the blue lake. One afternoon, feeling bored, Michael and his friends climbed up the ladder to the roof of the old building. They sat with their legs hanging over the edge, looking at the lake. 
Suddenly, Michael said, ""I dare you to jump down."" Without thinking, he jumped off the roof and landed in the sawdust, rolling around and laughing. ""I dare you all!"" he shouted. ""You're all cowards,"" he teased, trying to get them to jump too. 
His friends looked down from the roof, scared at first, but one by one, they jumped and landed safely in the sawdust, smiling with relief. In the warm afternoon sun, they lay on the sawdust pile, telling jokes. Then one of them said, ""Let's go back up to the roof and jump down again."" 
They were not very excited, but they climbed back up and started jumping off again. Soon, only Michael was left on the roof. His friends were down below, smiling and calling, ""Come on, Mike. What's wrong?"" Michael wanted to jump down and join them, but he stayed on the edge of the roof, feeling nervous. 
At first, they thought he was just joking, but then they saw him clenching his fists. He tried to count to ten and jump, but he couldn't. He took a deep breath and closed his eyes. After a while, his friends started laughing at him. They were tired of waiting, and it was almost dinnertime. ""Come on, you're a coward! Do you think we're going to sit here all night?"" they shouted. When he didn't move, they began to walk away, still shouting. 
""Who started this? What's wrong with you all?"" he called out. But he stayed on the edge of the roof, looking sadly at the ground. He was alone for nearly an hour while the sun slowly set over the lake. His clothes were wet from sweating. Finally, he closed his eyes, jumped off the roof, and landed heavily in the sawdust. He lay there for a long time, and the yard was quiet because the workers had gone home. 
As he lay there, he wondered why he couldn't jump before. Then he got up slowly and walked home, feeling ashamed and wanting to avoid everyone. He was so late for dinner that his stepmother said coldly, ""You should be able to get home on time by now. If you won't come home, you might as well stay out tonight."" She was a strong woman with soft skin and a little grey in her hair, always patient. But Michael, feeling gloomy and miserable, hardly heard her. He was still thinking about his friends laughing at him."
FCE_44,B2,"**Careers Advice**
Are you unhappy in your job and want to change it? Kitty Doherty offers some helpful advice. Many people who want to change their job go to a careers adviser. First, you will write a short history about yourself and then take some tests called 'psychometrics'. After the tests, you will get a summary of the results and suggestions for different careers, as well as any retraining you might need.
I decided to try Career Analysts, a big organization that gives career advice. Taking the careers test felt like being back in school during science exams. I was with about ten other people, and we had to answer questions quickly. I reminded myself that it was not about passing or failing. It was hard to see how the tests would show a true picture of me. The tests included finding mistakes in lists of names and numbers and matching similar shapes.
After the tests, I talked with an adviser. He used my test results and our conversation to create a report with his observations and recommendations. I agreed with most of what he said, but I was a bit upset to learn that I did poorly in the scientific and technical tests. I am glad I did not become a nurse! However, it was good to hear that I made the right choice in wanting to work in journalism.
Changing your career does not always mean making a big change. Last March, Donna Laney, 25, lost her job as a marketing manager after five years. Her friends suggested she go to Career Analysts for help. Donna said, ""Losing my job was a good chance for me to think about my career. I wanted to look at my skills and interests."" Some of the results surprised her. ""I didn’t know I had a talent for design. But I had to think about the cost of retraining in design and my financial situation,"" she explained. Other ideas included taking a year off to work in the Far East. In the end, she decided to use her existing skills and move into a job that suited her better than insurance. Now, she works as a Public Relations officer. She believes she could have reached this point without Career Analysts, but they helped her understand what she really wanted to do. She has sent several friends there, and they are all happy with the service.
Some people feel they would not have made important decisions without help. Juliet Greene, 26, visited Career Counselling Services and made some big changes in her life. After working at a major bank for six years, she found her job boring and wanted a new challenge. She went to Career Counselling Services with an open mind. The tests showed she was interested in sciences. She had four meetings with an adviser. The third meeting was recorded, which helped her remember what she said. After the fourth meeting, she decided she wanted to study geology and plans to start a degree later this year. She thinks the advice from Career Counselling Services was worth the money. Now, she feels much happier and more positive.
However, career advice does not work for everyone. Amanda Margetts, a 24-year-old sales representative, said, ""I reached a point in my career where I didn’t know what to do next. I thought a careers adviser might suggest something new. I got many new ideas, but I rejected them because they either meant a big drop in salary or a lot of retraining. I didn’t learn anything new about myself."" She felt that if she had told a friend the same things, they would have given her similar advice."
FCE_22,B2,"Fun at the Dentist's**
If you visit W. Lloyd Jerome's dental office in the center of Glasgow, you will see bright paintings on the walls and a stylish blue couch where patients sit while he checks their teeth. Jerome says, ""Fifty percent of people only go to the dentist when they are in pain instead of for regular check-ups. This is because they are scared."" To help with this, he has tried to make a place where people feel safe. That is why he decided not to wear a white coat, which many people connect with pain. He believes that dental treatment should happen in a relaxing and enjoyable atmosphere.
This idea is surprising for many people who think of dental visits as painful or very formal. Jerome says, ""If people are relaxed and entertained, they will forget their bad experiences."" One of his new ways to help people relax is by using virtual-reality headsets. ""We were the first dental office in Britain to use them, and they are very popular. Patients wear the headsets during the check-up, sitting comfortably on the blue couch and watching a film about underwater wildlife while I check their teeth. Then, the headset shows them a special camera view of their mouth.""
Most patients seem to enjoy this part of their visit. Another interesting thing is that the office smells more like a perfume shop than a dentist's office. Today, it smells like orange. Jerome explains, ""When people come in, I want them to feel that it is not like a regular dentist's office. Smell is very important. The usual dentist smell can make people nervous.""
I found the nice smell in the office very pleasant. Although Jerome is known as Glasgow's most stylish dentist, he takes his work very seriously. The relaxation techniques are important, but the quality of the treatment is the most important thing. For example, Jerome uses a special tool that sprays warm water on the teeth to clean them instead of scraping. It feels a bit strange at first, but if people are relaxed, it is not painful.
Five years ago, Jerome went to the United States to learn about new dental techniques. ""I found out that when you make it easier for the patient, it is easier for you too,"" he explains. He believes that his patient-focused approach is the start of a change towards a less formal style in British dentistry.
At that moment, a patient arrives. Jerome quickly goes to him, offers a cup of tea (herbal or regular), asks what video he would like to watch, and gently leads him to the chair. The patient seems to enjoy this special treatment, and it is easy to see why. The office feels more like a fancy beauty salon than a regular dental practice."

**Bitter Water Becomes Popular**
Chocolate comes from South America and is now a big business around the world. In Britain, people spend over £230 million on chocolate at Easter. This is about eight percent of all chocolate sales in the year. People eat more chocolate at Christmas than at any other time.
The large production of chocolate started in the last century, but the cacao plant was first grown by the Aztecs, Toltecs, and Mayans in Central America over three thousand years ago. The cacao tree is a tropical plant found in Africa, South and Central America, the West Indies, and South-East Asia. The fruit of this tree is the size of a melon and has 20-40 seeds. When dried, these seeds become cacao beans, which are used to make chocolate. In English-speaking countries, they are often called cocoa beans. This name comes from a mistake made in the 17th century.
The Aztecs used cocoa beans as money and made a drink called xocoatl, which means ""bitter water"" in their language. They flavored this drink with spices for special occasions. The Spanish liked the drink better with cinnamon and sugar, but it took a long time for this recipe to reach Europe.
In the late 17th century, chocolate houses opened in European cities where people could drink chocolate. Until the last century, the drink was made from solid chocolate that had to be melted in hot water. In 1826, CJ van Houten from the Netherlands invented chocolate powder by removing most of the cocoa butter from the beans. The chocolate bar we know today started in 1847 when a company in Bristol, Fry and Sons, mixed cocoa butter with chocolate and sugar to make a solid bar. A Swiss company later added milk to create milk chocolate.
At the beginning of the 20th century, French companies were the main chocolate producers in Britain. In 1879, the English company Cadbury named their factory Bournville, hoping to attract customers with a French name. Then, in 1905, Cadbury introduced the Dairy Milk bar, which was marketed as a healthy snack because of the milk. This helped it compete with French chocolate brands.
Today, people in Britain eat about four chocolate bars each week. This has made chocolate companies look for new ways to attract customers. One new idea is to turn chocolate bars into ice cream, soft drinks, or desserts to appeal to chocolate lovers.
However, cacao farmers are still struggling because cocoa bean prices fell in the late 1980s. Many small farmers went out of business. So, next time you enjoy a chocolate bar, think about the farmers who grow cacao."
FCE_18,B2,"**THE SHELL ARTIST**
Peter Cooke is 83 years old and is a master at making art from shells. He has many other things he wants to try, like making paper and working with feathers, but for now, he enjoys creating beautiful objects from shells. 
As he shows me his work in his apartment, he asks, ""Am I boring you?"" He is not boring at all; he is very enthusiastic and charming. He points to some shell-covered decorations above his fireplace and says, ""I won’t mind if people don’t buy them because I love them."" He never planned to sell his work, but about five years ago, some friends encouraged him to have an exhibition. They spoke to a gallery owner, and he had his first exhibition in London, where 70% of his pieces were sold. His second exhibition just opened yesterday.
The prices for his work are high, around £2,000 for some pieces. There are 86 items in the exhibition, with prices starting at £225 for a shell flower in a crystal vase. Cooke says he does not set the prices and is happy to talk about them. He believes that no one else makes art like his, and the gallery owner told him that one day, people will want his pieces even more because he will stop making them.
Cooke wishes he had started this art earlier in his life because he thinks he could have made even more amazing things. Although he still has many ideas, he feels he cannot do as much now because he is not as strong as he used to be. However, his work is very different from the common shell crafts found in seaside shops. He describes himself as having a ""miniature mind,"" which helps him create boxes covered in tiny shells, pictures made from shells, and baskets of realistic flowers.
He has his own way of working and uses materials he finds. For example, he uses cardboard from laundered shirts for flower bases, a special glue from a sail-maker, and washing-up liquid to clean the shells. He says, ""I have an idea of what I want to do, and it just happens."" His work shows a lot of detail and careful color choices.
Cooke travels to many places to find beautiful shells, including France, Thailand, Mexico, South Africa, and the Philippines. He lies on the beach to look for shells to take home. He only collects dead shells and defends himself against people who accuse him of harming the beaches. He explains that many people walk on the shells and break them, and he would never take shells that still have living creatures inside. He believes that once the creatures are gone, it is okay to collect the shells. His argument is strong, especially when you see how beautiful his work is compared to the shells he collects."
FCE_62,B2,"**The Schoolgirl Model**
Kira Langer is a 15-year-old girl who is a model. When she is not traveling to exciting places or appearing on magazine covers, she studies for her school exams. Jane Laidlaw learns more about her.
The receptionist at Kira's modeling agency told me, ""I'm afraid Kira will be a little late."" I thought about all the bad things I had read about models, like being difficult or vain. I worried that Kira might not come at all. But when Kira arrived, she was smiling and relaxed, and she was with her mother. She was not wearing fancy clothes, just a simple black dress and trainers. Kira was friendly and very pretty.
Kira explained that all models under 16 must have an adult with them when they work. Her mother looked proud of her daughter. Kira seemed a bit surprised by her fame because it was unexpected. It was her older sister who encouraged her to enter a modeling competition. Kira said, ""I said no, but she sent some photos in anyway."" When she found out she was a finalist, she was at school. This gave her the confidence to continue, and she won the competition easily. The Select model agency in London offered her work right away.
Now, Kira has to manage her life as a student and a model. Her friends and teachers are proud of her, but some people at school are not nice. They say she thinks too highly of herself. Kira finds this hard to handle because she is not a selfish person. She said, ""They think that because I am a model, I can't stay the same. But the only thing that has changed is that I am more confident.""
Being a busy model affects her social life. The agency can call her at any time for a job the next day. Kira said, ""If my friends are going out, I can't promise to join them because I don’t know my schedule."" However, her friends understand and do not complain about her modeling.
Kira has the looks and support to have a great career. Not many people can say that before finishing school. At the end of the interview, I asked her what she would like to do if she were not a model. She paused and said, ""I’d like to do what you’re doing."""

**Father and Son Start Gold Rush**
Terence and Chris Madden have traveled from the cold north of Canada to hot Africa to find valuable metals. The father and son team - one is an explorer and the other is a mineral expert - think their mine on a Welsh mountain could have up to 10,000 ounces of gold. After ten years of digging in the Welsh hills, they believe they are very close to a gold vein worth five million dollars. 
""As we dig, we are finding a lot of gold; now we just need to dig a few more meters to where it is concentrated,"" said Terence, 68, from Liverpool. They have dedicated their lives to finding gold. Their search started when Terence read about gold worth millions buried in the 'Dolgellau gold belt', an area near the town of Dolgellau in Wales. 
While reading old mining journals and newspapers at the Welsh National Library in Aberystwyth, they chose the best area of land to study. Since they first cleared the land and found pieces of gold in the rocks, they have spent ten years getting permission to work, taking samples of the earth, and removing old cars and trash. They dug out 150 tonnes of greenstone rock to make a tunnel and a 10-meter shaft. 
Now, they are running out of money. They have spent their savings on this dream and need to convince someone to invest £50,000 to dig a little deeper to where the gold is. Chris Madden says, ""Right now, this looks doubtful, but we have a few people we can contact."" 
As news spread about their dig, more people in the area became interested in gold. Dolgellau depends on tourists, and residents are hopeful. ""It would bring more people here if they are right,"" said Peter Woolven, manager of the Royal Ship Hotel, ""but if they find gold, I hope millions of people do not come and dig up the hillside."" 
The Welsh gold industry has declined a lot since the late 1880s when many people worked in hundreds of mines. One of the last mines, Clogau-St David's, which made wedding rings for the Queen and the Princess of Wales, closed a month ago. Now, individual gold diggers are coming back. George Hall, another prospector, plans to dig a tunnel deep into the hill on the other side from the Maddens. ""Searching for gold is very emotional,"" said Hall, 70. ""It's adventurous and exciting, the thrill of finding hidden treasure. Maybe I will be lucky this time."""
FCE_31,B2,"IN HOT WATER**
Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends a lot of time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She teaches and does research in marine geochemistry, which means she studies the chemicals in the sea. Rachel is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she is not teaching, she goes into a small steel vehicle that is used for underwater exploration. This vehicle is about the size of a small car, and it dives three kilometres down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes.
Inside the vehicle, space is very small. Rachel can reach out and touch the two pilots. They are used to being in this small space, where they cannot stand up or move around. They must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last for 16 hours: three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours to collect rock and water samples, and three hours to come back up to the surface. If there is a problem and they need to get to the top quickly, they can press a panic button. This releases a small escape vessel that goes quickly to the surface, like a ping-pong ball in water. Rachel says, ""No one has tested it yet, but I don't think it would be a very pleasant journey.""
Rachel remembers her first dive. She climbed into the vehicle on a ship with an instructor. He explained what to do in an emergency, including if the pilot had a heart attack. They wanted to see how she would react in such a small space. Now, Rachel has made six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian crew. They went to a place that was a five-day sail west of the Canary Islands. There, on the ocean floor, is a large area of underwater volcanoes that release black smoke. The Russian team was dropping off scientific equipment to study a project that would create a hole 150 metres through a volcano.
When Rachel is not at sea, she works in her office at the Oceanography Centre in Southampton. She says, ""Two-thirds of my salary comes from teaching, which I love, but I do it so I can continue my research on the 'black smokers.'"" This is another name for underwater volcanoes, where water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke. This smoke comes out at a rate of one metre per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees.
Rachel felt scared the first time she dived with an American team. They were towing equipment when suddenly there was an explosion. There was a loud bang, and she thought, ""I'm going to die."" They looked at each other in silence, waiting. When nothing happened, they were very relieved to be alive.
Rachel loves the adventure of diving to the deepest part of the ocean. Every time she looks out of the porthole and sees the chimneys, she feels amazed. She thinks, ""Here I am at the bottom of the sea, and no one else on this planet has ever seen them before."" Rachel studied the black smokers for three years for her PhD. When she finally saw them in real life, it was an incredible feeling."

I was dirty, smelly, hungry, and a little sunburned. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. My body was tired, and my mind was confused by foreign train schedules, money, and languages. ""Never again,"" I said as I arrived home. I said the same thing the next year and the year after that. All I had to do was buy one train ticket, and because I was under twenty-five, I could travel anywhere in Europe for a whole month.
Sleeping in a train corridor is very different from sleeping in a regular bed. The movement of the train rocks you to sleep. Carrying all your things in a backpack makes you travel simply and can lead to wasting things, like burning socks that smell bad or throwing away finished books. But this way of traveling is part of the Inter-Rail spirit, where common sense can be forgotten along with old books and socks. All you need is one of those tickets in your hand.
A ticket that lets young people travel through many countries in one day is special. On my first trip, my friends and I didn’t know how great this ticket was. We thought it was just a cheap way to get to our campsite in southern France. But we soon wanted to travel more, always looking for one more country to visit. And it didn’t cost us anything extra.
We were not completely uninterested in culture, but this was our first holiday without parents, like many other Inter-Rail travelers. We made our own plans and only saw the most interesting sights. This was a chance to escape guided tours and do something different. I was proud that sometimes all I wanted to see was the view from the train station. We were just trying to enjoy ourselves, like most other Inter-Railers who shared train corridors, food, money, and music with us.
The excitement of travel comes from arriving in a place that was just a name before. It feels like the city didn’t exist until the train arrives, and you see it with your own tired eyes for the first time. You can only understand Europe by seeing it, watching the changing landscapes, and noticing the different lifestyles. Everyone knows what is in Europe, but it doesn’t mean much until you see it yourself. This is why other people's holiday photos can be boring. While the train trip may not show you new things in the world, it is a valuable personal experience. Europe is big, and Inter-Rail gives people a great chance to see this, even if it didn’t happen for us right away."

Arriving at an airport in another country and finding out that your luggage is missing can be very disappointing. You might have to wear the same clothes for hours or even days until the airline finds your bags. If you are in a different climate, you may have to wear clothes that are not suitable for the weather. 
Airlines do not often say how many bags they lose, but it happens to many travelers. Even good airlines can make mistakes, and it is hard for any airline to promise that your checked luggage will travel on the same flight as you, especially if you have to change planes. 
Airlines ask passengers to arrive at the airport early to give enough time for bags to be checked and loaded onto the plane. The minimum connecting time (MCT) is the shortest time needed to change from one flight to another. These times are often longer to help with baggage transfers. Usually, this system works well, but extra security checks and air traffic problems can cause delays. 
Human mistakes can also happen, like if a label on a bag gets torn off. These issues can be worse at large airports, called 'hubs', where many bags are processed. For example, last year, Heathrow airport in London had over 41 million passengers, with nine million changing planes. British Airways alone had two million transfer passengers at Heathrow. 
Even busy airports like Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Singapore, and Zurich can have problems. In the United States, Miami airport is known for losing luggage when passengers quickly connect to flights to Latin America. 
To avoid losing your luggage, try to book direct flights when you can and check in early. If you must change planes, try to use the same airline for all your flights. Allow extra time for connections by taking an earlier flight, and make sure to label your luggage with your home and holiday addresses, including your flight numbers. 
If your luggage is still missing, contact the airline staff in the baggage area and fill out a property irregularity report (PIR) before you leave the airport."
FCE_2,B2,"**The Kingfisher**
Wildlife photographer Charlie James is an expert on the kingfisher, a beautiful blue-green bird that lives near streams and rivers and eats fish. Old trees hang over the stream, providing some shade to the shallow water. The main colors in this scene are soft greens, browns, and different shades of yellow from the sunlight. The sound of the water is gentle, like a breeze. The kingfisher moves quickly and smoothly, like a flash of light. It is gone in a moment, but its image stays in your mind because it is so striking.
Charlie James fell in love with kingfishers when he was young. He feels a strong connection to this little bird, but he cannot explain why he loves it so much. The kingfisher is part of many legends. In Greek mythology, the kingfisher is a moon goddess who became a bird. Another story says that the kingfisher flew so high that its upper body became blue like the sky, while its lower body was burned by the sun. There is some truth in this story. Kingfishers do not have blue pigment in their feathers. Instead, the way their feathers are structured scatters light and reflects blue. This is why a kingfisher can look bright blue or rich emerald green depending on the light.
Many wildlife photographers love kingfishers. Their colors are beautiful, and even though kingfishers are shy, they can be easy to watch from a hiding place. Charlie James's first hiding place was an old blanket he put over his head while he waited near a kingfisher's favorite spot. The bird came back in just a few minutes and sat only one meter away. However, it took him four more years to take his first good picture. During this time, the European kingfisher became a big part of his life. He spent as much time as he could by a stream where kingfishers lived. Unfortunately, school took away some of his time with the birds, and he missed classes, calling himself an ""academic failure."" But people started to notice his interest in the kingfisher, which is the most common kingfisher in the world and the only one that breeds in Europe. 
At 16, he was hired as an advisor for a nature magazine. He then worked as an assistant to the editor and eventually became a freelance wildlife film cameraman. Now, he wants to make the perfect kingfisher film. ""No speech, just beautiful images that say it all,"" he says. ""I like to photograph parts of kingfisher wings..."" His voice trails off as he thinks about the colors of the bird he has been close to for more than half his life. The photographs show some of his feelings, but Charlie knows that there is much more to his relationship with the kingfisher than what his work can show."
FCE_68,B2,"Conducting an Orchestra**
Giving directions to an orchestra is not easy. Anne Inglis talks to five new conductors about their work.
**A. ANNE MANSON**  
Anne Manson, 30, asked to attend conductor Claudio Abbado's practice sessions in Vienna. She ended up filling in for an absent assistant. Later, she was asked to help with another opera. ""I had to lead the first rehearsal for Abbado. I wasn't nervous. I have always felt good about standing in front of an orchestra."" Anne is from America and works with a well-known opera company in London that focuses on modern music. She is also becoming known in other European countries, thanks to support from the British Arts Council. Since her first experience, she has helped Abbado on many more projects.
**B. ANDREW CONSTANTINE**  
Andrew Constantine, 31, says the hardest part of being a conductor is finding the right opportunities. He won a big competition in 1991 after trying twice before. Looking back, he is thankful for the timing: ""If it had happened earlier, I would have been forgotten."" The competition gave him many chances to perform and work as an assistant to a famous conductor. However, he finds it hard to shake off the ""competition"" label. ""If in three years my name is still linked to the competition, I will be worried,"" he says. But orchestras like the English Chamber Orchestra, which hired him after the competition, are inviting him back. ""If this doesn't happen, my career will fall apart.""
**C. WASFI KANI**  
Wasfi Kani, who started Pimlico Opera, enjoys the long practice time needed for any opera. ""The music deserves four weeks of attention,"" she says. She began conducting seriously in her late twenties. After university, she worked in London until Pimlico Opera became fully professional two years ago. Taking lessons with Sian Edwards was a key moment for her. ""I saw her conduct and realized she was my size. I had always learned from much bigger people, which makes a big difference."" She likes the complex nature of opera: ""There are many arguments, and you have to think about the singers' personalities.""
**D. ROGER VIGNOLES**  
Roger Vignoles, 48, says, ""Conducting surprised me, but it fascinates me."" He started as a musician in an opera house and worked with good conductors. Last year, he was asked to direct Handel's Agrippina from the piano at a festival, something he had never done before. ""It was easier than I thought. I knew the music well and what I wanted it to sound like. I tried my best to get the performance I wanted. People respect my ability as a musician. I learn from every experience I've had, both in music style and performing. Now, I will do whatever people ask me to find out what I enjoy.""
**E. WAYNE MARSHALL**  
In 1986, conductor Simon Rattle noticed a young assistant conductor named Wayne Marshall. Now 32, Wayne soon found himself conducting a musical in London at short notice, which was a tough start. He even had to deal with some relaxed musicians reading newspapers during the show. ""I was strict with them. I always gave a clear beat and did my best. Many musicians don’t seem to need advice from a conductor. But I am never afraid to say what I want. If people see you are worried, it gets worse. I have never studied conducting formally, and no book teaches you how to conduct, but people have been kind to me. I am determined and know what I like."""

Last year, we visited a big theme park in the US, so we thought Fun Island would be boring. However, we were surprised and liked it. The park is good for younger children, so our three-year-old had fun too. The kids loved the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. There is a special dodgems ride for little kids, which was very popular. For older kids, there are scarier rides like Splash Out, where you jump into a pool! After five hours, my husband Steve and I wanted to leave, but the kids wanted to stay because they were having so much fun. Our only complaint is that the park could have a better atmosphere and nicer scenery. But the staff were very helpful, and we found it clean and safe.
**Wonderland - The McMillan Family**  
None of us had been to a theme park before, so we didn’t know what to expect. We thought our son Oscar might be too young, but he loved it. He enjoyed the Mountain Train and liked Little Land, which has small models of famous buildings. The older kids liked the ferris wheel and driving toy cars on a real road. We spent six hours there and were happy there were places to rest. The park looked great, and the staff were friendly. There is something for everyone, even adults.
**Adventure World - The Jeffree Family**  
After seven hours, we still wanted to see more. The kids loved the Big Top Circus, which had an amazing trapeze act. We tried the Terror Line, and even though the girls were scared and kept their eyes shut, they said they enjoyed it. Their favorite ride was Running River, where you think you will get wet, but you don’t. For younger kids, Toy Land is a lot of fun. The kids wanted to try the new ride, Fear Factor, but we were relieved they were too small for it! The park is so well designed that even waiting in line isn’t boring. It was very clean, and the staff were great. One staff member even helped when I couldn’t sit with both girls on a ride.
**The Great Park - The Langridge Family**  
We arrived at one o'clock and were sad that the park closed at 5 p.m. This is a great theme park for younger children because the rides are not too scary. I am a bit scared of rides, but I had fun. We all loved Exotic Travels, a boat ride that starts slowly and then becomes very exciting. We waited for half an hour for Lightning River, and it was over quickly! I wouldn’t go on the Big Leap, but it looked fun if you are brave. If the children were a bit older, they might have found it too easy, but they were the right age and loved it.
**Fantasy World - The Break-all Family**  
The park says there is ""No Limit to the Fun,"" and we felt that was true. The tallest roller-coaster in Europe, the Rocket, is very impressive. Ben thought it was the scariest ride, but Jennie said the Hanger, where you hang upside-down 30 meters above the ground, was even scarier! There are many main rides, and the older kids went on them several times. Sarah was too small for some rides but enjoyed the Long Slide. The staff were friendly, but some were not as welcoming. You need a whole day to enjoy Fantasy World. We wouldn’t have told the kids we were going home early."
FCE_60,B2,"**Running a Business in the Countryside**
Five women share their experiences of starting a business in the countryside.
A. ""My customers are friends,"" says CHRISTINE HOGAN, who runs a computer design business that makes over £200,000 a year and has four full-time employees. ""My husband and I moved from London to the countryside when our children were young. I wanted a job I could do at home. I had worked with computers before I got married, so my husband suggested I start a computer design business. It needed a lot of money, and the beginning was hard. But I was careful and always told the bank manager if I might spend too much. Working from home saves money, and I can work in the evening if I want. My business is small, and we rarely deliver work; people from the area usually come to pick it up.""
B. ""I enjoy being independent,"" says MAGGY SASANOW, who designs greeting cards from home. ""I studied art at university and wanted to work in a museum. But when I got married, we moved to the countryside, where there were no jobs like that. So, I decided to start my own business and now I make 50 different greeting cards that I sell to museums. I work in a big room upstairs. The downside of working from home is that there is always something to do, like mowing the lawn. I don’t advertise; my business grows by word of mouth. People send me work from London because I am cheaper than other artists. Working alone means I don’t share ideas with others, but there are more good things than bad.""
C. ""It has been hard at times,"" says DELIA TURNER, who makes curtains. ""I started my business eight years ago when it was growing. In two years, my income went from £24,000 to £80,000. I used to have six full-time workers, but I had to let them go because the economy got worse. This was hard because it is not easy to find jobs here. Now, I am back to making curtains at home with my husband’s help and using women who work from their homes. I have to lower my prices when needed and look for new opportunities.""
D. TESSA STRICKLAND runs her children's book publishing business from her farmhouse. ""I moved to the countryside three years ago for two reasons: it was cheaper than London, and I love the countryside. I like being able to work when I want. Eighty percent of my income comes from deals with Australia, the Far East, and North America, so I have to take calls at strange hours. The downside is that I need to be disciplined to close the office door. I publish children's books from different cultures, working with authors and artists. I had all my work experience in London, so I felt very alone at first.""
E. MEG RIVERS runs a cake business that sells cakes by post and has a shop with an income of £250,000 a year and employs six people, some part-time. ""I started ten years ago at home. I care about health, so I began making fruit cakes with good quality flour and eggs. Friends and family started asking for cakes, and soon I was sending them all over the country. Seven years ago, I rented a small building where everything is made. We have a baker, an assistant, and a professional cake decorator. I don’t bake anymore; I manage the business side. My biggest problem has been the financial side, which has been hard because we didn’t have a lot of money to start."""
FCE_1,B2,"**Meet the Amazing Watkins Family**
The Watkins family is very talented. The sons are musicians and composers who have won awards, and their dad makes musical instruments. 
John and Hetty Watkins are schoolteachers from South Wales. When they needed to buy a cello for their ten-year-old son, Paul, they found it was too expensive. John thought, ""Maybe I can make one."" He found a school nearby that teaches instrument making and took evening classes for about three years. 
After making some violins and violas, John made his first cello. Paul, now 28, says, ""It turned out really well. He made me another one later, and I used that one until a few months ago."" John has now retired from teaching and makes about twelve violins each year. He was very happy to sell one to a famous American musician named Jaime Laredo.
Paul and his younger brother, Huw, started playing music when they were young. Paul remembers, ""I began playing the piano as soon as I could reach the keys."" He later wanted to play the cello. His parents wanted him to play the violin because John played the viola and needed another violin for his music group. Paul tried the violin for six weeks but did not like it. Instead, he admired the cellist in his dad's group and asked for lessons.
Huw, now 22, says, ""My parents were supportive and relaxed. I wanted to follow in Paul's footsteps, not feel pressured."" Huw is now starting to become known as a pianist and composer.
Paul has done very well with the cello his dad made. He won the string final of the BBC Young Musician of the Year competition. At just 20 years old, he became the principal cellist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra, using his father's cello until last year. Now, he plays a very old cello on loan from the Royal Academy of Music. 
Paul says, ""Dad hasn't said anything about my new cello, but he played both and admitted that mine is quite nice!"" He believes his father's cello will get better with age, just like his own, which is already 304 years old.
Soon, Paul will perform on television with his new cello in Elgar's Cello Concerto. He says, ""The history of the piece doesn’t change how I play it. I will always play it my way."" However, he cannot watch himself on TV because he will be playing at the Cheltenham Festival that same night. Huw will also be busy, as his String Quartet will have its London premiere at the Wigmore Hall that evening. John and Hetty will have to be very organized to keep up with all their sons' music events in the coming weeks."
FCE_53,B2,"**Looking after the Countryside: The National Trust**
The National Trust is an organization that wants to protect the British countryside. Gill Page visits the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and talks to Gareth Roberts, a warden who works for the Trust to take care of the beautiful areas it owns.
Gareth believes that a National Trust Warden needs common sense. He says, ""You also need to be good at dealing with people because you work with farmers, visitors, conservationists, and building companies all the time."" Gareth grew up on the Lleyn Peninsula and worked on his parents' farm until he got married. About 80 people wanted the job of National Trust Warden for the Lleyn Peninsula. In the end, Gareth got the job because of his local knowledge and farming experience, even though he did not have formal training.
Gareth says, ""It helps that I still farm with my parents. I can understand farmers and their problems. They can't trick me!"" His farming background also helps him with the physical work of the job, like building fences, planting trees, and making walls. Since he started working with the Trust, Gareth has learned more about nature conservation. He remembers when he was young, he used to pick flowers, collect butterfly larvae, and find old birds' nests. He now wonders where he can find those things today. He understands that farming has changed the countryside, but he believes it is not the farmers' fault; they were just following government advice.
Gareth explains that when he began his job, farmers and conservationists did not get along. Both sides wanted things done their way. Now, they are talking and understanding each other better. ""We are at a point where we can bring them together,"" says Gareth. 
Gareth's work includes conservation, allowing the public to visit the Trust's land, planting trees, and working with tenant farmers. He says, ""My job is to make sure tasks are completed quickly and efficiently. I enjoy seeing projects finished, but I spend about half my time on reports and paperwork.""
Gareth loves his job, even though he is always working. He especially enjoys talking to the public, most of the time. However, he does not like the attitude of some visitors. ""Some people come in, demand everything, and leave as if they own the place. It annoys me to be nice to them!"" But Gareth believes that common sense is important.
If you have common sense and like working outdoors, you might want to apply to be a warden like Gareth. But be aware that there may not be a job available on the Lleyn Peninsula for a long time!"
FCE_55,B2,"**The Netball Captain**
In our series about women in sports, Suzie Ellis met England's netball captain, Kendra Slowinski. Kendra is the captain of the England netball team. When I met her, she had a busy day. She taught at a local school and then had a training session in a supermarket car park. I asked her, ""Don't you get strange looks?"" She replied, ""I am too focused on my movements and my feet to notice anything else. I might see cars slow down, but that’s all.""
Kendra said, ""My whole life is about being my best for the Championships."" She is following a strict schedule to be very fit for the games. This is her fourth World Championships, and it will be the biggest one yet, with 27 countries participating. She said, ""We will have home support, which is very special. It is important to improve the reputation of netball in our country. There will be more pressure because people expect us to play well.""
Their first game is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. Kendra mentioned, ""We have always beaten them, but they will be exciting to play against. They are very skilled."" The England team is currently ranked fourth in the world. Kendra explained that the Championships will be tough. ""You have to push yourself every day. There is no rest between games. In a series, you can still win if you lose the first game, but in the Championships, you only have one chance.""
In the fifteen years she has played at a high level, the sport has become harder and faster. Players are more aggressive on the court. Kendra said, ""You don’t train hard to lose. But after the game, we are all friends."" Netball is also using more science for fitness testing. Kendra said, ""It is important for us to think and train like world-class players. As captain, I need to have a strong mindset and lead by example. I want to support and encourage my team.""
Kendra has planned her netball career carefully. She decided that this competition would be her last as a player. She will likely coach young players in the future, but for now, she is focused on her final big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she might have a tear in her eye."
FCE_50,B2,"**SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS**
What should you do if your child has a special talent for music? It can be hard to know how to help them grow their talent. Some parents might not see their child's needs until they become frustrated and act out. While most schools can help children who are good at subjects like math or science, musically talented children need special support that regular schools may not provide, especially if music is not a priority there.
Children who are musically gifted, and those whose talents are encouraged by their parents or teachers, can benefit from attending a specialist music school. In Britain, there are five of these schools, which have been created in recent years. They offer a caring environment for children aged seven to eighteen to develop their musical skills with the help of professional musicians.
At specialist music schools, children spend a lot of their day on music activities. This includes individual lessons (up to three hours a week for their main instruments), playing in orchestras, singing, conducting, and learning music theory. They also practice in private rooms, sometimes with a teacher. The rest of their time is spent on important academic subjects like English, math, basic sciences, and languages, but they can also study more subjects if they want.
All five British specialist music schools are independent, meaning they are not funded by the government. The classes are small, so there is a high number of teachers compared to students. Most children at these schools live there full-time, which means they spend their formative years with others who share their interests.
However, there are some downsides. One big issue is the cost; fees can be high (between £12,000 and £17,000 a year for boarders). Each school tries to help parents with scholarships and financial aid for very talented children. Also, not all parents want to send their children to boarding school, especially at a young age. Many directors of these schools worry about admitting children as young as seven into such a strict environment. They want to make sure that children grow up to be well-rounded individuals.
It is true that separating musically gifted children from a young age can cause stress. Some children may lose their musical talent during their teenage years, and the pressure to succeed can lead to feelings of failure. However, all specialist schools closely monitor each student's progress and provide help when needed.
Most former students of music schools feel they gained a lot from the high-quality music education, but many also worry about the limited academic program, which often comes second to music. Many musically talented young people are also very smart and can handle academic challenges, so they may feel frustrated if their academic needs are not met.
For these reasons, it might be better to wait until a child is older and can make their own choices before deciding on a specialist music education. Children who are also good at academics can do well in regular schools with strong music programs or by combining regular school with music lessons at junior departments of music colleges. These colleges offer Saturday morning lessons with great teachers and opportunities to play in orchestras and chamber music groups. However, this option may not be possible for families living far from London or other big cities."
FCE_25,B2,"An Eye for Detail**
Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. The large garden around her house gives her many ideas for her art. It is full of her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wildly and spread all over the garden. The two long flower beds along the path in the garden have a beautiful mix of colors and shapes. This is partly because the previous owners were good gardeners and left plants that Susan liked. She also kept the gardener, Danny. 
Susan says, ""In fact, it was really his garden."" She and Danny got along well. At first, he would say some of her ideas were not worth it, but when she told him she wanted to paint them, he understood her vision. 
Susan likes to focus on painting individual plants instead of the whole garden. Sometimes she paints a group of plants, but usually, she picks one flower and takes it to her studio. ""I don't set everything up at once,"" she explains. ""I take one flower out and paint it, which can take a few days. Then I bring in another one and build the painting that way. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.""
Her busiest time is spring and early summer when the tulips bloom, followed by the poppies. ""They all come out together, and you're so busy,"" she says. But she also finds beauty in how flowers change as they decay. For example, with tulips, ""you bring them in and put them in water, then leave them for a day, and they change shape. They open up and look amazing. At first, they seem boring, but they change all the time.""
Susan has always loved plants. ""I studied botany in school and collected wildflowers from the countryside,"" she says. ""I didn't like garden flowers back then; I thought they looked fake, like silk or plastic flowers. I was fascinated by how wildflowers could grow in tough places, like cracks in rocks or on cliffs.""
Today, her garden has many plants from faraway places, but they look at home there. She has a relaxed attitude towards her garden, like a caring aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don’t break anything. 
With two art exhibitions coming up and plenty of inspiration in her garden, Susan has found it hard to spend time working in the garden. She now has an extra gardener, but she knows that to stay connected to her art, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""

Sarah Sutherland-Pilch is a chalet girl in Val d'Isère, France. She is 24 years old and comes from West Sussex. This is her second year in this job, where she cooks and cleans for visitors who come to ski and stay in wooden houses called chalets. Sarah studied French and History of Art at Oxford Brookes University and graduated last summer. She thinks being a chalet girl is a fun way to spend a year or two before starting a career. She meets many interesting people every week.
Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to work. The chalet can host up to 18 guests each week. She has her own breakfast before making breakfast for the guests. They enjoy porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants. After breakfast, which ends around 9:30 a.m., Sarah cleans up and either prepares afternoon tea or cleans the rooms, which she finds the least enjoyable part of her job. By 11 a.m., she is ready to ski. On good days, she can ski until 4:30 p.m.
After skiing, Sarah returns to the chalet to prepare dinner. She takes a shower first but does not sleep because it would make her feel tired. Dinner is served at 8 p.m., and coffee is ready by 10 p.m. After dinner, she cleans the kitchen because she does not like coming back to a messy place. Sometimes she talks with the guests, but other times they prefer to be alone. She enjoys good guests who make her week better, but some weeks are not as fun.
Sarah lives in a chalet with her friends, and they usually go out around 11 p.m. They often start at a place called Bananas, then go to G Jay's, and maybe finish at Dick's T-Bar. However, she does not stay out too late on Saturday nights because Sunday is her busiest day. She calls Sunday a ""frightful day"" because she has to cook breakfast early at 7 a.m. After the guests leave, she cleans quickly, strips the beds, and prepares for the new guests.
If she did not do the shopping on Saturday, she does it on Sunday. By around 3 p.m., after cleaning, she prepares tea for the new guests who arrive around 4:30 p.m. Sometimes they are confused and have many questions. Between tea and dinner, Sarah helps guests who need ski equipment and then gets a ride back to the chalet. Soon, it is time for dinner again, and she might chat with friends, but sometimes she is too tired and goes to bed early."

Mandie Currie is a zoo-keeper. She spent a day at the magazine Marie Claire. ""Choosing what to wear was hard because I usually wear a uniform at the zoo. First, I went to a photo studio, then to press previews, all before lunch. The zoo is a calm place, but here I was rushing around when I could be quietly with an animal. Some people on the fashion team seemed stressed, but my job is not very stressful. At a fashion shoot in the afternoon, I laughed because I usually clean cages or handle rats. I am interested in how magazines work, but I really enjoy my job at the zoo, so I will stay there.""
Alice Cutler is a fashion assistant at Marie Claire. She spent a day at London Zoo. ""I arrived at the zoo in my leather boots and dark blue trousers. The zoo gave me a green polo shirt to wear, which was good because I got very dirty. When I stroked an elephant, I thought Mandie was probably packing clothes. By five o'clock, I was dirty but had a great day. When I retire from fashion, I could see myself working with elephants, maybe in Africa.""
Karen Hodson is a nurse at Hammersmith Hospital. She worked with the television gardening show Ground Force. ""I was very excited to meet the team, and Alan Titchmarsh, the presenter, was very nice. I liked being outside because I sometimes don’t see daylight at work. It was hard work, but it was fun. I thought I was strong, but I felt weak compared to the team. I didn’t expect gardening to be so hard or need so much planning. I enjoy gardening, but I don’t plan to leave my nursing job.""
Charlie Dimmock is a landscape gardener on Ground Force. He worked a shift at Hammersmith Hospital. ""I made beds and gave out medicine. I thought I would feel faint doing some jobs, but I was surprised that it didn’t bother me. The friendship among the nurses is great, and it felt very different from my usual male work environment. I feel my job is not as important as nursing. My day at the hospital was not easy, but it made me feel satisfied.""
Lucy Harvey is a personal trainer. She spent a day with Ryanair as cabin crew. ""I changed into the uniform, and when I put it on, I felt different—people looked at me. Before the flight, our supervisor talked about safety and what to do if someone had a heart attack, which I knew from my fitness training. When the passengers boarded the flight to Paris, I gave out magazines. Everyone stared at me, and I felt nervous. On the way back, we had 80 schoolchildren on board who wouldn’t sit still. I wished I was back in the gym with one sensible adult.""
Sonia McDermott is an air hostess with Ryanair. She spent a day as a personal trainer in a gym. ""I was worried about this swap because I don’t exercise. I was surprised by how much attention you give to one person. In my job, I meet 130 passengers four times a day. At lunch, I saw that some trainers didn’t eat very healthily, but they all drink a lot of water. I wouldn’t change my job for this, but it has inspired me to join a gym and try to be healthier."""

I fell in love with the south of France a long time ago and try to visit as often as I can. There is a local train from Cannes that goes along the coast and crosses the border into Italy. It takes you past beautiful sea views. It doesn’t matter what the weather is like or what time of year it is; the journey is always magical. Out of the other window, you can see some of the best gardens and homes in France. It feels like you are looking into the lives of rich and famous people. The other passengers are always lively because there is a mix of tourists and locals, all enjoying the amazing journey.
**B. Raj Patel - Explorer**  
I have had many great train journeys, but my favorite is the Nile Valley Express, which travels through the desert in northern Sudan. When I was young in South Africa, I missed a family train trip from Cape Town to the Kruger National Park because I was considered too young and troublesome. I was sent to stay with my aunt instead. When I moved to England as a teenager, I still hadn’t traveled by train. London Waterloo was the first real train station I ever saw, and its big glass roof amazed me.
**C. Betty Cooper - Novelist**  
I am very grateful to one train in particular: the Blue Train, which took my husband and me on our honeymoon across France to catch a boat to Egypt. On the train, my husband gave me a pink dress, which I thought was wonderful. Someone said that pink is good for the brain, and I have worn it ever since. What I remember most about the journey is how lovely it was to travel through France and then by boat up the Nile. It was the perfect way to relax after all the wedding planning.
**D. Martin Brown - Journalist**  
We were working on articles about a trip around the world and had to cross a desert in Africa. There was no road, so we took the train called the Desert Express. The schedule was not reliable; we were just told to be ready on a certain day. We heard that the driver would wait for days if he knew people were still coming. When the train arrived, many people rushed to get on, and some even traveled on the roof for free. At night, the train went through some of the most beautiful landscapes I have ever seen. It felt like a dream, like traveling on the moon.
**E. Arisu Mezuki - Actress**  
Most people have favorite memories of trains from when they were children, but I do not. I grew up in Singapore and Cyprus, where I saw very few trains. It was not until I was a teenager that trains became important in my life. I made a film that featured a railway in Yorkshire. Most of the filming was on an old train line that volunteers had taken care of. That is where my love for steam trains started. When we weren’t filming, we took every chance to ride the train, and when I went back last year, it felt like time had not changed. Everything was still the same, even the gas lights on the station platform!"
FCE_8,B2,"'Want to Get Published?**
If you want to publish your story, our expert Margaret Stubbs has some helpful advice. Many readers of this magazine ask, ""I have written a story/book. Who should I send it to?"" First, they need to research where to send their work and improve their writing skills. To sell your writing, you need to understand the publishing world.
No matter what you write, you should learn about the markets you want to reach. The best way to do this is by reading a lot. Visit your local library and check out bookshops and newsagents. Reading different materials will help you understand what kinds of writing publishers are looking for. 
As time goes on, you need to keep updating your knowledge because new publications come out all the time. Editors change jobs, and magazines change their focus. Publishers are always looking for new writers, so you must give them what they want.
At first, you might not know what to write. For example, if you want to write short love stories, you should find out which magazines publish them. Look for recent copies of these magazines and see what kind of stories they buy. Remember, readers have different expectations, and editors want to meet those needs.
Writers often ask me, ""This story has been rejected three times. Am I wasting my time?"" As a former teacher, I never want to discourage anyone. However, it is likely that the work is not ready for publication. Many new writers are too eager to send their work out before they are prepared. If you have only written one story or article, it is very unlikely to be published. 
When you hear about someone’s success, they usually have been in publishing or journalism for years before they became successful. When you send your work for the first time, keep writing more stories while you wait for a reply. Write ten more stories, or even twenty. Each one will be better than the last, and you will start to see yourself as a writer. This will help you gain confidence and improve your skills. 
Don’t throw away any of your stories; instead, work on improving them. I also suggest not showing your work to others in the beginning. Remember, every successful writer has faced many rejections before they succeeded. 
Do everything you can to grow as a writer. Look for a creative writing course near you, or join a local writers' group. This will help you gain ideas and confidence by meeting other writers. Think of yourself as a writer and practice writing every day if you can.'"

On the last day of a bad year, I was waiting at the Baltimore railway station for the 10:10 train to Philadelphia. There were more people than I expected. The station felt different; it was not as clean and bright as usual. Elderly couples with matching bags filled the benches, and many college students had left their bags on the floor.
A grey-haired man was walking around, talking to different people. He looked well-off with his tanned skin and nice clothes. He approached a woman sitting alone and asked her if she was going to Philadelphia. She said she was going north, but to New York. He thanked her and moved on.
Now, he came to an old lady and asked her if she was going to Philadelphia. When she said she was going to Wilmington, he just walked away. I was curious about what he was doing. I was going to Philadelphia, but I understood why he didn’t ask me. He probably thought I looked unreliable.
He looked stressed as he approached a woman reading a book. He asked her if she was going to Philadelphia, and she said yes. Then he asked her for a favor. I stood a little away, pretending to check my wrist, even though I didn’t have a watch. The woman seemed cautious, and the man noticed. He said, “It’s nothing too difficult, I promise!”
They announced my train, and people started moving toward Gate E, pulling their bags behind them. The man explained to the woman, “My daughter is flying out this afternoon for a study year abroad from Philadelphia. I put her on a train this morning, but when I got home, my wife was upset. My daughter forgot her passport and called from the station. She didn’t know what to do.”
The woman listened sympathetically. I thought it was strange. Why didn’t he just go himself? The woman asked him, “Why don’t you go yourself?” He replied, “I can’t leave my wife alone. She’s in a wheelchair.” I thought this was a weak excuse. 
I noticed the man was holding a padded envelope, not a regular one. It looked like it was stapled shut. I thought to myself, “Be careful, lady.”"
FCE_30,B2,"'Gary and Me'**
John Moore is the owner of a restaurant, and he talks about his son Gary, who is a famous TV chef. John believes that everyone gets a chance in life. Gary had his chance with cooking, and John had his chance to run a restaurant. When John found out about a restaurant for sale, he quickly went to see it. The place was in bad condition, but it was perfect for his plans.
Running the restaurant reminded John of his childhood. He remembers being sad when his mother went to work in a factory and left him alone. Because of this, he wanted to have time for family. John's wife took care of their children and managed the accounts while he ran the restaurant. They lived above the restaurant and always made time to eat together as a family. This helped their children, Gary and Joe, become confident. From a young age, they would talk to the regular customers.
Gary was a lively child. When he was about seven, he jumped into a corner bath like it was a swimming pool and hurt himself. As he grew older, he had to earn pocket money. He started with small jobs and by age ten, he was working in the kitchen every weekend, which gave him a lot of money at school. He was very disciplined and often woke up before his father. In a family business, everyone helps out, and John liked seeing Gary work.
Gary was not very good at school, but he was great in the kitchen. By age 15, he was as skilled as the adult cooks and sometimes even managed the kitchen. He could make over a hundred meals, and John knew Gary would work in catering because he had talent. When Gary needed to do work experience for school, John sent him to a friend’s restaurant.
Recently, Gary started playing the drums and formed his own band. John worries about what will happen to Gary's cooking if the music becomes successful. He advised Gary to focus on one thing at a time. John told him that if he wanted to achieve something, he needed to do it by age 30, or it might be too late.
At 17, Gary went to catering college. On his first day, he finished his work quickly while the other students were still learning. He even helped others with their tasks. Everyone is amazed at how successful Gary's TV cooking show has become. John is very proud of him. He always tells Gary that if you want something, you must work hard for it because nothing is given for free. Gary has seen his chance and taken it.
As children grow up, parents hope they listen to their advice. John thinks that if Gary remembers even a little of what he has said, it is a good thing. He is happy with the person Gary has become."
FCE_7,B2,"**Finding a Flat in Dublin**
Finding a good flat in Dublin that you can afford is very hard. The best way to find one is through personal contacts. If you know someone who knows someone who is moving out, that can help. But if, like Jo, you just arrived in Dublin, you might not have any contacts. Jo had to stay in a hostel and look for a flat. For her, Dublin felt very new and unknown. She didn’t think about why she was going there. Everyone at school thought she would leave her small town. They wanted to escape and have a better life. Some of her classmates went to towns like Ennis or Limerick, where family helped them settle in. But Jo was going to Dublin alone.
Jo’s mother thought it would be good for her to stay in the hostel. It was run by nuns, so her mother believed she would be safe. Her father hoped the hostel would be warm because they are often cold. Jo’s sisters, who worked as waitresses, thought she was crazy for staying in a hostel for a whole week. But Jo didn’t know they were talking about her while she answered an ad for a flat in Ringsend. The ad said, ""Own room, own television, share kitchen, bathroom."" It was very close to her job at the post office and seemed too good to be true. Jo hoped it would be nice and that the people would like her and that it wouldn’t be too expensive.
There wasn’t a line for this flat because it was not just a ""Flat to Let,"" but more like ""Third Girl Wanted."" The mention of ""own television"" made Jo wonder if it was too fancy for her, but the house looked normal. It was a simple red-brick house with a basement. The flat was upstairs. As Jo climbed the stairs, a cheerful girl with a college scarf came down. ""Desperate place,"" she said to Jo. ""They’re both awful. Common as dirt.""
""Oh,"" said Jo and continued up. ""Hello,"" said the girl with ""Nessa"" on her T-shirt. ""Did you see that stuck-up girl going out? I can’t stand her kind."" 
""What did she do?"" Jo asked. 
""She didn’t do anything. She just looked around and made a face, then said, 'Is this all there is? Oh dear, oh dear,' in a posh voice. We wouldn’t want her here, would we, Pauline?"" 
Pauline, who had a very colorful shirt, looked interesting to Jo. She had seen punks like her on O'Connell Street but had never talked to one before. 
""I’m Jo, I work in the post office and I called about the flat,"" she said. Nessa said they were about to have tea. She got three mugs; one had 'Nessa,' one had 'Pauline,' and the other had 'Other' written on it. ""We’ll put your name on a mug if you come to stay,"" she said kindly."
FCE_43,B2,"Behind the Dolphin's Smile**
People love dolphins. We enjoy watching them in seaside areas, movies, and TV shows. However, the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society says that dolphins are in trouble. Mark Simmonds talks about the decline of dolphin populations.
Dolphins are special to us. They are very smart animals, they can feel human emotions, and they make us dream of freedom in the ocean. Our love for dolphins has grown because of TV shows. First, there was Flipper, and now there is Darwin from Seaquest. But these happy images hide the real problems dolphins face in polluted and overfished seas.
The number of North Sea harbour porpoises, a type of dolphin, has dropped by up to 89,000. You might think that such popular animals would be protected by law and cared for in special marine areas. Unfortunately, this is not true, and the lack of protection could lead to a big wildlife disaster.
There are forty different types of dolphins in the world. In northern Europe, the most common dolphins are the striped dolphin, the common dolphin, the bottlenose dolphin, and the smaller harbour porpoise. The striped and common dolphins usually live far out in the open sea and are seen in small groups. We know very little about them. Bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises used to be seen often near European coasts. Bottlenose dolphins are very social and were found along the Channel coast and in rivers in Britain, like the Thames. Now, they can only be found in a few places, like the Moray Firth in Scotland and Cardigan Bay in Wales. The few that are left show signs of stress.
It is hard to know exactly why dolphin numbers are decreasing. Overfishing is reducing fish populations and threatening local fishing jobs, which also affects dolphins and porpoises. Porpoises need to find food quickly. If fish are taken from one area, they may not have enough time to find food in another area. They can also get caught in fishermen's nets, which they cannot see. Many modern fishing methods use large nets that can float or move quickly through the water. In recent years, many dead dolphins have washed up on the beaches of France and Cornwall. Marks and cuts on their bodies show that they died because they were caught in these nets.
Dolphins can also store waste and other harmful substances in their bodies. For example, pesticides can build up in dolphins because they dissolve in fat. This means that when female dolphins produce milk, it can contain high levels of these poisons, which can harm their young. There is already one case of a young dolphin dying from its mother’s poisoned milk.
Another serious threat to dolphins comes from human activities. Dolphins live in groups and use sound to understand their environment. In the ocean, noise from ships and oil drilling travels much better than in the air. This noise pollution may disturb dolphins in ways we do not fully understand."
FCE_51,B2,"**Getting Fit**
Exercise is very important for your mind, body, and spirit. It helps you feel balanced, especially when life feels busy and stressful. Many articles talk about fitness because it is really good for you. There are many reasons to exercise, and very few reasons not to.
Exercise helps improve your muscles and can change your body shape quickly. It makes your muscles stronger and helps you stand and sit better. It can also prevent injuries by fixing muscle imbalances. Exercise can improve specific areas like your thighs, stomach, and arms. It is good for your heart, lungs, and blood circulation.
You may have heard these reasons many times, but here is something new: exercise can help reduce feelings of depression and tiredness. It can also help you sleep better and manage stress. Exercise can even help with some health problems. 
If you are not convinced yet, just think about it: exercise is good for you. There are many types of exercise you can try, like aerobics, jogging, or using weights. However, be careful not to train too hard or lift too much weight, as this can cause injuries. It is a good idea to talk to your doctor about what exercises are best for you.
Good posture is also important. If you do not have good posture, exercise will not help you look or feel better. A stiff or slouching body can look unattractive and may cause health issues. To improve your posture, imagine that a balloon is pulling the top of your head up. This can help you breathe better and make your body look slimmer.
Stretching is important too. It helps you move easily and keeps your muscles from getting hurt. If you stretch four or five times a week, you will become more flexible and fit. Stretching should be done slowly and carefully.
The best exercise routine includes warming up, stretching, a good workout, and cooling down afterward."
FCE_11,B2,"**IN THEIR NATURAL HABITAT**
What makes film-makers Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman stay away from home for many months? They are looking for the perfect shot. In the jungles and plains of East Africa, it is not easy to find producer Amanda Barrett and cameraman Owen Newman. Right now, they are in the Ngorongoro Crater, which has had six months of almost non-stop rain. This has caused some unexpected problems. Newman said they had to buy an expensive piece of equipment so that if one of their vehicles gets stuck in the mud, Amanda can pull him back to safety. Their teamwork has created some of the best wildlife films on TV, like their popular film about leopards. While this film was being shown, they were already back in the field, this time following the shy jackal.
Traveling film-makers have been moving around the world to film exotic wildlife since television began. I talked to Newman about their partnership while he was having a rare meeting with other people at a safari lodge. ""We do have some arguments, but we usually get over them quickly,"" he said about working with Amanda. Neither of them sees themselves as the leader, and they get along well because they both understand the animals in a similar way.
""When we travel, we have to set up our tents each night. But now we are staying in a more fixed camp. We leave at 5 a.m. each morning, so we make tea the night before and keep it warm in a flask."" Their daily meals are pre-packed and heated by whoever is available. ""We can be out for up to eight weeks at a time, so cooking can be a bit stressful,"" Newman said. It can be a tough life, but being in remote areas allows them to get close to the animals. Newman remembers filming a family of lions, where one lioness would often go off alone. When she returned, she would greet all the other lions and even their car.
Newman first worked with Barrett in 1988 on a film called ""The Great Rift."" Two years later, they began working together to film Arctic foxes. Since then, they have learned to spend four months in one location to gather enough material for each half-hour film. Before they can start filming, they must submit a script for approval. ""Amanda and I had a good working relationship from the beginning because we shared the same ideas and vision. We want to create a film that shows the true spirit of the place and the animals, and that touches people's hearts. I believe if you can make people feel something, that is better than just making them think."""
FCE_14,B2,"**The Netball Captain**
In our series about women in sports, Suzie Ellis met England's netball captain, Kendra Slawinski. Kendra is the captain of the England netball team. When I met her, she had a busy day. She taught at a local school and then had a training session in a supermarket car park. I was surprised to hear about her training place. I asked her, ""Don't you get strange looks?"" She replied, ""I focus on my movements and my feet, so I don’t notice much else. I might see cars slow down a little, but that’s all.""
Kendra said, ""My whole life is about being my best for the Championships."" She follows a strict schedule to be fit for the games. This is her fourth World Championships, and it will be the biggest one yet, with 27 countries participating. ""We will have home support, which is very special,"" she said. ""It is important to improve the reputation of netball in our country. Playing at home means there will be more pressure. The crowd will expect us to play well.""
Their first game is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. Kendra believes they have always won against them, but she knows they are a strong team. The England team is currently ranked fourth in the world. Kendra explained that the Championships will be tough. ""You have to push yourself every day. There is no rest between games. In a series, you can still win if you lose the first game, but in the Championships, you only have one chance.""
In the fifteen years she has played at a high level, the sport has become harder and faster. Players are more aggressive now. Kendra said, ""You don’t train hard to lose."" But after the game, everyone is friendly. 
Netball is also using more science for fitness testing. Kendra said, ""It is important for us to think and train like world-class players."" As captain, she believes it is important to have a strong mindset and to lead by example. ""I see my role as supporting and encouraging my team.""
Kendra has planned her netball career carefully. She decided that this competition would be her last as a player. She may coach young players in the future, but right now, she is focused on her final big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she might have tears in her eyes. Her loyal supporters will be with her every step of the way."
FCE_63,B2,"In Hot Water**
Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends a lot of time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She teaches and does research in marine geochemistry, which means she studies the chemicals in the sea. Rachel is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she is not teaching, she goes down into a small steel vehicle to explore underwater volcanoes. 
Inside the vehicle, there is very little space. Rachel says, ""I can reach out and touch the two pilots. We cannot stand up or move around, and we must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last for 16 hours: three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours to collect rock and water samples, and three hours to come back up.""
""If there is a problem and we need to get to the surface quickly, we can hit a panic button. This releases a small escape vessel that goes up to the surface quickly. No one has tested it yet, but I think it would not be a nice journey.""
Rachel remembers her first dive. She climbed into the vehicle on a ship with an instructor. He explained what to do in an emergency, like if the pilot had a heart attack. They wanted to see how she would react in such a small space. Now, Rachel has made six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian team. They went to a place five days away from the Canary Islands in the Atlantic Ocean, where there are many underwater volcanoes that blow out black smoke. The Russian team was dropping off equipment to study a project that would create a hole 150 meters through a volcano.
When Rachel is not at sea, she works in her office at the Oceanography Centre in Southampton. ""Two-thirds of my salary comes from teaching, which I love, but I do it so I can continue my research on the 'black smokers.' This is another name for underwater volcanoes, where hot water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke. It comes out at a speed of one meter per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees.""
The only time Rachel felt scared was during her first dive with an American team. They were towing equipment when suddenly there was a loud explosion. She thought, ""I'm going to die."" They waited in silence, and when nothing happened, they felt incredible relief—they were still alive!
""Diving to the deepest part of the ocean is an adventure. Every time I look out of the porthole and see the chimneys, I feel amazed. I am at the bottom of the sea, and no one else has ever seen them before. I studied the black smokers for three years for my Ph.D. When I finally saw them, it was an amazing feeling."""
FCE_56,B2,"**Interview Tips**
First impressions are very important. Studies show that people make judgments about us in the first few minutes of meeting. They notice how we dress, our eye contact, our body language, how fast or slow we talk, our voice volume and tone, and the words we use.
Mary Pearce wanted to be a teacher. She worked hard to earn her degree and felt confident when she graduated. She applied for a job at a nearby primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher. On the day of the interview, she saw a small hole in her jacket. She thought about changing, but she didn’t want to be late because she believes it is important to be on time. Unfortunately, Mary did not get the job. A friend who teaches at the school told her that the Head Teacher said, ""If someone doesn’t take the time to look their best at an interview, what kind of teacher will they be?""
Simon Grant, a hotel manager, says that people who care about their appearance are more likely to care about their jobs. Many people think that what is inside is what matters, but in an interview, you should try to present yourself in the best way.
Janet Goodwood worked for ten years as an administrative assistant in a big accounting firm. When the office manager retired, she applied for the job but did not get an interview. She thought it was a mistake and asked the Director of Personnel what happened. He told her that she did not fit the image of an office manager and suggested she improve her wardrobe before applying again. Janet was shocked because she believed she did a good job and that her clothes should not matter.
Movement and gestures also affect how an interviewer sees a candidate. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian found that only 7% of our message comes from the words we use, 38% from our voice, and 55% from our facial expressions. If our words and facial expressions send different messages, the listener will pay more attention to the non-verbal message. So, it is important that your words match your body language. Mixed messages can confuse the interviewer.
It is also important not to seem too desperate for the job or too eager to please. Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, applied for a promotion and her interview went very well. She was offered the job right away. However, she was too excited and showed too much enthusiasm. The boss realized she would not turn down the offer, so he gave her a lower salary than she wanted. She believes she could have asked for more if she had controlled her excitement.
Finally, what we say and how we say it can help us succeed in an interview. David Artesio, a manager of an employment agency, suggests learning about the company before the interview. For example, the annual report can tell you about the company’s work. Mentioning something that interests you during the interview can show your interest in the company.
Business consultant Marian Woodall advises having a few questions ready and avoiding long, confusing sentences. She says, ""Poor communicators talk in paragraphs. Successful communicators talk in short sentences and key points."""

**The Farmer**  
Matt Froggatt used to work as an insurance agent in London, but now he runs a sheep farm. He worked in the City for 14 years, but he found it was no longer fun. He did not plan to leave his job yet, but he was suddenly made redundant. He did not get a lot of money when he left, but it was enough to start his farm. His big chance came when he met the head chef of a well-known hotel restaurant. By supplying meat to them, he became more popular, and now he also sells meat online. Matt is happy to be out of the office, but he still works long hours, just like before.
**The Painter**  
Ron Able White was a manager in advertising, but now he is an artist. He started painting as a hobby and found it much more exciting than his job. He decided to take redundancy and become an artist. A career counselor helped him, and he told the counselor that he did not want to go back to his old job. This surprised the counselor because most people in their forties need to find work quickly for money. Ron and his wife moved to the north of England, where they did not know anyone. They left their friends behind, but they are happy that their friendships have lasted, and many friends visit them now.
**The Hat Maker**  
Katherine Goodison worked as a lawyer for five years before starting her own hat-making business in her London flat. She enjoyed being a lawyer and earned a lot of money, but the hours were very long. She did not want to become a senior partner and work even more, so she decided to leave. Many people thought she would get bored, but she has not. She keeps busy with deadlines for her fashion business, which helps her stay organized. Katherine feels happier and less stressed now, but she misses talking to colleagues. She loves being responsible for her work. If she does a bad job, she knows it is her fault. When she worked for a company, she cared, but now she cares even more because her name is on the products.
**The Masseur**  
Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16 years before becoming a masseur at the Life Centre in London. He started working in finance at 22, but he did not find it rewarding. He almost lost his job in 1989, so he decided to resign and travel for a year. During that year, he thought about what he wanted to do. He was interested in health, so he visited gyms and talked to the owners about starting a business. He knew he needed qualifications to change careers, so he took courses in massage. Then he got a part-time job at the Life Centre. Paul has no regrets about his choice. He feels more in control of his life now and enjoys having peace of mind."
FCE_6,B2,"'Dedicated to Their Sports'**
Four young sports stars talk about their lives.
**A. Darius (Runner)**  
I have always loved sports. I played many sports, but I was best at football and athletics. When I was 14, I tried out for a professional football club, but I chose to focus on athletics instead. My biggest moment was when I competed for my country in the youth team and won a medal. Unfortunately, it did not get much attention in the media, which was disappointing. I hoped to get some sponsorship because training is expensive. I train at home all winter and then go to Florida for three weeks before the season starts. It is fun because there are great facilities for athletics and the nightlife is good too. However, I have to be very disciplined. If my friends invite me out the night before training, I have to say no. I wish I could go, but being dedicated helps me in this sport. My main goal is to reach the next Olympics - that would be amazing.
**B. Gabriel (Surfer)**  
The surfing community is small, so I meet the same people at competitions. Professional surfers are serious, and the best waves are often at dawn, so I have to avoid late-night parties. I don’t mind this too much, but I love sleeping in, and I usually have to give that up too. However, it is worth it because without this dedication, I might not have won the National Championships last year. After a win, I always celebrate with a big night out, and if I win money, I like to go somewhere nice. The sacrifices are worth it because winning that championship allowed me to present a surfing series on TV. Now, I guess I am a bit of a celebrity.
**C. Dieter (Yacht Racer)**  
When I am on a boat with my friends, we have a lot of fun. We are traditional and always celebrate our wins in style. Some people say we act a bit childish, but we do not look for media attention. Sometimes, reporters seem more interested in our celebrations than in our race results. I am away for eight months each year, so it is nice to come back and spend time with my friends who do different things. You cannot always focus on the sport; it is not healthy. I am known in the sailing world, but I am not recognized much in public. I would not like to be a celebrity. I do get nice letters from fans asking for signed pictures, and I reply to every one, even if it takes time.
**D. Tomas (Tennis Player)**  
It feels great to walk onto the court and hear the crowd cheering for me. At my last tournament, it got a bit crazy with many people around. I do enjoy being recognized by fans when I am out shopping. However, it has some downsides. My last girlfriend did not like it when I got too much attention from female fans. Tennis players travel a lot, and that is why we broke up. It was hard, but you have to make sacrifices in any sport; you need to be serious and professional. It does not bother me too much. I am happy to focus on my game now and will catch up on other things in life after I retire, which comes early in this sport."
FCE_33,B2,"Young Shoppers**
Shopping in a supermarket with children can be very difficult for some parents. One mother says, ""They want everything they see. If it’s not the latest sugary cereal, it’s a Disney video or a comic. Usually, they want all three. I can’t afford all this, and if I give in to their requests, I feel guilty about buying unhealthy food. I hate saying no all the time, and I get stressed before we even leave home. I try to avoid taking them shopping, but then I worry that they are missing out on learning how to make choices. I feel stuck.""
Research shows that children ask for something to buy every two minutes when they go shopping. More than £150 million a year is spent on advertising aimed at children, mostly on television. This amount is likely to grow, and supermarkets are a big part of this advertising. Children often do not understand why their parents say no to certain things, especially when they see attractive ads for sugary foods. 
Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, ""Most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, but these ideas are not always correct. It is good for parents and children to talk about food. If children only hear about products from TV ads, they get a one-sided view. Parents feel frustrated because they have to compete with advertising and often disappoint their children.""
The Independent Television Commission, which controls TV ads, does not allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy things. But, as Dibb points out, ""The goal of advertising is to persuade people to buy products. Even if they cannot say, 'Tell your mom to buy this,' that is still the effect.""
Shopping with children can be stressful for parents because they have to decide which requests to agree to and which to refuse. One mother says she talks to her children about food and advertisements. She feels that her son is critical of ads now, and they have less conflict in the supermarket because he does not ask for things she does not want to buy.
Parents also admit they are not always consistent with their children’s requests. Mike, a father of a seven-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter, says, ""We refuse to buy sweets for our son because they are bad for him, but we buy double cream and chocolate for ourselves. It is nice to buy good things, and it is normal for children to want to share that. But I still get annoyed by their requests. It depends on my mood. If I feel good, I am more likely to say yes. It is hard to be consistent.""
Supermarkets could help reduce the conflict between parents and children by removing sweets from checkout areas or providing supervised play areas. Even if parents spend less money without their children, the idea of shopping without their kids’ demands might attract more customers."

**Five-Star Luxury and Modern Technology**
The Merrion Hotel is a new five-star hotel in Dublin. It was created by changing four large old houses into a hotel. This took a lot of research and nearly two years of work. The hotel has the latest technology to help both the staff and the guests.
Peter MacCann, the General Manager, wants his staff to know the guests' names. For more details about what guests like, he uses the hotel’s computer system. This system helps the hotel give special service to returning guests. It cost £250,000 to set up, but MacCann believes it will be worth it over time. He is happy with how well it works and the services it provides. For example, if a guest asks for certain music CDs during their first stay, those CDs will be ready for them when they come back.
Many hotel guests often complain about room temperature. The hotel has a high-tech system to control this. Guests can change the temperature in their rooms by three degrees around the normal 18°C. The front desk can also adjust the temperature anywhere from 14°C to 25°C.
Business guests will find the technology in their rooms very useful. MacCann thinks that about 65% of the hotel’s business will come from this group. To meet their needs, the hotel has put a business center in each room. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that can also copy and print, and a video-conferencing system.
Technology changes quickly, so the hotel has prepared for future improvements. They have added extra cables for new technology. The televisions are rented, so they can be replaced with newer models when needed. DVD recorders can also be updated.
Even with all this technology, MacCann wants guests to feel comfortable. The hotel has 145 large and well-furnished bedrooms that are welcoming. There is also a swimming pool, a gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a beautiful garden.
The food at the hotel is very important. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, who has two Michelin stars, moved his restaurant to the Merrion. He has designed a new kitchen and improved the restaurant. The hotel also has better parking than before. This partnership is good for both the chef and the hotel. With great technology and a skilled staff, the Merrion Hotel is likely to be successful."
FCE_40,B2,"**Where I Get My Energy**
Emma Marsden asked six women who live life fully to share how they find their energy.
A. **Jeanette Kupfermann, Journalist and Author:** ""I get my energy from excitement. I need to do things that challenge me. When I learn something new, I feel very energized. I also love rhythm; right now, I am learning flamenco dancing. Dance is amazing and gives me energy. If I am bored, I feel tired and think life is not worth it. Doing something meaningful, even in a small way, gives me energy.""
B. **Linda Kelsey, Magazine Editor:** ""I have a lot of work, but I enjoy it all. I love being at work; it is not a burden. If you enjoy what you do, you don’t feel sad, even if you are tired. I need enough sleep, and when I get it, I feel great. When I only sleep six hours, I feel a bit weak. I know exercise gives me energy, but sometimes it is hard to find the energy to do it! I go to a yoga class once a week and try to exercise at home. After I exercise, I feel much better. I often feel low in the afternoon, so I think it’s good to eat something then.""
C. **Annie Nightingale, Disc Jockey:** ""I don’t eat healthy food for energy; I think my energy comes from being enthusiastic and positive. I dislike negative people. I believe we should enjoy our lives and make the most of every moment. Enjoyment is important. I love my job, and the last two years have been very exciting. I work with many lively young people, which energizes me. I enjoy taking photos, even if I’m not sure I’m good at it. I also write words for fun, which helps me relax when I travel a lot.""
D. **Floella Benjamin, Author and Children's TV Presenter:** ""My energy comes from doing things I love. I believe in what I do, both at work and at home with my family. Being positive helps me. I love working with kids because they are full of energy. Energy is like a natural feeling that comes from talking to others. Just smile at someone and see how good it feels when they smile back. I try to eat healthy and don’t smoke or drink, but I don’t have a strict exercise plan. I get my energy from playing with kids.""
E. **Deborah Moggach, Author and Playwright:** ""What I love most is creating a garden from a wasteland. I once turned a concrete area into a beautiful garden. It was better than any workout. Knowing that someone wants to read my writing also gives me energy. I enjoy sneaking into a farmer's land or a forest. If I get caught, I say, 'Oh, what a lovely place! I didn’t know it was private.' I like this because it feels playful.""
F. **Katherine Monblot, Therapist:** ""I believe you need to care about what you do in life. I like to take risks and get bored easily, which keeps me motivated. Doing things I don’t want to do makes me tired. I used to be part of many committees, but I didn’t like how they took my time. You only have a certain amount of energy, so use it for what matters most to you."""
FCE_45,B2,"**ICE SKATING**
Ice skating has been around for thousands of years. Archaeologists have found skates made from animal bones. These bone skates were used until iron skates were made in Scandinavia around 200 AD. For the rich people in Scandinavia, skating was an important skill. In the early 1900s, skating was seen as stylish, but everything changed at the 1924 Winter Olympics when 11-year-old Sonja Henie showed a more athletic way of skating. This made skating very popular.
Today, skating combines art and sports. It is both beautiful and physically challenging. For beginners, balance and control are very important. You can only go faster when you become better at skating. The way you position your body helps with balance. Your legs should be slightly bent, and your knees should be relaxed. This helps keep your body weight centered and leans you slightly forward.
Relaxation is very important in skating. To start, your heels should almost touch, and your feet should point outwards. When you push forward with one foot, make a small movement with the other foot. It’s not too hard! If you keep practicing, you can slowly make bigger movements as you get better.
Learning how to fall is one of the first things a skater should know. Even professional skaters fall sometimes. To fall safely, you should stay relaxed. This helps reduce the impact when you hit the ice. To get up, use your hands to kneel, and then stand up.
Once you feel confident on the ice, you can try different styles like figure skating, freestyle, distance skating, speed skating, and skating in pairs. It is best to start with figure skating and then learn basic freestyle. Most ice rinks have teachers who can help you learn the basic moves, and soon you will be able to do turns, jumps, and spins.
If you watch good skaters, you will see how relaxed they are and how easily they move. To skate well, you should practice exercises regularly. It can be dangerous to skate if your body is stiff, so warm-up exercises are important. These should include stretches for your legs, back, and shoulders, especially for your ankles and knees. After skating, do the same exercises to avoid stiffness.
Skating helps improve balance, coordination, relaxation, and movement. It also makes your heart and lungs stronger and helps your body become healthier. When combined with swimming or jogging, skating is a great way to stay fit."

If you want to see something that makes people cry happy tears, watch a talented child win a medal. Julia Gregson talked to three young stars and their mothers about the joys and challenges of their lives.
A. **Annika Reeder**, 15, won a gold medal for gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games. She wants to be a physiotherapist and compete in the next Olympics. ""Right now, the training is very hard. I don’t have time to watch TV, go out with friends, or do much besides gymnastics and school. I take it one day at a time. When I feel really tired, my coach sometimes gives me a day off, but usually, I keep going. You can’t take too many days off because it makes your body stiff.""
B. **Annika's mother** says, ""From a young age, Annika showed great talent. I have seen some parents push their children, but that doesn’t work. To perform at Annika's level takes a lot of time and energy, and you have to want to do it. People often say we, as parents, have given up a lot, but they don’t see what the sport has given us. We love it and what it has done for Annika. Before gymnastics, she was a shy girl who hid behind me, but now she has met people from all over the world and gained confidence.""
C. **Sarah Stokes** started show-jumping at age 10 and has won the British National Championship. ""It’s great that my parents like show-jumping because they train me and take me everywhere in the horse box. The shows can last from one to five days. I never get tired of it; I love show-jumping because it is exciting and fun. Even if my parents weren’t there, I would still do it because I am determined. I’m happy when they are proud of me, but I do it for myself. This year, I want to qualify for the British young riders (under-18) team. My big dream is to win a gold medal at the Olympics.""
D. **Sarah's mother** says, ""From the moment Sarah sat on a horse at age 1, I knew she had a passion. When she was 5, she would wake up early to exercise her pony. To qualify for big shows, we travel all over England. To save money, we sleep in the horse box. Sarah is very organized. She is always happy on a horse and knows what to do. Watching your child succeed at something they love is amazing.""
E. **Jane McShane**, 10, is the Under-14 Chess Champion in Britain. ""Tournaments are really friendly. I know everyone, and it’s fun. When I play, I don’t focus as much as I should. I just look around and don’t think too much. I’m not worried about being proud; I don’t talk about my success at school because I don’t like to feel embarrassed.""
F. **Jane's mother** says, ""Jane played her first game when she was 5. My father said, 'Let’s see if she likes it.' He tried to teach me when I was young, but I was bored. Jane loved it from the start. By the end of that day, she had memorized all the moves, and by age 6, she was beating adults. I am happy when she wins, but if she wanted to stop playing tomorrow, I would support her. I don’t want to hold her back because she is so talented. If she has this gift, I want her to reach her full potential."""

It's true - we are all getting taller. Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy after school. The teacher joked, ""What do you want to be? The flagpole on a ship?"" This was funny because Chris was already almost two meters tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is the tallest man in Britain.
Every ten years, the average height of people in Europe increases by one centimeter. More tall people are being born, but this does not mean we are becoming a super race. Instead, we are going back to how our ancestors were. We are losing the effects of many years of poor diet, which is making a big difference. Professor Chris Stringer, a palaeontologist, says, ""We are becoming like Cro-Magnons again, the people who lived on Earth 40,000 years ago.""
For most of human history, our ancestors ate a variety of foods. Women gathered herbs, fruits, and berries, while men hunted animals. One study found they ate from 85 different wild plants. But about 9,000 years ago, farming started, and this changed everything. Many green areas of the planet became farms, and now just three plants - wheat, rice, and maize - provide more than half of the calories people eat today. This poor diet has harmed human health. 
In a study in Ohio, scientists found that when they started to grow corn, healthy hunter-gatherers became sickly farmers. Tooth decay and diseases increased. Corn, which was thought to be good, actually caused health problems. However, farming spread because one piece of land could feed ten times more people than hunting and gathering. 
Today, many people are still poorly nourished, but some wealthier countries are starting to eat better again. In the US, the average man is now 179 cm tall, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. This is a good trend, but it has its own problems. Even though people are getting taller, beds have not changed in length since 1860. Also, there seems to be less legroom in planes and trains, and clothing companies have to change their products often.
The question is: how tall can we get? We cannot keep growing forever. Some scientists think we might reach a height of 193 cm this century. However, there is a note of caution. While people may be getting taller because of better nutrition, as a species, we are actually getting smaller. 
During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, humans were a bit rounder and taller to keep warm. Now that the climate is warmer, we seem to be getting thinner and shorter, even when we eat well. As the planet continues to warm, we might get even smaller. In other words, the growth of humans could be affected by global warming."
FCE_57,B2,"Studio Audiences**
What is it like to be in the audience when a television show is being made? Cosmo Landesman found out. Studio audiences are a common part of television, but many people do not understand them. When we watch game shows, we often wonder, ""Who are these people?""
Some people think that studio audiences are not very important. I have heard that even people who work in television do not respect them. Some say they treat studio audiences ""like cattle."" I used to think that studio audiences were made up of silly people who wanted to be on TV for a moment. But there is no typical studio audience. They come from different backgrounds, jobs, and income levels. Television shows try to attract different types of people for different programs.
Many people who watch TV at home do not understand why anyone would want to be in a studio audience. Why would someone apply for tickets, travel far, and sit for hours in a studio just to watch what they can see at home? One reason is that people hope to be on TV for a moment. I did not believe this until I spoke to Angela. She said, ""I came for a chance to be on television."" Another reason is that people are curious to see how a show is made. But the most common reason I heard was, ""A friend gave me a ticket.""
Most of us have never been in a studio audience, but we think we know what it is like. You sit close to strangers while someone shows cards that say APPLAUD or LAUGH, and you clap or laugh when told. This is true for some shows, but not all. One studio manager said, ""We believe a show should be good enough not to need these signs.""
Is there a real difference between being in a studio and watching at home? For Claire, being in a studio is ""more exciting."" Charlotte liked feeling involved with live television. She said, ""Last year I saw my favorite comedian. When you watch him at home, you miss a lot."" What I missed was seeing the live actors. From my seat, I could only see the back of someone’s head. The opening scenes were so far away that I ended up watching the show on a monitor.
Going to a studio may not be the best way to watch television, but that is not what matters. For most people in the audience, it was just fun and a free night of entertainment."

**Bruce**  
I don’t like wild landscapes. I prefer places with people. When I travel, I like beautiful villages with old temples, not empty deserts. When I was eight, I went to school in England. On Saturdays, I would ride my bike to the village of Lastingham in its lovely valley. Cycling helped me relax from school. I enjoyed exploring the hills, valleys, and old villages. Coming from Scotland, I found the landscape familiar but also different. I still visit there today. I used to write about my adventures in my diary. This was my first try at travel writing, which later became my career.
**Sophia**  
There is a small train that goes from Hythe to Dungeness, run by volunteers. I always travel first class because it doesn’t cost much more than the regular ticket. The views are not amazing. The train goes across Romney Marsh with its sheep and next to a canal. But there is one part of the journey I always look forward to - when the train goes through back gardens. For a few moments, we see people doing everyday things, like making tea or folding a chair. I see myself in their eyes, a woman in a small train, looking into their homes. I like the simple landscape of fields, sheep, and a distant grey sea. It makes me look more closely for something special.
**Matthew**  
The Hartland Peninsula is a quiet and beautiful coast. The beaches are hard to reach and have many rocks, so there are not many people here. A few brave surfers come, but most visitors just enjoy the beauty of the sea. This coast faces the Atlantic and is known for shipwrecks. There are walking paths along the coast that you can combine with trips into beautiful valleys full of oak trees, ferns, and wildflowers. We stay in a simple self-catering place with a family in the village of Southole.
**Annette**  
My favorite place in England is the Trough of Bowland, a wide-open moorland that is great for hiking. There are not many people living there or visiting. It is a quiet and remote area, and I like the feeling of space. I found this place by chance when I was a student, and I visit every year, either alone, with my boyfriend, or now with my son. It has not changed much since my first visit. Having a child makes these visits more special. I feel sad that he is growing up in a city.
**James**  
I bought Glenthorne, my favorite house in Britain. I wanted peace and to reconnect with my English roots. I grew up in what is now Sri Lanka, but when I was twelve, I went to school in Devon, in the west of England. I used to ride my bike around the moors and village streets. There was a story about a place we would never cycle past: if you went down the driveway, you would never return. That place was Glenthorne. It is my dream place. It is a magical, quiet, romantic house. You can only hear the sea, wind, and birds."
FCE_42,B2,"**HAPPY HUNTING GROUND**
We are a family that loves animals. One afternoon, my daughter called me at work to tell me she had found a beautiful pine snake. She asked, ""Can we keep him?"" I said, ""Yes, but only for one night."" We had a special tank ready for animals like this, so we could look at it and learn more from our natural history book.
I got home late and quickly started boiling some water when I heard my sons screaming, ""Oh, Mother! Help! Do something!"" I ran to their bedroom. The problem was with Domino, our cat, and Bianca, the white mouse I had received as a Mother's Day gift. Domino was running around with the mouse in his mouth, trying to find a way out. I jumped into the room but tripped and fell on the floor. 
While I was thinking about how to stop Domino, I noticed the snake. It was escaping from the table and slithering all over the floor. The snake and I were in the middle of a chaotic scene with the cat, mouse, and kids all jumping around and screaming. The dog was barking loudly, and the pot in the kitchen boiled over. I quickly turned off the gas and went back to help.
I managed to grab Domino by the tail and saved the small, wet mouse from his mouth. This same mouse was caught by Domino three more times in its life but lived until it was old.
Feeling confident after saving the mouse, I looked at the snake. It seemed strong and calm. I sat on the floor, trying to stay still. Slowly, the snake relaxed and rested its head on its body. I carefully lifted the snake and walked to the end of the garden. I wanted to let it go near a tree.
When I finally let go of the snake's head, I was scared it would bite me. Instead, it slid over my shoulders like a colorful scarf. We stood there in the evening light, with my four children, me, and the snake. My oldest son, DJ, broke the silence and said, ""Mum, you are warm, and the shed is not.""
I asked the children to help me encourage the snake to move. Slowly, it started to go up the wall and disappeared over the roof. As the last part of its tail vanished, my three-year-old son Clay sighed and said, ""Wow, that was one big snake!"""
FCE_59,B2,"'Write to Me!'**
In our fast world with phones and computers, writing letters is becoming less common. However, I believe that receiving a letter is special and cannot be replaced by other ways of communicating. There is excitement when a letter arrives, joy in seeing who it is from, and happiness in reading what it says.
I have been writing letters for a long time. It started with little notes to my mother. She always made me write thank-you letters for Christmas and birthday gifts. It didn’t matter if they were short or messy, as long as they were letters. When I left home at 18 to study medicine in London, I wrote to my parents every week, and they wrote back. Sometimes my father wrote long, funny letters, which I loved. Most of the letters were about everyday life with my parents and their friends. We also talked on the phone, but I remember the letters more.
I also received letters from my boyfriends. Many of them had to work or study far away, so we kept in touch by writing. Writing letters helped our relationships because I could express my feelings better in writing than in speaking. I enjoy letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. Notes are nice, but it’s even better to get a lot of news at once! I love receiving letters from friends in other countries, like Mangala in Sri Lanka, a penfriend in Australia, and another in Vancouver. I also have a friend in France. We started talking in a restaurant while on holiday, and I asked for her address. If she hadn’t replied, we would have missed out on a great friendship. Now, we write to each other regularly. I can practice my French with her, and we have visited each other’s homes.
My best letter-writing experience was this summer when my family and I visited my American penfriend in Texas. We had been writing to each other for 29 years but had never met. People were surprised that our friendship lasted so long, and the local newspaper even wrote about it. I am happy that my children are also writing letters. Like my mother, I make them write their own thank-you letters. My daughter writes me little letters, just like I did for my mother. She and my son have penfriends in Texas, set up by my penfriend. I encourage everyone not to let letter writing become a lost skill."

**Careless Tourists Damage Ancient Rock Art**
Many ancient pictures carved into the rocks at a famous tourist site in France are being slowly destroyed. Scientists are worried that the 36,000 drawings on rocks in Mont Bego in the French Alps are being damaged so quickly that they may not last for future generations. The mountain is thought to have been a place for prayer and worship, and it has drawings that are about 4,000 years old. These drawings show cows with horns, fields, and different gods and goddesses. 
As more people visit the site, the pictures are being ruined by careless graffiti. Jean Clottes, the chairman of the International Committee on Rock Art, says, ""People think that because the pictures have been there for so long, they will always be there. But if the damage continues like this, there will be nothing left in 50 years."" He has seen tourists stepping on the drawings, which wears away the rock and makes the artwork less clear. Some visitors even take pieces of the rock home as souvenirs. He also mentions that when people cannot take a good photograph, they rub the drawings to make them look clearer. 
Other researchers have noticed that some people come with long sticks to scratch their own drawings or names into the rocks. Experts disagree on how to protect the drawings. Henry de Lumley, the director of the Museum of Natural History in Paris, believes the best way to save the site is to make the whole mountain a ""no-go"" area, allowing the public to visit only on guided tours. He says that if this does not happen, the site will be completely destroyed, and important research will be lost. 
Clottes disagrees with this idea. He says, ""Henry de Lumley's plan is very strict, and while it may work, it will also upset the local people."" He reminds us that the site was declared a historic monument by the Ministry of Culture, and we must do everything we can to protect it. 
David Lavergne, a regional architect, also wants to keep the site open. He says, ""Henry de Lumley's idea is not the best. Our department believes that people should be able to see the site, but it is hard to stop visitors from causing damage because the area is so large. I wish everyone could visit, but we do not have enough money to hire enough guards. We may need to think about charging a fee since there is no government funding."" 
In Nice, Annie Echassoux, who has also studied the site, is worried that as the mountain becomes easier to reach, the damage will increase quickly. She believes the only solution is to close off parts of the area and provide guides. ""We cannot say we cannot do anything because there is no money,"" she says. ""That is not good enough. Money must be found because the Ministry of Culture has classified this area as a historic site. If we do not take action, we will be responsible for losing the drawings for future generations."""
FCE_32,B2,"Young Shoppers**
Shopping in a supermarket with children can be very difficult for some parents. One mother says, ""They want everything they see. If it’s not the latest sugary cereal, it’s a Disney video or a comic. Usually, they want all three. I can’t afford all this, and if I give in to their requests, I feel guilty about buying unhealthy food. I hate saying no all the time, and I get stressed before we even leave home. I try to avoid taking them shopping, but then I worry that they are missing out on learning how to make choices. I feel stuck.""
Research shows that children ask for something to buy every two minutes when they go shopping. More than £150 million a year is spent on advertising aimed at children, mostly on television. This amount is likely to grow, and supermarkets are a big part of this advertising. Children often do not understand why their parents say no to certain things, especially when they see attractive ads on TV.
Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, ""Most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, but these ideas are not always correct. It is good for parents and children to talk about food. If children only hear about products from TV ads, they get a one-sided view. Parents feel frustrated because they have to compete with advertising and often disappoint their children.""
The Independent Television Commission, which controls TV ads, does not allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy things. But, as Dibb points out, ""The goal of advertising is to persuade people to buy products. Even if they cannot say, 'Tell your mom to buy this,' that is still the effect.""
Shopping with children can be stressful for parents because they have to decide which requests to agree to and which to refuse. One mother says she talks to her children about food and advertisements. She feels that her son is now critical of ads, and they have less conflict in the supermarket because he does not ask for things she does not want to buy.
Parents also admit they are not always consistent with their children’s requests. Mike, a father of a seven-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter, says, ""We refuse to buy sweets for our son because they are bad for him, but we buy cream and chocolate for ourselves. It is nice to buy good things, and it is normal for children to want to share that. But I still get annoyed by their requests. It depends on my mood. If I feel good, I am more likely to say yes. It is hard to be consistent.""
Supermarkets could help reduce the conflict between parents and children by removing sweets from checkout areas or providing supervised play areas. Even if parents spend less money without their children, the idea of shopping without their kids’ demands might attract more customers."
FCE_65,B2,"Climbing Walls**
In the past, climbers went to the mountains to climb. Now, people can climb in many places, both inside and outside. A crowd watches as the French climber Francois Lombard hangs upside down by two fingers on a climbing wall. He is competing in the World Cup Climbing Championships at the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham. This arena is better known for the TV show Gladiators, but both events have one thing in common - The Wall. New technology has made these events possible.
Before the mid-1960s, climbers practiced on cliffs where there were good climbing spots. In winter, they had to deal with cold weather, go for walks, or climb on snow and ice in Scotland. As climbing became more popular, it was important for climbers to stay fit. Since they could not use cliffs for much of the year, they started to climb on brick edges or stone buildings. This helped them keep their fingers strong and avoid boredom.
Soon, many sports centers built climbing walls using special bricks. One of the first climbing walls was made by Don Robinson, a physical education teacher, in a corridor at Leeds University in the mid-1960s. He created a wall with natural rock set in concrete. Many climbing walls like this were built in sports halls in the 1970s, but they had some problems. These walls were only straight up and down, while real cliffs have different shapes like overhangs and slanted rocks. Once the walls were built, they could not be changed, and climbers would get bored with the same holds.
In 1985, a Frenchman named Francois Savigny created a new material that could be shaped like the rocks on cliffs. These shapes could be attached to any wall and removed when climbers wanted something new. French companies also started to make climbing walls with steel frames. Steel was lighter than concrete, so it was easier to build overhanging walls. This new system allowed climbers to have many different holds to use."
FCE_61,B2,"'So You Want to Be an Actor'**
Do you want to be an actor? If you tell someone about your dream to be an actor, they will probably say it is a risky choice. Acting is indeed a risky career. There are many actors, but not enough jobs for all of them. When you decide to become an actor, some friends may think you are making a bad choice, while others may support you. Everyone will give you different advice. 
Choosing to be an actor is a personal decision, and you are responsible for your own success. There are no easy ways to become an actor. You do not have to take written tests, and there is no guarantee that you will get a job after your training. Success depends on both luck and talent. However, there is always a need for new actors, and acting can be exciting and rewarding.
Many people want to know what talent is. I think talent is a mix of natural skill and imagination. Imagination is hard to measure. It also depends on a person's courage and belief in their work. 
Why do people want to act? It can be hard to explain. In theater, the important moment is when the actor connects with the audience. This connection is what motivates actors to perform. When you ask successful actors how they achieved their success, they often do not have a clear answer. They know some things about their skills and techniques, but they do not take their success for granted. They understand that their success can change quickly.
Disappointment is a big challenge for actors. Last month, you might have been without work, doing other jobs like selling clothes or waiting tables. Then, you might get a chance to audition for a role. Even if you really want the job, you might not get it. Because of this, actors often avoid talking about their chances of getting a role. They find ways to cope with the stress of competition and the fear of rejection. No one likes to be rejected. 
From the moment you start auditioning, you are saying that you are ready and hopefully talented enough for the job. In many ways, your success depends on how much you care about acting. If you do not care, others may not care about you either."

Their grandfather, Lucien Rajotte, a grocer from Quebec, Canada, brought the game to the USA and taught it to his family. Soon, every weekend and holiday, the family played the game and had a great time. Eventually, they moved to New Mexico, but they still played pichenotte with the board that Grandpa made from old wooden crates.
When visitors came over, they were often curious because the game was unknown in the southern USA. Three years ago, Dave noticed that the old pichenotte board was cracked and decided to make a new one. It turned out to be beautiful. A relative saw it and wanted one, then a friend wanted one too. To see how much interest there was, the brothers took one of Dave's new boards to a sports bar in Santa Fe. ""People started to watch,"" says Dave, ""and said, 'No way I'm playing that silly game.' But soon they sat down, and you couldn't get them up from the table!""
When people asked about the game's origins, Dave did some research. He found that the game probably started in India, where a similar game called 'carroms' is played. This game changed into 'squails' in Britain, and British people brought it to Canada. Pichenotte is the French-Canadian version that developed in Quebec. 
Pichenotte can be played by two to four people and is a game of skill. Each player has 12 pieces or 'pucks'. They flick the pucks across a wheel-like board using their fingers. Flicking a puck into a small hole is worth 20 points. There are three rings around the hole worth 15, 10, and 5 points. The game usually lasts about two minutes. 
When the brothers saw how popular the game was at the bar, they made more boards and took them to markets and craft fairs. Many people came to buy them, and the game's popularity grew. Soon, championships started, and a trophy called the 'Lord Pichenotte Cup' was created. As word spread, the boards sold quickly. The brothers decided to make pichenotte their full-time business. They set up a workshop in their garage and have made more than 450 boards. Each board is made of birchwood and mahogany, weighs 12kg, and is 1cm thick. Norm says, ""They're very strong because they need to last a long time."" 
Each board costs $595 and can be bought from the brothers' website. There are no professional pichenotte players or TV shows yet, but the brothers hope that one day their garage will be home to a luxury car instead of tools and wood. For now, they are happy to spend their free time playing the game they hope will make them successful."
FCE_41,B2,"**WELCOME TO THE MODEL VILLAGE**
When you first enter the Model Village, it is hard to believe that a few years ago this was just a piece of empty land, covered in weeds. For a long time, people thought it was useless. One man, with the help of his wife, worked very hard to change this land into the beautiful village you see today. 
Many tons of soil and clay were moved to change the flat land into the lovely landscape you see now. Machines like bulldozers helped, but a lot of hard work was done by hand. After shaping the land, about 1,000 tons of topsoil were added to create the lawns, flower beds, and rock gardens. Hundreds of trees and bushes were also planted. These plants were chosen carefully because they needed to survive near the sea and withstand strong winter winds. Most plants came from local garden centers, but some were brought from Canada and New Zealand.
The Model Village was created by Colin Sims, who made over 100 models by hand over nine years, starting in 1972. The models are made from different materials like stone, concrete, treated wood, and plastic to resist all kinds of weather. At first, Colin needed help from experts to learn how to use these materials, but soon he became an expert himself. 
You will notice that everything is built to the same scale, and even the smallest details are carefully made. This took a lot of patience and special building techniques. The Model Village is very popular and is known for its high quality and good maintenance. The methods used here have been used in other model villages in England and even taught in some college courses about modeling.
All the buildings in the village show traditional British styles and are not based on one specific place. One of the most impressive buildings is the Manor House, which is a typical 13th-century stone building with a brick tower. You will also see a Castle, St Mary's Church, a zoo, and a mini golf course, which is the newest addition to the village.
Please stay on the paths during your visit and do not touch the models; if you accidentally break something, it can take us a long time to fix it. You can take photos from the paths only. Dogs are welcome if they are on a short lead.
To make your visit more enjoyable, you will find buttons in front of some models. Press these buttons to see the models move. At the end of your visit, we would love to hear your comments. We are always planning new models, and your ideas can help us create a more interesting display. We also want to know if any models did not meet your expectations. We are always updating the models and need your feedback.
We hope you enjoy your visit and look forward to seeing you again. Don’t forget to tell your friends about us!"

Every week, British tabloid newspapers publish pictures that invade people's privacy and break the rules set by newspaper editors. While some pop stars do pose for photographers sometimes, this is not common. More often, these pictures cause great harm to famous people when their private moments are shown on the front page. Very few of them ask for help from the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), which was created to handle these problems. These pictures rarely serve the public interest. For example, do private photos of pop stars help solve crimes? How did a picture of a famous actress on a hotel balcony help public health and safety? The actress has complained about such pictures before, and since she was in a hotel, where people expect privacy, she had a good reason to complain, but she did not take any action. It is a scandal that the PCC did not start an investigation. 
The PCC should also look into a recent story about a pop star's love life. Like the actress, the pop star has not made a formal complaint. Shouldn't the PCC take action on this and other unfair stories? This seems like a good idea. It could lead to many decisions against newspapers. These decisions would be reported by other newspapers and shown on TV and radio. The public would not support these newspapers, and editors would have to stop publishing such stories. Photographers would also be affected, as they would not be able to hide and take pictures of celebrities anymore. 
If the PCC decided to act like a ""police officer,"" there would be some problems. How would it decide to start an investigation? Should it talk to the victim and encourage them to complain? And if the person still did not want to complain, should the PCC still investigate? Celebrities and royal family members might expect that any story about them would be looked into, and they might be upset if it is not. The job of the PCC is very big. How could it monitor all of the British press, including national and local newspapers and magazines? 
There is also the issue of embarrassment. Even if someone's privacy is invaded, would they want the added embarrassment of an investigation? Most people probably just want to forget about it and continue with their lives. Some might have other reasons to stay quiet. They might have a worse story that they do not want to be made public if they complain. In this way, the PCC could also become a problem for them. 
One British comedian faced issues with the press when he and his wife were secretly photographed on their honeymoon in the Caribbean. He did not complain then, and he did not complain later when a photographer took pictures of him and his family during a holiday. He was afraid that the newspaper, News of the World, would publish the pictures again with a new story about his anger, saying they thought it was just a joke and that, as a comedian, he would have a sense of humor. This fear is understandable. People think they will become targets again if they challenge the tabloids. It is hard to find an easy solution to this serious problem."

Juliette Davidson spent her first year after leaving St. Aldate's College working for three lawyers. It was a good first job because they were supportive. She learned how to work in an office and improved her typing skills. However, there was no chance for promotion. One day, she decided to leave, bought a plane ticket, and traveled for a year.
Now, Juliette works as a Personal Assistant to Brenda Cleverdon, the Chief Executive of Business in the Community. She says, ""In two and a half years, I have become more skilled, and my job has really grown. From the start, my boss wanted to help me develop. My job title is the same, but my tasks have changed. I now do most of the correspondence and budgets, and I handle questions from company chairmen to people wanting to start their own business. Brenda includes me in all her work and also gives me specific projects and events to organize."""
FCE_17,B2,"'What is the Secret of Confident People?'**
Confident people seem like they were born that way, but most say it is a skill they learned. Nina Hathway talks to five people about how they became confident.
**A. Jenny**  
When I left school, I was very shy and thought I would always be that way. When I was about twenty-five, I helped at my daughter's school. I was nervous, but I did well. Someone suggested I take a university course. On my first day, I was very anxious, but my confidence grew over time. Working at the school changed my life and helped me in many ways.
**B. Michaela**  
Four years ago, my father got sick, and I had to run the family business. I was scared and became too aggressive. I thought that was how confident people acted, but I learned that confidence comes from believing in yourself. If work gets too hard, I don’t feel guilty about leaving some tasks for the next day. When I face something difficult, I remind myself that I have nothing to lose. Fear can make you feel unconfident, so I talk to myself to calm my fears.
**C. Lisa**  
People think I am very confident, but I often feel scared inside. I learned to look confident because it is important in my job in TV. Interviewing people showed me that many of us feel tense in important situations. My mother gave me great advice when I was a teenager worrying about clothes: 'Who is looking at you? Everyone is too busy thinking about themselves.' I also believe that facing your fears helps you gain confidence. I was very nervous during my driving test, but I passed. After that, I felt I could handle anything.
**D. Barbara**  
I feel confident because I enjoy my work, but I have built this confidence over time. If you keep working and learn from mistakes, you will feel more confident next time. I work hard and am liked at my restaurant, but not everyone likes me. I don’t let that bother me. You need to like yourself for who you are, not try to be what others want. My company offers training courses, which have helped my self-esteem. It is good to set small goals so you can see your progress instead of trying to do everything at once.
**E. Kim**  
After college, I worked as a secretary and often sat in meetings without speaking up. Eventually, I found the confidence to share my ideas. When I started working in politics, I was very nervous about speaking in public. I told myself, 'Don’t be silly. People do this every day, so you can too.' I also found it helpful to write down my thoughts, like having a comfort blanket. I believe everyone feels a bit nervous when speaking in public. The real secret to confidence is to keep telling yourself, 'Nothing is impossible.'"
FCE_47,B2,"**Visit to Malaysia**
Paul Forster goes to a kite-flying festival and spends a nervous night in the forest. Adnan Ali smiled when I gave him his torn kite. ""You have to keep it,"" he said. ""It's traditional - if the line breaks, finders keep it... and I have many more."" He pointed to a pile of beautifully decorated kites at his feet. All the kites were 120 cm wide and long, made of tissue paper and bamboo. We sat in the shade of the tall trees behind the Beach of the Seven Lagoons in Kelantan, and watched Malaysia's biggest kite festival.
In the center of the beach, there were 10 platforms where helpers held up the kites. A line of nervous competitors held the lines of their kites and waited for the countdown. When the whistle blew, the crowd cheered, and the kites flew into the air like rockets. More than 500 men and boys had signed up for the competition, which lasts for five days every year. Each person entered four different kite designs, which were judged on decoration, stability in the air, and how well they flew. 
""Flying kites isn't so difficult,"" said Adnan, ""but making them takes real skill. Visit me at home, and I'll show you how to do it."" I received five invitations that day, and I decided to accept his. At his house, I drank cold milky tea and ate fish crackers in a large room. As night came, he asked me to come back the next day to help rebuild his kite, but I couldn't. Instead, I explored the southern part of the state, driving towards Kuala Lumpur, through beautiful mountains with thick rainforests.
I took a wrong turn, and the smooth road ended at a river. A small boat was waiting to take people across. Nearby, I saw a sign that said: ""Jelawang Jungle 3 km."" Before I started walking, it would have been good to know that most of the path was steep and slippery. When I reached the campsite, I met Baba, who took care of a kitchen and some bamboo huts. I decided to stay there, trying not to think about the insects under my thin mattress. 
At night, it was very dark, and I could hear many different sounds. A waterfall was loud nearby, and many creatures were moving around. In the morning, I saw a great view of five green mountain ranges. In the afternoon, it rained. First, there was wind, then lightning hit the trees. I got soaked. As I slid down the hill, I wondered how the big butterflies avoided the heavy rain. I also worried about my car getting washed away (it sometimes happens) and if I would drown if I opened my mouth. Luckily, my car was still there, covered in mud, at the bottom of the hill.
In Kota Bahru, the capital of Kelantan, everyone asked me questions: ""Where are you from?"" ""How old are you?"" But they were friendly. Kelantan is known for its kites, but I remember it more for the kindness of its people."
FCE_48,B2,"What Kind of Shopper Are You?**
We all go shopping, but we do it in different ways. Do you know what kind of shopper you are? Abby Edwards asked some people about their shopping habits.
A. **Melanie, 22, Dancer**  
""I love shopping! I can't spend enough money. When I have cash, I go shopping and feel happy. I can't walk past sale signs. My boyfriend is the same, so we often go shopping together. We are both addicted to shopping!""
B. **Brenda, 40, Office Manager**  
""I don't like shopping much. My husband does most of the food shopping because he cooks and knows what he likes. I take my son and daughter shopping for clothes, but I don't enjoy it because we all like different things. I don't spend money on myself often, so when I do, I feel guilty and tell my husband I spent less than I really did.""
C. **Juliet, 28, Personnel Manager**  
""I only shop for what I need. I hate shopping and only go when I have to. When I do go, I know exactly what I want and I don’t want anything else. Shopping makes me tired, and I would rather be doing something else.""
D. **Anita, 35, TV Producer**  
""I like to look around sometimes, but I usually know what I want and where to find it. I don’t waste time and try to shop quickly. However, I have bought things I didn’t really need, so maybe I’m careful but sometimes make mistakes.""
E. **Lizzie, 41, Secretary**  
""I really dislike shopping. I can never find what I want, and the shops are too noisy and messy. Luckily, I don’t have to shop for clothes often because I get most of my clothes for free. For food, I go to the supermarket once a week and do it quickly.""
F. **Lisa, 22, Actress**  
""I think I’m a happy shopper. Sometimes I go shopping with my friends, and we often end up buying things. I don’t usually go with a specific item in mind, but if I see something I like, I buy it.""
G. **Suki, 26, Art Gallery Assistant**  
""I’m a careful shopper. I enjoy shopping, but I don’t buy a lot. I usually know what I want and don’t spend too much. Sometimes I shop to feel better, but then I feel worse if I spend too much.""
H. **Ann-Marie, 29, Nursery Worker**  
""I love shopping, but only on certain days and never on Saturdays because it’s too busy. I’m a careful shopper. I have an idea of what I want and I look in different shops to find the best price, which takes a long time!""
I. **Linda, 32, Restaurant Manager**  
""I don’t like shopping much. Since I work in the city, shopping is not exciting for me anymore. When I have to shop, I don’t try things on because it’s too much trouble. The clothes I buy don’t always fit, but I don’t mind making mistakes."""
