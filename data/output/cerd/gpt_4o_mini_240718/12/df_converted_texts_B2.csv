**Garbage in, garbage out**

Charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems like a good idea for the environment and for saving money. However, it may not be as effective as it seems. In many developed countries, the way we collect rubbish is similar. Rubbish bags or bins are picked up regularly by special trucks and taken to a landfill. Economists find this strange because, in most places, this service is free. Households pay for it through local taxes, but a family that throws away a lot of rubbish pays the same as a couple that throws away very little. 

The cost of rubbish disposal is not zero. The more rubbish people throw away, the more trucks and workers are needed, which increases costs for local governments. If rubbish disposal is free, people may produce too much rubbish. A common solution is to make households pay for the amount of rubbish they throw away. This could encourage them to throw away less and recycle more, as long as local governments provide places to recycle.

However, economists Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman found that this logical solution can have complicated and sometimes disappointing results. They studied several American towns that started charging households for rubbish. The most common method was to sell stickers or tags that people had to attach to their rubbish bags. Only bags with these tags would be picked up.

In a study published last year, Fullerton and Kinnaman looked at a program started in July 1992 in Charlottesville, Virginia, a town with about 40,000 people. Residents had to pay 80 cents for each tagged bag of rubbish. While this seems like a good use of market forces, the authors found that the benefits of the program did not cover the costs of printing tags, paying sellers, and running the program. 

Although the number of bags collected fell by 37%, this was mainly because people started to cram more rubbish into each bag instead of buying more tags. This method of compacting rubbish is not as effective as using machines at landfills. The total weight of rubbish collected only fell by 14% in Charlottesville, while in 25 other Virginia cities without a pricing scheme, it fell by 3.5%. 

Worse still, some people began to dump their rubbish illegally instead of paying for collection. Although it is hard to measure, the authors estimate that illegal dumping may account for 30-40% of the reduction in collected rubbish. 

On a positive note, there was a 15% increase in the amount of materials recycled, suggesting that people chose to recycle (which is free) instead of paying to have their rubbish taken away. However, this increase may not be directly related to the fee, as many people were already recycling in Charlottesville.

In a more recent study, Fullerton and Kinnaman looked at rubbish disposal in more detail. They found that charging for rubbish does reduce the amount thrown away, but not by much. On average, a 10% increase in sticker prices only reduces rubbish by 0.3%. This is less than in other studies, but it makes sense. To significantly reduce rubbish, people would need to buy less of everything. A small tax on rubbish is unlikely to make a big difference.

If this is true, we should consider whether other factors, like income and education, are just as important as price. For example, in richer towns, people tend to throw away more rubbish and have less time to recycle. 

Should we say that charging households for rubbish is a bad idea? Not really; free disposal is probably too cheap. However, the effects of simple policies can be complex. Detailed economic studies are often needed to understand them, and sometimes the results are not very pleasant."
CPE_19,"**Simplified Text:**

Theodore Zeldin explores how our work life could change. Do you feel respected and appreciated in your job? Success in a career is not enough anymore. Many professions feel undervalued, and even successful people often feel unhappy despite their fame. Loving your job used to be enough to make you special, but now you need to think about how your job affects you as a person, your mind, character, and relationships. This is an important question. No matter how skilled you are, if your work makes you boring or unable to talk to others outside your field, then no amount of status or money can make up for that.

Zeldin wants to find ways for work to help people feel fulfilled, rather than just being a tool for industry. Work should not only create wealth but also be a meaningful part of life, helping people discover new talents and connect with others. However, changing this will not eliminate unemployment. As more people get educated, they want jobs that are interesting and meaningful.

Even traditional professions like doctors and accountants are facing challenges. Doctors often feel more stressed than their patients, and accountants worry about their profession's ethics. Many architects do not get to use their creativity, and middle managers are losing their confidence. Companies and public institutions are becoming smaller, and methods like decentralised decision-making and performance rewards have not improved employee commitment. In Britain, only 8% of employees feel their values match those of their organizations.

Zeldin is studying different jobs to see how they shape or harm people. He is looking at important topics like happiness, love, friendship, and respect. Now, he is focusing on finding better ways to earn a living. While many experts work to improve companies, we also need to reflect on ourselves as human beings and think about the kind of people we want to work with.

How many of us feel truly alive at work? How many feel like part-time slaves, stuck in jobs that do not help us grow, but we feel we have no choice? For example, hotel workers make up 10% of the workforce. Many talented people work in hotels for low pay and long hours because the idea of what a hotel should be has not changed much since the Ritz in the 19th century. Hotels are not just places to sleep; they are like small United Nations where people from different cultures meet, often without speaking to each other.

Many hotel staff are foreigners who want to learn new languages and cultures, but they often have shallow interactions with guests. Hotels could become cultural centers, connecting guests with the city and each other. Hotel owners could use the knowledge of their staff instead of giving them only simple tasks. If they listened to their staff's true ambitions, they would see many new services hotels could offer. However, accountants often limit hotels to focusing on making money.

It is time to rethink what work means, not just from a financial perspective but from a human one. For Zeldin, work is about relationships. Many people want more than just obedience at work; they want to design their own jobs and choose their colleagues and customers, as long as it is practical and profitable. This requires the ability to communicate across different professional languages and understand each other.

Everyone knows communication is important, but true conversation is different. The new kind of conversation people want is more personal and creates a bond of respect. It allows people to understand each other better and can change their perspectives. This type of conversation is not just relaxing; it is a powerful way to create equality. Every meaningful conversation can change the world, even if just a little."
CPE_24,"**Text: Broadcasting: The Social Shaping of a Technology**

The term 'broadcasting' originally referred to spreading seeds widely by hand. This idea is not just about farming; it also represents a hopeful view of modern progress. It suggests planned growth and the potential for a good outcome if conditions are right. The metaphor assumes that there are central resources available for spreading and reproducing this growth.

We need to explore why a new technology that sends words and pictures electronically was organized in a way that fits this farming metaphor. Television, as a technology, is connected to other forms of communication like the telegraph and telephone. However, from the beginning, it was seen as a centralized 'mass' medium. This means that it was designed to send signals from a central point to many private homes, which matched the social and economic structures of modern societies.

There were attempts to create different ways of using television, but these remained just experiments. Two lesser-known alternatives are worth mentioning because they show what television could have been in a different social setting. In the early 1930s, radio enthusiasts in Britain experimented with two-way television as a possible replacement for regular telephones. Popular science magazines like Radio News published articles on how to build television transmitters and receivers, and many amateur experimenters were active across the country. However, in 1938, the British Radio Manufacturers Association set standards for television equipment and channel regulations that pushed these grassroots innovators out. This marked the end of a chance for television to develop as a more democratic form of communication in Britain.

Broadcasting was not only influenced by strong economic interests but also by the deep structures of modern societies. Despite the efforts of TV amateurs, television was mainly used for public shows in the USA during the early 1930s and was seen as a potential competitor to the film industry. In fact, throughout the 1930s, most people watched television in public places, especially in Britain and Germany.

The idea of amateur, two-way television was unlikely to succeed, while systems based on public viewing were operating in several countries during the 1930s. These systems could have challenged the idea of television as a private experience. However, manufacturers recognized the potential for mass sales of home television sets once prices dropped. As working-class people improved their living standards and joined consumer society from the 1920s onward, the dream of having a fully equipped home for entertainment became a reality for many in Western countries. This trend is now happening globally.

There is a clear link between social modernization and the structures of broadcasting. As societies modernized, there was more centralization of power and capital, and traditional communities broke apart, leading to new lifestyles. People became more mobile, both socially and geographically, which made them feel more isolated compared to those in stable early communities. Centralized broadcasting helped governments reach all citizens with important information and created a sense of community within the nation-state.

However, broadcasting can also be seen positively as a tool for democracy. During the time between the World Wars, many countries recognized broadcasting as a way to ensure equal access to information necessary for informed participation in political, social, and cultural life. 

Television is changing, and there is a risk that the term broadcasting may become outdated or insufficient. If this happens, the term will only refer to a specific way of organizing audio-visual technology during a certain phase of social modernization."
CPE_13,"**Text: Clutter**

Sometimes, it feels like no matter how many things you own, you still don’t feel secure. It is normal to want to create a home that meets your needs, but there comes a point when wanting more things becomes too much. Modern advertising is designed to make us feel insecure. One common message is that if you don’t have certain products, you are not as good as others. To see how much advertising affects you, try not to read any billboards the next time you walk down the street. These expensive messages influence us in ways we often do not notice. We are surrounded by them—on television, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, t-shirts, and the internet—all telling us to buy more.

**Caves**

Research institutions and universities around the world have spent many years studying caves, focusing on their origins, water systems, and living things. Caves are a small but interesting part of nature that spark our curiosity and desire to learn. Because they are natural features, they have been studied for a long time, especially in areas where caves affect our lives. However, visiting many caves requires physical ability, which means that cave research often involves both professional scientists and amateur explorers who visit caves for fun.

**Weather Watch**

Many observant people, using only their senses, helped create the field of meteorology, which has developed into a complex science since the 17th century. Today, satellites and electronic tools provide us with quick weather information, and computers can solve complicated math problems much faster than humans. Meteorology uses many technical terms that can be hard to understand for non-professionals. However, human experience is still very important in turning data into weather forecasts. Personal observations can offer valuable insights that help professionals understand the mysteries of the atmosphere."
CPE_16,"**MUSIC AND THEATRE**

Until recently, I believed that opera is mainly theatre. Now, I think differently. After working at a national opera house, I learned that opera is primarily about music, and that is how it should be. However, I come from the world of theatre, where the words and the actors are the most important. In theatre, once the performance starts, there is no one directing the action, and the performers and the audience usually speak the same language.

At any musical performance, whether in a concert hall or an opera house, there are many people who, like me, do not have a deep understanding of music. Some may feel embarrassed about their lack of knowledge, while most are amazed by the talent of the musicians. A great singer or a skilled string section is easy to admire. Even a good musician shows us the results of years of hard work. Watching top-class music is similar to watching an athletics event; we know athletes are doing something similar to what we do when we run for a bus, but we also see how much better they are.

Theatre audiences have different expectations. They often do not understand the skills of an actor and may not be impressed by a long and difficult speech, even though actors often get asked, ""How do you learn all those lines?"" This does not mean that theatre audiences are less demanding than concert audiences; in fact, many people enjoy both. However, in theatre, audiences and performers often meet on more equal terms, regardless of how challenging the material is.

The question is whether music can learn anything from theatre about this relationship. I believe it can. I have seen how a different approach can improve the experience for concert-goers. Live music is very theatrical, full of emotions like passion, humor, and sadness. It connects with the audience not just as individuals but as a group. The traditional ways of presenting music, such as strict dress codes and showing too much respect for conductors and soloists, create a clear divide between performers and listeners, which can feel uncomfortable.

On the other hand, when contemporary music audiences applaud between movements or after a difficult piece, it can interrupt the flow of the performance. While this is often a genuine expression of appreciation, it can also disrupt the overall experience.

Is there a solution? Yes, a lot is being done to attract new audiences to concert halls and opera houses and to break down the barriers that make people feel that ""serious"" music is not for them. I remember a special event, the community opera ""In Search of Angels,"" which took place in different locations within a cathedral and then in the town. It was an amazing musical experience where the skills of the professional musicians were central, and it changed the lives of many audience members, who were not just there to watch and listen but also to participate.

What I hope for in music is a bit more of the excitement and boldness that the best theatre can show. This can come from using unusual or challenging locations, which can surprise both performers and audiences. Sometimes, this means giving up comfort; the sound might not be perfect, or it could be a bit cold. However, theatre audiences have learned to be brave and follow artists into unexpected places. 

I know that most plays are performed in a traditional way, similar to concerts. However, I believe that we can and should change how we experience music. I am just an enthusiastic fan of both theatre and music, and I want both to succeed so that more people can enjoy the pleasure I find in being part of the audience."

**Sand**  
I admire how sand can be changed into useful things like glass and concrete, but I don’t really like it in its natural form. To me, sand is mostly a barrier that separates a parking lot from the sea. It blows into your face, gets into your food, and can hide important items like car keys and coins. When you are wet, it sticks to you and is hard to remove, even with a strong hose. However, the strange thing is that as soon as you step onto a beach towel, get into a car, or walk on a clean carpet, the sand falls off you easily. For days, you find sand on the floor every time you take off your shoes, and even more when you take off your socks. Sand seems to stay with you longer than some illnesses. So, I would prefer to avoid sand.

**Lock and Key**  
The search for a safe home, privacy, and security has been important since people first built homes. The simple lock on a door has changed to electronic locks that use plastic cards with many combinations. However, people still want to feel safe from “bad guys.” The idea of a lock and key is partly about feeling secure. Recently, some companies have tried using computerized locks that work with smart cards. But many people do not like these systems. You might accept them at work, but at home, most people prefer the comfort of using a real key. Because of this, when a locksmith company created a new electronic lock, they made sure to include a traditional metal key.

**Modern Art**  
I felt nervous about visiting the new Tate Modern gallery because, like many people, I find modern art confusing. I do enjoy some pieces, especially furry objects, neon light sculptures, and large photographs. Maybe if I knew more about modern art, I would have stronger opinions. However, the goal is not to understand art perfectly but to let it speak to you. This is a nice idea, but it has not worked for me in the past. The new gallery tries to help visitors understand the art better. The first thing I noticed was the labels that explain the context of each piece and what it means. Instead of just looking at the pictures without understanding, these explanations helped me appreciate the art more."
CPE_46,"**Every Picture Tells a Story**

**Adapting Novels for Film**

Turning a novel into a film often means cutting down the story and removing some parts. This can be frustrating for writers, but it can also be enlightening. While working on a script, I realized that I could remove a lot of dialogue and descriptions from a scene in the novel and still convey the same message. This does not mean that the original dialogue and descriptions were unnecessary. It is about how each medium engages the audience and the type of repetition it uses.

In a novel, repetition can include reminding readers of a character's traits or using phrases like ""he said"" to show who is speaking. While a character's trait only needs to be described once, reminding readers helps them understand better. In dialogue, we can often guess who is speaking from the context, but speech tags make it easier to read. In stage plays, which are mostly dialogue, this repetition mimics real speech, but sometimes it can be excessive, making it hard to understand the main message.

**Watching Movies**

When watching movies, people can feel completely absorbed in the story. It is an experience that takes them away from reality, at least for the duration of the film. However, once the movie ends and the lights come on, that feeling disappears, and they return to the real world. People often do not feel guilty about the time spent watching a film, and this escape from reality can lead to a lack of serious thought about movies, which some older generations viewed as ""just entertainment"" rather than art.

**The Film Studios**

The Leiper Film Company studios were made up of many different buildings. The layout was confusing, with only a few recognizable places like the Script Department. Most rooms looked the same and were used for both official and unofficial meetings. Finding a specific room without help was quite difficult. The studio had three main entrances, which made it even more confusing for newcomers. However, most people who worked there knew their way around. Thanks to their hard work, stories of romance and adventure reached audiences everywhere, allowing couples like Jane and George, or Sally and Dick, to escape their everyday lives for a few hours.

**Film-Makers**

Many people dream of making a movie. Bookstores are filled with guides on scriptwriting and film production, and universities offer courses on the subject. There are even competitions that give away cameras like the one used by Robert Rodriguez to make his film *El Mariachi*, which cost only $7,000 and launched his career as a director. Rodriguez reflects on his early success, noting that famous directors like Orson Welles and Steven Spielberg made their breakthrough films at a young age. 

In the past, filmmakers had to take their time to learn the craft, often working behind the scenes as editors or writers before directing their own films. For example, John Huston was 35 when he made *The Maltese Falcon*, and Fred Zinnemann, who directed *High Noon*, found success in his forties. Today, without the support of studios or television, new filmmakers often have to work independently."
CPE_3,"In the past, the council houses were spread all over the western side of the city. They were rows of small, dull homes made of orange brick or pale white stucco. In the summer, the chemicals from a nearby factory created a strong smell of sulphur that filled the air around the houses. One common sight in that part of Norwich in the morning was a paperboy making a face as he walked along someone’s front path. I have forgotten much of my early life, but I remember sitting near an upstairs window and watching the houses disappear into the distance. 

Later, I have memories of faces I cannot name, like my mother ironing towels in a house that I don’t think was ours, and snow falling on a big mansion at Earlham. My mother appears in these early memories, and I remember her as a small, precise woman who was often angry. I never understood why she was angry, so I couldn’t do anything to make her feel better. Even as a child, when I went with her to small shops or on longer trips into the city, I sensed that she was a bit strange. She was the most solitary person I have ever known, feeling alone even in a crowded room. 

My mother had a strong sense of propriety that was unusual for our neighborhood. This sometimes led to intense cleaning sessions or strict rules about how to behave. I never fully understood her moral code, which included not going into neighbors' gardens or risking their rose bushes while walking down the street. It also meant sitting quietly in the dining room for long periods, listening to radio shows that my mother liked. There were many rules I had to follow.

Over time, I noticed other people in our lives. Despite her loneliness, my mother had a few friends. There was Mrs. Buddery, who loved the Royal Family, Mrs. Winall, who rarely spoke, and Mrs. Laband, who was more lively but not always approved of by the others. Looking back, I realize that these women were not great company. They often talked about their bad legs, the cold weather, and ungrateful children, a group I often felt I belonged to. 

I felt as if a heavy weight made up of our houses, my mother, and her friends was on my shoulders, and I needed to grow up quickly to lift it. Growing up in West Earlham followed a clear pattern. Until you turned five, you stayed at home and got in your parents' way. I remember long, boring days when I played on a rug while my mother sat coldly in an armchair. After your fifth birthday, you went to Avenue Road infants school, which was half a mile away. Some lucky children had mothers with old bikes that had child seats. I think my mother let me walk with other children in the street to get there.

If I remember anything from those early years, it’s the summer holidays. During those days, I caught glimpses of the world outside West Earlham. There was an old man next door to Mrs. Buddery who told stories about his time in the Merchant Navy. Once, there was a charity event at a house far away where a kind woman offered lemonade and tried to get me interested in something called the League of Pity, a kind of junior charity. However, my mother dismissed it, saying the organizers were just trying to take your money. 

My mother often talked about how people were only interested in money, and she had a very low opinion of politicians. If she thought about the House of Commons, she probably imagined it as a place where rich people opened letters filled with money sent by gullible citizens. I might be exaggerating, and I know I overlook her good qualities and focus on her flaws. But my mother did not show much kindness; it seemed to have been taken away from her.

To be fair, my mother was aware of her role in my education. Sometimes, she would take me on the bus to the Norwich Castle Museum. We would walk through rooms filled with paintings by local artists. My mother didn’t completely dislike this activity and eventually started to have opinions about the art. I remember one time she stopped in front of a painting of a Roman soldier and said, “Well, I wouldn’t want to meet him on a dark night!” This was one of the few times I remember her trying to make a joke."
CPE_10,"**Text: Philadelphia Avenue**

I walked down the odd-numbered side of Philadelphia Avenue. The evening was getting darker, and the air was humid with a light drizzle that made my walk feel secretive. I knew this side of the street very well; I remembered our neighbors, the Matzes and the Pritchards, and Han Kieffer's grocery store. The houses of my first friends, all girls, were also here. Although I didn’t know everyone’s name, each house was clear in my memory, just like the small channels in the sidewalk that carried rainwater from the roofs to the street. As the street went downhill, I noticed that the houses seemed to get simpler: the porches were lower, and the front yards were smaller.

Over the years, things changed. Wooden porch railings were replaced with iron ones in a style that looked Southern or Spanish. In Shillington, some houses I remembered as homes became stores, and strangely, some stores, like Pep Conrad's and Han Kieffer's, became homes again. I wondered how the people used those spaces and how they lived with the smells of the products.

**Bachelor Fads Furniture Designer Rick Gilbert**

Rick Gilbert lives in a flat that used to be a curtain warehouse. It has the typical features of a loft, like exposed brick and large doors that used to let in curtains from the nearby train tracks. However, Gilbert did not want an empty, open space. He explained, ""In my last place, my living and working areas were mixed. It was hard to relax or start working when everything was in view."" To create a separate office area, he used a large piece of corrugated plastic. ""It hides the office, creates a hallway, and leads to the kitchen,"" he said. He wanted the kitchen to be a neutral space where he could cook for friends or make coffee for clients. To balance the modern look of the plastic and stainless steel kitchen, he chose light wood for the floors. His flat is filled with modern furniture, but it also has sentimental pieces from his parents or things he bought at markets.

**Bruce Chatwin**

Bruce Chatwin's life was a mix of adventure and mystery. He was a talented writer known for his unique style. His first book, *In Patagonia*, published in 1977, changed travel writing. It reads like a thrilling story, with the charm of romantic fiction and deep insights. However, even in this book, Chatwin mixed facts with fiction. He often changed details to make his stories more interesting, suggesting that through travel, we can discover hidden histories meant to inspire future explorers.

**Swimming**

During a warm summer rain, I quickly ran across my lawn and jumped into the pool. As I swam, I kept my eyes just above the water. Each raindrop created little splashes that turned into bubbles. The best moments were when the rain got heavier, drowning out the sound of birds and creating a mist over the water, as if the pool was rising to meet the sky. It was during this summer in 1996 that I began to think about swimming across Britain. I wanted to follow the rain as it traveled to the sea, escaping the frustration of swimming back and forth in the pool like a tiger in a cage.

Many of us live in a world where everything is labeled and explained. This makes our reality feel more like a visual experience. That’s why walking, cycling, and swimming are important; they help us reconnect with nature and explore the world beyond the usual paths. A swimming journey would let me discover parts of our world that still hold mystery, like dark forests or high mountains."
CPE_67,"**Crying**

Charles Darwin believed that crying did not have a clear purpose in human evolution. However, recent scientists have shown that crying has social importance. Psychiatrist John Bowlby emphasized how crying helps create a bond between a mother and her child. Many people think that tears, especially in children, mainly show feelings of helplessness. 

Understanding why adults cry is more difficult. It appears that the sound of crying is less important than the visual message it sends. Crying may have helped early human groups by building trust and social connections. 

There are many reasons why we cry. We might cry to show sympathy for people facing great injustice. Sometimes, we cry unexpectedly when we hear beautiful music or moving speeches. We may also cry while watching a touching movie, and interestingly, this happens more often when we are with others than when we are alone. The social role of crying seems clear, but research on this topic is still ongoing."
CPE_27,"**The Heat is On**

We have all heard about global warming, but how much warmer will the Earth get, and how will it affect our lives? Most people know what global warming means, but few understand its consequences. A warmer climate is likely to change the weather in all parts of the world. Since the atmosphere is connected to everything on our planet, any climate changes will significantly impact plants, animals, water, and soil. Humans have learned to use these natural resources to grow food, build cities, and support billions of people. Therefore, any changes to these resources are serious.

The challenge we face is understanding how the world will change and what is causing these changes. Over the last 100 years, human activities have greatly increased the levels of certain gases in the atmosphere, which are linked to global temperature. These increased levels are likely affecting the global climate, but our limited knowledge makes it hard to predict the current and future situations. 

We know that greenhouse gas levels have changed in line with global temperatures over the past 40,000 years, suggesting a strong connection between the two. Evidence shows that the Earth's surface has warmed by about 6°C over the last century. Most scientists believe this warming is not entirely natural and is partly due to human pollution. 

A lot of research has been done to predict what will happen with higher global temperatures. Most of this research uses computer models called general circulation models (GCMs). These models use the laws of physics and chemistry to analyze how temperature, pressure, sunlight, and other factors interact to predict climate conditions. However, these models are simplifications of reality and have many limitations. Their results are only estimates, and they can be slow and expensive to run. 

Despite these challenges, most people agree that the rate of climate change will be faster than anything we have seen before. The predictions from GCMs help us understand the world we will live in over the next few generations. Currently, they suggest that the average global surface temperature could rise by 1°C to 3.5°C by the year 2100. They also predict that sea levels will rise by 15 to 95 cm and that rainfall patterns will change. Scientists expect extreme weather events, like heatwaves, floods, and droughts, to become more common in some areas. 

These predictions highlight the potential impact of climate change on the environment and humans. Changes in climate could affect where ecosystems, like forests and grasslands, are located, the types of species they contain, and their ability to provide resources that societies depend on. This includes food production, water resources, and human settlements. Some effects may be irreversible and could be harmful in many areas, but not all impacts will be negative. 

In some places, climate change may have positive effects. For example, in Australia, research shows that wheat production has increased by about 0.5 tonnes per hectare since 1952, partly due to climate trends. Warmer temperatures have led to fewer frosts, which means less damage to crops. 

However, many predicted effects of future climate warming are concerning. Even small changes in climate can affect water availability, especially in dry regions or areas already facing shortages. The Mediterranean Basin is one example, where decreasing rainfall has been observed in recent decades. In southern Portugal, rainfall is now more concentrated in autumn and winter, with less in spring.

Another worrying effect is the change in glaciers, which will impact ice and, in turn, affect plants, animal habitats, and human structures. There is a strong chance that Arctic ice will melt completely, making transport and exploration easier but increasing risks from icebergs. 

The most dramatic effect of global warming will likely be rising sea levels. This will happen because warmer water takes up more space and because of melting ice. Since about half of the world's population lives in coastal areas, rising sea levels could have severe consequences. Increased flooding is a major concern, with cities like London, New York, and Tokyo at risk of significant disruption. Many people could lose their homes and jobs, leading to millions of environmental refugees. 

The most serious consequences may be faced by small, low-lying island nations, which could disappear if worst-case scenarios occur. This would be devastating for the people and cultures of these islands and for the countries that would need to take in those displaced."

The 2018 date is set because the next time Mars and Earth will be in the right position for a launch is in 2031. 

It is a challenging task, but there is a race to create new technologies for this mission. If these technologies are ready in time, the spacecraft might succeed. Even if the mission does not happen, the work done to reach these goals will help improve future space missions."
CPE_44,"**AESTHETICS**

The existence of art can sometimes make it harder to understand art theory. This is because art is often seen as just the physical object, like a building, book, painting, or statue, rather than what it means to people. The true value of art comes from how it interacts with human experience. When art is seen only as a perfect object, it can create ideas that prevent new ways of thinking about it. Once a piece of art is considered a classic, it can become disconnected from the human experiences that created it and the feelings it brings to life.

When art is separated from its origins and its effects on people, it becomes difficult to see its true meaning. Art is then treated as something separate from other human activities. A key task for anyone writing about art is to connect the deep experiences that art provides with everyday life, which everyone understands.

Just like mountains are part of the earth, art is part of human experience. Those who study the earth, like geographers and geologists, show how this connection works. Similarly, those who study art must also show how art relates to everyday life. To understand art better, we sometimes need to step back and look at the ordinary experiences that we usually don’t think of as artistic.

For example, we can enjoy flowers without knowing much about plants. But to understand how flowers grow, we need to learn about the soil, air, water, and sunlight that help them thrive. To truly grasp the essence of art, we should start with the simple experiences that catch our attention and bring us joy.

Many people today find joy in things they don’t consider art, like movies, jazz, comic strips, and even sensational news stories. When art is only seen in museums and galleries, people often seek enjoyment in their daily lives instead. Even those who disagree with the idea of art being only in museums may still hold onto the belief that art is separate from everyday experiences. However, the best appreciation of art happens when it is closely connected to the ordinary things people do."
CPE_22,"**Observing Lions**

In popular culture, lions hunting for food are often seen as amazing team players. As the sun sets, a group of lions quietly moves from the shadows to surround their unsuspecting prey. They appear to be perfect social animals, working together for a common goal: their next meal. However, after many years of studying these animals in the wild, we have a different view. When we began our research in 1978, we wanted to understand why lions hunt together, raise their young, and scare off rivals with their loud roars. 

If we measure an animal's success by how many offspring survive, then cooperation might not always be beneficial. If one animal is too generous, it may end up helping others at its own expense. So, why do lions seem to ignore the rules of self-interest? We thought we could answer this question in two to three years, but lions are very good at being inactive. They are like noble gases that do nothing. It has taken various research methods to find clues about their behavior. Since wild lions can live up to 18 years, we are only now starting to understand their actions.

**Pop Music Review**

The release of Bedrock's third album was a significant moment for a talented band that had struggled in the past. ""New Life"" started a movement that changed rock music in this country for the rest of the decade. The heavy, serious sound of the past was replaced by a lighter mix of catchy local styles. This new music combined social commentary and strong emotions with sounds from fairground organs and brass bands. Humor and irony were also present, and the singers were proud of their backgrounds.

The album showed that Bedrock was skilled at collecting ideas and writing songs. They often wrote about traditional English themes like sunbathing and lazy Sundays. However, the album's true strength was in its deeper, sadder songs, such as ""So Low,"" which had a beautiful melody related to weather, and ""To the Brink,"" a serious ballad. The best part of ""New Life"" is its high quality - all 16 tracks are excellent, making it a standout album in an era of long CDs.

**Extract from an Autobiography**

As a child, I was always interested in stories about 'The Sibyl,' wise women who had great influence in ancient times. At first, I only knew of one from a story my mother told me. An old woman from Cumae offered King Tarquin of Rome nine books for 300 gold pieces. When he refused, she burned three of them and offered him six for the same price. He still refused, so she burned three more. Finally, he bought the last three for the full price. I understood that there was a valuable lesson in this story about sales and life.

I was often a lonely only child. I would ask to play with other kids, but they would say no. My mother advised me to do something so interesting that they would want to join me. It worked, and it’s a lesson I’ve never forgotten. When I had the chance to write a travel book, I needed to find a topic that mattered to me. I’m not a keen traveler; I even sent my editor a long list of places I didn’t want to visit. I’m mainly interested in ruins because I prefer to travel through time in my mind.

**What Happens to Your Manuscript?**

When you send your manuscript, it will likely join a pile of other submissions waiting to be reviewed, known as the slush pile. The person sorting through these is usually a junior member of the editorial team or an experienced freelancer who works part-time. Neither has much power, but they want to find something original. The junior hopes to make a name for themselves, while the experienced person wants to keep their job.

If they think your novel is good, they will pass it to a senior editor, who will discuss it in a meeting. This editor must explain why your novel is worth accepting based on its quality and potential sales. They will also consider whether you, as an author, seem like a good long-term investment, which you should have shown in your letter. Additionally, they will think about how marketable you are, as a new novel needs all the support it can get. Because of this, publishers often prefer to meet potential authors before making an offer."
CPE_39,"**Text: Advertising on Trial**

If you work in an advertising agency, the early 1990s were likely very challenging. The recession was worse than expected, affecting many industrialized countries for thirty years. In Britain, in 1991, the economy shrank, interest rates were very high, and consumer spending dropped significantly. Over half a million people lost their jobs, and many homes were taken back by banks. Every business was impacted, especially industries like vehicles and construction, which saw a 30% decline.

While many people lost their jobs during this time, those who remained in advertising felt a lot of pressure. They were expected to help their companies make money, and they often felt closely watched by their colleagues and bosses. At the same time, they had to do their jobs with smaller budgets, being told that ""less is more."" Despite these challenges, the importance of marketing grew. Companies began to realize they needed to create products and services that customers actually wanted, rather than just what was easy for them to make.

As a result, marketing started to receive more attention from management, and some brands began to be marketed more effectively. This increased the status of marketing professionals, but it also added to their workload. Marketing was often seen as a solution to many problems, even though about half of marketing budgets were spent on advertising. 

The 1980s were a good time for advertising, but the early 1990s brought the worst downturn in a generation. This was partly due to the economic situation, but there were also deeper changes happening. The recession caused companies to rethink their advertising budgets and question the value of advertising. Many companies wanted to know what they were getting for their money and what return they were seeing on their investments. Advertising, which often raises doubts, was under scrutiny.

Client companies wanted better strategies, targeting, creativity, media placement, and thinking from their advertising agencies. They aimed to get the best people working on their accounts and to motivate them to produce excellent work. While this situation may not inspire sympathy for the advertising industry, it meant that many advertising professionals faced the same challenges as their clients: how to achieve more with less.

Several factors made effective advertising even harder. Some were due to the recession, like debates over production costs and a reluctance to take risks, which are often necessary for good advertising. Other changes were happening regardless of the economy, such as demographic shifts, the growing power of retailers, changing consumer needs, the rise of sponsorship, and stricter advertising laws. Additionally, some companies faced the new challenge of advertising in foreign markets.

These issues forced advertising professionals to reconsider the famous saying by Lord Leverhulme: ""Only half my advertising works. The trouble is I don't know which half."" Now, more than ever, there is pressure to increase the effectiveness of advertising. Unfortunately, help for those looking to improve is not easily available. Companies and advertising agencies have been too busy dealing with these challenges to share their experiences. Those who have managed to succeed often want to keep their strategies private. As a result, while conferences and seminars may offer some useful insights, the available books on advertising often do not provide practical guidance. They tend to present advertising work as always high-quality and valuable, which is not true and does not help the employees responsible for the advertising."
CPE_18,"**The Lure of the Kitchen**

When I was at university, I decided I wanted to be a chef. This was an unusual choice among my friends. Most people did not see cooking as a good job. Being a chef is often seen as a tough profession. Chefs work long hours under a lot of pressure, doing hard and sometimes boring tasks, and they do not earn much money. However, these reasons did not stop me. I was not happy at university. The work was difficult, and the social life felt closed and self-important. Becoming a chef seemed like a great way to escape the stress of university life. It offered a sense of purpose and honesty that I felt was missing in my college experience.

My desire to cook was not just a reaction to my time as a student; it also came from a love for food. I first realized this when I had a meal at a famous restaurant in London. It was an amazing experience. I still remember my starter clearly. After that meal, I felt so grateful to the chef that I wanted to kneel down and cry. I felt happy for days. This experience made me want to learn the secrets of cooking. I changed my student life into a preparation for becoming a chef. My history degree felt meaningless to me, and I focused on cooking instead. I learned by reading cookbooks, visiting markets, and cooking elaborate meals.

**Extract from a Novel**

The swimming instructor at my school was a tough ex-drill sergeant, small but strong, with tattoos on his arms. When I asked him to teach me how to dive, he told me to sit on the edge of the pool, raise my hands above my head, and roll forward, pushing off with my feet. I practiced this until my time was up. The next time, he had me stand up and dive off the edge. He was strict, and every time I came up from the water, he looked at me with disapproval: ""Don't look down, look up!"" ""Keep your legs straight."" ""Point your toes!"" The following week, I went up to the high diving board. It felt very high as I stood there, trying to gather my courage. Slowly, the noise around me faded, and I felt like I was in a bubble of silence. I waved my arms as I had been taught, tried to look up, and jumped into the air. For a moment, I felt like I was flying. When I hit the water, I fell awkwardly, and my legs were everywhere. The instructor looked at me with disappointment and shook his head. But even he could not take away my happiness. I thought, ""This is what they mean by 'free as a bird.'""

**The Traveller**

For those of us who value a comfortable bed, running water, and the chance to live a long life, the idea of a traveller can seem strange and fascinating. These are people who choose to take risks, like climbing dangerous mountains or sailing alone on small boats. They might eat insects if there is nothing else to eat and can live for months in uncertain conditions. It is easy to see them as odd or eccentric, like hermits or extreme sports enthusiasts. While they exist, their unusual lifestyle is far from our everyday lives, and we often think of it as unimportant. We can simply return to our comfortable lives, thankful that our risks are predictable, like crossing a busy street.

**SAILING**

Jonathan Raban is afraid of the sea, which is probably why he spends so much time sailing. He does not say he is a top sailor, but he is skilled. His main reason for sailing is that, as a writer, he enjoys writing about his experiences on the water. Sailing gives him exciting stories to tell. Raban's small boat has a device that tells sailors their exact location anywhere in the world. While he appreciates this tool, he also believes that the invention of the compass was a mistake. He thinks it changed how people relate to the sea. Since the compass was invented, sailors have focused more on it than on the ocean itself. The sea, which used to be full of life and mystery, has become just a space to navigate. Because of this, a sailor can often let an autopilot take over, allowing Raban to observe the waves more closely."
CPE_62,"**Holiday Reading**

Summer brings us two great joys: escaping home and reading books. These joys are closely connected. Books can help us feel more at home in the world. We can relate our own experiences to those in great books written long ago or in faraway places. There are fewer types of people than there are individuals, so in the stories of others, we find our own thoughts and feelings. Authors can express our emotions and situations in a way that we might struggle to do ourselves. What we feel shy or confused about is clearly described in their words, which is even more surprising if the author is from a different time or place. We feel thankful to these writers for helping us understand ourselves better.

Through reading and traveling, we can break free from our daily routines. Our eyes are most open during the first few days in a new place, and this is also true when we read a great book. A good book can show us things we might have ignored before. Our minds become more aware of details, like the colors of the sky, the expressions on people's faces, or feelings we didn’t know we had.

**Author's Note**

These reflections on travel were published as articles in the Observer newspaper over seven years. I have made some small changes to fit the articles better, but not much else. I corrected a few mistakes, but only minor details. If I had more time, I could have improved them further, but that would never end. For example, in my second article about China, I thought the Hong Kong dollar would stay strong, but a year later it fell. If I rewrote it to include this prediction, it would no longer be a report of that time. Like any traveler, I was there, not knowing what would happen next, just trying to understand what had already happened. This is the story of modern travel: the world opening up to people who can afford a ticket. However, I believe my fellow travelers were not completely unaware. Even a simple postcard can have a purpose.

**Ecotourism**

If there were awards for tourism phrases that have been misused, ""ecotourism"" would win first prize. This term appeared in the early 1980s, showing a growing awareness of environmental issues and a desire from travelers to have a positive impact while abroad. It quickly became a popular marketing term for holidays. Now, ""ecotourism"" can mean anything from living with remote tribes for two weeks to a one-hour boat trip through an Australian gorge. Any tour that includes cultural experiences, beautiful nature, wildlife, or a bit of adventure is likely to be labeled as ecotourism. While the original idea was to help travelers make informed choices, the lack of clear rules and definitions has left many confused in the world of ecotourism.

**Transylvanian Journey**

I lost my notebook from my journey in Transylvania for 50 years, but I found it again a few years ago by chance. It has helped me remember that time and write about it, but it wasn’t always as helpful as I hoped. In Transylvania, I had a much easier time than I expected, moving from one welcoming house to another and often staying for weeks. When I stayed in one place for a long time, I stopped writing because I thought there was nothing to record. I was slow to start writing again when I moved on, and sometimes I only made quick notes instead of detailed stories. Worried that some details might be out of order when I began writing this book, I added many warnings. But then I realized that these pages were not meant to be a guidebook, so I let the story unfold naturally without too many restrictions."
CPE_49,"**Text: Fashion**

Fashion is often thought of as a modern idea that developed because of capitalism in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. However, many fashion historians argue that fashion, in terms of style and design, has a long history. They often start their discussions with the growth of trade in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. As societies have become more complex, populations have grown, and new technologies for making different types of clothing have emerged, the meanings of what we wear have also become more complex. Therefore, it is hard to say exactly what any piece of clothing means today. For instance, a man's suit, which is often seen as a sign of uniformity, can have very different meanings depending on the context and the person.

**Writer**

Reports about publishers fighting over popular book manuscripts can give a false idea of what life is like for most novelists. In my experience, which is not exactly at the top of the best-seller lists, there are two main ways to make a living. The smartest writers work in the evenings and have other full-time jobs that will still be there even if their book is not quickly published or made into a film. Others, like me, do various writing jobs, teaching, and workshops to get by. I have heard of a writing job at a chocolate factory, but I have never found anything like that. Somehow, by balancing part-time jobs and using credit cards, and often thanks to the help of those mentioned in the Acknowledgements section of books, I manage to write my novel.

**Sudden Fame**

The small places we were performing at around the country were starting to sell out, and we needed extra security to manage the growing number of excited fans. We had to use secret entrances to avoid being overwhelmed by our followers at the village halls and ballrooms where we played. On the few nights we were not working, it was hard to leave the house without being chased by fans. In just a few days, we became celebrities. Our fans watched our every move, and our management took care of all our needs. Although my shyness never completely disappeared, it was replaced by a strange, naive confidence that only people who are usually shy and suddenly become famous can understand. In short, I felt completely out of my depth emotionally."
CPE_31,"**Music - The Challenge Ahead**

Technological advances are changing our lives at work, home, and during our free time. Susan Hallam talks about how these changes affect music in Britain. In the late 20th century, there was a quick increase in ways to listen to music, such as through radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, videos, and new multimedia technologies. However, this has led to fewer live music performances and fewer full-time jobs for professional musicians.

It is clear that access to music will keep growing because it meets many human needs. On a national level, no important state event happens without music. For individuals, music offers many activities, both formal and informal. A society without music is hard to imagine. The real question is not whether there will be music in the 21st century, but what kind of music it will be and if people will still feel the need to learn to play musical instruments.

I believe that people will continue to learn instruments. The music industry is a major source of income in Britain, and musical skills will remain important for many jobs, especially in media-related fields. Additionally, there is evidence that playing an instrument can help develop skills early in life. Research in the USA suggests that listening to or making music positively affects spatial reasoning, which is one way to measure intelligence. While these results need more confirmation, studies in Europe show that group music lessons can improve social relationships in schools and help children focus, especially those with behavioral issues.

Current research is also looking into how playing an instrument might help develop transferable skills. For example, regular practice can lead to good study habits and concentration, while performing in concerts can teach punctuality and organization. Because of these benefits, there will likely be a continued demand for instrumental teaching in the near future.

What about the long-term future? Will there be a change in focus, and if so, what will it be? I see two likely possibilities. First, the types of music people listen to will become more varied, with new genres combining different styles. Second, technology will play a bigger role in composing and performing music. This will make it easier to create music without needing advanced technical skills, but it may also reduce the need for live performances and musicians focused only on that.

At the same time, more people of all ages will want to participate in making music. These activities will likely be community-based and reflect the musical traditions of those communities. If we want this future to happen, the music profession must prepare. Instrumental teaching will need to change to help more people learn different instruments throughout their lives. This will require changes in the curriculum and how progress is measured to stay relevant for a wider audience.

Training for musicians will be essential. They must be able to motivate and teach learners of all ages, work with diverse groups, and develop skills in communication, social interaction, entrepreneurship, and management for community work. This is a big change from traditional methods and will require a response to demands for public accountability. Positively, this is an opportunity for everyone involved in music education to show the high quality of music teaching available.

Finally, we need to raise the importance of music itself. Music is vital in our lives, but it is often taken for granted. Everyone in the music profession must work together to change this."
CPE_58,"**The Actor's Craft**

Actors sometimes face criticism and disrespect. This negative view often comes from the way actors talk about their work in interviews. Instead of sharing deep thoughts, they often use tired phrases or get caught up in gossip. Paul Scofield once wrote to a friend that an actor's work is only interesting when performed. He believed that discussing it makes it feel empty and unimportant. Each time an actor performs, they start fresh, learning about their character and the writer's ideas. After a play ends, they feel empty until the next performance, and this emptiness shows when they talk about their work.

**A Review of Hamlet**

Adrian Lester's performance as Hamlet is a mix of youth and maturity, showing both simplicity and confidence. He skillfully handles the text and controls his body and emotions, making him a strong and likable character. Lester plays a young man filled with anger but also humor. His physical presence, like the way his arms hang, suggests he is waiting to be brought to life. Another actor, Handy, portrays Horatio in a way that also feels like he is moved by an inner force. This raises questions about acting: Is it just copying real behavior, or is it something deeper? What brings these characters to life? 

**One Director's Approach to Rehearsal**

This director's rehearsal begins with a process called ""dropping in."" The stage manager shows the script on a screen while the actors listen quietly. When it’s their turn to speak, they look at the screen, think about the words, and find the right moment to speak. For example, if the line is about queuing in the rain, they should breathe and let the memory come to them. They might picture a queue at a bus stop or a concert. The director encourages actors to be open-minded and trust that something will happen during the rehearsal.

**The Perfect Theatre**

The ideal theatre should make you feel that your presence matters. Attending a live performance should feel special, and the staff should share this feeling. It can be uncomfortable if the people working at the theatre seem uninterested. The theatre should create a connection between the performers and the audience. The audience should be close enough to hear and see everything clearly. The design of the auditorium is important; it should fit the human voice and body. If the space is too big, it can feel wrong because drama is about human experiences. Many theatres built in the late 1800s got this right by creating spaces that feel welcoming. 

When it comes to plays, you can't please everyone. You can't predict what the audience will want to see. When you go to the theatre, you want to experience something surprising and unique; otherwise, you might as well stay home."
CPE_37,"**Text:**

**Paul Simon**  
Rock and roll in the 1950s was mainly a music style for young people, but it also had a big effect on the middle class and older people. It opened the door for the next generation of rock stars, who listened to this new and exciting music, knowing it would be important in their lives. For Paul Simon and other young people in the US, the best way to hear this new music was through Alan Freed's radio show, Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party. Freed's show was very popular among young people who wanted to become rock stars. Like John Lennon, who was 3,000 miles away in Liverpool, listening to Radio Luxembourg, Paul Simon was captivated by the music from Freed's show. He was getting ready to move from just listening to music to creating his own.

**Snow**  
I could not see a clear path, but I thought I would be okay if I walked carefully. The wind was strong, pushing me over as I slipped on the icy ground. Suddenly, the snow that looked safe gave way, and I fell into a hole about four feet deep. The snow had formed a roof over a gap between two rocks, and when it melted, it left only a thin layer that I fell through. I pulled myself out, feeling shaken and worried about what would have happened if the hole had been much deeper. I sat against a pine tree that was sticking out of the snow to think about my situation. After an hour, I had only gone about half a mile. It was clear that I would have to change my plans.

**Qualitative Research**  
There are many books that help researchers understand qualitative research. While a lot has been written about how to collect data, these books often do not explain how to analyze that data. There is still some mystery about how researchers study their data. To help with this, we invited different social scientists who have worked on qualitative projects to talk about their methods. The goal was to share knowledge about qualitative data analysis, not to create a guidebook for new researchers. This task involves making unclear processes clearer. Although this may seem easy, we found it quite challenging. Therefore, we allowed our contributors to present their work in different styles, including personal stories and more formal writing."
CPE_2,"**Screen Learning**

Recently, I saw my six-year-old son eating noodles in a funny way. He was pulling them up with his teeth and pretending to be a dinosaur. He said, ""I'm a little dinosaur."" He was acting out a scene from a TV show, so I asked him what he remembered about dinosaurs. He didn’t remember much. 

There is a trend to use the internet and computers for learning, but is learning from a screen really effective? One writer shared his experience with an interactive program he tried with his son. The father read the words while the son played with the pictures. The father thought that if his son had spent ten minutes reading a book, he might have learned something. 

Research shows that learning happens best in an environment where there is conversation with teachers or parents. It needs guidance. Using new technology to teach our children is fine, but traditional education still plays an important role.

**Hollywood**

By 1918, most of the world’s film-making had moved to Hollywood. The local people were not happy, seeing their neighborhood in Los Angeles changed by these newcomers. However, they eventually accepted this change because success became the main focus. Success is measured by how much money a film makes. 

Hollywood can recognize a good film, one that can create stars and make money. In less than a hundred years, Hollywood has transformed from a small village to a town as famous as New York, Rome, or Paris. Physically, it has changed a lot; a hundred years ago, you would walk through orange groves to get to the village store. 

Yet, in some ways, it still feels like a village, with a narrow view of the world. For those who live and work there, the main topic of conversation is films: how much money they have made, who is dating whom, and who is working on which project. Many successful people try to leave Hollywood to live elsewhere, but it remains the center for almost everyone in the entertainment industry.

**Photography**

Photography was created by artists in the 19th century as a new way to capture their surroundings. They wanted a lasting record of what they saw, and photography provided that. The combination of light, lenses, and special surfaces created images that were more detailed and realistic than paintings, which took much longer to create. 

This new art form surprised other artists. At first, they enjoyed the new images, but then they argued that photography could not be considered art because it relied too much on machines. They believed that true art came from human creativity. 

Despite the criticism, photographers recognized that they had discovered a new way to express themselves. They used photography like other artists use brushes and pencils to show their view of the world, nature, and people.

**Book Illustration**

During the time of black-and-white book illustrations, it was common for every children's book to have illustrations. This also applied to novels for older children, which saw a decline in production over time. 

Although children's publishing was active, it often operated on a low budget, leading to many average-quality works. However, the best artists always gave their best effort. As a result, the collection of black-and-white illustrations is a mix of both valuable and less impressive works, making it a great place for research and discovery. 

The best illustrations are likely to be shown to the public again, either through reprints of classic books or exhibitions of original works. There are signs that interest in this art form is growing again, and we may soon see new editions of classic children's book illustrations."
CPE_68,"**Blogging: Sharing Our Lives Online**

Not long ago, a website warned about the dangers of public check-ins, which are online announcements about where you are. The message was clear: when you say, ""Hey, I'm here,"" you are also telling many people about your location, including those you might not want to meet. This shows that sharing everything online can have negative effects.

The internet gives us many chances to share our lives with a global audience, which can seem exciting. We might think we can gain wealth or fame, so we start sharing personal stories and photos online. However, we may soon realize that the internet can be a confusing and risky place.

But there is hope. A long time ago, a group of early internet users, known as bloggers, explored these challenges. They faced many difficulties, like losing jobs and friends, long before social media became popular. These early bloggers have valuable lessons for us.

In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, began sharing his life online. At that time, the web was mostly used by graduate students and scientists. Hall saw a chance to share his personal experiences. He created a blog filled with his stories, photos, and art. By January 1996, he was posting daily, and many people were interested in his adventures.

Hall was open about everything in his life, but one day, visitors to his blog found it replaced by a video called Dark Night. In it, he explained that he had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it, his partner told him to choose between the blog and the relationship. Hall chose to remove the blog, saying that sharing so much made people distrust him. This shows that while sharing online can be fun, it can also lead to disappointment.

In 2002, Heather Armstrong, who worked in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, a colleague shared her blog's address with the company's vice presidents, including some she had criticized. As a result, she lost her job. This situation illustrates the ""online distribution effect,"" where people feel they can say things online that they would never say in person. However, our online lives are connected to our real lives, and ignoring this can lead to serious mistakes.

Armstrong's story had a happy ending. Although she was upset and stopped blogging for a while, she later got married and started a new blog about her family. Today, she is a well-known ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her family. She learned an important lesson: while the internet allows us to say anything, it doesn't mean we should."
CPE_23,"**Text: Enough Sleep?**

Many people today feel tired all the time. In richer and busier countries, sleeplessness and anxiety have become common. Research in the USA shows that 40 million Americans suffer from chronic sleep problems. Some popular novels in Britain even have characters who cannot sleep or are set in sleep research labs. This shows a growing interest in sleep: its patterns, its importance, and the issues people face with it. A leading sleep researcher says, ""People need more sleep."" When people are busy, they often sleep less. They wake up early to avoid traffic.

Recently, a sleep researcher conducted an experiment. He let his subjects sleep for up to 14 hours a night for a month. After three weeks, they settled into an average of eight hours and fifteen minutes of sleep. This shows that they needed more sleep than they were getting.

In Europe, a university sleep research lab in the English Midlands has studied many topics, including how tiredness affects sailors, how airport noise disturbs sleep, and the dangers of driving when tired. They recruit participants through student newspapers. Subjects are picked up by taxi, paid £5 an hour, and asked to change their sleeping habits.

Dr. Louise Reyner reassures participants who worry about having electrodes on their heads, saying that the lab is more interested in physical effects. In a dark room, there is a driving simulator with a screen showing a road. Participants come in at 2 PM, a time when people usually feel sleepy, especially after a poor night’s sleep. They drive while answering questions. The road seems endless, the sun is bright, and the air is warm. The young men insist they will not fall asleep. Dr. Reyner has a video of one participant trying hard to stay awake. At first, he sits up straight, but soon he starts to blink more often and his head begins to droop. Eventually, he falls asleep for ten seconds, waking up suddenly. By the second or third time, the car has gone off the road. Dr. Reyner suggests that drinking coffee can help. Two cups can make someone a safer driver for at least half an hour. She also recommends energy products like tablets and caffeinated gum, especially for shift workers.

But what do we really know about sleep? It is clear that humans, like other mammals, sleep in cycles. When we sleep, we go through four stages, from light sleep to deep sleep. Dreams usually happen during light sleep, and the brain temporarily paralyzes the body to prevent injuries. Beyond this, many ideas about sleep are not certain. Some believe sleep helps repair the body or rest the brain, but it might also happen during relaxed wakefulness.

Scientists agree that women sleep about half an hour longer than men, and older people need less sleep, but the reasons are unclear. Some researchers say, ""Sleep is a way to travel through time without getting hurt."" 

Sleep patterns have changed over time. A history professor studied British sleep habits from 1500 to 1850 and found that people went to bed early, woke up after midnight for a while, and then went back to sleep. This time was used for thinking, remembering dreams, or even stealing. The poorest people benefited most from this quiet time, escaping their daily struggles. 

By the 17th century, with more artificial light, wealthy people began to adopt the sleep patterns we have today. The industrial revolution later forced most people to work longer hours in lighted buildings. However, in many non-western cultures, people still do not have strict bedtimes. They might sleep for a few hours, wake up, and then sleep again. In some tribal societies, noises from animals and the need to watch over fires make it hard to sleep continuously. It seems that people everywhere are in need of more sleep."
CPE_60,"Text: ""We are talking about big cowboy boots. I stood in my expensive designer cowboy boots on the rocks in the Arizona desert. Money was not a problem. I wore a complete cowboy outfit, and if you have the outfit, you might look like a cowboy. But I was not one. I squinted into the morning sun, looking at the Arizona mountains, and I had to admit that I did not feel at home. I flew in from Denver early in the morning, thinking I might look like a cowboy coming from the sky. But that feeling disappeared when I saw a real cowboy at the Phoenix airport. He was wearing a dirty shirt, needed a shave, and was carrying a worn-out bag. When he saw my new cowboy boots, he raised an eyebrow and left without saying anything.

I thought there should be clothes for an ex-racing driver that would make him feel comfortable, so he wouldn’t feel out of place. I loved being a racing driver and driving fast cars. I was addicted to it, and it was all I knew. But I don’t race anymore, and I can’t if I wanted to. I wondered what I should do now. A racing driver should have other identities ready for when he stops racing. I thought I had some, but when I tried to reach for them, they disappeared.

I considered being a commentator at races, but there were many former drivers ahead of me. I also thought about selling classic cars, but that didn’t work out because nobody was buying them. In the end, I had to step back before I lost everything. Being an 'ex' anything is hard. Who wants to hear about how I almost became the World Champion? Nobody wants to hear a story that ends with 'almost.' Even if I had been the champion, you would probably only want to hear the story for a few minutes before getting bored. Last year’s champion is last year’s news. 

I don’t want sympathy, and I don’t get any. I had a good career, made money, and saved enough. But I miss the excitement of getting into a powerful racing car. I miss the thrill of going from zero to one hundred and fifty miles an hour in just under five seconds. I even miss the danger of racing. I miss the bright, interesting people and the reporters who cared about what I said. Being somewhat famous has its perks. Businessmen and politicians liked to say they knew me. Young boys would sneak under fences to get my autograph. 

Now that I don’t race anymore, I have a lot of free time. Just last week, my phone rang twice. I have time in the morning and afternoon, and tomorrow looks free too. I looked up at the clear blue sky. There were no buzzards flying above. Maybe Arizona doesn’t have buzzards. But I saw some small brown birds in a cactus nearby, and they seemed to be telling me to leave their nest alone. I never thought the desert had songbirds. I realized that a fake cowboy in fancy boots still has a lot to learn."""
CPE_1,"**Vancouver**

In the last ten years, many people from around the world have moved to Vancouver, a city in western Canada. In the evenings, residents walk through the city streets, and if you join them, you will likely hear many different languages. People come to Vancouver for its mild weather, beautiful location between the ocean and mountains, clean and safe environment, and good education and job opportunities. Although some locals complain about how quickly new buildings are being built, it is clear that the new residents and growing tourism have helped the city improve. Vancouver was once called 'Terminal City' because it was a gateway to other places. Although this name is not used as much now, Vancouver is still a major gateway.

**Putting Pen to Paper**

Journalists like me often do not write letters well. Some say this is because we do not like to write for free, but I think it is more about how we try to make our writing very effective. In our work, we focus on getting the best results, so we lose the natural feeling of writing a letter. A true artist, who may rewrite their work many times, does not have this problem. I believe that understanding the impact of their words is what makes someone a real artist. For example, when Shakespeare wrote his famous lines, he probably did not think about how the choice of words made them powerful.

**Supermarket Opening**

In Britain, the opening of a new supermarket used to be a big event. You could expect a celebrity, like a soap star or a member of the royal family, to come and cut the ribbon. Now, new supermarkets seem to open every day, and celebrities are no longer needed. Why pay a famous person when anyone can open it for free? Last week, people waiting for the new Superbuy store did not care who opened it, as long as they were at the front of the line. According to someone who knew an employee, the first five men to enter would receive a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women would get a bunch of flowers. This news quickly spread through the crowd, making those at the front feel proud and causing envy among those who arrived later."
CPE_53,"**Text: Citizen Kane**

When the film *Citizen Kane* was released in 1941, it received a lot of attention and positive reviews, but it did not do well at the box office. It was only when it was shown on television that people started to remember it. This film has inspired many people to become filmmakers, which is impressive since it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles believed that its success came from his lack of knowledge about the rules of filmmaking; he simply went for it. He had a great team, including cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and special-effects expert Linwood Dunn. When Welles and Mankiewicz decided to create a story about a newspaper owner who was similar to but not exactly like Hearst, Welles realized he had found the perfect project for himself as both director and actor, and he took the opportunity with great enthusiasm.

**Dermot and Carmel**

That morning, Dermot thought Carmel was acting a bit strange. He had mentioned twice that he might be late and that he might stop by the golf club on his way home to talk to someone. Carmel had nodded as if she didn’t really hear him. “Will you be okay? What are you going to do today?” he asked. She smiled and said, “It’s funny you ask. I was just thinking I have nothing to do today, so I’ll take a walk downtown and look at the shops. I feel like it’s almost wrong to waste the day like this.” Dermot smiled back, “You deserve to enjoy yourself. And if I’m late, I won’t need any food, so don’t worry about it.” “That’s fine,” she replied.

**Title Race**

“Tea boy? Do you mind? I’m a mobile lukewarm beverage resource facilitator.” Human nature can be quite funny. A recent study showed that job titles often cause jealousy and problems at work. A survey by a well-known recruitment company found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees believe that job titles create divisions among coworkers. Surprisingly, 70% of office workers said they would give up a pay raise for a more “motivational” or “professional” job title. If our desire for better titles is so strong that it overcomes our basic need for money, we are in trouble. In the early twenty-first century, no one wants to be called “subordinate.” The job titles being discussed focus on skills (like specialist or coordinator) but are really just fancy words."
CPE_55,"**The Vienna Assignment**

I was in Vienna to take photographs. This was usually why I traveled. Photography was not just my job; it was a big part of my life. I loved how light fell on different surfaces and how a single picture could capture a moment in time, a place, or a person. I always hoped to take the perfect photograph, and as long as I had film in my camera, there was a chance. My rule was simple: finish one roll of film, load another, and keep looking for new images.

Once, I took a photo of a smoke plume from a burning oil well that became very popular. It was a lucky moment, but they say you create your own luck, both good and bad. After that, I decided to work freelance, which seemed smart at the time. However, life had other plans, and the mid-nineties were not as successful as I had hoped. That’s why I found myself in Vienna instead of a more exciting place. But I was still taking photographs, and I was getting paid for it, which I thought was good.

My assignment in Vienna came about by chance. I had taken photos for a book called *Four Cities in Four Seasons*, which featured London, Paris, Rome, and Vienna. I had received a good payment for my work in London, capturing the beauty of the city in different seasons. I knew that some of my best photos would not be used because the book was not meant to challenge anyone’s views; it was just a picture book.

After I submitted my winter photos of London, I learned that the Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, had left the job in Vienna for unknown reasons. Instead of hiring someone new, they offered me the job. The Austrian publishers liked my work, and I was available, while other photographers were not. I was happy to go because things were not going well for me at home. A week in snowy Vienna sounded great.

They put me up at the Europa hotel in the old city. I had visited Vienna before with my wife, but it had been a busy and hot trip, and I hadn’t taken many photos. This time, being alone in the cold January weather, I felt it would be different. As soon as I arrived and saw the beautiful light over the snowy roofs, I knew I would enjoy my time there and take great pictures.

On my first day, I didn’t take any photos. Instead, I rode the trams around the Ringstrasse, getting on and off to experience the city’s atmosphere. The weather was cold and still, just like the grand buildings from the old empire. I didn’t want to see what Schussner had done in the other seasons; I wanted to create my own version of Vienna.

A photograph captures a moment, but you have to wait for the right moment. So, I took my time to observe everything around me. The next morning, I was out at dawn. The fresh snow made Stephansplatz look beautiful and almost empty. I struggled to find a way to capture the cathedral in one shot. Its tall spire reached into the sky, while at ground level, it was massive. I realized I might have to take a partial shot instead. In that weather and at that time, it could still be magical.

Photography has always had a sense of magic. Even when you understand the process, the mystery remains. You can watch a blank piece of paper turn into a photograph in a dark room, and that feeling stays with you forever. Maybe that’s why what happened at Stephansplatz that morning didn’t surprise me in a strange way."

**Kinetic Art Exhibition**  
The Hayward Gallery in London has changed into a place of wonder with a new exhibition about kinetic art, which is art that involves movement. This exhibition looks at the history of kinetic art over the last 60 years. It shows that creating art that moves or explores the idea of movement has been an important but often overlooked part of 20th-century art. The curator, Guy Brett, has spent his life studying this topic. The exhibition includes a variety of paintings, drawings, documents, and films about kinetic art, and it does not rely heavily on text. This allows visitors to enjoy the art and make their own discoveries without too many explanations.

**David Hockney**  
David Hockney's art attracts many people, even those who usually do not care much about art. Some people like his work because it is figurative and easy to understand, while others enjoy the themes of leisure and escape from daily life. Hockney's personality and humor also make him popular, but this raises the question of whether his art has a serious purpose. Some critics think Hockney is overrated, but others argue that his popularity does not mean his work lacks depth. Hockney himself knows his limitations and believes it is not fair to judge his art based on traditional ideas of greatness. He does not claim to be a great artist and thinks that only future generations can truly judge his importance.

**Window-shopping - An Art Exhibition**  
In recent years, I have seen many contemporary art exhibitions, some great and some not so good. I often feel frustrated by shows that seem to push a specific idea or agenda among artists. Sometimes this works, and we see new trends, but often it feels forced. As a curator, I wanted to create a show that was different. I worked with seven artists to fill an empty warehouse with individual artworks that connected only by being called art. For example, Sam Cole created knitted cats that chased each other on a toy train track, while Matthew Crawley filmed himself breaking a video camera. These pieces did not fit into a specific theme, but they complemented each other in their differences. I did not make big statements about contemporary art, but I believe that art is a personal activity where artists set their own rules.

**Art History**  
People who enjoy paintings sometimes hesitate to analyze them because they fear it will ruin their enjoyment. Some art historians focus more on theory than on the experience of looking at art, which can take away from the pleasure of viewing and creating art. This is similar to how knowing the recipe and cooking method does not lessen the enjoyment of a dish. Understanding more about what we see can actually enhance our pleasure. Additionally, our preferences for certain types of art are influenced by the values of the society we live in, not just by our personal tastes. While it is important to appreciate the sensory experience of art, the idea that thinking about art takes away from enjoyment is an outdated belief that sees art as separate from thought."
CPE_25,"**Metals**  
People in the Stone Age may have become interested in metals because they wanted to decorate themselves. While sitting by a river, one of our early ancestors might have found a shiny yellow stone and picked it up. This stone felt different from regular stones and was very attractive. This could be how gold became important to early humans. Because gold is easy to shape, it quickly became a popular material. Copper may have also been discovered by chance. Once people realized how useful copper tools were, they began to search for copper ores and ways to extract copper from them. This led to the development of metalworking, which improved the lives of our ancestors.

**St Ives**  
We walked slowly down a narrow, cobbled street towards the town center, struggling with our heavy bags against the strong wind and trying to avoid the cold waves crashing over the walkway. The streets were empty, and all the windows of the houses by the water were tightly shut against the storm. We had seen the weather get worse as we arrived in St Ives on a small train. As the dark clouds gathered, visiting Cornwall in the off-season without a car did not seem like a good idea anymore. I had convinced my friend to come with me by promising beautiful walks along the Cornish coast and cozy evenings by the fire.

**Computer Modelling**  
Studying the past is difficult because it is already gone. The people who lived in times of peace and those who faced wars and droughts are long gone. The reasons why they settled in certain places or formed families and communities are now forgotten. Archaeology gives us some clues, but we cannot test our ideas with experiments on past cultures. We cannot go back in time to see what happened. However, computer modeling allows us to recreate ancient landscapes and environments and fill them with virtual communities—digital people that have some needs and abilities like real humans. We can set rules for them and create social groups. Then, we can change the weather or the population and observe how these virtual cultures and their artificial people respond."

**Vervet Monkeys**  
Cheney and Seyfarth studied a group of vervet monkeys. One day, the dominant male noticed a strange male monkey nearby. The stranger wanted to join the group, which could mean the dominant male would lose his position. To keep the stranger away, the dominant male made an alarm call that vervet monkeys use to warn of a leopard. This scared the stranger back into the trees. He repeated this every time the stranger tried to come closer. However, the dominant male made a mistake. After using the alarm call several times, he called out while walking across the open ground himself. 

**What Cats Catch**  
In a survey in the village of Felmersham, people collected what their cats caught. Over one year, seventy cats caught more than 1,000 animals. A professor in America estimated that all the cats in Britain might kill 100 million birds and small mammals each year. However, this number is not realistic because most cats live in towns and catch fewer animals than those in the survey. The important question is whether these numbers are sustainable. The answer seems to be yes. In winter, many people feed birds, and gardens provide places for birds to nest, keeping their population above natural levels. The survey showed that cats are important predators, but they are not destroying Britain's bird population.

**Buffalo's Day**  
Buffaloes are very important to the marshmen, and they are treated with care. Each morning, the buffaloes, who often sleep near their owners, slowly leave their resting place to go to the reed beds. They take their time, groaning about the hard day ahead, until the leader finally steps into the water. Once in the water, they seem to forget their purpose and relax, making low sounds of complaint. Their movements away from the house are slow and almost unnoticed, but eventually, they are swimming, looking tired. They spend the day among the reeds, grazing on green shoots.

**Picasso, Pablo**  
In 1940, Picasso painted several still lifes of fish while staying in the fishing port of Royan. One painting shows a fishmonger’s table with a crab and some soles. The fish look alive despite their situation. The painting is not easy to understand because Picasso used a flat pattern of overlapping shapes. The light brush strokes and cool colors create a calm underwater feeling. However, there is tension in the painting, as the fish seem to be ready to fight the crab. The sharp shapes and even the chain around one fish add a sense of danger, giving the painting a deeper meaning."
CPE_12,"**Photography**

Over the last 150 years, photography has been used to capture many aspects of human life. In this short time, photography has improved its ability to record moments in time and space, allowing us to see both large and small things. It has given us images from faraway places, distant parts of space, and the complex social issues of modern life. Photography has become one of the most important ways to express what it means to be human.

However, the idea of recording events visually has a much longer history. The first known images date back to about 35,000 years ago during the Upper Paleolithic period. We are not sure why early humans created cave paintings. They might have recorded real hunting events, served as magic to help with hunting, acted as religious symbols, or simply brightened their daily lives. Still, these images are deeply connected to human culture.

Throughout history, people have questioned how accurate visual images are and what role they play in society. The saying ""seeing is believing"" has given special importance to visual images. When photography was invented in the mid-1800s, it seemed to promise a truthful visual record. The camera was thought to work like the human eye, capturing fixed images that closely resembled what we see. This chemical process allowed for the capture of what we consider natural images.

At the same time, photography was seen as a sophisticated cultural achievement, producing images that artists had worked hard to create. Ironically, because photography seemed so realistic, many believed that everyone could easily understand photographs. For instance, in 1933, photographer August Sander said that even the most isolated person could understand a photograph of the sky, whether it showed the sun, moon, or stars.

However, as global communication increased in the late 20th century, we must consider how well photographs can cross cultural differences. Is photography limited by cultural norms like any other form of communication, such as language? Has our familiarity with photographs made us overlook the complex ways they convey vivid impressions of reality? 

Photography is often seen as providing convincing evidence, making it seem like a clear window into reality. For example, it is common for someone to show a photograph and say, ""This is my grandson."" Since its invention in 1839, photography and the attitudes towards it have changed significantly. This change may be partly because photography has moved into what we might call ""mythic time."" Its original role as a record-keeper has evolved, and photographs, once closely tied to the photographer and the subject, have become historical documents. These images often tell us more about the people and society that created them than about the subjects themselves.

I want to show that the camera is not just a silent recorder of events. Photography does not only reflect culture; it can also inspire social and political change. For example, it is hard to imagine the cultural changes of the Italian Renaissance in the 15th century without recognizing how the development of perspective changed visual representation. Similarly, photography has played a major role in shaping the media culture of our time, while also revealing the harsh realities of the world we live in."
CPE_26,"**How to Write Poetry**

Teaching people how to write poetry can be tricky. It requires creativity, but one mistake can lead to confusion. I believe that for beginners, the best way to learn is through reading a lot, writing often, and letting your imagination flow freely. Some people need a stable life to write poetry, while others can express their feelings through writing during tough times. Some writers follow a schedule, while others wait for inspiration. All approaches are valid as long as they are not too strict. The key is to find your own voice and nurture it, allowing it to grow until it can stand on its own.

**The Short Story**

In a short story, it is important not to include too many characters or long descriptions. Flashbacks should be brief and only used when necessary to explain something important. A memory from the main character can help move the story forward, but it should not slow down the action. Dialogue is very useful because it can show different perspectives quickly, keeping the reader interested. Writing too much can ruin a short story, but being brief does not mean you should only summarize the plot. The conflict and action in a short story should be just as strong as in a novel, but every word must count.

**Screenplays**

Writing a screenplay for a film is similar to playing chess. Many chess players make mistakes, but they still manage to play. They may not see far ahead in the game, but they learn to think about the overall strategy rather than just individual moves. As they play more, they start to notice patterns in the game, like openings and end games. The same applies to writing screenplays; the more you practice, the more you understand its complexities.

**Looking at Writing**

Humans naturally learn to speak, as seen in young children, but writing is not instinctive. Charles Darwin noted that while language is a natural human ability, written language is not. All societies have language, and while languages change, they do not necessarily improve. Children learn to speak without formal lessons, and when they lack a common language, they create their own. In contrast, writing systems have been developed only a few times in history and are complex. Most children in the past did not learn to read or write, and even today, many struggle with it. Children are naturally good at listening and speaking, but learning to write is a skill that takes time and effort. We need to understand how writing works and how to help children learn it effectively."
CPE_8,"Text: ""I have never started a novel with so much doubt. If I call it a novel, it is only because I don’t know what else to call it. I have a small story to tell, and I do not end with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave my reader uncertain. This book is about my memories of a man I met only a few times, and I do not know much about what happened to him in between our meetings. I could invent details to make the story more complete, but I do not want to do that. I just want to write down what I know. To avoid embarrassing people who are still alive, I have given the characters in this story names I made up, and I have taken care to ensure that no one can recognize them. The man I am writing about is not famous. He may never be famous. When his life ends, he might leave no more trace of his existence than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the water's surface. If my book is read, it will be for its own interest. However, the way he lives and the unique qualities of his character may influence others, so that long after he is gone, people may realize that a remarkable person lived in this time. Then it will be clear who I am writing about, and those who want to know a bit about his early life may find something useful in this book. I believe my book, despite its limits, will be a helpful source of information for my friend’s biographers. I do not claim that the conversations I recorded are exact. I never took notes of what was said, but I remember well what matters to me. Although I have put these conversations in my own words, I believe they accurately represent what was said. I mentioned earlier that I have invented nothing, but I have taken the liberty that historians take to create speeches for the characters that I did not hear. I did this to make the scenes more lively and believable, as they would be less effective if told simply. I want to be read, and I think I am justified in making my book engaging. A smart reader will easily see where I have used this technique and can choose to ignore it. Another reason I feel nervous about this work is that the people I write about come from a different culture. It is hard to truly know people, and I believe you can only really know your own countrymen. People are shaped by many things: the place they were born, the home they grew up in, the games they played, the food they ate, the schools they attended, the sports they followed, and the poets they read. All these experiences make them who they are, and you cannot understand them just by hearing about them; you must live them. You can only know them if you are one of them. Because you cannot fully understand people from a different country except by observing them, it is hard to give them credibility in a book. I have never tried to write about anyone but my own countrymen, and if I have done so in short stories, it is because you can treat characters more briefly in those. You give the reader general ideas and let them fill in the details. In this book, I do not claim that my characters see themselves as they truly are; they are seen through my own perspective, just like my main character."""
CPE_4,"**POETRY RECITALS**

At any time in history, the world of literature can seem confusing to those living in it. However, later generations can see clear patterns and important figures in literature. Right now, there is a complex mix of different styles of poetry, various groups of poets, and different ways of presenting and teaching poetry. There are also many opinions about what a poet's role in society should be.

In general, the current discussion in poetry is about the distrust between serious 'literary' poets, who write poems meant to be read on the page, and 'popular' poets, who prefer to perform their work in front of an audience. This division is not strict. Over the last twenty years, public poetry readings have become more common in many forms. Small literary groups in towns hold readings in community centers or members' homes. Schools and colleges invite poets to read and talk to students, and arts festivals often include poetry readings by well-known poets.

The effects of these events, where poets often have to perform in public, are varied and uncertain. For 'pop' poets, who write their work specifically for live audiences, performing is beneficial. Their poems are usually simple and can be understood easily in one hearing. However, when these poems are read on the page, their weaknesses in thought and creativity can become clear.

On the other hand, poets who are serious about their craft aim to create deep and meaningful work. They try to express strong emotions and ideas in a small space and use various rhythms. Unfortunately, these poets may not be appreciated by audiences who are hearing their work for the first time. The risk is that they might only read their simplest poems to connect quickly with the audience, which may not represent their best work.

Attending poetry readings cannot replace reading poetry from a book, but it can be enjoyable and educational. Hearing good poets read their work, even if they are not great speakers, helps the audience understand the important parts of the poems. It is best if the audience has the text in front of them or knows the poems beforehand.

The main reason for popular poetry readings, which sometimes include music, is to help audiences enjoy poetry and see it as an art form for everyone, not just a select few."
CPE_30,"**Oral History**  
Historians are increasingly using oral evidence, but this approach has its challenges. It is overly simple to think that a person's story is a clear reflection of their past experiences. In an interview, both the historian and the informant influence each other. The historian chooses who to interview and what topics to discuss. Even if the historian only listens, their presence can change how the informant remembers and talks about their past. The final result is shaped by the historian's social position and their understanding of history, which may affect how the informant shares their memories. Additionally, the informant's memories are not always direct connections to the past. They can be influenced by other sources, like the media, or colored by feelings of nostalgia or resentment about their childhood. The emotions and attitudes expressed can make the testimony seem convincing, but they may actually reflect later experiences rather than the time being discussed.

**Animal Science**  
There are two main ways to study animal science: the physiological approach and the whole animal approach. Physiologists focus on how the body functions, including how nerves, muscles, and senses work together to create complex behaviors. Those who study the whole animal look at the behavior of animals in their natural state and the factors that influence that behavior. Within this approach, there are psychologists and ethologists. Psychologists often work in labs studying the learning abilities of a few species, like rats and pigeons. Ethologists study natural, unlearned behaviors of animals in the wild. While these two areas have some differences, they are increasingly coming together. Physiologists often claim that their methods are more fundamental. However, understanding how nerve cells work does not eliminate the need to study behavior itself, as behavior has its own structure and units that must be examined. Trying to explain a bird's nest-building behavior by only looking at nerve cells would be like trying to read a book with a powerful microscope.

**The Social Sciences**  
Students studying social sciences for the first time face a challenge: they must learn both the content of their new subject and the methods used to study it. This means they need to understand not only the knowledge found in textbooks but also how that knowledge is gathered and organized. These two aspects are closely connected. Although we all have experience with social life, social sciences go beyond common sense. Each discipline focuses on a specific part of social life, uses particular research methods, and has its own concepts. These basic ideas form the foundation of the subject, allowing social scientists to move beyond everyday understanding and differentiate one discipline from another.

**Classical Architecture**  
In the classical world of Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building structures. The Roman architect Vitruvius defined architecture as involving order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, propriety, and distribution. He also provided Greek equivalents for some of these terms, suggesting that his ideas came from earlier Greek sources that we no longer have. While utility and function are not part of his initial definition, Vitruvius later discusses how to design structures for different purposes. At the start, the focus is on the artistic aspect of architecture. The origins of classical architecture are complex, with a long history of simple constructions, like huts, in Greece and Italy that did not meet Vitruvius' artistic standards. Although these early structures may seem basic, they contributed important elements that influenced later architectural designs. Essentially, the classical temple, despite its appearance, is a simple, single-roomed hut at its core."
CPE_7,"The two sisters kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for a while. She would drive around the gardens and the railway, going over a small bridge with all four wheels in the air, which was her only mistake. After that, they would pass the gasworks, which smelled of sulphur. Chen, however, found it funny that his wife was driving without him knowing. ""So you can really drive, Lily? Well done!"" he said. Mui thought it was strange that her brother-in-law was not upset. Instead, he was excited and made plans with Lily for a trip. They decided to go on a Monday at the start of next month, which was the quietest day for their business. They planned to leave early in the morning and return by midday to avoid losing customers. In the meantime, Lily would practice driving around the gardens. Although Mui had doubts, she bought a road map and got a ten percent discount, which impressed Chen. However, Lily felt a bit insulted that Mui did not trust her navigation skills.

Within an hour of leaving home, they were looking at the English Channel. Lily drove very well. Even Mui, who was in the back seat ready to give directions, had to admit this. On the road, Lily passed a couple of slow cars with great skill, which made Mui hold back her comments. Chen even applauded her. After passing the gasworks in the seaside town, they drove smoothly along the empty promenade. Lily parked in a small street off the seafront that had many empty spaces. She was unsure about the road signs and preferred to pay for parking rather than risk getting a ticket. Lily noticed her sister's worried face in the driving mirror and thought it was better not to add to her worries. She locked all the van doors carefully. ""Don't worry,"" Chen joked. ""No one will want that old van."" The sisters were annoyed. Lily accused Chen of being ungrateful, and Mui scolded him for being too quick to judge by appearances. Surprised, Chen took Man Kee, their son, to look at the grey sea. He held Man Kee close and thought about how he wanted to raise him. Chen wanted his son to learn about numbers, which he struggled with, and to grow up to own many restaurants, gaining experience along the way. The dark sea made Chen feel thoughtful as he planned for Man Kee's future.

There was smoke on the horizon, and then, shining in the morning sun, he saw a ship. Chen put a coin in a telescope and tried to find the ship. At first, he couldn't see it, but then he finally spotted it. It was a small, old tramp steamer. Chen lifted Man Kee to the telescope. ""Do you see the ship, Son?"" he asked gently. ""It is a special little ship for people like us. It may look small and old, but we know it will take us back home when we are done here. It will take you to your homeland, Son, which you have never seen."" Chen kissed Man Kee's head. Lily and Mui were behind them. Lily put her arm around Chen's shoulders. ""The little old ship,"" Chen said. ""Let your mother see, Son."" Man Kee did not want to let go of the telescope, and when he finally did, the telescope stopped working. By the time Chen found another coin, the ship was gone over the horizon, and Lily could only see seagulls flying around."
CPE_43,"**THE WELL**

I had read that if you dig a deep enough hole, you could see the stars on a clear day. I convinced you to help me with my plan. You watched with wide eyes as I pulled up the well bucket, steadied it on the wall, and then climbed in. I asked you to let me down. I didn’t think about how heavy the bucket was or that you might not be strong enough to hold it. You held the handle, trying to help as I pushed the bucket off the side of the well. As soon as it was free, I fell down. You screamed and tried to stop it, but then you let go. I fell into the well and hit my head. At that moment, I didn’t realize I had achieved part of my plan. I saw strange lights, like stars, but it was only later that I connected these lights to the cartoon images I had seen when a character got hurt.

At first, I was confused, then scared, and finally angry at you for letting me fall. I was also worried about what my mother would say. You called down to check if I was okay. I opened my mouth to shout, but then I heard panic in your voice, and I couldn’t speak. I lay still, peeking at you through my eyelashes. You disappeared, calling for help. I waited a moment, then climbed back up and pulled myself over the edge, landing on the courtyard stones. I heard alarmed voices coming from the castle. I ran away to hide in the shadows by the moat bridge. 

My mother and father arrived with you and old Arthur. My mother was screaming, and my father was shouting for Arthur to pull on the winch handle. You stood back, looking pale and shocked. I was hidden in the shadows, feeling a strange excitement. Then I noticed the drops of water I had left from the well to where I stood. I looked in horror at the dark spots on the dry stones. At my feet, the water had formed a small pool. I looked back into the courtyard, where my father was shining a flashlight down into the well. The drops sparkled in the sunlight, and I couldn’t believe no one had seen them. My mother was now screaming loudly, a sound I had never heard before. It shook me. What should I do? I had gotten back at you, but things had become more serious than I expected. What started as a fun prank was now a situation that could lead to serious trouble for me.

I regretted not thinking this through. In just a few minutes, my clever plan had turned into a disaster. Suddenly, I had an idea, like a lifeline to a drowning person. I gathered my courage and left my hiding place, staggering out and blinking. I called out softly, then yelled louder when no one heard me. I stumbled a bit further and then fell dramatically on the stones. Sitting up, with my mother comforting me, I sighed and said, “Oh dear,” smiling bravely. I claimed that I had found a secret tunnel from the bottom of the well to the moat and crawled through it until I got out.

I thought I was almost getting away with it until my father appeared in front of me. He asked me to repeat my story. I hesitated. His eyes narrowed, and I realized I was only making things worse. I said the secret passage had collapsed after me, so there was no point in looking for it. I insisted the well was dangerous and that I had barely escaped with my life. Looking into my father’s eyes felt like looking into a dark tunnel with no light at the end. It seemed like he was seeing me for the first time, and I felt like I was looking into a future where I would understand how the world works, and how foolish my lies were.

My words got stuck in my throat. “Don’t be ridiculous, boy,” he said, with more contempt than I thought possible. He stood up and walked away. Arthur looked down at me, looking regretful and troubled. He seemed to want to shake his head, not because I had a scary adventure and my father didn’t believe me, but because he could see through my lie. He worried about what this meant for my character and future. His pity felt like a harsh judgment, even worse than my father’s, and it affected me deeply."
CPE_51,"**REMOVAL DAY**

Now that her children are grown, Susan, who is a widow, must leave her family home. The van had the words 'Removers of Distinction' on it, and indeed, everything that made the house special was being taken away. Fred, the removal man, was carefully wrapping fragile items in newspaper and packing them into boxes, while his helpers were not as gentle. Susan was leaving a beautiful four-story house that looked over a small harbor. The memories of her children growing up there felt present in the air, like dust.

When they first bought the house, her son Robert, who was five at the time, had asked, ""Mum, how do you get a house home?"" It was easy to miss the little boy he used to be, especially now that he was an adult helping her move. He was making sure she didn’t mention the piano. Francesca, her daughter, was also helping, being bossy and determined to take care of the Steinway piano.

Fred noticed Susan was not crying. He said, ""That's something."" When Susan asked if people usually cry, Fred replied, ""You'd be surprised. They seem happy while packing, but then they cry in an empty room. They feel sad when they see everything taken apart."" Susan could understand that feeling. She would have warned the movers about the piano, but Robert insisted it was their job to notice.

The piano was the last item to be moved. Susan sat on the bottom stair, remembering the day they moved in. It felt like that day was playing in reverse. The piano had been brought in first and got stuck on the stairs. The movers struggled for nearly two hours to get it up. Little Robert watched in amazement while Francesca cried, ""We can't live in a house without a piano!"" They had to find a way to get it inside, and her late husband, Peter, had solved the problem. They left the piano outside while they moved in the other furniture. The next day, a builder took out the first-floor window, and a crane was borrowed to lift the piano through the window. The children were overjoyed to see it come in. However, it cost a lot, and they had to wait months to have it tuned.

Peter had said, ""That's there forever."" But forever is a long time. The children were too busy to visit often, and Susan found it harder to move around the house. She thought about the stairs and remembered the banister rails were not perfectly fixed. She should have warned the movers, but it was too late now. 

Fred asked her if she was okay. ""Just the piano left now, and then we’ll be done,"" he said. Susan moved away from the stairs, feeling anxious. Robert and Francesca appeared to watch. Fred casually asked, ""No tears then?"" Susan felt close to crying. It was strange how moving things made them feel important. Items that seemed unimportant before now felt full of emotion, and she thought she might cry.

Just then, the piano appeared at the top of the stairs, with Fred leading and another mover behind. It tipped slightly. ""Easy does it!"" Fred called out, and they carefully brought it down the stairs and out the front door, placing it behind the van. Robert was the first to laugh, and soon they were all laughing, relieved that it was over. They leaned against each other, gasping for breath and laughing more. Fred asked, ""What's the joke?"" but his question only made them laugh harder. As they walked down the path for the last time, the only tears Susan shed were tears of laughter."
CPE_11,"**Online Literary Criticism for Everyone: Is DIY Literary Criticism Just Fun?**

From the beginning, one of the main ideas of the Internet was to allow open access. In theory, anyone could publish their thoughts or share music online. However, in the early days, some technical skills were needed. Still, there was one area that became truly available to everyone: literary criticism. 

By visiting Amazon.com, the first popular online bookstore, anyone could try writing book reviews. Amazon allowed anyone to share their opinions about books and give them up to five stars. This seemed like a great idea because it meant that readers could see what others thought about a book, not just the publisher's description or professional critics' opinions. Other online bookstores also offered similar features, but Amazon was the largest, with over 80% of the online market. This meant it had the most customers and the most reviews, but it also faced some problems.

Many reviews were submitted every day, and Amazon did not say how many. It was impossible to check all of them. Instead, a team of editors looked for reviews that followed the company's rules. For example, one-word reviews or personal attacks on authors were not allowed. Reviews that gave away the ending or included bad language were also removed. However, since reviewers could remain anonymous, it was easy for some to misbehave. For instance, authors could write positive reviews for their own books. 

One author, Lev Grossman, was upset by the bad reviews of his first novel. To balance things out, he wrote some positive reviews under a fake name. His trick worked until he wrote an article about it, and then Amazon removed the fake reviews. Authors could also comment on their own books by clicking a link that said, ""I am the Author, and I wish to comment on my book."" Most authors used this to encourage readers to buy and enjoy their books. Some even shared their email addresses for direct communication. However, Amazon did not always check if these comments were really from the authors, except for well-known writers.

The real drama began with reader reviews. When James McElroy's book, *We've Got Spirit*, was published, it received good reviews from the press. However, many people mentioned in the book felt hurt and used Amazon to express their anger. Many negative reviews appeared but were quickly removed. Despite this, Amazon saw the large number of reviews as good for business. 

Amazon wanted reviews to be a place to discuss books, not just a chat room. They paid special attention to bestselling books to ensure all reviews followed the rules. This meant that silly reviews were more likely to appear on pages for less popular books. For example, a classic children's book called *The Story about Ping* inspired some humorous reviews because ""ping"" is also a term used in technology. One long review compared the book's story to Internet architecture, saying it provided a good overview of networking concepts. However, such silliness was rare. 

Most readers took their reviews seriously, and overall, the reviews gave a good idea of whether a book was worth buying. The writer George Orwell once said that reviewing too many books made it hard to have real feelings about them. This is why the opening up of literary criticism to everyone is seen as a positive change."
CPE_14,"**Art in Modern Times**

In recent years, especially over the last two hundred years, we often think that every artist must go against the art of their time. Art is often praised for being unique, revolutionary, or even shocking. We feel proud to admire artists whose work was not appreciated in the past. However, when it comes to contemporary art, we sometimes hesitate and say that an artist has gone too far, or that their work is no longer art. The media often expresses these feelings for us, and we tend to agree because we expect art to always be new and different. This expectation makes us overlook the old themes and methods that are still present in today’s art. We want artists to be different from us, with special talents that break the rules. In the past, people commissioned artists for specific purposes, and art was part of everyday life. Today, we leave artists to work on their own and can become frustrated if they try to connect with us.

**Picture This**

I will describe a situation and then ask an important question about it. An artist picks a piece of text from an art book that talks about the variety of pictures. The text asks, ""What are they all about?"" and then says, ""There is no end to the different kinds of pictures."" This language seems childish, but let’s continue. The artist then asks someone to prepare a canvas for him and to take it to a sign painter. He instructs the sign painter to write the chosen text on the canvas in simple black letters without any decoration. The sign painter does this. My important question is: is the final product a painting?

**Underground Encounters**

At the Mercury Gallery in London, there is an unspoken rule for painters: once you find a successful style, you should stick to it. Collectors expect artists to keep producing similar work, and if they try something new, it can upset people. I’m not sure why this is the case. Gallery owners prefer safe choices, and perhaps art buyers feel more comfortable with familiar styles. However, some artists break this rule and succeed, like Picasso and Hockney. Eric Rimmington is another artist who is trying something different. His new exhibition changes from the still lifes he is known for to paintings of the London Underground. Rimmington finds the railway fascinating. He started with drawings of Kings Cross Station in the 1980s and then decided to explore what happens underground. His exhibition, ""Underground Encounters,"" features 40 paintings and drawings that capture the unique charm of this hidden world.

**Extract from a Novel**

I have come to this island with a few books. I use the word ""escape"" because the villagers joke that only a sick person would choose such a remote place to live. I have come here to heal myself. Besides an old woman from the village who comes daily to clean, I am alone. I feel neither happy nor sad; I am like a feather floating in memories. I mentioned the uselessness of art but did not speak about its comforts. The comfort of my work lies in the fact that in the quiet moments of a painter or writer, reality can be changed and shown in a new way. Our everyday actions often hide the deeper meaning of life. For artists, art allows us to deal with the pain and struggles of daily life, not to escape from it, but to fulfill our true potential through imagination. Otherwise, why would we hurt each other?"
CPE_63,"**Family Business**

""Look, this isn't good!"" said my Dad. We were in the car on our way back to London. My father, with my brother Maurice beside him, had just picked me up from the fancy girls' school I attended. He had also just been to Parent's Day, where I received the Latin prize and the prize for the best results in my end-of-school exams. He had a long talk with my headteacher, and now we were heading home for the holidays.

""What isn't?"" I asked, although I had a feeling I knew what he was thinking because he was unusually quiet. Normally, he talked a lot. ""You can't fool me. Now that you have all those certificates, you'll do what you want,"" he said. ""I heard you might get a scholarship to Oxford."" 

""So?"" I replied, trying to act tough. ""Isn't that useful?"" 

""I also heard,"" he continued, and I knew a serious conversation was coming, ""that you want to be a barrister. A barrister!"" My father knew a lot about lawyers and the law. 

""I just said that,"" I replied. ""I couldn't think of anything else!"" 

""And apparently,"" he went on, ""you have the right personality. You can quickly understand a lot of information, you are good at speaking, and you enjoy performing."" 

""I don't know about that,"" I said. ""I only know what I see on TV."" 

""Regardless,"" he said, gathering himself, ""I feel like your heart isn't in the family business anymore. You will go to Oxford University, and after that, I can't see you wanting to join us."" 

The problem was that, like many children in family businesses, I felt trapped by my father's expectations. I saw many career options for myself and wanted to explore them. At the same time, I didn't want to upset my father. I wasn't as scared of him as Maurice was - I was the favorite - but I still found him intimidating. 

""It's too soon to know,"" I said weakly. 

""I tell you, you're not going to want to join us,"" my father said, who often seemed to be right about these things. ""It's a shame because you have the talent - the intelligence, the courage, the vision."" 

""There's still Maurice,"" I said, feeling down. My father scoffed. We both knew Maurice didn't like the business. 

""Anyway,"" I continued, ""you could always use me as a consultant."" My mother had died when I was young, and my father raised me and Maurice. Maurice was two years younger than me, and since he was motherless, I took care of him. It wasn't hard; I loved him. 

Because the business was successful, we lived comfortably - in a big house in London, attended nice schools, wore good clothes, and enjoyed parties, theaters, and operas. My father knew many interesting people - politicians, actors, and businessmen - and our home was always lively.

""I have an idea,"" my father said. ""You can help us during the holidays until you leave Oxford, and then if you want to leave, you can. It will give you some pocket money and help me."" 

""Okay,"" I said, relieved to avoid making immediate choices, especially since my father would be upset if I disagreed. This was how he controlled us. 

So, it happened. In my last term at school and during university breaks, I helped out, never more than twice a year and always with easier tasks. I became one of the top students, had a small house, a nice car, designer clothes, and a black dress from Paris that I planned to wear for my final exams. 

In my last term, my father came to visit me and took me to a village for a meal and a chat. There were only a few weeks left until my exams. My tutor said I would get a First Class degree in Law, and I knew that if I focused and organized my thoughts, he might be right. I felt ready and confident. 

But then my father told me that he needed me to do one last important task for the family business, the biggest one they had ever attempted, and he promised it would be worth my time. 

""But Dad,"" I protested, ""I have my final exams coming up, and I need to focus on that. It's really important for me to do well, and I don't want to think about anything else right now."" 

I could tell my father didn't understand the pressure I was under (or maybe he was jealous of my life away from him), and he would see my refusal as a betrayal. As he explained the task, I realized how determined he was, how clearly he approached his work, and how much energy and control he had. In his way, he was brilliant, and I admired that in him. It made my own plans seem less important. 

""All right,"" I said. ""I'll do it."""
CPE_56,"**Simplified Text:**

Simon Costello realized that buying the house in Pembroke Square was a mistake within a year of moving in with Lois. It was clear that a house they could only afford by being very careful with money was not worth having at all. However, at the time, it seemed like a good and desirable decision. Simon had been successful in his work, and cases were coming in regularly. Lois had returned to her job at the advertising agency just two months after giving birth to their twins and received a raise that brought her salary to thirty-five thousand. She strongly wanted to move, and Simon did not resist her arguments, which seemed convincing at the time: their flat was not suitable for a family, they needed more space, a garden, and a separate room for an au pair. They could have found these things in a less expensive area of London, but Lois wanted more than just extra space. She felt that living in Mornington Mansions was not good enough for a rising barrister and a successful businesswoman. Even saying the name of their old flat made her feel like it lowered her status.

Lois decided that one of them should save money by using public transport. Since her office was on the other side of London, Simon had to be the one to travel by tube. The crowded journey made him feel resentful and unhappy, and he often thought about his grandfather's house in Hampstead, where he had stayed as a boy. He remembered the smell of dinner and how his grandmother took care of his grandfather after a long day at work. She was a supportive wife, always involved in legal causes and happy with her life. But that world was gone. Lois had made it clear before they married that her career was just as important as his. This was a modern marriage, and they both needed their jobs. Their lifestyle depended on both of their salaries. 

Now, what they had worked hard for was at risk because of Venetia, who had come to their office in a bad mood. Something had upset her, and she confronted Simon with intense anger. He blamed himself for not leaving his room earlier, thinking that if he had, the argument might not have happened. He remembered every word of her accusations. She said, ""I defended Brian Cartwright today. He told me that when you were his lawyer four years ago, you knew he bribed three jurors. You did nothing. Is that true?"" Simon replied, ""He's lying. It isn't true."" She continued, ""He also said he gave shares in his company to your fiancée before the trial. Is that true?"" Again, Simon denied it, but his response felt unconvincing even to him. He felt guilty and ashamed, remembering the fear of punishment from his school days. When he looked into her eyes, he saw her disbelief.

He wished he had said, ""Cartwright told me after the trial, but I didn't believe him. I still don't believe him. He will say anything to make himself look important."" Instead, he had told a more dangerous lie, and she knew it was a lie. But why was she so angry? What did his past actions have to do with her? Why was Venetia acting as if she was the judge of his professional life? Was her own behavior always perfect? Did she have the right to ruin his career? He was not sure what she could do, but if this rumor spread, it could destroy him."
CPE_36,"I chose this place to live because I thought I would be anonymous among people who didn’t care about the worn-out rented houses and messy gardens. However, I was wrong. The shopkeepers, who are living their real lives, soon start to recognize me. The beautiful roses from my neighbor’s garden remind me that gardens can be loved. Usually, I stay inside to forget about the summer outside, but tonight I am watching the swifts flying between the trees and roofs. I have trimmed some herbs to make space for a chair, and my arms are stinging from scratches. It is a small London garden where plants must grow tall or spread out to survive.

“Been doing some clearing, I see,” says my upstairs neighbor, Jaz, leaning out of her window. She is a writer with several unpublished works, and I sometimes help her with them as an English teacher. I have her latest manuscript with me. “How’s the work going, Jaz?” I ask. “Honestly, in no other job do people ask you about your work so many times a day,” she replies. Then she says, “I have something to drink in the fridge. I’ll bring it down.” I don’t want Jaz in the garden, and I realize it looks messy. She knocks on my door. “So, you’re on holiday now, lucky you,” she says, sitting in the chair while I drop a cushion onto what used to be a small lawn. “Cheers,” she says, acting young. “I should’ve gone into teaching – writers don’t have holidays. But you know what they say, those who can, do; those who can’t, teach.” And then there are those who can do neither.

“So, what are your plans for the holidays?” she asks. I feel overwhelmed by the empty days ahead. “Actually, I’m going to Stonebridge tomorrow. Can you feed my cats?” I ask. My heart races as I speak. “Of course,” Jaz replies, knowing she will be around. “Where will you stay? A nice bed and breakfast?” “No, I’ll stay with my oldest friend, Ruby, at the Rising Sun. We’ve known each other since we were eight.” This isn’t true, but I often deal with fiction. “Going back to your roots. What do you think of my manuscript?” Jaz asks about her story, The Cruelty of Red Vans, which I haven’t read much of. I like the title and tell her so. I can see how red vans could be cruel, always bringing gifts to other houses and returning her manuscripts in silly bags.

I decide to be honest for once. “Let me give you a little tip,” I say. “What?” she asks, surprised. “Try writing about nice people for a change, people who want to be good: a little less self-centeredness, a bit more fiction…” “Teachers!” Jaz replies, acting like a rebellious student. “I keep a journal where I write something good about each day,” I say. My words sound a bit old-fashioned. “Keep a journal! Nice people! Get a life, Ann.” Oh, I have a life. I have my work, and I go out sometimes, reading on the tube. When we finally go inside, my calm kitchen gives me a moment of comfort, but suddenly I remember my old geography teacher, Miss Tarrantine, who was about my age now, winking at us and saying, “I’ve had my moments.” We nearly died laughing."
CPE_6,"**Heritage**

Heritage is important because it connects people and communities to their past. We often feel connected to our personal heritage, knowing about our grandparents and hearing stories about their lives. However, there is also a need to learn about our wider past to help us understand our future, both as individuals and as a nation. Heritage gives us a sense of continuity; knowing about the past helps us feel secure about the future. Just as we inherit our genes, we also inherit a culture that has been passed down through generations. There may be parts of our national heritage that we do not like, but it is still a part of who we are, and it can be comforting to feel connected to something larger. Heritage teaches us a lot and is essential for our well-being. It influences our customs and material culture. In the past, we learned about our heritage through stories and legends from our ancestors. However, in modern society, many of these oral traditions have been lost. Now, we often look to places and buildings to understand our past. It is very important to preserve these connections as a way to honor our ancestors' identities.

**The Fens**

Some time ago, I started writing a novel called *Waterland*, where the landscape of a region in England called the Fens became very important. After the book was published, people asked me why I, a Londoner with no personal connection to the Fens, chose to write about this area. The simple answer is that I found the Fens interesting because they seemed quiet and empty, providing a blank space for my story. However, I learned that the Fens are not truly flat or empty. They are uniquely English but also strangely different. It is surprising that in the middle of England, there is a place that many English people find unfamiliar, especially since many other unique areas of Britain have become part of the national culture. The Fens are both empty and full, cultivated and wild, seemingly simple yet deeply mysterious. While writing my novel, I did not explore the Fens extensively; I have not yet visited places like Wisbech or Prickwillow. As a fiction writer, I prefer to create imagined worlds rather than seek strict facts. However, trying to imagine the Fens has its own logic, as they are not just a landscape but also a way of thinking.

**Museums**

Museums need to make their collections easy to access. In the past, this meant simply putting items in display cases with long descriptions that were hard for most people to understand. Today, accessibility should mean more than that. Displays can be engaging and use creative techniques to attract visitors and evoke emotions. However, museums should be about more than just displays; they should reach out to the widest community possible. For example, some museums provide loan boxes of objects for teachers, and recently, they have started offering similar materials for elderly people with memory loss. Museums focus on real objects and specimens, not replicas. They exist to provide a genuine experience with history. They show items that were used and had meaning at some point in time. This is their strength and what sets them apart from heritage centers, theme parks, books, and CDs. Museums that meet this challenge and create exciting and accessible displays will find that their competitors in ""virtual history"" can actually help them by increasing interest in real historical experiences.

**Architecture and Environment**

The desire to preserve things is not new, but changes in our towns happen quickly and on a large scale, affecting many of us. This can make some people very focused on preservation and encourage others to think more about the nature of our towns today and their future. It can be argued that people who have lived through significant events, like world wars, are more likely to want to preserve things because stability becomes important to them. If there is a psychological need for preservation, planners should consider it. Change is not necessarily bad if we learn how to manage it. Changes in our towns reflect social changes, such as population growth, welfare, and our needs."
CPE_33,"**Text: Einstein**

If you stop someone in the street and ask them to name a scientist, they will likely say Albert Einstein. His image is often used to sell products that seem smart, like computers and encyclopedias. Most people know little about what Einstein actually did, except that he created some complex theories called 'relativity', which are famous for being hard to understand and for making strange predictions that don’t match everyday experiences. 

Einstein was part of a major change in scientific thinking, which started the development of modern science in the twentieth century. Physicists and mathematicians were trying to find a new, clearer way to describe the universe by studying how matter and natural forces interact. Einstein made important contributions by rethinking the basics: time, space, matter, and energy. Before him, scientists followed Isaac Newton's idea that stars and planets moved in a fixed space and time. Einstein changed this idea, saying that time and space are not fixed but relative.

**Young Readers**

When we were children, Lydia and I did not trust any book that won awards because we thought they would be boring. Our mother often criticized us for this attitude, while our father would give us small coins as rewards to encourage us to read better books. He would also include some good books in our Christmas and birthday gifts, marked with a note saying, 'This Book is NOT Literature'. Although we thought most of his choices were 'boys' books', he did introduce us to some shorter works of good fiction and, once, to a famous collection of poetry.

**Language**

Jacob Grimm wrote in 1851, 'The origin of human language is truly secret and marvellous.' This secret has led to many strange ideas. For example, Charles Caller suggested in 1928 that early humans made sounds like ""meuh"" when they felt danger. This sound is sad. The early human who traveled through dangerous lands made desperate noises, and some words have kept a trace of this, like 'malaria' meaning ""fever"" and the Latin word 'mors' meaning ""death"". 

Many people avoided discussing the origin of language, thinking it was a topic for odd theories. However, recently, the study of how language began and evolved has become very important. Language likely started in East Africa about 100,000 years ago. At first, speech was mainly used for friendly communication and was important in struggles for power. Sharing information was probably not the main purpose of language, which goes against the ideas of philosopher John Locke, who described language as a 'great conduit' for sharing knowledge."
CPE_20,"**Text: Writing Reviews**

Frank Kermode looks at how to write reviews from the perspective of someone who does it. Most reviews are written quickly and do not last long. There are strict deadlines and limits on how long they can be. Once published, they are only read for a short time—usually a day, a week, or at most a month. Because of this, many people think that writing reviews is not very important. They believe that writers only do it for money or because they need a break from writing longer, more serious works.

However, writing reviews is a skilled job. It is different to write a short review of six or eight hundred words for a newspaper than to write a longer review of six or eight thousand words for an international journal. A review in a weekly magazine, which is about fifteen hundred words, has challenges from both short and long formats. 

Reviewers must think about their audience. Some readers may just skim the review, while others may want a detailed analysis. A good reviewer needs to know a lot about different topics and must write in a way that is clear and enjoyable for intelligent readers. This means that most reviewers also write other types of work.

The American novelist John Updike, who does not think highly of criticism, still enjoys writing reviews between his novel projects. He collects all his reviews, no matter how short, into books with modest titles. Some might think that less famous writers should accept that their reviews will not last, but it is understandable if they want their work to be remembered, especially if they feel their best writing is in those reviews.

I feel this way about my own writing. My main work has been in academia, and my serious books are academic in nature, which is what professors are expected to write. However, in the English-speaking world, there is no strict separation between reviewing and literary study, so it is common for the same people to do both. 

In the past, some academics criticized professors who wrote reviews for showing off or wasting time. But now, it is less common for non-professors to complain that professors are taking opportunities away from them. This is partly because there are many more reviews being written today, so almost anyone can write one, and also because the pay for writing reviews is often very low.

I believe that this situation is good for both readers and professors. Readers can trust that reviewers know what they are talking about, and professors benefit because writing reviews helps them stay connected to the public. It also reminds them that they need to communicate clearly with non-professors. While they may use complex language when talking to each other, they should make sure to be understandable when writing for a wider audience.

In conclusion, despite its importance, reviewing is usually a secondary job. You can only do it well if you are also successful in another area of writing."
CPE_40,"Ralph unlocked the door to his apartment and, as he stepped into the dark hallway, he felt a brief sense of ownership. Even after three years, this feeling sometimes surprised him when he returned home alone at the end of the day. When he first bought the flat, he would come home excited and curious, wondering what had happened in his absence. The flat felt like a welcoming place, a space where he could focus without distractions. 

He thought he should worry about things like intruders or broken pipes, but his flat always seemed to be waiting for him, either looking tidy or a bit messy, depending on how he had left it. Over time, he began to see it as an extension of himself, a place where his thoughts and feelings spilled out. He grew frustrated with its inability to change. There were always a few letters piled up by the door and the answering machine blinking with messages when he got back. He was thankful that his windows were intact and that nothing had been stolen, but he often wondered what the flat would look like if something bad happened.

From his dull office on the third floor, Ralph looked forward to his quiet evenings at home. After leaving the busy office, he felt a bit more like himself on the bus ride home. However, he often found that he didn’t want to be alone, even though he thought he did. While sitting at his desk, he longed for solitude and time to himself, but once he escaped, he felt empty. This emptiness made him think that the work he did, which he didn’t enjoy, was changing him and pulling him away from who he really was.

He would often read or listen to music at night, but he started to question why he did these things. His thoughts became unclear, and he struggled to connect his feelings and ideas. He remembered a time when he felt more in control of his life. He had wanted to improve himself but found that he only wanted to get by. He applied for jobs that his friends talked about, following them as they moved forward, unable to see that he could find a job that would also make him happy.

He went to one job interview with gratitude and didn’t think to question the job itself, which was a vague editorial position at a local free newspaper. After a pleasant conversation with Neil, his potential boss, he didn’t consider what working there would mean for his future. Neil offered him the job right away, saying he was the only graduate who had applied, which Ralph took as a compliment at the time."
CPE_45,"**Goat Racing**

I was about to see goat racing on Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. I was pushing my way through ice-cream vans, large crowds, food stalls, and loud music. Even though everyone was moving towards the racecourse, I tried to find a good spot to watch. An area was blocked off to create a course for the goats. It wasn’t as fancy as regular racecourses, but it was similar because people were standing on both sides of a stretch of ground where the goats would run. It was a challenge to keep a few selected goats in order, especially since goats are known for eating almost anything they find.

**Canoe Trip**

As the day ended, I started to worry about the night ahead. The canoe was too wet to sleep in, there was nowhere to stop, and we hadn’t seen any villages or huts since early morning. In the dim moonlight, we used our flashlight to see the cliffs, but the flashlight batteries were dying. We changed the batteries, but they didn’t work. We realized we wouldn’t be able to find a place to camp. A few miles later, Lesley shouted that she saw a distant flickering light, and we felt hopeful. But the light turned out to be moonlight reflecting on the waves. Soon, we could hear the loud sound of rushing water, but we couldn’t see what was happening. Time seemed to stop as we continued on.

**How to Be Presentation Perfect**

I am not good at making presentations, but as the managing director, I often have to present to my colleagues and major shareholders. How can I improve my presentation skills and my confidence? You are not alone. Making a presentation requires different skills than running a company, but many senior executives need to be good at it. If you want to convince your audience, you must believe in what you are saying. Show your belief with passion and enthusiasm during your presentation. This means you need to prepare well. Test your ideas beforehand and ask colleagues to help you think of difficult questions your audience might ask. You should also create a positive atmosphere from the beginning. Start with something everyone can relate to and gradually lead to the conclusion you want to reach."
CPE_64,"**Simplified Text:**

Some activities cannot be rushed; they take the time they need. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you are impatient with making mayonnaise and add the oil too quickly, it will not turn out right. If you pull hard on a tangled fishing line, the knot will just get tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some tasks are done very quickly, while others take seconds, minutes, hours, days, or even years. Some things can be done faster, like solving crossword puzzles or doing math in your head. But other things cannot be rushed. If you try to hurry them, they may fail, just like the mayonnaise or the fishing line.

The idea of ""Think fast; we need results"" can sometimes be unhelpful, just like trying to get a good night's sleep in a short time. We learn and think in different ways, and these ways work at different speeds. There are three main speeds of thinking. 

The first speed is faster than thought. Some situations need an immediate reaction. For example, when my motorbike skidded on a wet road, my body reacted quickly to keep me safe, and only later did I think about what happened. This quick reaction can be called our ""wits."" 

The second speed is thought itself. This involves reasoning, weighing options, and solving problems. For example, a mechanic figuring out why a car won’t start, a scientist studying an experiment, or a student working on an assignment are all using this type of intelligence, which we often call ""intellect."" People who are good at solving these problems are seen as ""bright"" or ""clever.""

The third speed is slower and less focused. It is more relaxed and dreamy. In this mode, we think about things without a clear purpose. For example, when we are sitting by the sea, listening to the waves, or just waking up, we are in a different mental state than when we are planning a meal or writing a letter. This slower way of thinking is just as important as the faster ones. 

Taking time to think slowly is necessary, especially when life gets busy. We need this ""tortoise mind"" just as much as the ""hare brain."" Some everyday problems are better solved with a slow mind. Some complex issues can only be understood with a relaxed attitude. Recent studies show that slower thinking is good for understanding complicated situations. 

Deliberate thinking works well for clear problems. For example, deciding where to go on holiday is usually straightforward. But when we are unsure about what to consider or when the issue is complicated, we need to use our slow thinking. If we are trying to manage a difficult group of people at work or deciding whether to change careers, it may be better to sit and think rather than rush for answers. This type of intelligence is linked to creativity and wisdom. 

Poets and philosophers have long understood the limits of fast thinking and have encouraged slower ways of knowing. Recently, scientists have started to study these slower ways of thinking. The field of cognitive science is showing that our unconscious mind can do many interesting and important tasks if given enough time. It can recognize patterns that our conscious mind might miss, understand complex situations, and solve difficult problems better than quick thinking can."
CPE_29,"**Text: Surviving in a Foreign Land**

I have been welcomed warmly. It is a friendly and well-equipped place in a very isolated area. At any time, there are about forty people here - scientists, students, weather experts, and satellite trackers - in a close community where everyone helps each other. My basic French is enough to communicate, but not to have casual conversations. I miss the small details in conversations, and my phrasebook is not helpful at breakfast. This is not a practical problem for me, but at first, I felt unsure of myself. I was a bit nervous about mealtimes. I would hesitate, worried about which table to choose, and I felt anxious when I spoke, like I did in the early weeks of school. I still smile awkwardly or feel panicked when people talk to me. I think this occasional sadness is not about missing company or communication, but because I have lost the social confidence I used to have.

**Elliot**

When I first met Elliot, I was just a young author, and he did not pay much attention to me. He remembered faces, though, and when I saw him, he would shake my hand politely but did not seem interested in getting to know me better. If I saw him at the opera with someone important, he would often not notice me. However, when I became successful as a playwright, I noticed that Elliot started to look at me differently. One day, he sent me a note asking me to lunch, and I thought he was trying to get to know me. After that, as my success brought me many new friends, I began to see him more often.

**Alfred Hitchcock**

The film director Alfred Hitchcock always said that he did not care about the story of his films or the acting, but he did care about the visuals and the sound. For Hitchcock, it was not a message or a great performance that moved the audience; he believed that people react to the film itself, no matter their background. So, if a film is made well in terms of its emotional effect, the audience in Japan should react the same way as the audience in India. Hitchcock was very clear and logical about his work. He was a man of reason and a talented craftsman who liked to hear the audience scream. He did not focus on speculation or deep ideas, and he did not explore his characters in a complicated way. He concentrated on film itself and the precise beauty of what a film can do to an audience."
CPE_57,"**Amateur Astronomy**

Many things have changed in astronomy over the last fifty years. Until about thirty years ago, there were not many charts and catalogues available. Telescopes were limited, and there were few books on practical astronomy. Today, there are many types of telescopes and equipment that cover almost everything needed. Electronic calculators and computers have changed how we create almanacs and charts, making it easier to analyze observations and publish results. This could be seen as the golden age of amateur astronomy. However, some things have been lost as well. Now, you may have to travel 80 km to find a dark sky, which was easier to find in cities 50 years ago. Daytime skies are often filled with trails from airplanes, which can last for hours and create clouds, making it hard to observe the sun and stars at night.

**Too Much Choice**

Today, people have too many choices. There are too many things to do and too many options available. In our modern economy, the desire for new products and services has become an addiction, and technology speeds up this change. New products come out quickly, and just as one is released, another is on the way. This can be overwhelming and tiring, leading to a feeling of disconnection from life. While choice is important in our economy, having too many choices can cause stress, take up time, and make life more complicated. Because of this, many people are looking for ""simplexity"" – the simple things that bring meaning to life in a complex world. However, simplifying life is not easy when there are so many products available. There are more basic brands of detergent and breakfast cereals than we could ever need, along with countless software updates and plans to choose from.

**McAndrews Hotel**

Every summer, we spend two weeks at McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. This is a family tradition started by my grandmother, and it has become very important to us. Nothing can interfere with this ritual. We are a special group of guests at McAndrews: perhaps old-fashioned or even snobbish. I dislike the bad manners of shop assistants, which some people see as equality today. I also do not appreciate overly friendly waiters who seem to struggle to keep their distance. I know the names of most of the other guests, as they have been coming here since childhood like me. However, I can be sure that when I see them in the hotel, we will only exchange polite greetings, respecting each other's privacy. This kind of respect is hard to find in hotels today."
CPE_9,"**Text: Othello and Lake Vostok**

**Othello**  
A great production of Shakespeare's play Othello has moved from Stratford to London. I want to correct an unfair review I wrote when the show first opened last spring. At that time, I said that Ray Fearon was too young for the title role, and I criticized his acting. I still believe that changing the age difference between Othello and Desdemona is not true to the tragedy, but I take back my comments about Mr. Fearon's excellent performance. The entire cast is wonderful. Some memorable scenes include the one where Cassio's games with other young officers become dangerous, and the moment when Iago starts to lose control. I challenge anyone not to be moved to tears during the scene where Emilia helps Desdemona get ready for bed. The pace and tension throughout the play are fantastic. Do not miss this production.

**Lake Vostok**  
In the middle of Antarctica, there is nothing alive. On the edges of the continent, there are many penguins, seals, and birds. But in the vast white area in the center, life does not exist—except for a large hidden body of freshwater called Lake Vostok, which is under nearly 4 kilometers of ice, right below the coldest place on Earth. The water has been cut off from air and sunlight for up to 25 million years. Biologists are eager to explore its mysterious depths and find out what strange organisms might be there. Geologists and glaciologists are also interested. For two years, researchers around the world have been planning ways to uncover the secrets of the lake, and if they succeed, we will see many discoveries about Lake Vostok in the next few years.

**Scientists**  
Last week, I heard something interesting on the radio. A group of scientists is discussing what motivates them to be scientists. The phrase ""because it's there"" comes to mind. We all know that the quest for knowledge drives us, the desire to understand everything from atoms to black holes. But these scientists want to know why we have this desire for knowledge and why science cannot explain this motivation. I believe it is more important to focus on whether what scientists do is right, rather than getting stuck in debates about the purpose of science. The key issue is not why we pursue science, but to understand that science is a tool, and we should decide how, where, when, and why to use it."

**Food**  
Our relationship with food is very important and satisfying. Many people who enjoy cooking buy cookbooks like this one. However, we often think that cooking is only worth it for special occasions or complicated dishes. This is not true. For example, if you chop some carrots, a leek, celery, and herbs and put them in water, you can make a delicious soup. This is much more satisfying than buying a pre-made soup. Instead of buying a sweet chocolate mousse full of preservatives, you can quickly make a tasty dessert that both adults and children will enjoy. Cooking is also a way to show care and love by sharing your food with others. Sharing meals is a big part of our celebrations, like birthdays and anniversaries. No one would want to have takeout for a wedding or anniversary party, and most people wouldn’t discuss business over canned soup.

**In the Elevator**  
This morning, Alistair tried to clean up his office, but there were still papers everywhere. Tax forms were overflowing from drawers and boxes, waiting for a day when he would organize them. He also had a lot of paperwork from owning an apartment building. Many books and journals were close to new bookshelves. As the elevator took him to his floor, he knew Mallory would arrive on time for their meeting. She would knock on his office door exactly at the hour. She was very strict about time and neatness. He wondered how she would react to the mess. She might think someone had broken in. He could walk in after her and pretend to be shocked. Mrs. Wilson, his cleaning lady, had come while he was trying to clear some space on the floor. When he peeked out of his office as she was unlocking his apartment, he smiled at her, hoping she would help. But she looked at him with a hard expression and thought, “No way I’m going in there,” before she went into her own area, which she was responsible for. He knew Mrs. Wilson thought he was from a different place, far away from her familiar world in Brooklyn.

**KAREN**  
Karen had a simple wish: she did not want to be like her mother. This desire led her to create her own story, one of strength and difference. In her story, there were important moments, like when she was twelve years old and her brother accidentally hit her in the eye with a golf club. At first, she thought she would go blind. But the bone protected her, as the doctor later confirmed. The golf club had missed her eye, and she only needed a few stitches that healed over time. When she opened her eyes in the doctor’s office and saw her mother there, complaining about both miracles and small mercies, she felt she was saved for a reason.

**Miss Fogerty**  
Miss Fogerty was walking quickly back to her duties across the wet grass of the village green. She felt both excited and sad about what she had just seen. It is always thrilling to be the first to know something important, especially in a small community, and Miss Fogerty’s life was usually quiet. However, she was very sad about Dr. Bailey’s health. He had been her doctor for many years, and she appreciated his care during her yearly throat problems, which were her only health issues. Miss Fogerty thought his best quality was that he always made patients feel like there was enough time to talk and that he really wanted to listen to their worries. This quality made the doctor very loved in the village. He was always willing to share his time, knowledge, and humor, and in return, he received great loyalty and affection from the people."
CPE_59,"**Joanna's Lessons**

Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist. So, why has she decided to write books for young children learning the piano? Even someone who cannot hear music well would be impressed by her performances. Watching her play the piano, moving quickly and playing many notes, shows how talented she is. However, at a recent concert for kids, one small boy surprised her. After watching her play different styles of music, he asked, ""Can you play Match of the Day?"" This request made Joanna laugh. She realized that, to him, she was not a real pianist until she played that song. Of course, she played it and noted the experience for her next children's concert.

Joanna is unique among top concert pianists because she cares about how young children learn to play. She has just published her own beginner piano book for children called *Joanna MacGregor's Piano World*. She managed to write this book despite her busy schedule. This summer, she is performing at many festivals and working with young composers and artists. She also runs her own recording label, Sound Circus, and loves to collaborate with other artists.

So, why did she take on the extra work of writing a book? ""People who know me are surprised,"" she says. ""But I believe the first lessons are very important. Many music teachers focus only on talented children, but most people enjoy music in a more everyday way. I find that much more interesting!""

Joanna's experience helps her write these books. From ages 18 to 25, before she became a concert pianist, she taught many beginners. She also grew up in a home where her mother taught piano, and many children came to learn. ""I played around on the piano while other kids of all backgrounds wanted to play different types of music. I didn't focus on only the talented ones. I believe everyone should have the chance to learn music.""

Just like everyone should learn to swim or speak a little French, Joanna thinks everyone should try to learn the piano. Some children learn quickly, while others take their time and sometimes give up. This can happen at any stage. Some kids find the beginning too hard, while others feel pressure to be like the talented children they see on TV. 

""I worry that some people use music, like sports, to push their children to achieve things instead of just enjoying it. Children often quit because they feel they cannot meet their parents' expectations.""

When asked if she thinks other piano books are not good enough, Joanna is careful with her words. ""I don't want to criticize other teachers or their books,"" she says. She believes her colorful and engaging books are not the only ones that make learning fun. To help young beginners, she includes stories in her books and CDs. The challenge is to make learning interesting. From the first lesson, there are fun accompaniments for teachers or parents to play along with the child. For kids whose parents cannot play, the accompaniments are on the CDs.

Joanna insists that learning should be fun. ""You need to let them improvise and encourage them to play all over the keyboard."" As children progress, they need to learn to read music instead of just playing by ear. Joanna understands this challenge because she relied on her ear when she was young. However, she believes that practice is the most important part of learning.

How can children be encouraged to play a piece more than once? Joanna admits she did not practice much until she attended the Royal Academy of Music, where she had to practice a lot to learn difficult pieces. Now, she loves practicing. She spends about eight hours a day practicing, which she says is more important than performing. ""I understand how hard it can be for some people. We need to talk about it more.""

Joanna shares some tips for practice: ""Whether you practice for twenty minutes or five hours, decide what you want to achieve first. Also, reward yourself by playing the whole piece, even if you make mistakes. And mix difficult pieces with easier ones."""
CPE_54,"**Text: Writing by Hand and on Screen**

Dr. Johnson believed that ""what is written without effort is usually read without pleasure."" This means that good writing takes hard work. When I look back at my handwritten school essays, I notice that they had very few mistakes. Today, I would rewrite them many times. I think this is because writing by hand was physically challenging. The slow pace of writing helped me think carefully. When using a computer, it is easy to make mistakes. Many writers spend as much time correcting their computer drafts as they did writing by hand. 

Emails, unlike handwritten letters, can feel less personal. However, many people now write love letters through email, which is a positive change. At least these emails are written in English and follow some grammar rules. But words on a screen can feel dull. Writers often do not realize the power of writing and may exaggerate their messages. Words typed quickly can lack the care and personality of handwriting.

**The CD Experience**

I put down my cup and looked at the CD. The case was not impressive, but the shiny disc inside looked interesting. ""Wonderful little things, aren't they?"" Mr. Warriston said as he entered the room. I agreed and handed the disc to him carefully. ""It's amazing how they can fit seventy minutes of music on them,"" he said, turning on the music player. Lights lit up, and he opened a small drawer to place the disc inside. He pressed a button, and the drawer closed. ""Some people say they sound cold, but I think they..."" 

""Do you have to turn them over like records?"" I asked. 

""What? No,"" Mr. Warriston replied, surprised. ""You only play one side."" 

""Why?"" I asked. He looked confused and then thoughtful. ""I don't know. I don't see why you couldn't make both sides playable and double the capacity..."" He stared at the machine. ""You could have two lasers or just turn it over by hand... hmm."" He smiled at me. ""Yes, good point."" He pointed to my wooden chair. ""Anyway, let’s get you sitting in the best spot for the stereo effect, okay?"" I smiled, happy to have asked a technical question that Mr. Warriston could not answer.

**Books vs. Electronic Text**

Malcolm Bradbury made a good point when he said that if matches had been invented after cigarette lighters, we would have been amazed by the improvement. Many people believe that electronic text is as important as the invention of printing, but they forget that changes in how we think take a long time. For example, a book from 1979 predicted that books would slowly disappear in the 1980s. So far, that has not happened. 

Reading long texts on a screen is often frustrating, so many people avoid it. Computers encourage people to read only parts of texts. Some people say that this leads to new ways of storytelling, but many books have always been read in a non-linear way. What is new is that computers do not encourage reading a text from start to finish.

**The Office**

Charles walked into the office and saw a perfectly organized space. The carpet was clear of papers, and the dark wooden desk looked just as he remembered it from the auction five weeks ago. Neat file holders were being put away, and twelve years of trade journals filled one wall. Kathleen struggled to close the filing cabinet and then turned to him. ""You have to use computers, Charles. This is too much work.""

""Hello, Kathleen. This is amazing,"" he said, admiring the room's antique furniture. He was not thinking about computers or any machines in the office. ""Simply amazing,"" he said, avoiding the topic of computers. They had discussed this many times over the two years they had known each other. She could never understand why he resisted technology, especially since he was skilled with computers and had even published an important paper about them. She had inspired that paper. Through her keyboard skills, she could create new software that worked in exciting ways."
CPE_32,"Text: ""You don’t take sugar, do you?"" shouted his secretary. She was not really asking; she was stating a fact because she had been making Lancelot coffee for many months. She often forgot small details because he usually wasn’t supposed to be there. But now, he was there all the time. He realized that staying away only caused more problems. He thought about how he had gone from being a respected advisor, meeting authors and playwrights for lunch, to being overwhelmed with work and struggling to find a parking spot in the mornings.

""This came,"" she yelled, waving a manila folder before placing it in front of him. ""From that guy in Los Angeles. You said you wanted to see it."" A label on the folder read: ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert,"" and below it said ""An Expanded Synopsis."" Lancelot did not want to see the word ""synopsis."" He preferred to see ""A First Draft."" He had already seen a synopsis of this book and did not want to see another one, even if it was revised. Ian Cuthbert had received a large advance for this book when Lancelot bought the company. Ian was one of Lancelot's old friends, and he had made a mistake by asking him to write books. Ian was known for being unpredictable, and Lancelot felt that he was becoming even more difficult to deal with.

Lancelot skipped the introduction he had read many times and looked at the synopsis. He recognized almost every phrase. He closed the folder and pushed it aside. Clearly, at this rate, Ian's manuscript would never arrive. The synopsis lacked the brilliance that Ian was known for, and it felt like it had lost its original purpose. Lancelot remembered a famous author whose last book was published incomplete after his death, written chapter by chapter for payment. But in that case, the payments were small amounts that had never been given. Ian had received a huge advance, which went against the usual rule that authors must deliver a manuscript before getting paid.

Lancelot, who studied modern languages at Oxford, remembered when Ian was seen as a promising talent in Cambridge. Ian's peers aimed to take over British theatre, and they succeeded quickly. But Ian seemed lazy compared to them. He wore his overcoat like a cape and talked about famous French writers as if he had met them. Yet, for some reason, Ian's creative talent remained hidden. While less talented people succeeded, Ian withdrew even more. At the height of his influence, he was already difficult to work with. He was supposed to edit a magazine about the arts, but it never got published. His contract with a fashion magazine was renewed three times, but it only created stories about his high salary, which kept increasing to make him produce more, and then to make him produce anything at all.

At editorial meetings, Ian often criticized others' ideas. Ten years later, he could hardly be counted on to show up for his own funeral. Lancelot was starting to think that ""A World History of the Short"" had been a mistake from the beginning."
CPE_65,"**Text: England's Breakfast Revolution**

Health experts agree that a good breakfast is very important. However, in history, breakfast is a relatively new idea in England. In medieval times, breakfast was rarely mentioned in literature. There are some mentions of travelers eating a meal at dawn before long journeys and sick people having breakfast for health reasons, but most people did not eat breakfast unless they were kings or nobles.

In the sixteenth century, breakfast started to become common for everyone. Some writers believe this change happened because food became more available. However, they may not have considered other important social changes. For example, new work patterns meant that more people had jobs with set hours. Many of these jobs required workers to start very early in the morning. As a result, having a meal in the morning became necessary and was no longer just for the wealthy."
CPE_61,"**Photography**  
When a photographer takes a picture, they choose what to show based on their skills, personal views, and experiences, as well as social and cultural influences. In this book, we will explore how these factors affect the style, content, and meaning of a photograph, and how viewers understand and react to these images. For instance, a casual reader of a newspaper may think they understand the photographs printed there. However, instead of just accepting the image as it is, we can ask whether it truly shows what happened at that moment. Does it reflect the photographer's opinion? Is the exact moment captured important, or should we see the photograph as a symbol of a larger situation in the world?

**More than a Game**  
For me, sports are more than just a game. The most successful athletes have strong self-belief. To succeed in sports, you need to focus completely on your goal and set aside everything else. Sports can be harsh, and no one will do the hard work for you. It’s a matter of survival. Sports have taught me discipline and determination, but they also show the value of teamwork. My sport allows me to shine individually, but it is still a team effort, and I must balance both. This is similar to life – you can achieve personal success, but you should always remember the people around you. Sports have given me a lot, not just money. They have opened doors for me and shown me things in the world that many people will never experience. However, you also have to sacrifice a lot to enjoy these benefits.

**Tuning In**  
Some experiences stay in our memory so clearly that they become special moments we remember well. For me, one such moment happened many years ago in California when I lay awake listening to a beautiful mockingbird singing from a tree in my neighborhood. I don’t have trouble sleeping, but the bird’s amazing song kept me awake. As I listened to its complex melodies, I felt like I was in a unique artistic space. To understand the bird's patterns, I drew on my knowledge of jazz and Indian classical music. The bird made me feel like I was enjoying a stunning live performance. I reacted with joy and surprise as each unexpected musical twist followed the last through the open window until I finally fell asleep."
CPE_52,"**Simplified Text:**

Human culture has always had strong feelings about birds. But what does this say about us? Paul Evans reports.

In a greenhouse, a little brown bird called a wren is bumping against the glass. Some people see the wren as a sign of something important, while others think it is just a bird that is lost. Both ideas could be true. 

Wrens have been part of British culture for a long time. In medieval times, people believed that the direction in which wrens flew could tell them about their luck. Today, images of wrens can be found in many British homes. Even if old beliefs about wrens are not as strong now, people still care about them. A place without wrens feels sad. 

This connection to birds comes from a time when people relied more on nature for survival. They developed a way to understand the importance of different creatures. However, beliefs about birds can change over time. 

For example, the red kite was once seen as a valuable bird in London, where it would take bread from children. But later, people began to see it as a pest, and it almost disappeared from many areas. Now, red kites are protected again and are symbols of conservation in Britain.

Our relationship with birds goes back to the beginning of human history. Early humans watched birds closely because they could warn them about danger, bad weather, and food sources. Birds also connected them to their dreams. 

Birds are important to us because they represent flight, song, and freedom. Our interest in birds reflects our own identity and connection to nature. Some people think our feelings about birds are outdated, but they are still a part of who we are. Losing this connection would be difficult.

Recently, birds have become important indicators of environmental change. In Britain, 30 bird species are now endangered. This is sad not only because we are losing these birds but also because we are losing part of our culture. Birds like the skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing represent love and magic in literature. The loss of these birds is felt deeply by those who appreciate poetry and stories.

However, the loss of other birds that are not mentioned in literature is often ignored. Folklore, which includes stories and legends about birds, is very important. These stories create a strong connection to birds that scientific terms cannot match. They help us feel emotions that are often hidden in our busy lives.

Whether we watch birds on TV or in our backyards, the joy we feel cannot be fully explained by science. Birds engage us in ways that are hard to understand. The wren in the greenhouse connects our present with a rich history, holding onto its song and moving into the future—a mystery that keeps us curious."
CPE_28,"**Maps**

The purpose of a map is to show the relationships between different points and features on the earth's surface. These relationships are based on distance and direction. In the past, distance was often described in terms of time, such as ""a few hours' walk"" or ""a day's journey by river."" This way of measuring distance was more about how easy it was to travel through the land than about the actual distance. Direction was also important, but for most travelers, the main questions were ""Where do I go from here?"" and ""How far away is it?"" Therefore, having an accurate direction was not always necessary. Because of this, written directions were often used alongside maps. Even today, some maps, like those showing train routes, do not always show true directions.

In early maps, important landmarks were marked with signs that varied in size to show their significance. The way maps were made depended on their purpose and location, so it is important to understand the specific style used in early maps. The history of map-making, or cartography, is mainly about improving the accuracy of distance and direction and expanding the information included on maps. To achieve this, cartographers have used knowledge from other sciences. For example, instead of finding direction by looking at shadows or stars, they began using the magnetic compass and developed tools to measure angles accurately.

As knowledge of the world grew through exploration, attempts to create maps of known areas increased. Astronomers found that the earth is not a perfect sphere but is slightly flattened at the poles, which led to better mapping techniques. Over time, the needs of map users changed. Travelers and merchants were no longer the only ones using maps. Soldiers, especially after the invention of artillery, needed accurate maps to understand the land's features. This led to the creation of contour maps. Other users, like archaeologists, historians, and modern geographers, also had specific needs for maps.

Today, cartographers create maps that show various types of information, such as geological layers, climate zones, and land use. The growing recognition of the importance of maps in many scientific fields has led to a modern revival of cartography. However, it is important to note that the development of maps has not always been steady. There have been times of slow progress, interrupted by periods of rapid change, where old ideas coexisted with new ones. Cartographers have often understood the need for progress but had to wait for better tools to implement their ideas. Since it is easier to copy old maps, many map publishers have been slow to accept new ideas.

Therefore, maps should not be taken at face value as proof of current knowledge and techniques. The many maps we have today are the result of significant human effort and thought. They provide a valuable record for studying human history, which makes the study of historical cartography both interesting and educational."

I was taken into a young man's living room, which was a calm and cultured space surrounded by a messy group of rooms where the less ambitious family members lived. Moving from the kitchen to his room felt like going from economy to business class. This room had the largest collection of records I had ever seen, the first stereo record player I had encountered, and surprising evidence that a teenager had spent money on nice wine glasses, pictures, and furniture. His name was Andrew Lloyd Webber. He had received a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford, to study history, and he had nine months before starting, during which he wanted to become England's version of the famous composer Richard Rodgers. My own dreams were just as crazy; I wanted to be a pop star for the usual reasons: women, money, and fame. However, my dreams were not as important to me as Andrew's were to him. If I had failed, my dreams might have felt more serious. So, when Andrew suggested that I try to become a famous lyricist like Oscar Hammerstein, I was open to it. This was partly because, within ten minutes of meeting him, he played me three of his own tunes, and I could tell he was very talented. As he confidently played songs from the many shows he had created at school, I was reminded of the best show albums from my parents' collection. He needed a new lyricist for his work. I didn’t have much to impress him with, except for praising his music and showing him a seven-inch single of a song I had written with an unknown pop group that had not done well. We said goodbye, promising to meet again and write something together. I was still more interested in pop music than in theatre, but on the bus back to my flat, I thought I had met someone with rare talent and determination, and I would be foolish to miss the chance to work with someone who was likely to succeed in musical theatre soon. Even if we didn’t become top composers, we could try to compete with the Beatles and Rolling Stones later in the summer. The Everly Brothers had just made a comeback and would need new songs.

The next day, back at my desk in the office where I was training to be a lawyer, the excitement I had felt about a life in show business with Andrew Lloyd Webber had faded a bit. I would still look at small ads in Melody Maker for groups needing a singer and write a few more simple songs that wouldn’t show my voice’s limitations. But it was likely that I would finish my exams and become a respectable lawyer by the time I was twenty-five. By then, I would probably have outgrown pop music, as my father had predicted I would by twenty-one. This worried me—if he was right, I only had a few more months to enjoy it. But for now, I felt I had nothing to lose by seeing Andrew again. It would be fun to go to a musical with him and write lyrics that were more like those of musical writers than pop stars. Andrew was an interesting person who talked about good food and Victorian architecture and supported the Leyton Orient football team. I wasn’t sure about the musical idea he had been working on for the past year, but in 1965, I was rarely sure about anything. His talent was clear, and he claimed to have many important contacts. I soon found myself back in his living room. The idea was about the life of Dr. Thomas Barnardo, a 19th-century philanthropist who started the orphanages that carry his name. His story was important, but it didn’t really inspire me. The hero seemed too perfect in Andrew's version, and the idea felt unoriginal, too similar to Lionel Bart's hit show, Oliver. However, Andrew's strong belief in his music's brilliance was contagious and not completely unjustified. What did I know about musicals? As David Land, who would later be my agent for over twenty-five years, often said, if there is a demand for one hamburger place on the block, there is room for two. We could be the second hamburger place. I started working with great enthusiasm, especially for the funny songs. Andrew explained the plot, played me the tunes, and often gave me the titles, most of which had likely been thought up by his school friend who had already tried. I even skipped a day at the law office, pretending to be sick, to write my first set of theatrical lyrics. I didn’t know it then, but I had changed my career."

**Language**  
You and I are part of a species that has a special ability: we can influence each other's thoughts with great accuracy. Language is so important to human life that it is hard to imagine living without it. If you see two or more people together anywhere in the world, they will likely start talking to each other. When there is no one to talk to, people often talk to themselves, their pets, or even their plants. I like to think of language as an 'instinct.' This means that people know how to speak in a way similar to how spiders know how to spin webs. Web-spinning was not created by a brilliant spider, and it does not require special education or skills in building.

**Climate and Weather**  
Climate and weather, which are mainly caused by the air around us, greatly influence the lives of animals and plants. Climate can strongly shape the appearance of landscapes. For example, warm and wet conditions all year round allow tropical jungles to grow, which are full of many different species. In contrast, cold and windy areas can only support a few types of living things. The daily weather patterns that create the climate are caused by large air masses rising and mixing, as the atmosphere is always moving. Some of this movement happens because the layer of gases is on a spinning planet. Since air is light, it does not move at the same speed as the Earth and tends to lag behind. However, a more important cause of air movement is the sun.

**Coffee**  
As a barista, my job included serving drinks, but I was also responsible for making coffee. In Lygon Street, Melbourne, a restaurant's success can depend on its coffee. I spent several days training to make coffee, learning more than I ever wanted to know about cleaning and maintaining the restaurant's shiny espresso machine. I also learned the key principles for making a perfect, rich cappuccino. By the end of the first week, I realized that making good coffee was not as easy as it seemed, and I thought I might be sent back to simple tasks like cleaning ashtrays. Fortunately, my boss was patient. ""Making coffee is both an art and a science,"" he said, ""and you need time to learn the skill."""
CPE_41,"**Art on TV**

Why does television often struggle with programs about visual arts? Painting and sculpture are great subjects for the camera because it can show the entire artwork and then zoom in on the details. However, there are few TV series that truly capture the joy and complexity of viewing art. A good example of this is Robert Hughes's eight-part series on American art, called *American Visions*. Hughes is a trusted critic with a strong personality, and he had nearly eight hours to introduce British viewers to a type of art that is often overlooked in British galleries. I expected the series to focus on famous artworks, but instead, it explored how American history and culture are reflected in its art and architecture.

**Dealing in Metals**

For 20 years, I worked as an international metals dealer and became known as a speculator. The metals market is less regulated than other markets. With some luck, a willingness to take risks, and a good understanding of the market, it is possible to make a lot of money. Taking risks is a normal part of this industry. This adventurous culture fits well with a free-market global economy. However, the free-trade economists who believed that the market would keep the prices of scarce metals stable have found the opposite is true. More minerals are being extracted, and the prices of raw materials are going down. When considering inflation, the prices of most metals are about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to investigate claims made against one of the large companies that benefit from these low raw material prices.

**Extract from a Holiday Brochure**

Abaco and its nearby cays are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas, which stretch from Florida to Cuba. Each island has its own character and offers something unique. To explore the islands and cays of Abaco, a boat is essential. If a boat is not included with your accommodation, don’t worry. There are many ferries and water taxis available. You can also rent boats if you prefer to go at your own pace. Sailing is the most popular way to travel here. Abaco is known as 'The Sailing Capital of the World' for good reason. The calm, protected waters are perfect for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The cays and their beaches stretch for 200 miles, resembling a string of pearls. At night, the lights of the restaurants and cafes in Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay shine brightly, adding to the beauty of the area."
CPE_69,"**Text: Build Your Own Bamboo Bike at the UK's First Workshop**

Join a course at the Bamboo Bike Club, led by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan, where you can create your own custom bike frame and enjoy a fun weekend of bike-building. It’s Saturday morning in Hackney Wick, east London, and the Bamboo Bike Club is busy with activity. This is the only place in Britain where you can learn to build bikes from bamboo.

Bamboo is becoming a popular material for bike construction. Companies like Calfee Design from California and Bamboo Bikes from Yorkshire have been making bamboo bikes since 1894. However, many cyclists find these bikes expensive, with ready-made frames costing around $2,995 or £1,868. This high price motivated James and Ian to spend years working in a shed in Brecon, Wales, to create a bamboo bike business that is affordable for regular cyclists. They wanted to share the joy of making something unique and sustainable, not just sell bike frames.

Now, the Bamboo Bike Club offers monthly courses where you can build your own bike frame at a reasonable price. On the first day of the course, James and Ian teach participants how to choose strong bamboo and create strong joints. They guide everyone through the process of assembling the bike frame, which includes a front triangle made of thick bamboo and thinner parts for the seat and chain. They also use metal tubes for the handlebars and other parts that need extra strength.

James and Ian are very supportive, helping participants with their work and ensuring everything is done correctly. Many people in the course are engineers, but Ian assures everyone that it’s okay to make mistakes. If you mess up, you can just try again with a new piece of bamboo. Each piece has been checked for quality, so you can choose how your bike will look, whether plain bamboo, black, or mottled.

On Sunday, the focus is on building the lugs, which are the parts that connect the frame. Participants wrap the joints with hemp bindings and glue them with epoxy resin to make them strong. After adding a waterproof coating, the bike is ready for wheels, brakes, gears, and personal touches. James and Ian claim that their bamboo bikes are just as strong as metal ones. Ian has been riding his bike for over a year, and James has tested his bike off-road for three months without breaking it.

While bamboo bikes may not look as polished as professional metal frames, they are unique. James and Ian believe that the individuality of each bike is important. Personally, I think bamboo bikes are best for relaxed rides rather than racing. I choose a 'Classic English' frame for a comfortable ride. When I try James's bike, I find it light and smooth, thanks to bamboo's ability to absorb vibrations.

James says that the real joy of these workshops comes when you ride the bike. They are light and fun to ride. And the best part? The price is less than £500."

**Self-Help Books**  
Diane Reverend was an editor at Random House in New York when she first saw a manuscript by an unknown psychologist, Dr. John Gray. ""I knew it would be a bestseller,"" she says, and she was right. Dr. Gray became very successful, and Diane started her own company. Dr. Gray's book about improving communication between men and women is very popular and represents a growing self-help industry in America. This industry tries to meet people's desires for self-improvement, but it also creates new desires and supports the publishing industry in New York. In Britain, many self-help books are published, but many more are rejected because they are too similar or too specific. This is a good thing. Editors are now looking for the next big hit, and they focus more on how marketable a book is rather than its writing style. Diane says, ""If someone has a catchy title, that's a big part of the success. It helps reach people.""

**Autobiographies**  
When someone writes an autobiography, there is an unspoken agreement that they will tell the truth. However, this agreement is often not fully kept. Writers may leave out things they feel are too shameful or not important enough. Sometimes, they might invent stories that express their truth better than just sticking to the facts. An autobiographer might call their book an autobiography just to make readers believe they are reading true events, even if the story is mostly fiction. This can happen without any intention to deceive.

**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**  
Experts say that detective stories became popular because they reflect the conflicts of society in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In these stories, crime symbolizes human desires like greed or lust, and solving the crime helps restore order in society. However, in Hammett's stories, society is shown to be corrupt. The detective and the criminal are two sides of the same person. The detective understands the criminal, and they share a strange connection. The detective is seen as too honest by criminals and too shady by the law. His job is complicated by his feelings of guilt and his desire for justice.

**Science Writing**  
Stephen Jay Gould is one of the best science writers today. I met him at the Grand Hotel while he was promoting his new book. He said he couldn’t write well in such a fancy place because understanding the culture is important for a writer. Science is its own world, and only scientists can explain it well. If you don’t know the community and its rules, you will struggle. Gould believes in never writing down to the reader. ""You can make the language simpler, but don’t change the ideas,"" he says. ""If readers feel you are talking down to them, they will lose interest."""
CPE_17,"**Air-conditioning**

At Cannons Gym, a popular place for City of London workers during lunch, the air feels very cold. To handle this summer's high temperatures, the gym has used a lot of air-conditioning. Sometimes, it feels like being in the Arctic. This shows how people often misuse air-conditioning today. It is now a common part of our work and leisure, showing how we can control the climate. However, many buildings with air-conditioning could use other ways to stay cool. They could use natural light and fresh air, and have thicker walls that keep heat out during the day and let it go at night. These ideas may seem simple, but they can make a big difference and reduce the need for air-conditioning.

**Sundials**

It is interesting that as we start a new millennium, people are becoming more interested in sundials, which are tools that tell time based on the sun's position. A hundred years ago, sundials were important for keeping time accurately. But as clocks and watches improved, sundials became just garden decorations. Now, they are being taken seriously again. David Harber, who makes sundials, believes people like them because they connect us to the planets. He says there is a special moment when a sundial starts to work. They are calm and beautiful objects that remind us of our place in the universe.

**Paint Your Own China**

My idea of china-painting came from a visit to an arts and crafts show long ago, where serious-looking older women showed how to paint delicate flowers on teacups. It was fascinating to watch them, as each brushstroke created a perfect petal or leaf. Their hands were steady, and the paint never smudged. I thought these women must have practiced for years or had a special talent. Because of this, I wondered what kind of people would join a china-painting class. Would beginners have natural talent? However, the atmosphere in the class was friendly and fun. Everyone was there to enjoy themselves, and even the teacher did not want to paint like the women I had seen before."
CPE_47,"**The Wrong Country**

Uncle chose a package holiday for Keith and Dawne at a good price: a flight from Gatwick Airport, twelve nights in Venice, the beautiful city, at the Pensione Concordia. When they went to the travel agency to book the trip, the clerk told them that the other travelers were a school group from the south coast, all learning Italian. But something went wrong. Either at the travel agency, the check-in desk, or in a computer, a mistake happened. Keith and Dawne ended up in a hotel called the Edelweiss, in Room 212, somewhere in Switzerland.

At Gatwick, they gave their tickets to a girl in a yellow-and-red uniform. She checked their tickets and said everything was fine. An hour later, they were surprised to hear older people on the plane speaking with accents from the North of England. Keith thought there might have been a cancellation, or that the Italian class was on another plane. They ordered drinks, and then more drinks. 

When they landed, a stout woman with glasses said, ""The coach will take us on. Stay together now."" There was no mention of an overnight stop in the brochure, but when the coach arrived at its destination, Keith realized that this was clearly an unexpected stop. It was close to midnight, and tired from traveling, they did not question the beds they were offered. But the next morning, when they found out they would be staying there for their entire holiday, they became worried.

""We have the lake and the water birds,"" the receptionist said with a smile. ""And we can take a boat to Interlaken."" 

Keith calmly told the man, ""There has been a mistake. We were supposed to be in Venice, at the Pensione Concordia."" 

""I do not know that name, sir. This is Switzerland,"" the receptionist replied. 

""A coach is supposed to take us on. An official said so on the plane,"" Keith insisted. 

""Your group is booked for twelve nights in the Edelweiss Hotel. If you have changed your minds—"" 

""We haven't changed our minds. There has been a mistake."" The receptionist shook his head, saying he did not know about any mistake. 

Dawne then said, ""The man who made the booking was bald, with glasses and a moustache."" She gave the name of the travel agency in London. 

""Is there a problem?"" a woman said, smiling at Keith. She was the stout woman he had seen at Gatwick. 

""My name is Franks,"" she said. ""I'm married to the man with the bad leg."" 

""Are you in charge, Mrs. Franks?"" Dawne asked. ""We are in the wrong hotel."" 

Again, Dawne mentioned the travel agency and described the bald clerk. Keith interrupted, ""It seems we got into the wrong group. We reported to the Your-Kind-of-Holiday girl and left it to her."" 

""We should have known when they weren't from Dover,"" Dawne added. ""We heard them talking about Darlington."" 

Keith was impatient and wanted to speak. ""We noticed you at Gatwick. We knew you were in charge."" 

""I counted you, although you probably didn't see me,"" Mrs. Franks replied. ""Let me explain. Your-Kind-of-Holiday sends clients to many places, with different holidays at different prices. There are villa holidays for young people, treks to Turkey, and treks for singles to the Himalayas."" 

""What I am trying to say is that all tickets and labels look similar, yellow with two red bands,"" Mrs. Franks laughed. ""If you followed others with the yellow-and-red label, you might think you could end up in a wildlife park! But that couldn't happen."" 

""We're not supposed to be in Switzerland,"" Keith insisted. 

""Let's see,"" Mrs. Franks said unexpectedly and walked away, leaving them standing there. The receptionist was no longer at the desk, and they could hear typing. 

""She seems kind,"" Dawne whispered. Keith was not listening. He tried to remember everything that had happened: giving the tickets, waiting, and then the girl leading them to the plane. 

""Nice to have some young people along,"" an elderly man said. ""Nottage is the name."" His wife was with him, and they both looked very old. They said they had the best night's sleep because of the lakeside air. 

""That's nice,"" Dawne said. Keith walked out of the reception area, and Dawne followed him. Outside the hotel, they did not say that there was an irony in what had happened. On their first holiday since their honeymoon, they had ended up on a package tour with older people when they wanted to escape the needs of the elderly. Uncle had said so himself when they tried to convince him to join them."
CPE_48,"**Text: 'HE WAS A PEOPLE PERSON'**

American business leaders are looking to the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a model for good management. Eluned Price reports.

Most people in Britain know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and what he did. However, America has only recently discovered him. The Wall Street Journal described Shackleton as ""an Antarctic explorer whose achievements went mostly unnoticed for most of the 20th century,"" which is an exaggeration. Now, Americans are showing great interest in him. Many biographies and stories about Shackleton's voyage on the Endurance are being published, and the American Museum of Natural History is preparing a big exhibition. Columbia Tristar is also making a film about his life.

Some American managers see Shackleton as a role model. They admire his leadership and communication skills and often refer to his actions as lessons for modern business. Shackleton, known for his determination and resourcefulness, has become an example for management consultants. Jim MacGregor, a managing partner at Abernathy MacGregor Frank in New York, has looked up to Shackleton for years. His firm focuses on communication during mergers, acquisitions, and corporate crises.

MacGregor explains that even if a company handles a crisis well, poor communication can still cause problems. He believes Shackleton is a great model for management because he had strong values and was at his best when his team had a lot to lose, including their lives. One of Shackleton's most interesting decisions was to turn back when he was only 97 miles from the South Pole. This choice showed his commitment to the safety of his men.

In a crisis, people want to know who is in charge. While many managers today avoid responsibility, Shackleton was willing to take charge. His 1914 expedition became legendary when his ship, the Endurance, was trapped in ice for nine months and eventually sank. When the ship went down, Shackleton told his men, ""We should all eventually reach safety if you do your best and trust me."" His leadership was clear from the accounts kept by his men; he was always in control.

MacGregor notes that Shackleton planned carefully, kept his men informed, and valued their opinions. He was flexible and willing to change plans when necessary. Shackleton believed that an explorer needs optimism, endurance, and patience. MacGregor points out that in difficult situations, especially in America, people often want quick solutions. However, sometimes it is better to wait and see how things develop.

Shackleton led by example. On the way back from the Endurance, he noticed Hurley, the expedition photographer, without gloves. He insisted that Hurley wear his gloves, saying he would throw them overboard if he didn’t. Another time, during a previous expedition, Shackleton offered to leave a biscuit in the snow rather than eat it himself, showing how much he valued sharing with his team.

As Caroline Alexander, author of *Endurance*, says: ""The public's interest in heroic efforts is growing. Shackleton represents the ideals we long for today."""
CAE_15,"**Simplified Text: 'Finding Food in Madagascar'**

In the forests of Madagascar, there is a special primate called the aye-aye. Its way of finding food is similar to that of a woodpecker. Both the aye-aye and the woodpecker look for insect larvae by digging into wood. The woodpecker uses its beak to make holes and its long tongue to get the insects. The aye-aye, however, uses its sharp front teeth to chew into the wood and its long third finger to reach inside and pull out the insects.

Although scientists first described the aye-aye's unique feeding method over a hundred years ago, they have only recently learned how it finds the insects hidden in the wood. Dr. Carl Erickson from Duke University studied the hunting skills of two male aye-ayes named Nosferatu and Poe, a female named Samantha, and her baby, Annabelle.

Dr. Erickson wanted to see if the aye-ayes could find insects by looking for signs, like holes in the wood where insects might have entered. He gave them logs with narrow holes. Some holes led to food, while others were empty. The aye-ayes quickly went to the logs with food, showing they did not need to see the holes to find it. They might have been using their sense of smell or hearing, but further tests showed they did not rely on these senses either. They could find food even when the smell was blocked and when the insects were dead and silent.

So, how did the aye-ayes find the insects? Dr. Erickson found that they could sense the empty spaces in the wood. When looking for food, an aye-aye taps the wood with its long finger and listens carefully. Dr. Erickson believes the aye-aye uses a method called echo-location, where it listens for sounds that tell it there is a hollow space below. It can also hear insects moving when they are disturbed by the tapping.

Some scientists think that the aye-aye might fill the role of woodpeckers in Madagascar, but there are also birds like the Sickle-billed and Nuthatch Vangas that look for insects in wood. So, the woodpecker role may not be empty. The aye-aye is not only like a woodpecker and an echo-locating bat, but it also acts like a squirrel. Its front teeth keep growing like a squirrel's, and it has been seen in the wild chewing through nuts and using its long finger to get the nut meat out."
CAE_19,"**Text: Ordinary People, Ordinary Lives**

Many of us have photos of our grandparents, but how many of us really know what their lives were like when they were young? The few diaries we have are often incomplete, and family stories are sometimes only half-remembered. What will our grandchildren know about us? We often plan to write things down but never do. We might leave videos instead of photos, but those images are still flat.

Hannah Renier has found a solution: she writes autobiographies for other people. She creates a hardback book of at least 20,000 words, with illustrations if needed. Her work focuses on ordinary people, not famous ones. The idea came to her when she spoke with her family and realized how much of the past was being forgotten. ""When I started, I didn’t take it as seriously as I do now,"" she says. ""I met people who have interesting stories to tell. They often say they are doing it for their children or future generations, but they enjoy the process too.""

The promise of confidentiality helps her subjects feel free to share their true feelings. One man, who is 62 years old, said, ""I had the confidence to be honest. I was surprised by what I shared. There were painful memories, like my divorce."" He wrote his story for his family, hoping they could learn from it, but he hasn’t let them read it yet. He feels some details might hurt them, and he prefers they read it after he is gone.

Ms. Renier has noticed that many people are influenced by their childhood experiences. ""It’s amazing how much people are shaped by their parents,"" she says. ""The messages they received as children can affect them for their whole lives. They often repeat the same patterns in their relationships."" Many people still regret things that happened with their parents, even many years later. If they had issues in their youth, they often still have them as adults.

Ms. Renier acts as a recorder rather than an interrogator. ""I’m not there to pry into their lives,"" she explains. People sometimes share things and then worry if they should be included. She usually includes everything, allowing them to remove parts later if they want. Most people want to be honest about their lives.

This is not vanity publishing; it’s not about people saying, ""Look at my interesting life."" Life is moving quickly, and we are losing touch with our past. These books help people connect with their roots and ancestors, especially since families are not as close as they used to be. People want a way to be remembered.

Each book involves up to 30 hours of recorded interviews, which Ms. Renier uses to write the life story, organizing the events and interpreting them. Modern technology helps her create everything except the binding, which has gold lettering. Clients can choose the color and title of their book. The final product is well-organized and written, and it looks professional. Each book costs nearly £3,000, with extra copies available for £25 each. She receives about 10 inquiries a week, but the high cost stops many people from ordering. ""I thought it would be a more affordable product,"" she says. ""But the people I’ve worked with are often from wealthy backgrounds, readers of magazines like Harpers & Queen, which is where I advertise. They are the kind of people who would have had their portraits painted in the past."""

The Museum of Classical Archaeology is one of the few places in the world that has a collection of casts of Greek and Roman sculptures, with over six hundred pieces. It is important to note that none of the sculptures are original; they are all replicas made from the originals, mostly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Museum is located in a specially designed gallery with great natural light. There are many benefits to having plaster casts: sculptures that were originally displayed together but are now in different museums across Europe can be seen together again. You can see almost all the famous works of Greek and Roman sculpture in just one afternoon.

Cambridge Darkroom is a photography center that has community darkrooms and a gallery displaying various photography exhibitions. We regularly offer courses and workshops for people of all ages and skill levels, including a popular Beginner's Course, a shorter Induction Course, and Master Classes with guest photographers. We have a membership program that allows all members to use our darkrooms. We also support young photographers (ages 12 to 16) to improve their skills through our Young Members scheme, led by our resident photographer. We sell photography books and magazines and provide a full range of photographic materials.

**C. Sedgwick Museum of Geology**  
The Sedgwick Museum has a wonderful collection of fossil animals and plants, rocks, and minerals from all geological ages and parts of the world. It also has Britain's oldest complete geological collection, created by Dr. John Woodward (1665-1728). This collection includes nearly 10,000 rare and interesting specimens stored in their original cabinets from the early 18th century. Adam Sedgwick was a Professor of Geology and the keeper of the Woodwardian collection. Throughout his life, he greatly expanded the collections, creating an outstanding museum. The collection is organized by geological age, allowing visitors to see the major changes in life on Earth over time. The new Whewell Gallery displays beautiful minerals and gems, with full labels explaining their nature and modern uses.

**D. The Cambridge University Collection of Air Photographs**  
The collection has over 400,000 air photographs taken by university staff over the last 45 years. The University has its own aircraft based at Cambridge Airport and takes photographs across Great Britain. These photographs are interesting as they provide a detailed record of the landscape, showing both the natural environment and human impact from prehistoric times to today. There is a small display in the entrance hall, and the knowledgeable library staff can help with any questions. The photographs cannot be borrowed, but copies can usually be purchased. These copies are made to order and typically take about a month.

The Cambridge Brass Rubbing Centre is the second oldest and longest-running center of its kind in the world, making it one of the most unique tourist attractions in the region. Visitors can enjoy creating wall hangings by rubbing one of over a hundred different brass plates from the tombs of medieval knights and ladies. By making resin copies, known as facsimiles, the center preserves the originals while allowing everyone to enjoy brass rubbing. The brass plates, which served as memorials to tomb statues, spread from Germany across medieval Europe and Scandinavia. Many beautiful brasses were destroyed during various revolutions, but most of the remaining ones are in Britain, with the widest range available at the Cambridge Centre."
CAE_13,"**From Here to Paternity**

**A. The Theatre Director**  
I have had a strange personal life, but I have been lucky to spend 35 years with small children, and I have loved every moment. This morning, I enjoyed feeding the baby, which is what being a father means to me. I feel very fortunate with my children. We all enjoy the same things: opera, theatre, books, and music. This has created a strong bond, especially now that they are mostly grown up and I see them more as a friend than just a father. I do not believe in physical punishment. I have sometimes slapped my children in anger, but I do not support it. I may not have been the most attentive father, but I have always tried to be available. I am here for them if they need me, but I believe they should reach out to me first. If I start asking them why they haven’t contacted me, it can make them feel guilty. My parents did that to me, and I would never do that to my children.

**B. The Advertising Executive**  
I was young when my children were born, around 25, and I found the responsibilities quite annoying. It made me feel older quickly, but it also kept me young, which I appreciate. As they became teenagers, they introduced me to music, youth culture, and fashion, which helped me stay connected in my work. I missed some important moments when they were young, like their first concerts and sports days, and I feel sad about that. However, now I can take them on holidays to the south of France, and they enjoy spending time with my friends and attending parties and award ceremonies without feeling out of place. I think it helps that my job is seen as interesting and glamorous.

**C. The Politician**  
My first child was born just as I was about to be elected to the Greater London Council, and I had more children soon after. My wife and I promised to make time for them, but as my political career grew, finding time became difficult. I only accept weekend meetings and public events if my children can come with me. If I didn’t do this, they would feel left out. This way, they can see what I do when I am not with them, and they don’t feel like I am disappearing. I have noticed that more politicians are bringing their children to work, which shows we are becoming more aware of the importance of including our children in our lives.

**D. The Writer**  
My first marriage ended when my daughters, Kate and Bonnie, were young, so I had to think more about fatherhood. I worked hard to stay connected with them. My ex-wife and I even tried living next to each other for a while, so they could visit easily, but I think it confused them. Kate has said in interviews that I was always there for her, but I wonder if I was a good father. I was around a lot, but I treated my children like adults too soon. Kate recently said that we were too lenient. I think I could have set more rules and structure. Instead, I took a very relaxed approach, and I regret that now. I still worry about my older daughters just as much as my youngest. In that way, your children never really leave you.

**E. The TV Presenter**  
I was ready for children. I was 30, had met my wife, and we had a nice home, so we thought, ""Why not have a child instead of just buying new furniture?"" Having my daughter, Betty, has made me understand who I am. It feels special to have a child, but it also means you become just one of many parents. It can be frustrating at times, but whenever I feel annoyed, one look at her makes it all better. A baby's smile is the best way to feel happy again."

CAE_46,"**Text: 'Science Defying Gravity'**

Journalist Tom Mumford joins students who are using weightlessness to test their ideas. The aircraft looked like a normal plane from the outside. The pilot told the 13 students from Europe and America that it was built in 1964 and was a Boeing KC-135 refueling tanker, based on the Boeing 707. However, inside, it was very different. The interior was a long white tunnel with few windows and lights along the padded walls. Most of the seats were removed, leaving only a few at the back where the nervous students sat.

For a year, these students had competed to take part in this flight, which was organized by the European Space Agency. They had to come up with creative experiments to do in weightless conditions. Those with the best ideas won a spot on this special flight, which was like an extraordinary roller-coaster ride. 

For the next two hours, the Boeing would fly in a way that felt like a giant bird soaring up and then diving down. The pilot would cut the engines at 3,000 meters, allowing the plane to rise higher for a moment before gravity pulled it back down. During the few seconds of weightlessness, the students would feel as if they were closer to the moon than to the Earth.

The flight started smoothly, but the students quickly realized this was not a regular passenger flight when the pilot made the plane climb at a steep angle for about 20 seconds. The engines roared, and the students felt the blood rush from their heads as they were pushed against the cabin floor. Then, the engines stopped, and they experienced weightlessness almost immediately. For 20 seconds, they floated in silence, as if the floor had turned into a trampoline. Moving around became confusing; directions like left, right, up, or down lost their meaning.

After ten seconds of freefall, the pilot pulled the plane out of its dive. The return of gravity was sudden, and some students landed hard. After completing the first curve, some students felt sick at the thought of the 29 more to come. Thirty curves meant ten minutes of ""space time"" for their experiments. The Dutch students studied the movements of their robotic cat, Leonardo, to find out how cats always land on their feet. They released a device they built to investigate this, and one student managed to turn it over using a remote control. 

However, during the next curve, another student accidentally landed on top of it. Meanwhile, a German team from the University of Aachen studied how the quality of metal joints is affected by the lack of gravity, which is important for building future space stations. Another group from Utah State University worked on creating solar sails from thin liquid films that harden in ultraviolet sunlight. They believe that if they perfect this process, satellites could use solar sails to harness the sun's energy, just like a yacht uses wind.

After two hours of flying between heaven and Earth, the students felt a mix of excitement and instability, but mostly exhilaration. One student said, ""It was an unforgettable experience. I wanted to be an astronaut before, but now I want it even more."""

**With the Trees, I Planted My Stake in New Zealand**  
**JONATHON PORRITT TALKS TO DANNY DANZIGER**

Jonathon Porritt is the author of *Seeing Green - The Politics of Ecology*. 

I had a strange time in my life when I didn’t experience any summers. I went to New Zealand every summer, which is actually winter there. So, I had nine winters in a row, which I enjoyed because I like winter. My parents had the idea to buy a small piece of land for my brother, sister, and me to take care of. My mother said, “If you can plant trees on it, then it can be yours.” The idea was that we would always have a connection to New Zealand, which is nice because my father grew up there. They found a piece of land about 20 miles north of Auckland in a place called Rangitoupuni. The land was not very good, but it was suitable for planting trees. I have always been interested in land. I spent a year in Australia working on sheep farms and doing different farming jobs, so the idea of planting trees excited me, and I was eager to start. My family also became enthusiastic as we went along. I began planting in 1968, and by the end of 1972, the three of us had planted the entire 70 acres.

In New Zealand in 1968, it was a very rainy winter. It rained almost every day while we were planting, and I don’t think I have ever been so wet or cold for such a long time. Every morning was a challenge: getting ready for the next planting session. I would come out of the Land Rover warm and dry, but then the rain would start, and my clothes were still damp from the day before. My hands would struggle with slippery shoelaces. “My mind would start to wander, allowing me to think about many strange ideas and reflections on life.” 

In that first year, I had a helper who was an experienced tree-planter, which was very useful since I had never planted trees seriously before. You wear a planting bag around your neck, filling it with as many trees as you can. When the bag is full, it becomes heavy, and it only gets easier when it is lighter. The hardest part of the job was getting the lines straight. You decide how far apart to plant the trees, then you set up three poles in a straight line. These poles help you keep your planting straight. Once you are in line, you plant all the way down the line, then turn around and come back. I enjoy hard physical work, and it helped me get fit. After a while, you can plant trees almost automatically. You get into a rhythm and use the least number of movements to dig the hole. 

The rhythm is important in many farming jobs. You train your body to do the same movements, and then it becomes easy: you take the tree out of the bag, dig a hole, put it in the ground, stamp it down, and move on. Mentally, it is interesting. My mind would start to think about many ideas and reflections on life. A lot of my thoughts about nature and our place in it began during those days. I have returned to New Zealand four times since then and watched the trees grow, which has been very satisfying because I planted them and feel connected to their success. I always worry when I read news about strong winds or droughts in New Zealand. Such news makes me anxious. However, everything turned out well, and those trees are now 20 years old and healthy.

I should add that I took a break from teaching and went back in 1984, alone for three months. I wrote my first book there, *Seeing Green*. There is a simple cabin on the tree farm with just a bed, a table, and a chair. In the mornings, I would write; in the afternoons, I would prune the trees, and in the evenings, I would do research. My connection to that area is still very strong. It is the place I feel most connected to in terms of the bond between people and the earth. It is a powerful connection."
CAE_10,"**Text: 'RAISING BADGERS'**

""What now?"" was my first thought when one of my helpers brought a cardboard box to me. My husband Derek and I have run an open dairy farm in Somerset for six years, and we are known for caring for orphaned animals. But the noise from the box—a mix of a cackle and a bark—was unfamiliar. I looked inside and saw three small grey badger cubs, each about eight inches long. Their soft coats were covered in fleas, and their milky eyes looked up at me from their tiny black-and-white striped heads. I had never seen badger cubs before. Most badgers are born between mid-January and mid-March and spend their early lives underground. If they are orphaned, they often die from hunger and are never found. These three cubs were brought to me by builders who accidentally disturbed their home while working. The mother was found dead, with her babies still trying to suckle. I could see the cubs were healthy but cold and whimpering. After removing the fleas, I took them into the farmhouse kitchen and placed them beside the stove for warmth. There were two females, named Primrose and Bluebell, and a male named Willow. At first, I used a syringe to feed them, but I had to wipe each cub with a warm cloth first to mimic the feeling of their mother licking them. This helped them to go to the bathroom. For the first few days, I fed them every four hours. Within a week, they were drinking from a bottle and moving around, though a bit unsteadily. They were happy with each other and a heated pad as a substitute for their mother.

However, three weeks later, I noticed that Willow seemed weak, even though he was still eating normally. This was a warning sign. I should have acted quickly, but I didn’t realize how serious it was. The next morning, I found him dead. The vet's examination showed that Willow had died from a lung infection. When bottle-feeding any animal, it is important not to let them drink too quickly, as liquid can go into the lungs. In Willow's case, this caused an infection that would have been hard to treat, even with antibiotics, because he was so small. Feeling sad about my loss, I continued to care for the other cubs. Then, six days later, a local farmer, who had heard about our cubs, came to see me. He had found another male cub, abandoned by its mother. He knew she would not return because the area had been disturbed too much, and the cub was cold and hungry. This new cub, named Willow II, joined us. At six weeks old, he was about two weeks younger than the females. I soon discovered why his mother had left him; he was very difficult to feed. I had to keep moving the bottle's teat around and squeezing it to get him to drink. After ten minutes, he would finally latch on as if he hadn’t eaten all day.

By the end of April, the females were eating creamed rice and then anything else. Willow II was happy to stop using the bottle but struggled to eat without making a mess. Eventually, I offered him a sausage, which he slowly learned to chew and eat. After a week of sausages, he was ready for more variety. At nearly five months old, they were all eating cereals for breakfast, a meat and vegetable meal for lunch, and fruit, nuts, cheese, hard-boiled eggs, and sunflower seeds in the evening. Normally, badgers eat 60% earthworms, plus beetles, baby rabbits, mice, and even plant roots. My badgers were better off than others that year because the summer was very hot, making it hard to find earthworms.

By August, my badgers had started to become nocturnal and would only go for walks at dusk or late at night. We often walked through the cider orchard, where the long grass made it easy for them to chase each other. They would get excited, fluff up their fur, and chase their tails. As ""human badgers,"" we joined in their fun. I learned to avoid their playful nips, but Derek, who joined us less often, sometimes got caught and had colorful reactions to it.

During two late-night walks in a dry period, I saw other badgers in our field. They were likely looking for food because badgers are very territorial and will fight others that enter their area. We were warned that they might come into our badger pen and harm the cubs, so we put sheet metal over the gate to keep it safe. The local press took pictures of me walking the badgers, and we started a campaign to build a sett (a badger home) on the farm. With help from others, we designed a new home for the badgers. One of our sons, Daniel, drew the plans, and we built a sett with tunnels, an enclosure, and a badger gate that faced their usual walking path. It had three chambers, one larger than the others, with a glass side so people could see inside from a darkened area. As the sett took shape, the badgers explored it before their walks. Eventually, they became more interested in the tunnels and bedding than in walking.

The cost of building was higher than we expected, but a local bus company called Badgerline helped fund part of it, and local businesses donated materials. Everyone wanted to see the badgers have a home. One evening, they finally moved in. After watching them for a while, we left them to settle. Half an hour later, I quietly returned to check on them and saw three badgers curled up in their chambers, sound asleep. Nowadays, I don’t walk with them as often, especially since they don’t wake up until midnight. We see Primrose only sometimes because she has joined a nearby sett, but Bluebell and Willow II still come to greet me before running off into the night. This is their territory now, a place they know well and a home they have happily accepted."
CAE_67,"**Text: In Search of True North - The Man Behind Halley's Comet**

Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, wants to follow in the footsteps of Sir Edmund Halley, who studied compass variations. Anjana Ahuja reports.

Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is famous for the comet named after him. However, one of his most important achievements was mapping the ""variations of the compass"" during his sea voyages on the warship Paramore. These variations, now called ""declination,"" refer to the angle between magnetic north and true geographical north. Understanding declination was crucial for sailors to correct their compasses and navigate the oceans accurately.

Halley, one of only two men in England at that time who were paid to do scientific research, set out for the Cape Verde Islands to chart declination in the North and South Atlantic. His first trip was cut short due to crew problems, but he later sailed again. This second voyage took him to Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, Newfoundland, and back to England. In 1701, he published a ""New and Correct Chart showing the Variations of the Compass in the Western and Southern Oceans."" More advanced maps based on his work helped sailors for over a century until changes in the Earth's magnetic field made them less accurate.

Dr. Clark, who loves sailing, plans to celebrate the 300th anniversary of Halley's journey by retracing the Paramore's route. He needs to raise £70,000 before starting, and Sir Vivian Fuchs, who led the first expedition across Antarctica, is supporting him.

Dr. Clark became interested in Halley while working at Halley Station in Antarctica, where he read about Halley's life. ""Halley led a remarkable life,"" Dr. Clark says. ""He was a respected scientist and led expeditions. He was not just an astronomer; he also studied geophysics. While he was Astronomer Royal, he mapped the stars and worked on other projects.""

During this time, Halley invented a diving bell and helped Sir Isaac Newton with his famous book, Principia Mathematica, which is the foundation of classical physics. Dr. Clark believes that recreating Halley's voyage will give him the recognition he deserves. His expedition, called ""In the Wake of the Paramore,"" will also have scientific value. It will involve taking measurements that Halley made, but with much better instruments. These measurements are important because the Earth's magnetic field is always changing.

Dr. Clark explains, ""It is common to measure the size of the magnetic field but not its direction. You need to know true north to measure the direction. On our expedition, we can use global positioning satellites to find that."" The British Geological Survey and the United States Navy will provide instruments for the trip. A Danish satellite will also be taking similar measurements, and Dr. Clark hopes his data will fill in any gaps in the satellite's coverage of the Atlantic Ocean.

Halley's journey was significant because it was the first scientific expedition at sea, and he was the first civilian appointed as a naval captain to study declination. Does Dr. Clark have the right experience for his voyage? He has spent two years in Antarctica and worked in the geomagnetic group at the British Geological Survey. He has also sailed the 13,000 kilometers from Rio de Janeiro to England. He plans to complete the expedition in four stages with different crews.

Does he share Halley's obsessive nature? ""I am willing to give up my life for eight months to do this, so some might think I'm obsessed. But I wouldn't want to sail across the Atlantic again without a good reason. Halley and his fascinating life have given me a real sense of purpose."""

**POWER DRESSING**

Every summer, the peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show off their beautiful tail feathers to the hens. This behavior raises a question that puzzled Charles Darwin: how could birds develop such extravagant features in a world where survival is tough? How do they manage to do this?

Zoologist Marion Petrie and her team from the Open University are studying the peacocks at Whipsnade to find answers, more than a century after Darwin's death. Darwin believed that living things change over time through evolution, not by special creation. He thought that natural selection was the main way this happened. In a competitive environment, the individuals best suited to survive are the ""fittest."" However, this usually means the strongest or fastest, not necessarily the most beautiful.

Darwin thought that the peacock's tail was a burden, so he introduced the idea of ""sexual selection."" He suggested that females are attracted to beauty for its own sake. However, Darwin's friend Alfred Russel Wallace disagreed. He believed that if peahens prefer males with the most impressive tails, there must be another reason behind this choice that is not obvious to humans. According to Wallace, the tail is not just for show; it must indicate some real advantage for survival.

Today, researchers still debate this issue. Studying the natural behavior of peafowl is challenging. However, the 200 peacocks at Whipsnade, which live like wild birds but are used to people, provide a great opportunity for research. Marion Petrie and her team have two main questions: Do peahens really choose the males with the most impressive tails? And do these males have some real advantages, or is it just for show?

The adult male peacocks display in groups, and the hens compare them. Long observations and photographs suggest that the hens do prefer the males with the most eye-spots on their tails, which are related to tail length. Males with more eye-spots attract more mates. However, it is still unclear if these males are better in other ways.

William Hamilton from Oxford University has suggested that showy male birds might be healthier and free from parasites, and their bright feathers could signal this. There is some evidence for this in other bird species, but Dr. Petrie and her team have not yet been able to check for parasites in the Whipsnade peacocks.

This year, Dr. Petrie is comparing the offspring of attractive males with those of less attractive males. Are the children of the attractive males healthier and growing faster? If they are, it would support Wallace's idea that females make choices based on real benefits.

There is also an interesting theory from mathematician and biologist R A Fisher from the 1930s called ""Fisher's Runaway."" He suggested that if a female chooses a male with a slightly better tail, her sons will inherit that tail, and her daughters will inherit her preference for long tails. This could lead to a situation where males with the longest tails have the most mates, and the preference for long tails increases over generations. Modern computer models show that this could explain the development of the peacock's tail. Interestingly, this would also support Darwin's idea that, once this process starts, females would be selecting beauty for its own sake."
CAE_66,"**THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS**

Tom Cunliffe believes that the best boat design should mix old and new ideas. He applied this idea in his own boat, 'The Westerman'. This week, the Summer Boat Show in London is filled with beautiful yachts that use the latest technology. Most of these boats come from a major change in boat design that happened 25 years ago. In contrast, my boat is quietly resting in a tidal creek on the south coast. Although it was designed last year, it looks like it is 100 years old, which might make you think its owner is a romantic. Maybe I am, but I’m not sure.

My boat uses the charm of traditional design, but modern technology has made the process easier. However, it is important to note that advanced technology can sometimes keep sailors away from the real challenges of life at sea. These challenges are often what they wanted to experience by going sailing in the first place. I am not saying that sailors should go back to facing every difficulty. I believe it is important for my boats to have a coal stove for warmth and comfortable places to sleep. But why go sailing if every sail can set itself? Dealing with sails that flap in the wind is part of being a sailor.

Why should we change the steering position from a safe place at the back of the boat to a less secure spot near the front? Unfortunately, this change makes the cabin feel like a large room on a cruise ship, with a bed bigger than the one at home. For me, a boat should be a boat, not a house on the water.

When I bought my first boat, Hirta, to sail around Britain for a TV race series, the previous owner said it had all the comforts but no luxuries. Over time, I learned how true that was. Hirta had heavy sails, no running water, little electricity, no fridge, no central heating, no winches, and no electronics, especially for navigation. Yet, she was the easiest and kindest boat I have ever sailed.

However, classic boats like Hirta need a lot of care because they are old. When I hurt my back, I realized I could no longer take care of her. I looked for a younger boat but found nothing suitable, so I decided to build a new one from scratch. The Westerman has never let me down. Although the designer, Nigel Irens, and his assistant, Ed Burnett, are skilled with computer design, Irens first sketched this boat on a paper napkin before using a computer. After creating a model, we worked together to improve the design. The final version was perfect.

The completed boat has crossed the North Atlantic and won four out of her first six races. She looks timeless, moves beautifully in the water, and has a peaceful atmosphere inside, much of which is made from reclaimed pitch pine. This may be because she was designed purely as a sailing boat, without thinking about any furniture we might add. This traditional method works well. In her calmness, she shows that you don’t need to follow trends to be happy, and sometimes it is wise to learn from history. Built with special treated wood, she is completely waterproof. So, she has all the advantages of a fiberglass boat but still looks, feels, and sails like a real boat."

On the first day, I did nothing and slept a lot. From the second day, I started attending body conditioning classes, yoga, and other activities. The instructors are very well trained. I was surprised at how flexible I felt as the week went on. They offer many treatments, including aromatherapy, seaweed baths, manicures, and pedicures. The facial treatment lasts an hour and makes you feel refreshed. The staff in the treatment rooms were friendly and professional. The atmosphere was lively and positive. Henlow is planning to renovate this year, adding a half-size Olympic swimming pool and a Light Diet Room. Bicycles are available for riding around the grounds. If you prefer to relax, you can read a magazine or take a peaceful walk in the garden. During my stay, I felt happier and had a better appetite. I left feeling wonderful and full of energy. I would love to visit again. This is a perfect getaway for busy women. Save Room 5 for me!

**B. SHRUBLAND HALL**  
The calm and relaxing atmosphere of this stately home was clear as soon as I entered the reception area. The Hall has a beautifully decorated library, a lovely conservatory, and plenty of space, so you can be alone if you want. When you arrive, everyone gets a medical check-up, including weight and blood pressure. They called us patients, which felt strange since I am healthy. However, I was impressed that a shoulder problem found during the check-up was quickly shared with the fitness instructor, and we worked on it in group workshops and individual sessions. Each guest follows a specific diet. I lost weight without starving, but I was still hungry enough to get a bad headache on the second day. My daily menu included grapefruit and honey for breakfast, salads for lunch, and a mix of exotic fruit, yogurt, and hot broth for dinner. If you are not on a light diet, you can eat in the main dining hall, where the food is tasty and well-presented. You can have a massage or water therapy every other day. All extra treatments are reasonably priced.

**C. CAREYS MANOR**  
Careys is not a health farm and does not pretend to be one. It is a lovely old manor with cozy log fires and a spacious lounge. If you are counting calories, you might want to skip the gourmet food. The French chef prepares rich sauces and delicious desserts. Luckily, the hotel has a gym and a soft-water pool, so I could exercise after enjoying the food. (You can choose a 'health-conscious' diet if you want to lose weight.) There is a spa bath, steam room, sauna, and treatment rooms. A big attraction is the sports injury clinic. I received expert advice on an old shoulder injury. The physiotherapist suggested good posture, exercises, and massage. Careys is comfortable and luxurious, relaxed and calm. If you want to explore, there is beautiful countryside nearby.

**D. CLIVEDEN**  
Cliveden is a grand country home and a five-star hotel that treats guests like royalty. It offers health and beauty treatments, a gym, saunas, a swimming pool, tennis, horse riding, and more. There are beautiful woodland walks and gardens on the 376-acre estate. Waldo's is a famous restaurant with amazing dishes. It took me half an hour to read the dinner menu because there were so many choices. The meal was fantastic, especially the sticky-toffee pudding with banana ice cream. I went to bed very happy! The next morning, I spent a few hours in the gym to burn off some calories before my next meal. In the Pavilion, I enjoyed a facial with gentle heat and essential oils, followed by an aromatherapy massage. I thought about the other journalists' reports on fitness assessments and beauty treatments. Cliveden has everything you need if you want to stay fit before enjoying a meal at Waldo's.  
*Kay Letch*

**E. SPRINGS HYDRO**  
The best and worst thing about Springs Hydro is the carrot cake. It is the best because it is the most delicious I have ever tasted. It is the worst because it has 360 calories, which can be a problem if you want to lose weight. You have been warned! The second best thing is the wonderful aromatherapy massage. I chose a relaxing oil blend and fell asleep twice during the massage. I had the best night's sleep in years. The facilities are modern and well-organized, with luxurious bedrooms. There are many therapists and beauty rooms, so it is easy to book appointments. They offer a variety of treatments, from manicures and pedicures to deep-cleansing facials and body treatments. The guests are a mix of people, including football teams, mothers and daughters, best friends, and singles. Ideally, I would like to take a break here once a month.

CAE_22,"**NATURAL TALENTS**

In the seven million years since humans separated from chimpanzees, we have not developed many differences. Genetically, we are still more than 98% similar to chimps. This means that the things that make us different from animals are very recent. Our biological history suggests that our ability to create art and other unique human traits come from just a small part of our genes. This is a big responsibility for a few genes.

Recent studies of animal behavior show that many traits once thought to be unique to humans are now seen as differences in degree. For example, both humans and wild chimpanzees use tools. Chimpanzees use sticks to eat and as weapons, while sea otters use rocks to open clams. Monkeys also have a simple form of language, with different sounds for 'leopard', 'eagle', and 'snake'. These findings suggest that there are not many absolute differences between humans and animals, except for art.

If human art comes from a special genetic ability, it is strange that our ancestors did not create art for almost 6.9 million years after separating from chimps. The earliest forms of art may have been wood carvings or body painting, but these materials do not last over time. The first clear evidence of human art appears around 35,000 years ago with cave paintings, statues, necklaces, and musical instruments.

If we believe that our recent artistic creativity makes us different, we need to consider how our art is different from that of animals. Three main differences are often mentioned: human art is not useful, it is created for beauty, and it is learned rather than instinctive.

First, as Oscar Wilde said, ""All art is quite useless."" This means that human art does not help us survive or pass on our genes, unlike many animal behaviors. While some human art communicates ideas or feelings, this is not the same as passing on genes. In contrast, birdsong has clear purposes, like defending territory or attracting a mate, which helps them pass on their genes. By this standard, human art does seem different.

The second claim is that human art is motivated by a desire for beauty. We cannot ask birds if they enjoy their songs, but they mainly sing during the breeding season, suggesting they do not sing just for pleasure. Again, this makes human art seem unique.

The third claim is that human art is learned, not instinctive. Each human group has its own art styles that are learned. For example, songs in Tokyo are different from those in Paris. However, these differences are not in the singers' genes. People from different cultures can learn each other's songs. In contrast, some birds are born knowing how to sing their species' songs, even if they have never heard them before.

The role of learning in human art is also clear because our art styles change quickly. For example, geese have made the same sounds for 2,000 years, but human art evolves rapidly. Even casual museum visitors can tell that a painting from the twentieth century is newer than the Mona Lisa. Art experts can often identify when and who painted a work, but they might confuse two mid-twentieth-century artists named Congo and Betsy. In reality, these artists were chimpanzees. Congo created up to 33 paintings in one day and became upset when his pencil was taken away. Congo and Betsy had a show of their paintings in 1957 in London, and many of their works sold, which is something many human artists cannot achieve.

These paintings by chimpanzees blur the lines between human art and animal behavior. Like human art, the ape paintings were not created for practical purposes; they were made for the satisfaction of the painter. You might argue that human art is different because most human artists intend to communicate with others, while the apes did not care about sharing their paintings. However, this argument is not very strong, as some famous human art was also created for personal satisfaction."
CAE_39,"**An Awfully Big Adventure**

The Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last unexplored places on Earth. It is also one of the most dangerous. Charles Blackmore crossed it and lived to tell the story. There are very few big adventures left and very few heroes. Children's stories used to be about brave explorers with sunburnt skin and eyes focused on distant horizons. Today, such characters are rare in fiction and in real life. Or so I thought until I met Charles Blackmore.

Blackmore's great adventure was leading a team across the Taklamakan Desert, which means ""once entered, you never come out."" Local people call it the Desert of Death. He remembered the dangers and excitement of that amazing journey while at home with his family. His team included four Britons (one was a medical officer), an American photographer, four Chinese experts, 30 camels, and six camel handlers. It turned out that the camel handlers had never worked with camels before; they were long-distance truck drivers. This misunderstanding could have endangered everyone’s lives and the success of the expedition.

This diverse group set out to cross 1,200 kilometers of one of the world's harshest deserts, and Charles Blackmore wrote a fascinating account of their journey. At that time, he was about to leave the Army after 14 happy years. He started the expedition for fun, to fill a gap in his life, and to discover who he really was outside the Army. ""I had always thought I would spend my whole life in the Army. I was offered a promotion, but suddenly I wanted to see who I was outside of that. It was a big risk. My wife, Tina, was very worried that I wouldn’t come back since nobody had ever done that route before; we went into it without knowing what to expect. In the end, it took 59 days to cross from west to east, and the desert was surprisingly good to us.""

Anyone reading his incredible story will wonder why he used the word ""kind."" The team faced many hardships: sickness, extreme temperatures, severe thirst, and losing part of their water supply. ""But,"" Blackmore explains, ""when we were at our limits and the camels had gone without water for seven days, we found some. We didn’t experience the desert's famous sandstorms, and we never faced the freezing cold that could have stopped us completely. That doesn’t mean we didn’t face challenges all the time. The fine sand got into everything, especially our blisters and wounds. The high dunes were hard to climb for us and for the heavily loaded camels, which often rolled over onto us.""

""What pushed me on more than anything was the need to survive. We had no backup plan. Our budget and time didn’t allow for one. No aircraft ever flew over us. Once we entered the sandhills, we were completely on our own. I knew I had the mental strength for the trip, but I was very scared about my physical ability. I remember the first day — we sat at the edge of the desert, and it was so hot that it was hard to breathe. I thought, 'We have to do it now!' At that moment, I was very scared.""

If it was tough at the beginning, how did they feel at the end? ""After walking for 1,000 kilometers, you’re not going to give up. You’ve endured so much; you have come so far. We were very thin but also very strong despite our exhaustion. My body was fit, and my legs felt powerful. I could walk over anything.""

Midway through the book, Blackmore describes lying in the desert, looking up at a full moon and thinking of his family. How aware was he of how hard it must have been for them? ""Inside me, there’s someone trying to find peace. When I have doubts about myself now, I think back to the image of the desert and remember that we managed to complete that journey. I feel prouder of that expedition than of anything else I’ve done. Yet, when I think of my life’s achievements, I think of my family and the happiness we share — by that measure, the desert does not compare.""

Has Charles Blackmore found peace? ""I long for the challenge — for the open spaces — the excitement of it all. We were motivated by a sense of purpose. I find it hard now to fit into the sameness of modern life."""

Life was getting out of control for Susan Harr, so she decided to unplug her gadgets and enjoy doing things by hand. Many people love technology because it gives us amazing devices that make life easier and save us time. However, Susan believes that we have been tricked into thinking that technology is the best way to live. 

She had a bad experience with her broken word processor, which cost her a lot of money to fix. This made her question whether we really need all these gadgets. Little by little, she has stopped using some household technology as it breaks down. She wonders what kind of ""time"" technology really gives us. Does it just allow us to do more things that require even more gadgets? 

When her word processor started making strange noises, she decided to leave it outside, where it now sits quietly. She enjoys taking her time with her sewing instead of being tied to a noisy machine. Although she appreciates some gadgets, like her washing machine, she has found joy in living without others. For example, after feeling that they watched too much television, she returned their rented color TV and went back to a small black-and-white one. This change helped them spend more time walking their dog, reading, talking, and enjoying other hobbies.

One of her hobbies is sewing, and she no longer uses her old sewing machine, which has become a table for plants. Instead, she sews by hand. Many people think they cannot live without their gadgets, but Susan believes that life can be better without them. She feels sorry for those who had to do hard work without machines. 

Computers make our lives easier, but Susan finds that sewing by hand is enjoyable and relaxing. She can listen to the radio or talk with family while she sews. If the task is simple, she can even watch her favorite TV shows while doing something useful. She now enjoys sitting by the fire with a cup of tea while sewing. 

At first, she thought it was terrible for women to spend so much time sewing by hand, but now she sees it as a calming and satisfying activity. She finds that things get done quickly, and she can take her time. She also enjoys washing the dishes and daydreaming while doing it. 

Now, Susan looks around her house and wonders if they really need things like a freezer, a microwave, or an electric lawnmower. She thinks they could save a lot of money by living without electric lights too!"

Charles Hurst is a cabinet-maker who creates beautifully crafted furniture. Joanna Watt meets him in his workshop, which is located under a railway arch in East London. When I arrive, he greets me quickly with a handshake and says, ""Well, fire away then!"" It is not clear if he is always in a hurry or if he is just shy. Looking around the workshop, I see that Hurst is very busy. There are many pieces of furniture and wooden planks in different natural colors. Hurst has been a cabinet-maker for ten years and has a great reputation. He has many orders lined up for months, even though he does not advertise himself. People know that if they want a good cupboard, table, bookcase, or kitchen units, Hurst is the right person to contact.

Finding a furniture-maker is not hard, but finding one who makes high-quality furniture with simple designs is more difficult. Hurst says, ""There are few real cabinet-makers now. Many people just call themselves furniture-makers."" He is often disappointed by the quality of modern furniture. He criticizes mass-produced furniture and craftsmen who make low-quality pieces. Hurst's desire for perfection is a big part of his success, along with his talent. He is confident in his skills and says, ""I have a huge natural ability. I have always been good at making things."" Near the end of our interview, he becomes more modest and says he learned his craft by asking questions and observing.

Most of Hurst's work comes from private clients. He used to work for companies, but he found that unfulfilling. Some clients come back to him for more work, and he enjoys doing their entire house. However, he admits that not all client relationships are easy. He finds it frustrating when clients do not know what they want until it is too late. He prefers clients who are clear about their needs.

Although Hurst is proud of his work, he also respects other craftsmen. He says, ""There are people far better than me. I can admire other people."" He did not train at Parnham, a well-known furniture design college. He is critical of craftsmen who take too long to make one piece and of students who try to make their work fashionable. He believes that furniture should be practical and useful, not just a statement.

Hurst is confident and straightforward, but he is not pretentious. As I leave, he reminds me, ""After all, I am only making furniture."""
CAE_49,"**Three Theories About Sleep**

People spend about one-third of their lives sleeping. This shows that sleep is very important. However, scientists do not fully agree on why we need to sleep. There are three main theories.

The first and most popular theory says that sleep is mainly for our physical health. It suggests that while we sleep, our bodies work to repair any damage from the day and help us feel better.

The second theory focuses on learning. It claims that sleep helps us process the information we learn during the day. According to this theory, without sleep, we would not be able to learn effectively.

The third theory is about energy. It says that we need to sleep to recharge our energy, so we are ready for the next day. 

These theories show that sleep plays an important role in our lives, but the exact reasons are still being studied."
CAE_31,"**ECCENTRICS**

An eccentric is someone whose behavior is unusual and does not follow the accepted rules of society. This raises the question, ""What is normal?"" Most of us have our own quirks and strange habits. For example, someone might love entering newspaper competitions, collect beer mats, or write angry letters to the press about various topics. Eccentricity shows our individuality.

Inside us, there is often a struggle between two forces: individualism and conformity. Individualism is the desire to be unique, while conformity is the desire to fit in with others. Most people want to be accepted and liked, which makes conformity stronger than the desire to stand out. 

People with unusual hobbies or strong opinions often come together. They form clubs and hold meetings to share their interests, which others might see as strange. Being part of a group can be comforting. Many of us feel a tension between wanting to fit in and wanting to be different. Even when we follow the crowd, we may feel the need to show our individuality. For example, someone might say, ""I say what I think,"" or ""You must take me as you find me.""

At any time, we can choose to express our individuality. Many successful people have done this. Bob Dylan, an American singer, once said, ""When you feel strongly about what you are doing, pursue it without giving up. This may confuse others."" However, this strong expression of individuality is not the same as eccentricity, especially at first. 

If a pop singer wears strange clothes just to get attention, or a socialite makes shocking comments to be noticed, that is not eccentricity. But if they continue these behaviors until they become a part of who they are, then they can be considered eccentric. The key to eccentricity is that it is natural. Eccentrics do not try to be odd; they simply are.

True eccentrics are not focused on what others think. They act according to who they are. This makes them different from enthusiasts, practical jokers, criminals, exhibitionists, and recluses. These people are aware of society and often react to it. Some want to impress others, while others want to escape from society. In contrast, eccentrics live their lives without worrying about what others think."
CAE_58,"**Natural Books**

We asked four well-known naturalists to share the wildlife book that has influenced them the most.

**A. Geoffrey Lean**  
Choosing the author was easy for me. As an environmental journalist, I have had the chance to meet many important figures in this field. One of the most significant is Barbara Ward, a small but strong woman. She has been at the center of environmental issues in Europe after the war. She combined her experiences from different environmental movements into her own powerful ideas. When I was a young journalist, she helped me understand these complex topics. Choosing her book was harder. It could have been ""Only One Earth"" or ""Progress for a Small Planet."" However, I believe her most important book is ""The Home of Man."" Although its title sounds old-fashioned, it focuses on the rapid growth of cities and the big themes she cared about. It is a passionate call for what we now call ""sustainable human development."" I have read many books since, but none compare to it.

**B. Linda Bennett**  
When I read ""Signals for Survival"" by Niko Tinbergen, I can hear the calls of herring gulls and remember the smell of their droppings in the sun. This book wonderfully explains the interesting world of animal communication through words and pictures. After reading it, if you watch a gull colony, you will see that their chaotic activity is actually a well-organized social structure. You can identify which birds are partners and recognize families later in the season. Niko Tinbergen was a respected behaviorist who wanted to share his findings with everyone. His collaboration with talented wildlife artist Eric Ennion made this book special and interesting for anyone who loves wildlife. Ennion's simple yet effective paintings show how one gull can be aggressive while another is calm. This is the work of a true naturalist.

**C. Lee Durrell**  
The book that has influenced me the most is ""My Family and Other Animals"" by Gerald Durrell. This book not only led me to a wonderful husband and a career in conservation, but it also deepened my love for the natural world. I was studying animal sounds in Madagascar when I first read it. After two years of challenges, opening this book made my world brighter. It beautifully connects animals, people, joy, and nature—a small example of a world worth saving. Some people say humans are the worst because of the harm we have caused to other species. However, I remember Gerald as a boy in the book, seeing all living beings as a family, connected and inseparable. This is an important idea for everyone to understand.

**D. Bruce Pearson**  
I found ""The Shell Bird Book"" by James Fisher in my school library shortly after it was published in 1966. I was immediately attracted to it, especially to the 48 colorful bird illustrations by Eric Ennion. These images caught my attention. I already had other bird books and had spent holidays learning to identify birds. They inspired me to start sketching what I saw. But ""The Shell Bird Book"" offered much more. Along with the beautiful illustrations, it included chapters on bird migration, the history of birds in Britain, and even a chapter on birds in music, literature, and art. The wide range of information and exciting images encouraged me to appreciate birds and nature in a broader way. The book showed me that my emotional and creative connection to nature is just as important as a scientific one. Since art was my stronger subject, I began to see new possibilities for myself."
CAE_37,"**Do Reviews Sell Books?**

We asked five important British publishers about how book reviews affect a book's success. Here is what they said.

**Publisher A**  
Reviews are very important for publishers. A study showed that many people said they bought a book because of reviews, more than any other reason like ads or recommendations from friends. Authors feel differently about reviews. Both authors and publishers are upset when there are no reviews, but publishers often think that even bad reviews can help sales because they get people interested. Publishers enjoy reviews that match their own opinions about a book since they are often the first to read it.

**Publisher B**  
Publishers and newspapers both care about book reviews, but they have different needs. Newspapers want to entertain their readers, while publishers want their books to be reviewed positively. Book reviews today are better and more varied than they were 40 years ago, but many paperback books still do not get enough attention. Publishers need reviews because they are a cost-effective way to promote a book and its author. A good review from a trusted source can really boost sales, especially if there are several positive reviews.

**Publisher C**  
Reviews are essential for literary publishing. Many of the books we publish are not by famous authors, so we rely on reviews from literary editors. Good reviews are often more valuable than ads because they show that the review is not influenced by money. Publishers often say they care more about the size of the review than its content. Good reviews can help launch a book and a writer's career, but they need support from other factors like recommendations and marketing.

**Publisher D**  
The relationship between publishing and reviewing in Britain is complicated. In the United States, a single review from the New York Times can make or break a book. In Britain, bookshops often do not pay much attention to reviews. Sometimes, it takes many years of good reviews for people to notice a talented writer. Interestingly, some poorly reviewed books can still sell very well. Non-fiction reviews often focus more on the subject than on the book itself.

**Publisher E**  
All publishers and writers hope for great reviews, but do they really sell books? I once published a biography that received excellent reviews, but it did not sell well because people felt they could just read the reviews instead of buying the book. The name of the reviewer can matter. Thirty years ago, if certain reviewers liked a book, people would pay attention. Today, an unexpected reviewer or a clever review can also encourage people to buy the book."
CAE_2,"**WEATHERVANE MAKER**

The craft of making weathervanes is very old, dating back to ancient Egypt. Today, this skill is still practiced in the workshop of Graham Smith. He is one of the few people in the country who makes weathervanes by hand. Graham creates unique designs based on what his customers want. ""This way, I can make a special item just for them,"" he says. Many of his customers are women looking for gifts for their husbands. They want something unique that reflects the man's job or hobbies.

Graham's work is different from the traditional cockerel design, which is the most common type of weathervane. The first weathervane he made was not a cockerel, but a witch on a broomstick. His friends liked it and asked him to make weathervanes for them. ""I realized that there are endless possibilities for designs,"" he explains. Graham decided to focus on making weathervanes. He had trained as a precision engineer and worked in that field for 15 years. Then, he and his wife, Liz, decided to change their roles—she went to work as an architectural assistant, and he stayed home to care for their children and grow his business. This was five years ago, and he has no regrets about this change. ""My previous job was not creative, but this work is exciting and artistic,"" he says. ""I really enjoy designing.""

Graham has now created over 100 original designs. He pays close attention to detail and always gets the customer's approval on the design before he starts cutting it by hand. He also keeps many traditional designs available because they are still popular. ""People like handmade items,"" Graham says. ""They appreciate having something a little different.""

Graham does not plan to expand his business because he wants to keep it as a rural craft. ""I have found my place in the market. People love the uniqueness, and I feel satisfied when a simple shape becomes something almost lifelike,"" he explains. ""For centuries, weathervanes have helped communities understand the weather by showing changes in wind direction."" He adds that more people are moving to the countryside and want to add a special touch to their homes, which has helped crafts like his.

Graham is now busier than ever, sending weathervanes to customers around the world. He has noticed a lot of interest from buyers in America and Denmark. ""The price depends on how detailed the design is,"" he explains. His latest request was for a curly-coated dog. No matter the occasion, Graham can create a special gift."

**Beginner Takes All**

Before it was even published, *The Horse Whisperer* was the most talked-about book of the year. This first novel by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans made him a lot of money. He shares his story about his inspiration and success.

At the start of the year, Nicholas Evans was having a tough time. A film project he had been working on, called *Life and Limb*, fell apart suddenly. He was worried because it had been two years since he had earned any money, and he was in debt to his bank. A sensible person in his situation would have found a job, maybe returning to television. But instead, he made a surprising choice. He bought a ticket to America and spent three months researching for his first novel.

Although he acted on impulse, the idea for his story had been in his mind for a while. He had met a farrier (a person who shoes horses) while visiting a friend in Dartmoor. The farrier told him about a gentle horse that suddenly became aggressive. The owners were desperate until they heard about a gypsy who could calm the horse just by talking to it. These special people were called ""horse whisperers."" This story inspired Evans.

He started to research horse whisperers, thinking about writing a screenplay since he was a filmmaker. However, after the failure of *Life and Limb*, he decided to write the story as a book. During the spring, he traveled across the US, visiting ranches and learning about horses and the people who work with them. He later said, ""It was a strange time. I was watching people, but I felt alone and worried about my life. I had tried for ten years to succeed as a filmmaker, and now I was in debt and unsure how to support my family.""

By the end of August, after returning home, he had written the first half of the book. He was still worried about money and needed to know if he should continue. He showed the manuscript to a friend who was a literary agent. The agent read it and said it was ""fine."" When asked for an estimate, he suggested Evans might get $30,000 as an advance for the book. Evans thought about how much he needed to pay off some of his debts, and $30,000 was not enough. He had spent seven months on *The Horse Whisperer* and still had at least two months of work left. He was also told to write a 12-page summary of the rest of the book.

In October, he sent the first two hundred pages of the novel and the summary to seven UK publishers just before they went to the Frankfurt Book Fair. Soon, his agent called to say he had turned down the first offer of $75,000. Evans was shocked and asked, ""What?"" The agent replied, ""It's okay, I feel something good is happening.""

What happened next is now famous in publishing. Within a week of competitive bidding, the novel was sold to Transworld Publications in the UK for £550,000 and to Delacorte in the US for $3.15 million, both record amounts for a first novel. Evans and his team were amazed. They had not even sent the manuscript to New York, and they still do not know how it got there. They also did not send it to Hollywood, but soon major film studios were interested in it. Evans's UK agent worked with an American agent, who called to say, ""I think we can get $3 million for it."" They all laughed in disbelief.

That October night, Evans sat in his study while four famous filmmakers called him one after another, asking to pay $3 million for his unfinished novel. He shared this story while we drank coffee on his porch overlooking his garden. He mentioned that he had turned down an offer to write the screenplay for *The Horse Whisperer*. ""It's been like a fairy tale,"" he said. ""I don't want to ruin it. Writing at that level is very hard, and I don’t want to become just an employee of these people who have paid me so much. I would hate to write a draft and then have them say, 'Thanks, Nick, but we’ll hire someone else now.'""

He wanted to stay involved but from a distance. The success of his novel led to new support for *Life and Limb*, but he was unsure if he wanted to make it anymore. ""I think it would be foolish not to write another novel,"" he said."

**Young Masters**

Bobby Fischer is facing challenges as he tries to return to chess. Chess is now more of a young person's game. After being away from the game for 20 years, Fischer is back and playing against his old rival, Boris Spassky. Fischer won the first game, which was impressive, but he is not the same player he was in 1972. He is now 49 years old, out of practice, and not in great shape. Spassky is even older. 

Chess has changed a lot in the last 20 years. Fischer helped make chess popular, leading to a new level of professionalism in the game. Now, winning is the main goal for modern players. In international chess, a player’s nerves and stamina are just as important as their intelligence. The pressure in chess has always been high. Players use a chess clock to make sure they finish their moves in time; if they don’t, they lose the game. Nowadays, games can last longer, and many are played without breaks. This increased pressure favors younger players. Over the last 30 years, each new world champion has been younger than the last. Currently, eight of the ten highest-ranked players are under 30.

The way chess is played has also changed. Much of modern chess preparation happens off the board. Players must prepare seriously before matches, especially because computers have changed the game. A small computer can store one million chess games and provide quick access to many games of an opponent. In recent matches, players have used large teams to analyze each other’s strategies. The opening moves of a game are studied in great detail, and being well-prepared can be crucial.

Today, there are more top players than ever before, and many grandmasters compete for small prizes around the world. Success in chess requires both physical and mental effort. A single game can last up to eight hours, and players must stay focused. A moment of distraction can lead to losing the game. The chess clock adds to the stress, especially during the final moments when players have only seconds to make their moves. In these intense moments, players must act quickly and efficiently, similar to athletes.

At the highest level of chess, losing is very painful. Winning brings great satisfaction and a chance to recover from the stress. However, one win is not enough to win a tournament. Chess masters must be ready for the next challenge every day. Most chess tournaments last 9 to 11 days, with games played daily, and there are competitions throughout the year. World championship matches can be even more demanding. For example, the 1984 match between Anatoli Karpov and Gary Kasparov in Moscow had to be stopped after several months because both players were exhausted. Karpov lost about 10 kg during the match.

Can Bobby Fischer overcome these challenges? He once said, ""All I want to do is play chess."" This makes his decision to leave the chess world after 1972 seem strange. However, it also made him a legend. If he has returned for the money, he is in a good position, as both he and Spassky will earn millions from their match. But if Fischer believes he can prove he is still the best player, the outcome could be very disappointing for him."
CAE_60,"**Fame and Fortune**

Imogen Edwards-Jones interviews some new British talents, from poets to pop stars, who are on their way to success.

**A** Nick Grosso is in his early 30s and has written three successful plays. He is now turning his first play, *Peaches*, into a movie script. ""It's low budget, but we don't know how low,"" he says. ""It won't be over £30 million, but it could be as little as £30."" Nick is very talented, but what is surprising is that he had never been to a play or read one before writing *Peaches*. ""When I wrote the play, I never thought it would be performed,"" he explains. ""It's set in a car. I probably wouldn't do that now because I know the problems it can cause. I knew nothing back then."" He left school at 16 but returned a year later. After finishing his A-levels, he joined the Young People's Theatre. ""I realized I wanted to write for actors. I wanted my writing to be heard, not just read, because of the rhythm and rhyme,"" he says. ""Suddenly, I was with people who thought like me. It was the first time I enjoyed being in an educational setting. It was very inspiring.""

**B** Comedian Simon Pegg, 28, has made great progress in his career since studying drama at Bristol University. He is currently writing a TV comedy series and has just finished a tough tour with comedy star Steve Coogan. He has always worked hard. Even in Bristol, he was practicing his comedy in clubs. ""University was very theoretical,"" Simon remembers. ""It made me realize I didn't want to be a serious actor; I was always more interested in comedy. People think comedy is the hardest job, but it really isn't. If you have courage and good material, it's wonderful to make people laugh."" He has performed with the comedy group Funny Business, but his partnership with Steve Coogan has been the most successful. ""He saw my show, and since I was a big fan of his, he probably noticed I was imitating him,"" Simon admits.

**C** Ciaran McMenamin, 24, became well-known when he starred in the series *The Young Person's Guide To Becoming A Rock Star*. The response was very positive, and his career has taken off quickly. ""It's been a great opportunity for me,"" he says with a smile. ""Now I can choose what I want to do, which is what I've always wanted."" This is a comfortable position for him, especially since he has just graduated. Looking back at his early career, it's clear that he was always meant to succeed. Encouraged by his mother, he went from leading roles in school plays to the Ulster Youth Theatre, where he spent four years. ""I was basically using acting to avoid doing homework,"" Ciaran laughs. ""But then I decided I wanted to take it seriously because I had a talent and passion for it."" Now, he is waiting for the praise to come in, but when asked about fame, he becomes thoughtful. ""When you're 18, you think you'll love the photos and interviews, but you soon realize that's not why you act. It's about earning respect for doing good work.""

**D** Neil Taylor, 25, is the lead singer of the pop band Matrix, which has just signed a three-album deal with Domino Records. Neil and his bandmate Rick Brown are expected to be very successful when their single, *Chimera*, is released soon. ""The record company's idea of good sales is very different from mine,"" he says. ""They want a big hit, but I just want two people to buy it and be happy."" Unlike many new pop stars, Neil has worked hard for his success. He left school at 16 and has been trying to enter the music industry ever since. ""It's funny how things happen,"" he says. ""I had been performing at student gigs for eight years and was starting to feel tired. I was about to give up when I met Rick Brown, who had connections at Domino, and we formed Matrix. It couldn't have happened at a better time. There were times when I felt very down, and I was in some terrible bands. But hopefully, it will all be worth it.""

**E** Poet and author Stephen Richards is 27 years old and has won many awards and honors, more than most people twice his age. He is already well-known in the poetry world, where he has been touring and giving readings several times a week for the past six years. His first novel, *Hidden*, will be published in March. ""It's a story about obsessive love. It was a strong idea that I couldn't express as a poem."" Stephen loved creative writing in school but lost interest in education later. ""I decided not to go to university, but I became bored stuffing envelopes at a theater and realized I should go."" After university, he published his first work, a children's book, in 1992. ""I don't think my parents expected me to be a writer; they thought I would just be a reader because that's all I did as a child."" With his poetry receiving much praise, moving into novels is a brave step. ""My poetry has a structure, and there's less chance of making big mistakes,"" he explains. ""A novel can be any length, so there are more words that could be bad. My main goal is to avoid just producing work without caring about its quality."""
CAE_1,"**Simplified Text:**

A. Isabel, the main character in this fun novel, thinks she looks good in jeans but rarely wears them because she doesn’t want to be seen with the wrong people. She is a 31-year-old art student who loves historical romance stories. Isabel is looking for the right man but worries that her knobbly knees might stop her from finding him. Despite her worries, she remains hopeful, which helps her and others in the story. The author writes with a lively style, using chapter titles like ""Our Hero Feels Inspired,"" similar to the dramatic pace of early silent films.

B. This story celebrates the rise and near-fall of a local radio station in America. It is told from the perspective of a smart, shy child named Francis With. Francis works for WLT (With Lettuce and Tomato) Radio, a station created by Roy and Ray Soderbjerg to promote their sandwich shop. The station soon broadcasts a mix of singers, preachers, soap-opera stars, and announcers. The small-town setting allows the author to use dry humor and simple writing, taking readers back to the kinder days of the 1940s and 1950s, filled with old stores, classic cars, and radio shows.

C. In the author's world, it is normal for a second husband to talk with his wife’s first husband. When Richard Vaisey, a successful professor, falls for a beautiful Russian poet, he shares his feelings with his wife’s ex-husband. The poet writes bad poetry, which bothers Richard, and she is also trying to get help for her brother, who is wrongly imprisoned. However, the way the author tells this story is what makes it interesting. He moves the plot forward with a sense of humor and carefully examines the relationships, making it an enjoyable and clever read.

D. In 1960s London, two sets of best friends—two women and two men—become connected for 25 years through life and death. At the beginning of this long novel, James Hudson, a mysterious American businessman, is starting a newspaper, which his friend Richard Blake is editing. The newspaper launch is important, but so is the fact that a woman they both loved (and one of them married) was killed years ago. The story includes murder, ambition, love, and jealousy, and the writing is strong. This book allows readers to really get to know the characters and become deeply involved in their lives.

E. This touching and funny story is written by one of the best American authors. It follows Ian Bedloe, who feels guilty about a past mistake and decides to take care of his brother's three orphaned children. At 40, he is slowly becoming an unusual bachelor. The story explores many emotions and highlights the special bond Ian forms with the youngest child, Daphne. It is a warm book that perfectly balances sadness and humor."
CAE_53,"**Volunteer Tourism**

Four academic writers discuss international volunteer work.

A. It is difficult to say that volunteer tourists make a big difference in development. While they can help build homes or schools, they usually pay a lot of money to participate in these projects. This money could be better used if donated directly to local communities, as it could pay for more labor than one volunteer can provide. This is especially true for gap year volunteers, who often lack the necessary skills or experience. Many studies question whether these volunteers are truly motivated by a desire to help others or if they are more interested in gaining experience that will help their careers. However, these projects can help develop people who may act ethically in their future careers.

B. Volunteering can lead to better international understanding, improved conflict resolution skills, and increased participation in global issues through civic organizations. It can also help build international social networks among everyday people. In this way, the overall benefits can be greater than the individual contributions, helping both volunteers and local communities. However, if volunteering is mostly done by wealthy individuals, it may only benefit them and not the communities that need help.

C. At its worst, international volunteering can be seen as a form of charity that serves the interests of wealthy Westerners rather than the communities they aim to help. On the other hand, it can also provide valuable technical assistance for development. When done well, international volunteering can benefit both volunteers and the organizations they work with, while also allowing for the sharing of skills and cultural experiences in developing communities. Most importantly, volunteering can raise awareness about issues like poverty and injustice.

D. Volunteer tourism fits well with the growing trend of helping others. These small efforts to ""make a difference"" can seem positive, especially in a time when people are skeptical of big government and businesses. However, this approach can ignore the need for democratic government and reduce development to individual acts of charity, which may not truly change the situations of poor communities. While volunteering can be a good thing, when it is promoted as sustainable development, it can lead to misunderstandings about real development issues. The focus on volunteer tourism can distract from the serious global inequalities and poverty faced by many in developing countries."
CAE_55,"**Sound the Alarm**

Stuart Harris reports

Many of us listen to the radio in the morning, and most of us need something to help us get out of bed. This is why we have clock radios. But how do you choose a good one? A group that included myself, inventor Tom Granger, and broadcaster Paul Bridges tested five clock radios that are currently available.

One model has a 'dual alarm function', which I thought meant you could wake up to a buzzer, snooze for a bit, and then get up. However, the instruction booklet says this function is for setting two different wake-up times: one for weekdays and one for weekends. But who really lives like that? This model costs about the same as another one we tested, but it has a cassette player, which is a nice feature. You can listen to your favorite tapes to fall asleep and wake up to music instead of news. We all agreed that the radio quality was excellent, but the size is a problem; it is as big as a rugby ball. Paul Bridges mentioned that he needs space on his bedside table for his keys, wallet, glasses, and phone. He also said he always books a wake-up call just in case the alarm fails.

This model was voted the best overall. Paul Bridges said he was 'in love with it', even though the clock he tested kept getting stuck at 16:00. I liked the digital display with its nice grey numbers on a soft green background. The snooze button is wide, so you can easily tap it without opening your eyes. However, the smooth buttons made me want to touch them like piano keys, which caused problems when I finally looked at the instruction booklet. The clock has a backup battery, so you don’t have to reset it if the power goes out, which we all liked. However, we found it difficult to set up, but once we did, we felt pretty good about it.

Tom Granger thought this model, which has a built-in lamp, was 'very tacky'. He had to pull the light out of its socket to make it work, which made him question the quality of the whole thing. He read the instruction booklet twice before he could get it to work because the clock kept changing from 12:00 to 02:00. The light was hard to position; it only shines on the clock, which is already lit. Paul Bridges found the lamp idea funny but agreed that the radio was hard to tune. The buzzer sounded like an alarm on a submarine and made me want to throw it across the room. Interestingly, this model is the third most popular on the market. It is aimed at young people, with its bright colors and fun design, which appealed to both Tom Granger and me. Tom said, 'I would choose this one because it stands out more than the others.' 

The traditional controls made it the only model we could set up without reading the instructions. Unfortunately, the alarm has a funny 20-minute error margin; the manual says, 'the alarm may sound about 10 minutes earlier or later than the set time.' Paul Bridges laughed at this idea, saying the model was 'very tricky' and 'completely useless'. 

The simplest and cheapest model we tested was liked by Tom Granger because it was 'very standard and took up little space', and it has old-fashioned dial tuning. He said, 'It's easier to set up. With modern push-button tuning, you’re never sure if you pressed the buttons correctly, so you can’t be confident it will work.' He agreed that manufacturers had to improve radio quality because of button-tuning. I thought the tuning was a bit rough, as did Paul Bridges, but we agreed that the radio quality was good. The buzzer on this model worked well; it got me out of bed in just two beeps!"
CAE_50,"**Hedgehogs**

A hedgehog is a small mammal known for the sharp spines that cover its body. Hedgehogs live in many parts of the world, but they are not found in America or Australia. All types of hedgehogs can roll into a tight ball when they are attacked, which makes their spines point outwards. This is a good way to protect themselves, but it depends on how many spines they have. Some desert hedgehogs have adapted to their environment and have fewer spines, so they are more likely to run away from danger instead of rolling up.

Hedgehogs are mostly active at night and sleep during the day, often hiding under bushes or in holes in the ground. Although all hedgehogs can hibernate, not all of them do. In good conditions, some hedgehogs will stay awake all year."
CAE_25,"**Great Sportswomen on a Winning Streak**

Excelling in any sport is challenging, even for men, but women often have to work even harder. Training and competing leave little time for a normal life, so they must make sacrifices. Despite these challenges, they are overcoming prejudice and breaking records. Here, we talk to some amazing British sportswomen who are achieving their goals.

**A. Jill, 27, Skier**  
""It's a great feeling to fly through the air and land safely, but it can be scary. Sometimes I don’t feel well or it’s windy, and I can’t see well, but I just keep going. It’s hard to have a life outside skiing because we train for ten months each year. You give up a lot of your social life and friends, but it was my choice. There are six men and three women on the British team. We all compete on the same courses and get treated equally - it’s a young sport.""

**B. Caroline, 22, Cyclist**  
""Two years ago, I borrowed a bike to join a charity race. I won because I cycled faster than everyone else, which was amazing since I had never cycled before! I earn a good salary as a professional, and cycling has many opportunities for sponsorship. However, I worry that people might think I succeeded because of my looks, not because I’m a great cyclist. So, I focus on cycling instead of making money. I train for at least four hours every day on the bike, plus I do some stretching, swimming, and running. My boyfriend is also a cyclist, so he understands how much time it takes.""

**C. Annabel, 26, Rower**  
""Rowing is hard for girls to start because very few girls' schools offer it. Most girls don’t begin until they are 19 or 20, which makes it harder to succeed internationally. Also, coaches often change every year, so the women’s team lacks stability. But it’s a lot of fun, and I love being fit, plus there’s a good social life.""

**D. Ffyona, 24, Long-Distance Walker**  
""When I was 13, I dreamed of walking around the world, not realizing how big it was! I felt trapped in Britain and wanted freedom. Each walk has been different. The walk across Australia was the hardest experience for me. I walked 50 miles a day with very little sleep and many blisters on my feet. But I set a record! I had to because my sponsorship money would run out after 95 days. Some men think women are more likely to fail, so they see sponsoring us as a risk.""

**E. Lisa, 26, Saloon Car Racer**  
""Some men have big egos when they drive. When I do well, they often ignore me. Being a woman has its challenges. When I reach a corner, men think, 'I have to beat her,' so I’ve had many tough moments! You need to be competitive and aggressive. It’s hard to earn money, and what I do make goes back into the sport. Women have been racing since the 1920s and have often been seen as unusual. It’s great that more women are starting to race every year. For me, the excitement of saloon car racing is always trying to achieve a perfect lap.""

**F. Alison, 28, Triathlete**  
""I wake up at 5:30 three mornings a week to swim. I need Tuesday and Thursday mornings to catch up on sleep. In the evenings, I either cycle or run. Yes, I sometimes fall asleep at my desk! There is a lot of nervousness before a race, and when I compete, I really push myself. I don’t feel good if I don’t. I’ve often asked myself why I do this. The answers are: a) I’m happier when I stay fit, b) I would be lazy if I didn’t push myself, and c) racing is very social. Men and women usually compete together, but when events are covered in the media, 90% of the articles focus on the men’s events, and only 10% mention the women’s. The prize money is also not as good. But now we have formed an International Triathlon Women’s Commission to improve this."""
CAE_34,"**Simplified Text:**

Richard Cork remembers the day he met Picasso when he was 78 years old. Even from a distance, he could easily recognize Picasso, who was having lunch at an outdoor restaurant in Cannes. At that time, I was an 18-year-old student traveling around Europe and Morocco in an old van. I had run out of money and found a job painting boats by the waterfront. However, I spent a lot of time drawing and was lucky to have my sketchbook with me when I saw Picasso.

Picasso was known to be a private person who usually stayed away from others to work. So, I was very surprised to see him sitting at a table with his wife, Jacqueline, and some friends. Without my friend's encouragement, I would not have had the courage to go over and ask for his signature. I was nervous when I introduced myself and offered my sketchbook, but to my surprise, he agreed. He wrote his name at the top of the page and then added some lively lines below. Picasso's art often reflected real things, so those lines might have represented a cloud, the sea, or the shape of Cannes harbor.

I thanked him and started a shy conversation. Since Picasso's English was not very good and my French was not great either, an American woman at the table helped us communicate. She kept calling him ""the Maestro,"" which made it hard for me to speak freely. Still, I managed to tell Picasso how much I loved art and admired his work. After a while, I went back to my boat and proudly showed my friend what I had. But he noticed that Picasso was still having lunch and said, ""Is that all? Why don’t you go back and take advantage of this chance? He probably wouldn’t mind if you drew his portrait.""

With my sketchbook in hand, I returned to Picasso's table. I thought it was better not to ask if I could draw him, as he might say no and ruin the moment. So, I just stood by the table, set my pad against a screen, took out a crayon, and started to draw. When Picasso saw me, he smiled playfully and made it hard for me to draw. He acted out funny expressions, rolling his eyes and sticking out his tongue, like a clown. I felt like giving up, but his playful spirit challenged me to keep going. 

Eventually, Picasso relaxed and let me study him without distractions. I noticed how strong and alert he looked, wearing a blue-and-white striped shirt. He seemed much younger than his age, with bright, dark eyes that were full of life. Even though he was surrounded by friends, he seemed a bit distant and alone. He let his friends talk while he quietly focused on his own thoughts.

When the American lady told me that Picasso wanted to see my drawing, I felt embarrassed and said it wasn’t good enough. But Picasso insisted, and when I showed him my sketch, he nodded approvingly. Then, to my surprise, he said it was his turn to draw. I quickly gave him my crayon, and he made a few quick strokes on the paper. In seconds, he drew a bearded face that looked very different from my careful drawing. He had moved one of my eyes onto my nose and captured my smile with a single lively line. I looked like a character from one of his playful artworks.

I thanked Picasso and asked if he would sign my drawing. The American lady explained that he said I already had his signature. So, he had some limits to his generosity! Still, I feel very lucky to have met Picasso and to have received his attention. It meant a lot to me."
CAE_12,"**Talking Shop**

Have you ever gone into a store and ended up buying more than you planned? This text explains some of the tricks that shops use to encourage you to spend more money.

**A. The Image of Freshness**  
Supermarkets know that customers really like fresh food. To create this feeling, they often place fruits and vegetables at the entrance of the store. They might also have a bakery that fills the air with the smell of fresh bread. The colors in the store, like green, are chosen because they remind people of fresh produce. However, most of what supermarkets sell, like frozen foods and cleaning products, is not fresh.

**B. Displaying to Advantage**  
The way products are placed in a store is very important for sales. Supermarkets use computers to find out which areas of the store customers visit the most. They put high-profit items in these areas. Products at eye level are especially popular with manufacturers. Special bins with discounts attract bargain hunters. Another strategy is to place related items together, like putting salad dressings near ice cream or burgers.

**C. Spreading Staples Around the Store**  
Supermarkets often place low-cost items like bread and sugar far from the entrance. This way, customers have to walk past more expensive items to get to them. Chain stores also place popular products away from the entrance, hoping that loyal customers will search for them and see other tempting products along the way.

**D. Less Sells More**  
Chain stores have changed how they display their products. For example, the Next chain has moved away from the idea of selling many items cheaply. Instead, they create a boutique feel by showing fewer items, making them seem exclusive. Their success comes from good store design as well as stylish clothing.

**E. Tempting Totals**  
Food shoppers often pay more attention to the total cost of their shopping than to the price of individual items. Supermarkets mix low-cost staples with more expensive items to attract customers. They sometimes sell certain staples at a loss to bring people in, a strategy known as ""loss leaders."" They also get low prices by buying in large amounts or by promoting products prominently.

**F. The All-Important Price Tag**  
Customers in chain stores tend to buy fewer items and notice prices more. For example, pricing a blouse at £14.99 instead of £15 can make a difference. This strategy also helps reduce theft, as employees must ring up sales to give change.

**G. Lighting to Effect**  
Both supermarkets and chain stores pay attention to lighting. Chain stores try to use lighting that looks like natural light so customers can see the true colors of clothes. Supermarkets use special lighting to make fresh foods look more appealing.

**H. Walk This Way**  
Many chain stores use different types of flooring to guide customers. One pattern shows the paths through the store, while another marks sales areas. This strategy, called the ""Yellow Brick Road,"" encourages shoppers to follow certain routes. For example, Marks and Spencer use wood or marble for paths to lead customers to more inviting carpet in sales areas.

**I. In-Store Promotion**  
As you enter a supermarket, you might see large, colorful pictures of delicious food, which can make you hungry if you haven't eaten. In the U.S., some supermarkets are testing ""video trolleys"" that show ads for products while you shop. These trolleys aim to attract impulse buyers and can increase sales significantly."
CAE_26,"**Text: Sea, Ice & Rock**

Chris Bonnington, 58, is famous for climbing Mount Everest in 1985. He has also created new climbing routes in Britain and the Alps and has written many books, such as *Quest for Adventure* and *Everest the Hard Way*. Robin Knox-Johnston, 53, started his career at sea in the Merchant Navy. In 1968-1969, he became the first person to sail around the world alone in his yacht, Sunhaili. He also set a record for crossing the Atlantic Ocean, taking just 10 days to sail from New York to the Lizard in England. 

Chris and Robin worked together to sail and climb in Greenland, and they wrote about their journey in their new book, *Sea, Ice and Rock*. In 1979, while I was working on *Quest for Adventure*, I called Robin to ask for an interview. He invited me to join him for a sail. I could teach him some climbing techniques, and he could teach me the basics of sailing. It was my first time on a yacht. We sailed for a while and then stopped. Robin's wife and daughter stayed on the boat while we paddled to shore to practice climbing. The route was challenging, but I was impressed by how steady Robin was in difficult conditions. 

When we reached a steep drop, I asked Robin if he had ever climbed before. He hadn’t, so I showed him how to do it. After I finished, Robin politely asked if he could go down the way he used ropes on his boat. He was used to using his arms, but I wanted him to use his legs. I was not very happy about it, but he managed to lower himself down safely. During that trip to Skye, Robin and I built a strong friendship. His idea to combine our skills for a trip to Greenland was a natural next step after our voyage to Skye.

Robin impressed me as a leader. Normally, the captain makes all the decisions, but Robin asked for everyone’s opinion first. Most of the time, people were too afraid to give him advice, but it felt good to be part of the decision-making. To be honest, I found sailing difficult and boring. The moments of crisis were easy to handle because of the excitement, but spending days in the middle of the sea was hard for me. I prefer being on land and am not very handy. Robin, on the other hand, is a natural sailor and enjoyed fixing the engine or repairing the toilet. I realized that Robin didn’t really need my help, which sometimes made me feel useless.

The crew was also very close together: six people on a 32-foot yacht that was meant for four. When you are on a mountain expedition, you can get away from each other. When we reached Greenland and it was my turn to lead the expedition, I found it hard to take responsibility for Robin’s safety. There were many times when if Robin had fallen, he could have pulled me down with him. I had to be careful about that. I also underestimated how hard climbing the Cathedral, Greenland's highest mountain, would be. Robin is not a natural climber, which made his efforts even more impressive. 

The first time we tried to reach the top, we were climbing for 24 hours. On the way down, we were so tired that we almost fell asleep on steep slopes, 1,500 feet above the ground. Robin worked very hard, but he completely trusted me and just followed my lead. When it became too difficult and I realized we had to turn back, he accepted it. I knew that Robin was worried about the boat: whether it would get through the ice and if it was still okay. Still, he wanted to try climbing the mountain again.

The only time we had a problem in our relationship was on the yacht on the way home. We were taking turns to keep watch. I was supposed to wake up at 4 am for my shift, but Robin decided not to wake me because he thought he could handle it alone. The night before, I had almost fallen asleep. I felt that he didn’t trust me, which made me feel insecure, and I told him so. Robin quickly reassured me that I was misunderstanding the situation. While we enjoyed the trip to Skye, we didn’t really get to know each other until the end of the Greenland expedition. I discovered that beneath his tough exterior, Robin was a kind and sensitive person."
CAE_8,"**A History of the Apple**

Apples have been part of human life for a very long time, with many different types in various colors, shapes, and sizes. However, in the late twentieth century, we risk losing this important part of our heritage.

**Prehistoric Times (8,000 BC)**  
People have been eating apples since ancient times. In neolithic Britain, they would spit out apple seeds. Around 10,000 years ago, they left apple remains near their homes by lakes in Switzerland and Italy. In these areas, early humans even stored dried apple halves for the winter. These apples were wild crab apples, small and not very tasty, which were known in Ancient Britain as ""windings."" They were very different from the apples we eat today.

**Norman Influence (1000 AD)**  
The French learned how to grow fruit from the Romans, and this knowledge was brought to Britain. The Romans introduced some apple varieties, but many did not grow well in the British climate. After the Norman Conquest, new apple varieties became more popular. British monks continued to experiment and create new types of apples, which are the ancestors of many Western apples today.

**Medieval Apples (1200)**  
In the thirteenth century, several apple types became common in Britain. The Old English Pearmain, known for its pear-like shape, was the main dessert apple until the eighteenth century. The Costard was a popular cooking apple sold in Oxford markets from 1296 until the late seventeenth century. However, due to droughts, the Black Death, and the Wars of the Roses, apple production decreased, and more apples were imported. This changed in the sixteenth century when King Henry VIII sent his fruit expert, Richard Harris, to France to learn about apple growing. Harris returned with many new apple varieties, including the famous Pippins, and started the first modern orchard in Kent.

**Settlers and Apples (1750)**  
By the seventeenth century, apples were so popular in Britain that the first settlers who went to Canada, Australia, the US, South Africa, and New Zealand took apples and seeds with them. Captain Bligh of the Bounty brought apples to Australia, and Jan van Riebeeck took them to South Africa. The Pilgrim Fathers on the Mayflower also carried apples to America. In North America, the famous apple planter was John Chapman, known as ""Johnny Appleseed."" Born in 1774, he planted apple nurseries from Pennsylvania to Indiana. Native Americans saw him as a medicine man, and his love for apple trees and unique clothing led to many stories about him.

**Modern Apples (1850)**  
Around this time, a Quaker farmer named Jesse Hiatt in Iowa found a new apple tree growing from the roots of a dead tree. He named this apple ""Hawkey."" When he showed it at a fruit show, a judge tasted it and exclaimed, ""Delicious!"" In 1895, this apple was sold as ""Delicious"" and became one of the most popular apples worldwide.

Another famous apple, the Granny Smith, was discovered in Australia by Maria Anne Smith. She was the daughter of convicts and worked as a midwife in Eastwood, New South Wales. Known as ""Granny Smith,"" she took care of her family's farm. In 1868, she found a small tree growing from discarded fruit and transplanted it. Soon, she harvested the first major crop of green apples, which became famous worldwide. She remarked that it was like God to make something useful from what we consider rubbish, referring to both the apple and her own background.

**The Problem of Uniformity (1950)**  
Today, apples are grown all over the world, from India to Africa. However, most apples come from only a few varieties, chosen for their appearance or how well they travel, rather than their taste. This lack of variety is a problem, as it reduces the diversity of apples. While some amateur gardeners in the UK have kept old apple varieties alive, the US has lost many apple types from a century ago. Fortunately, consumers are starting to want more variety. It is important that we all work to protect the diversity of apples and other foods for everyone's benefit."

Richard Nerurkar, a long-distance runner from Britain, visits a training camp in Kenya. This camp is located ten miles south of the equator, on a mountain path that leads to Mount Kenya, the highest peak in the country. For the past three years, this beautiful but isolated place, called Nanyuk, has been my base for winter training in Kenya's Central Highlands. However, I had never trained with Kenyan runners before. On my fourth trip to Kenya, I decided to change that. I participated in my first race in Kenya and stayed at the national team training camp, where the best runners prepare for the World Cross-Country Team Championships. I was invited by the national team coach after I finished fifth in the World Championship 10,000 meters race, behind three Kenyans and a Moroccan. It was an opportunity I could not miss.

Training at high altitude helps produce more red blood cells, which improves how well the body carries oxygen. This has helped many Kenyan runners succeed. My first race in Africa was also special because it was the first international cross-country race held on the continent, in Nairobi. It was a humbling experience for me, as 41 runners finished ahead of me, and almost all of them were Kenyan. I felt I had run well, but I know that Kenyan success is not just because of the altitude. Kenyan runners have a simple and effective approach to running. They run effortlessly, eat simple food, and enjoy competing.

During my time at the training camp, I learned how the Kenyan runners train. The camp is located at St Mark's College, 6,200 feet up the southern slope of Mount Kenya, surrounded by beautiful fields and tropical plants. The living conditions are basic; the athletes share rooms with college students. Their daily routine includes three workouts: a light morning run, interval training in the middle of the day, and a steady run in the late afternoon. Each day starts at six in the morning, and we gather to hear instructions from the coaches. We were told to take it easy during the morning run because we had a tough day ahead. We ran about 40 kilometers each day, which is just under a marathon distance. On Sundays, we only ran 20 kilometers, which was a nice break from the other days.

Life at the camp was simple. We only needed a splash of water on our faces and a quick brush of our teeth before breakfast. Breakfast included tea, bread, and boiled eggs, eaten in a small dining area. Lunch and dinner were similar, with ugali (a maize dish), stew, cabbage or spinach, and tea. After running, we would drive to a stream to wash off in the evening. By the end of my stay, I had a deeper understanding of why Kenyan runners are so successful. Their success is not just due to genetics, upbringing, or altitude. I began to think that the simple lifestyle in the mountains, their hard training, and their passion for running might be the real reasons behind Kenya's success in distance running."
CAE_7,"**Text: The Challenges of Mass Marketing**

Almost everyone knows that advertising is struggling. This problem started in early 1989, before the recession really affected the economy. The decline in advertising is happening all over the world. The main issue is that advertising has not kept up with changes in the economy. Advertisers often think about large audiences and mass media, but as more brands and media options have appeared, audiences have become smaller and more specific. Even big brand campaigns should focus on smaller groups, but they usually do not.

Think about your own shopping habits. When you go to a supermarket, you might buy 30, 40, or even 50 items. Most of these items are not from advertised brands, and you may buy several of the same brand. In a year, you probably buy only a few hundred different brands. For durable goods, you might buy about a dozen brands a year. If you buy a new car, it is likely provided by your employer, and you may only buy a new one every three years. You also do not buy many clothes, and most of them are not from advertised brands. Overall, you probably do not buy more than 400 different brands in a year.

In comparison, there are about 32,500 branded goods and services that are advertised. If we ignore the 23,000 brands that spend less than £50,000 a year, we can focus on the 9,500 brands that are listed and analyzed. The average person buys only 400 of these 9,500 brands, and not all of these purchases are because of advertising. This means that about 96% of advertising may not lead to sales, but no one knows which 96% is wasted.

When you watch TV, count how many commercials are for brands you buy or might buy in the future. Most people find that only about 6% of the commercials are relevant to them, meaning that 94% of the ads may be wasted. Many people believe they are not influenced by advertising, but the truth is that most people do not buy most of the brands they see advertised. Waste is a natural part of advertising. It is unrealistic to think that every person who sees an ad will rush out to buy the product. People only remember a small number of ads and ignore the rest, so some waste is unavoidable.

However, this does not mean that advertising is not effective. Many ads have shown that they can work. Advertisers need to reach a large number of people to find the few who will respond, as they cannot know in advance who will be interested. Media advertising is a cost-effective way to communicate with many people. With better targeting, advertisers can reduce waste by reaching more people who are likely to respond, but they can never know exactly who will respond.

Even the best direct mail campaigns do not get a 100% response rate. This is a key difference between media advertising and face-to-face selling. A salesperson might succeed with every potential client they meet, but this is not possible with media advertising. If advertisers knew exactly who would respond, they would not need to use media at all; they could contact those people directly.

Any advertiser who can gain one million new customers (about 2% of the adult population) is doing well. For popular products like soap powder, the top brands would be very happy with a million extra customers. Therefore, any advertising campaign that can attract 2% of the population would be considered very successful, even though this is a small part of the population. The most effective way to reach them may still be through mass media, but for advertising to improve, it needs to be more focused than ever before."

**Solar Survivor: Charles Clover Visits Britain's Greenest Home**

In Southwell, Nottinghamshire, there are some interesting surprises. One is Southwell Minster, an ancient cathedral that many people do not know about. It is famous for its 'green' men, which are pagan figures carved by craftsmen in the thirteenth century. The second surprise is the 'autonomous house,' which is the greenest home in Britain. It was designed and built by Robert and Brenda Vale.

The Vales use rainwater for washing and drinking, recycle their sewage into compost for their garden, and heat their home using waste heat from their electrical appliances and their own body heat, along with that of their three teenage children and two cats, Edison and Faraday. The house looks traditional, with a clay tile roof, and is located 300 yards from the Minster. It was designed to match the orange brick of the town's nineteenth-century buildings and was approved by planners, even though it is in a conservation area.

When you ring the solar-powered doorbell, you will notice it is very quiet inside. The house is super-insulated, with special windows that keep out noise. Once inside, you must take off your shoes, as Robert insists on this. The house feels very calm and peaceful. On a sunny summer day, the windows are closed, and the conservatory warms the air before it ventilates the house. Robert opens clever ventilation shafts and windows to create air movement because the house is designed to be draught-proof. Even the cats have their own small air-locked door.

The Vales, who teach architecture at Nottingham University, have cared about the environment for a long time. They wrote a book about green architecture in the 1970s called *The Autonomous House*. They first designed a building that produced no carbon dioxide, and then they decided to also avoid using mains water. They created composting toilets, installed rainwater tanks in the cellar, and used copper gutters to keep the drinking water clean, filtering it before use. Water from washing goes into the garden, and they do not use a dishwasher because they believe it is wrong to use strong detergents.

Robert says, ""We wanted to show that it is possible to design a house that is much better for the environment without living in darkness."" The only medieval feature of the house is its design: the hall, which includes the fireplace and staircase, goes all the way up to the roof. The Vales do not pay water bills, and last winter, their house used only nine units of electricity a day, costing about 70p. This is much less than what other four-bedroom houses use for heating.

Soon, they will install solar water heating panels and equipment in the garden, which will help the house generate more electricity. The house will still use mains electricity for cooking and appliances but will produce extra electricity, enough to charge an electric car in the future. The only heating source is a small wood-burning stove in the hall, which they only use during the coldest winter days. 

When I visited in February, Robert was reading and said it was too warm to light the fire. The temperature on the first floor was 18°C, which is lower than what is usually expected, but he said it felt comfortable because there were no draughts and everything was at the same temperature. He compared this to an Edwardian lady who felt comfortable at 12.5°C because of her warm clothing. He suggested that people living in old houses should go back to how people lived in the past, but this idea might be hard for many to accept.

The secret of the house is that it is low-tech and simple, so there is little that can go wrong. Most materials were bought from a local builder's merchant and installed by local workers, making the house affordable to build. It cost the same per square meter as low-cost rental housing. Unsurprisingly, commercial building companies are not happy with this idea."
CAE_51,"**Text: The Camera Can Deceive**

Arthur Conan Doyle, the writer of the Sherlock Holmes stories, thought of himself as a rational and scientific person. However, in 1920, he saw photographs of fairies taken in a garden and believed they were real proof of these tiny creatures. He published these photos with an article, accepting fairies as magical beings. 

It was not until 1939 that the two women who took the photos confessed they were fake. They had simply cut out pictures of fairies from a book and placed them among flowers. The photos looked beautiful, but the simple trick showed that a basic idea about photography is wrong: that the camera cannot lie. In fact, it can, and it always has been able to. 

Today, we often use computer software to change our digital images, and it is a myth that photography ever had a time when it was completely honest. From the beginning, when cameras started capturing images, those images were being changed."
CAE_11,"**Text: Blacksmiths**

Throughout history, iron has captured the human imagination, and blacksmiths, the people who work with it, have often been seen as more than just skilled workers. Before the Industrial Revolution, blacksmiths were respected like doctors and astrologers because they made weapons, armor, and farming tools. They were also celebrated as artists. In the 18th century, blacksmiths created beautiful ironwork for St Paul's Cathedral. The elegant metalwork in French and Belgian Art Nouveau buildings was also made by talented blacksmiths.

However, by the late 1960s, the number of blacksmiths in Britain had greatly decreased because heavy industry no longer needed their skills, and modern architects rarely used beautiful wrought-iron designs. In the last ten years, there has been a revival of interest in decorative architecture and a more creative approach to interior design. Still, much of the work looks similar, with manufacturers advertising their products as ""classical"" or ""Victorian-style."" You can find trendy design stores filled with rusty candlesticks and other similar items.

Fortunately, there are new opportunities for blacksmiths, and a series of events in the coming weeks aims to promote their craft. The first event is an exhibition of forged ironwork by members of the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA), which opened last week at the Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey. Alan Dawson, the secretary of BABA, says, ""We could be at the start of a new Iron Age, because both the public and blacksmiths are seeing things differently."" Power tools have made it easier for blacksmiths to work with metal, allowing them to bend, twist, and weld it more easily. Dawson adds, ""These artists now have a material that lets them express themselves.""

About 250 pieces have been created for the exhibition, including bookends and a spiral staircase. Prices start at £90 and can go much higher. Most of the money will go to the individual makers, but a portion of each sale will be kept by the Association to promote good ironwork. Dawson's own contributions include an eight-foot gate and a lamp with a glass shade. He explains, ""My style comes from letting steel bend and flow into shape when it's hot. It's like drawing with metal in space.""

Many artists are fascinated by iron. Unlike most metals, which are soft when cold, iron and steel are tougher and more challenging to work with. Susan May, a jeweler, says, ""It's magical because it's very soft when hot, but when it cools, it becomes hard and unmovable."" Ann Catrin Evans creates mild steel door knockers and handles inspired by the dark castles often seen in horror films. One of her designs looks like a ball and chain, and another resembles a Celtic cross. She says, ""I love that steel is cold and hard, and it feels like it will last forever.""

No other metal has given people as much visual pleasure or a greater sense of security. It is likely that iron will continue to be used for decorative purposes for many years to come, as long as we can avoid seeing any more rusty candlesticks!"
CAE_14,"**Text: THE DAY I GAVE UP SMOKING**

I thought everyone would be happy when I stopped smoking, but one of my colleagues was very angry. She shouted, ""What do you mean? If it was that easy, why didn't you stop years ago?"" I found it hard to explain how I went from being a heavy smoker to not smoking at all in just a few hours. It was surprising for me too. 

I attended a stop-smoking session that was a mix of group therapy and hypnotherapy. This happened two months and three weeks ago. I had not planned to stop smoking and didn’t really want to. I felt annoyed by the constant pressure from anti-smoking groups, and I still do. I had low blood pressure and a healthy family. I didn’t cough or feel sick, and I seemed to recover from colds faster than my friends who lived healthier lives.

On that ordinary Thursday afternoon, I went to the Birmingham session of The Easy Way to Stop Smoking to write an article about others trying to quit. I said, ""I won’t be trying to stop myself; it wouldn’t be fair."" I thought it was reasonable because I really enjoyed smoking. It gave me pleasure. The counsellor seemed to understand me. We were encouraged to smoke as much as we wanted, and the room was so full of smoke that we had to open the windows.

I noticed that when I was told to smoke, I didn’t want to, and neither did the others. I think the messages about stopping smoking started to make sense to me. Just as smoking had become a challenge, the idea of quitting began to feel appealing. The thought of not being a smoker made me feel strong. It was a personal feeling that was just for me. Could I also achieve other things? 

In many ways, it was easy to stop. The physical cravings for nicotine, which felt like hunger, went away after a minute or two and lasted only four or five days. I thought my work would be hard without cigarettes, but it wasn’t a problem at all. I had believed I wouldn’t be able to meet deadlines without nicotine and that I would fail to write a story. Surprisingly, the hardest part was doing simple things at home on weekend mornings. 

I am starting to think that smoking helped me deal with boredom; having a cigarette was an activity. Yes, I do miss smoking, but not too much. Every new experience as a non-smoker is something I have to get used to—like eating out, waiting for a plane, checking into a hotel, or during a theatre break. These are all moments when I would have smoked before."

Dorothy Hodgkin is the only British woman scientist to win a Nobel Prize, but many people in Britain do not know her name. For the past four years, I have been asking friends if they know about her. If they respond positively, I know they are aware of her achievements. 

Dorothy Hodgkin deserves to be known because she made significant contributions to science. She passed away in 1994 and was a remarkable person, much like the crystals she studied. Her life shows important changes in the 20th century, such as the growth of women's education and the global nature of science.

When I started my research, I wanted to read biographies of scientists. A friend suggested a biography of Linus Pauling, who was a close friend of Hodgkin and also worked in her field. However, when I went to the bookstore, I found that there were no biographies of Pauling available. I was surprised that he was not considered interesting enough for British readers, even though he was a very important chemist and won Nobel Prizes for both chemistry and peace.

Even scientists sometimes think that biographies about scientists are not interesting. Peter Medawar, a Nobel Prize winner, once said that the lives of scientists are often dull. If scientists believe this, it is not surprising that publishers and bookstores feel the same way. This idea that scientists are less interesting than artists or writers is a common belief.

Some scientists avoid talking about their personal lives because they do not want to seem like they are promoting themselves. This can create a false image of science and may discourage young people from pursuing careers in science. However, more scientists are now appearing in public in different ways. For example, Professor Richard Dawkins presents awards on a TV quiz show, and geneticist Steve Jones appears in car commercials. These activities help people see scientists as real individuals.

The world of publishing is also changing. Scientific biographies used to be very serious and not very engaging. They often did not include much about the scientist's personal life, like their family and relationships. This changed with Richard Feynman's book, ""Surely You're Joking, Mr Feynman?"", which is both funny and touching. Recently, even famous scientists like Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, Albert Einstein, and Marie Curie have been shown with their flaws, making them more relatable.

Dorothy Hodgkin was dedicated to her scientific work. She made important discoveries, including the structures of penicillin and vitamin B12, for which she won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1964. She also helped solve the structure of insulin in 1969. Despite her busy career, she was also a devoted mother of three and had a husband who was often away due to his job as a historian. While her personal life may not seem directly related to her work, it shows how she balanced different parts of her life.

There is much to learn from her life, and her scientific work is also very important. Understanding her passion for science is a challenge for biographers because many readers may not have enough background knowledge in science. However, understanding scientific ideas is not harder than reading Shakespeare or learning a new language; it just requires effort.

It is unfortunate that many educated people do not recognize the contributions of scientists like Dorothy Hodgkin, even though they would feel embarrassed if they did not know famous writers or artists."
CAE_56,"**Text: Margaret and Her Water Finding Skills**

Margaret Wilkins is known for having a special ability, often called a ""sixth sense."" She can use a forked hazel stick to find water underground. Many farmers whose wells have dried up are now asking for her help. Along with her husband, Margaret runs a well-drilling business that uses modern tools like drilling rigs and air-compressed hammers. However, to find water, she relies only on her forked hazel stick. The couple has a success rate of over 90%.

This ability to find water, minerals, and lost objects underground is called dowsing. There are many ideas about how dowsing works, from physical explanations like magnetism to spiritual ones. One of the most believable ideas is that everything on Earth vibrates, and water vibrates more than other materials. Some dowsers believe they can feel these vibrations, while others say they can smell water, as smell is a very strong sense.

In recent years, due to drought, Margaret has been very busy, sometimes having a waiting list of almost six weeks. Most of her customers are farmers with dry wells. She explains, ""We usually see customers only once because wells last a long time."" Other customers include people with remote cottages or barns that are now holiday homes, where it is too expensive to run water pipes over long distances. There are also golf-course developers who need water for their clubhouses.

Margaret looks for water between 50 and 70 meters deep. She says, ""You can't drill a well if there is any risk of waste getting into the water supply. The water we find is in cracks of solid rock, and if we bring it up correctly, it should be clean. However, in Cornwall, there are many minerals, so we have to be careful about iron.""

Another important factor is electricity to run the pump, which can be costly if the well is far from power sources. After considering these factors, Margaret begins her search for water. For large areas like golf courses, she starts with a map and a pendulum. ""I hold the pendulum still and move it gently over the map. It will swing when it is above an area with water.""

Once she has identified possible locations on the map, Margaret walks over the fields with her hazel stick. ""When I am above water, I feel a strange sensation; I sway a little. When that feeling goes away, I use the stick to find the exact spot to drill."" She holds the two ends of the stick with both hands and pulls them slightly apart to create tension. ""When water is directly below, the straight part of the stick rises. It is crucial to drill exactly where the stick indicates. If we drill even a little off, we might miss the water.""

Margaret's husband also checks the same area. Usually, they agree on where to drill, but if they disagree, they will keep looking until they find a common spot. Margaret is not alone in her work; many anthropologists and writers have been interested in this mysterious ability. She describes it as an ""intuitive perception of the environment,"" which is the best way to explain how she finds water so accurately. If she did not have this ""sixth sense,"" it would be hard to understand how her family could continue their well-drilling business year after year."
CAE_36,"**Simplified Text: 'We Changed Lives for a Day!'**

Have you ever thought about living someone else's life for a day? It might be fun to try something different! We arranged this for four people. Here’s what happened.

**A. Amanda's Story**

I had never been in a place like this before. It was dark and noisy, with many people and a great atmosphere. It was very different from my hometown, and I wasn't sure I could handle it! Being a mother is a busy job, but this was something else! I had only fifteen minutes to learn how to carry a tray of drinks with one hand. The other waitresses made it look easy, but just when I was getting the hang of it, the drinks slipped off the tray and spilled everywhere. I felt so embarrassed, but the other waitresses laughed. Everyone makes mistakes at first!

By opening time at 11:30 am, there was already a line outside, and I started to feel nervous. I worried about remembering all the orders, but luckily, everything was automated. After a couple of hours, my feet hurt, and I couldn’t get used to the loud music. Every time a customer spoke to me, I had to say, ""Pardon?"" which was embarrassing! By the end of my shift at 5 pm, I was completely exhausted and wanted to soak my feet in hot water. I couldn’t believe it when one of the waitresses said it had been a 'quiet' day! I never realized how tiring waitressing could be. I always thought it was an easy job, but you really need to be friendly and able to handle many customers at once. I’m quite shy, and I don’t think I could manage on a busy Saturday night. I wasn’t impressed with the pay either. I must have been a bad waitress because even the rich customers didn’t tip me! I was very happy to return to my children. It felt much easier than waitressing!

**B. Cindy's Story**

I was a bit nervous about being a 'mum' for a day, but I was also excited. I had been told that Amanda's daughters were cheeky, but I thought I could manage. As Amanda left for the restaurant, I had to get the two girls dressed and fed. After dropping Sophie at school and Katie at nursery, I thought I would have three hours of peace. I was wrong! A note from Amanda reminded me that I still had to make the beds, clean the house, and do the laundry.

At 1 pm, I picked up Katie, quickly shopped at the supermarket, and took her home for lunch. But when I brought Sophie home from school, the real trouble began. They turned the couch into a trampoline and played a game that involved screaming loudly! I thought they would tire out soon, but I was wrong again. I thought I had a lot of energy, but they wore me out! After much effort, I got them to bed by about 8 pm, but then the fun started! How many glasses of water can a child drink? I knew they were just trying to come downstairs to watch TV, but it was exhausting to spend all evening negotiating with them. I never realized how tiring it could be to take care of two small children. You don’t have a moment to think about yourself, and the responsibility is overwhelming. Still, I really enjoyed the day.

**C. Rosemary's Story**

On the farm, I wake up at 5:30 am, so sleeping in until 7 am felt like a luxury! I was unsure how to dress for school. I hoped I wouldn’t stand out too much. At assembly, I looked at about 400 students and hoped I blended in. Then it was time for a math class. The children worked in small groups, which was very different from my school days when we had to recite together! I helped with a nature project, identifying and feeding snails. By lunchtime, I was tired and looking forward to a break, but teachers only have about five minutes to eat. There is so much to do before classes start again. I attended a staff meeting and ended up helping with athletics trials. After lunch, there was a silent reading lesson (which was nice!) and then a French lesson. The children wanted to practice their French with me, which showed how rusty I was! Finally, we had Physical Education. I was exhausted, but the children had so much energy. The hardest part was speaking in front of the class, even for just two minutes. Teachers may have more holidays, but I think I will stick to farming!

**D. Hilary's Story**

I arrived at White House Farm at 8:30 am, only to find out that Rosemary had been up for three hours! Rosemary's farm has 100 Jersey cows, 15 calves, and about 800 sheep. She also makes ice cream, yogurt, and cream, which are sold in shops and restaurants. I spent most of the morning in the ice cream shop, filling milk containers, making ice cream, and putting on labels. It was hard not to eat some of the treats!

At lunchtime, I checked on the sheep. I drove to one of the fields and helped a sheep that had fallen over. If sheep are left for more than 12 hours after falling, they could die, so they need to be checked every day. It must be very hard in winter! After feeding the calves, I started milking, which took two and a half hours. Rosemary does this twice a day, starting at 6 am, every day of the year! I found it quite lonely. I missed the children because animals don’t talk back! The worst part of the job is that you can’t take time off. The cows need to be milked twice a day, so it’s hard to plan any time away. Rosemary will only have about three days off this year. Farming seems romantic, but the reality is very different. The income is not steady, and I wouldn’t want to depend on the weather."

A trumpet isn't just for Christmas. It is interesting how many musicians, even famous ones, come from families without music. Hakan Hardenberger, the only son of parents who did not play music, grew up in a rural area of southern Sweden. At the age of 30, he has become a unique trumpet player in the world. His recordings introduce new music, including concertos by lesser-known composers from the baroque and classical periods, as well as new pieces.

When you meet him, he looks young and energetic, just like the sound of the trumpet. Recently, he performed the Hummel Trumpet Concerto in one of London’s top concert halls. A television program was also made about his work, filmed in both London and Sweden. Hakan was born near Malmo, and his music career began with a Christmas gift when he was eight years old. His father, who did not play music but liked Louis Armstrong, decided to give him a real trumpet instead of a toy. This gift was a great success, and Hakan never stopped playing.

His mother found the second trumpet player from the Malmo Symphony Orchestra and convinced him to give Hakan lessons. Bo Nilsson, the teacher, recognized Hakan's natural talent right away. Hakan is grateful to have had such a passionate teacher from the beginning. Bo was very dedicated to trumpet playing and always looked for new mouthpieces.

Hardenberger explains that the trumpet is a simple instrument, and it is impossible to make a perfect one. There will always be some imperfections, and no two mouthpieces are exactly alike. He believes it is important to understand these imperfections and learn to work with them. From the start, Hakan had a special ability to find the right balance and connect with the trumpet.

He humbly says that even as a child, his unique sound was already recognizable. Unlike John Wallace, a famous British trumpet player who started in brass bands and orchestras, Hakan has always seen himself as a solo artist. He admired the French trumpeter Maurice Andre and bought all his records. His parents supported his dream of becoming a professional trumpet player.

When he was 15, it was time to decide where he would study. Although Bo Nilsson wanted him to go to America, it was considered too far and dangerous. Instead, at 16, he went to Paris to study with Pierre Thibaud. Thibaud agreed with Hakan’s view that playing in an orchestra was not for him, comparing it to digging in a garden.

Hakan knew he played better than many of his peers, but it was only after his first competition at 17 that he realized he had a special talent for connecting with the audience. Thibaud suggested he enter the competition for experience. Hakan prepared only the first round pieces but made it to the second round. He was lucky to know most of the pieces in that round too. However, in the final, he faced a concerto that made him nervous. He did not win first prize, but he enjoyed the performance and realized that even if he felt he played poorly, people still listened to him.

Hardenberger’s honest view of his work might seem arrogant, but that is not true. He thoughtfully avoids trying to explain what makes his communication with the audience special, saying, ""You risk destroying it by trying to explain. The power of music is that it can always move people."""

A. The story of Tristan Smith, a citizen in the made-up republic of Efica, is a powerful tale about human power, history, and humor. The author skillfully creates a world with its own history, traditions, and customs. The book is also known for its humor and the author's unique perspective, combined with deep psychological insights. It is a challenging but rewarding read.

B. Harriet is a confident middle-class woman with an architect husband and her own business. Normally, she would not have met Sheila, a traditional working-class woman who cares for her elderly father and has raised her grandson, Leo, since he was three. Their lives change dramatically when Leo violently attacks Harriet's son, Joe, in the street. After the court case, both boys refuse to discuss what happened. Leo, who had always been a good student and never fought before, cannot explain his actions, while Joe physically recovers but becomes withdrawn. Harriet is deeply affected by her son's situation, and caring for him takes over her life. Sheila feels so guilty that she asks to meet Harriet, leading to an unusual friendship. The author excels at showing how people respond to major changes in their lives and captures the mother's feeling that she can never do enough for her son.

C. This book, which was shortlisted for the Booker Prize, tells the story of one of the most isolated Scottish Orkney islands and its people over a long and quiet history. The narrative is set against important moments in Scottish history, imagined through the daydreams of a young boy named Throfinn Ragnarson. He suddenly disappears in the story but returns after World War II, having learned to appreciate the simple lives of his ancestors.

D. After his recent big success, the author has written a sequel that carries the same gentle humor and sharp observations of family life that made the first book popular. Fifteen years after her daughter's death, Aurora Greenway is approaching her seventies with her lively friend, Rosie Sunlap. Aurora's way of living remains a mix of vanity, charm, and reluctant kindness, while Rosie supports her in her entertaining manipulation of friends and suitors. By the end of the book, Aurora must face the passage of time and the arrival of a new generation. The author skillfully reveals the sadness that lies beneath the ordinary moments of life, focusing more on the shadows than the bright spots of human experience.

E. Six very different people are brought together by millionaire Logan Urquhart to sail around the South Pacific islands on his yacht, the Ardent Spirit. The author uses beautiful descriptive language to explore the personal journeys of self-discovery that each sailor experiences, returning home with renewed spirits after their time at sea. The author uses striking images to express themes of memory and awareness, which can be both isolating and enlightening."
CAE_20,"**Take Five Careers**

Rebecca Cripps meets five women who talk about their different jobs: the good parts, the bad parts, and what a typical workday is like for them.

**A. THE BRAIN SURGEON**  
**Name:** Anne  
**Age:** 34  

**ANNE'S DAY**  
""I wake up at 6:30 am, go to the gym at 7 am, and arrive at work by 8 am. I start surgeries at 8:30 am. I perform surgeries all day on Mondays and Wednesdays, and sometimes on Friday afternoons. Most brain surgeries take about three hours, but some can last all day. There are times when I work for ten hours without eating or taking a break. Deciding when to operate can be stressful. I don’t feel stressed while I’m operating, but I sometimes worry about the next day. Brain surgery is often a last option for patients, but when it is successful, it feels amazing, which makes up for the times it doesn’t work. From 10 am to 1 pm, I see outpatients and explain the surgeries to them. I enjoy this and find it easy to talk to patients. If they get upset, I try to comfort them, but time pressure can make this hard. I usually leave work between 6 pm and 8 pm. Some nights and weekends, I am on call, and I always carry my pager. When I’m on holiday, I worry for the first few days about my patients, and I often dream about operating. I find it hard to relax.""

**B. THE SENIOR DESIGNER**  
**Name:** Marita  
**Age:** 31  

**MARITA'S DAY**  
""I wake up at 7:45 am, leave home by 8:20 am, and take the train to work, arriving at 9:15 am. On Mondays at 10:30 am, we have a meeting to discuss our work and any problems. I work in a team with three senior designers, a partner who oversees everything, and a junior designer. My work is mostly about production, with only 10 to 15 percent being design. I receive a brief from the client, and if they have clear ideas, I spend three to four weeks designing and developing the project. After that, I present my ideas to the client. Once they agree, we create budgets and I start hiring photographers and illustrators. I also work with printers to ensure everything is done on time. I spend a lot of time managing people, and it’s important to communicate well. When their work comes in, I put everything together and send it to the printers. Managing several projects at once can be very stressful. Deadlines are always close, and my day is never the same. I have lunch at 1 pm for an hour, and we often go to the pub. If the client likes my designs, it feels great, but it’s disappointing when a project gets rejected. I usually get home by 7:30 pm, but sometimes it’s 8:30 pm or later. I find it hard to relax when I’m busy.""

**C. THE CHAUFFEUR**  
**Name:** Linda  
**Age:** 42  

**LINDA'S DAY**  
""I usually wake up around 7 am, but on two or three mornings a week, I wake up between 4:30 am and 5 am to meet long-haul flights. At 10:30 or 11 am, I might go for a bike ride or swim. Since chauffeuring is a sitting job, I have to be careful about my diet and exercise. I usually have a big breakfast and just snacks during the day. People often ask me for recommendations for restaurants or shops, so I need to know the area well. Many jobs are pre-booked, which allows me to plan my routes. Not all passengers are polite; some can be rude. However, most are well-behaved, and I have a good relationship with my regular clients. Sometimes I hear conversations in the car and have to focus on driving. I work seven days a week, up to fifteen hours a day, so I need to be careful not to get too tired. I try to go to bed by 11 pm.""

**D. THE LANDSCAPE GARDENER**  
**Name:** Tracy  
**Age:** 27  

**TRACY'S DAY**  
""I wake up around 7 am, leave home at 7:30 am, and go to my first job. My assistant and I mostly maintain gardens we designed. We do some commercial work, but most is in private gardens. We spend about an hour and a half at each house. Around 11 am, we get hungry and go to a local café for a big breakfast. In summer, I may work until 10 pm; in winter, until 4:30 pm. I have an office at home, so when I return, I check messages and return calls. If someone wants their garden designed, I usually set up a meeting in the evening around 7 pm or 8 pm. We focus on using old materials to make gardens look historic. Sometimes clients have very specific ideas, which can be challenging. However, it’s very rewarding to see a garden we created bloom. I find it hard to relax in the evenings because I can always hear the phone ringing for business. I sleep well because my job is physically demanding, and I’m always tired at the end of the day. I may not be very strong, but I am fit. It’s a tough job, but it allows me to be creative.""

**E. THE CIVIL ENGINEER**  
**Name:** Zena  
**Age:** 27  

**ZENA'S DAY**  
""I arrive at the construction site by 8:30 am. I am the assistant resident engineer, overseeing the building of bridges and a retaining wall. I check that the contractors are following the schedule and safety rules while minimizing environmental impact. I help coordinate the site workers and solve any problems. The contractors start work at 6 am, so my first task is to find out what happened since I left the night before. The rest of my day depends on what I learn from the clerk of works. I usually have paperwork to review or design questions to answer. I take a half-hour lunch break between 2 pm and 2:30 pm, but I often eat while I work. The contractors have set meal times, so when they are eating, I can check things on site. Since we check their work, it can create tension, so we need to maintain a good relationship. I see the duty resident engineer once a day, but if something urgent comes up, I act immediately. I usually leave the site around 6 pm and am on call all the time."""
CAE_40,"**Careers: Six People Talk About Their Typical Working Day**

**A. Credit Card Executive**  
I wake up at 6 am and get to the office by 7:30 am. I manage programs for our credit card users. My job includes launching and managing the Membership Rewards scheme in major European markets. I keep in touch with current card users, find new ones, and build relationships with partner companies. I spend the first 45 minutes organizing my day and then respond to emails. I handle advertising for the membership program across Europe, so I meet with marketing staff and advertising agencies to create strategies and plan future projects. I have meetings most of the day, but I keep my door open for anyone who has questions. I travel to different markets in Europe once or twice a week to discuss any issues. When I’m in London, I usually leave work between 6:30 pm and 7:00 pm.

**B. Record Company Executive**  
I arrive at work by 10:00 am and go through the mail, which includes ten to twenty demo tapes, letters from producers, concert information, and invoices from musicians and studios. The phone starts ringing around 10:30 am with calls from producers and publishers, and I have meetings throughout the day to discuss campaigns or projects for artists. When I listen to demo tapes, I know that people are sharing their hard work, so I try to give helpful feedback. Once I sign a band, we start working on their first album, choosing songs, a producer, and additional musicians. I also share my vision for the album with the marketing team. I manage budgets and spending. I leave work by 7:00 pm at the earliest, and most evenings I go to concerts, sometimes seeing up to five new groups in one night. I often don’t get home until 1:00 am, when I listen to a record to relax.

**C. Sales Director**  
I wake up at 8:00 am and drive to work, arriving by 9:30 am. I open the mail, check the schedule for client meetings, and wait to see who comes in. I enjoy showing people around the showrooms and helping them buy furniture. We sell antiques that cost between £1,000 and £6,000, and we buy from auctions, private clients, and overseas. Many items need restoration, so I work with restorers and other specialists. I read the Antiques Trade Gazette while drinking coffee to stay updated on the business, and I often visit the Victoria and Albert Museum to compare furniture. I handle accounts once a month and do tax returns every three months. I go home at 5:30 pm, and it usually takes me about an hour to relax.

**D. Air Traffic Controller**  
I work on a set shift schedule. On early shifts, I leave home at 6:00 am. I start my shift at 7:00 am, taking over one of the control positions in the tower. We have a rotating schedule, so I work for about an hour and a half at one station, take a break for half an hour, and then switch to a different station. The air traffic controllers, a supervisor, and the watch manager work closely together to manage aircraft movements. In winter, we handle about 1,000 movements a day, and even more in summer. Night shifts are quieter, and I often read about new air traffic rules between 12:00 am and 4:00 am. This job can be stressful, and I find it hard to relax after a shift. I hope to become a watch manager and eventually the general manager of the airport.

**E. Shop Manager**  
If I have an early shift, I leave home by 8:00 am. The first thing I do is start the electronic point-of-sale system. I make sure someone is watching the cash register and coordinate lunch breaks for the staff. In the morning, I help customers find and order books. I enjoy serving customers, but it can be frustrating when they come in with reviews and expect me to gather many books quickly. From 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm on weekdays, publishers’ representatives visit, and I discuss new titles for the upcoming months. I need to think about how many copies we might sell. When we want to feature a new title, I ensure it arrives on time. My early shift ends at 5:45 pm. Two days a week, I work a late shift, and then I close the computer system, lock up, and go home.

**F. Financial Analyst**  
I listen to the news at 7:00 am, then get up and take a taxi to work, arriving by 8:45 am. I contact freelance reporters to find out what is happening in my area. I assess financial risks for multinational companies operating abroad, so I warn clients about potential problems. I provide three services: an online executive preview, a security forecast, and a travel information security guide. From 9:15 am to 9:30 am, I meet with editors to discuss the stories I will follow. My first executive preview must be online by 10:00 am, and my second by 11:00 am, so I need to work quickly. I write the stories, send them to my editor for approval, and then make any necessary changes. I travel to Africa about three times a year to report on events and stay updated. I leave work around 6:00 pm, and it’s hard to relax, so I often stay awake until 1:00 am."
CAE_45,"**Career Power: Take Control at Work**

**A. What Makes a Good Leader?**  
A good leader inspires others and helps create change. Leadership is not about being tall or just being smart. According to Pat Dixon, author of *Making the Difference: Women and Men in the Workplace*, leadership is about ""making things happen through people who are as enthusiastic and interested as you are."" Enthusiasm is very important, and a good leader should be able to express their ideas clearly and confidently. Dixon says it’s about having the confidence to say ""I believe"" instead of ""I think.""

**B. Potential for Leadership**  
John van Maurik, who runs a Leadership in Management course, believes that most people have more potential for leadership than they think. Becoming a leader means recognizing and developing your hidden talents. In a way, we are all born leaders; we just need the right environment to grow. While it’s easy to see leadership in famous figures like Emmeline Pankhurst or Mahatma Gandhi, it can be harder to see it in our own workplaces. However, leadership is now seen as essential for good management.

**C. Good vs. Bad Bosses**  
Think about the best and worst boss you have had. They might have been good at setting goals and meeting deadlines. But how did they achieve these goals? A good leader motivates and supports you, while a bad leader makes you feel unimportant and blames you when things go wrong. The first one leads well; the second one just manages poorly.

**D. Leaders vs. Managers**  
Leaders and managers are different. Managers like to work within set rules, while leaders create new opportunities. Micheal Shea, author of *Leadership Rules*, writes that a good manager can keep a company running smoothly, but a good leader can change a discouraged organization, whether it’s a business, a sports team, or a country.

**E. Improving Your Leadership Skills**  
Whether you are a boss or a middle manager, you can improve your leadership skills. Here are some tips:  
- Leadership works best when you choose to do it. Find out what you are passionate about. When you feel inspired to lead, use that energy to take action.  
- Start seeing yourself as a leader. Your ability to lead is an important part of who you are.  
- Collaboration is good, but sometimes strong leadership is needed. Try different styles. If you usually ask others for their opinions, try taking the lead instead. Notice how this changes the results.  
- Set goals and strive to achieve them. Look at your job demands and see where being a leader can help you succeed.

**F. Developing Leadership**  
- Leadership does not just happen; it develops through taking the lead, taking risks, and learning from mistakes. Learn to delegate, motivate, organize, and give feedback.  
- Don’t assume everyone will immediately accept your way of leading. Keep improving your communication skills. You don’t need to be liked, but your ideas should be respected.  
- Be visible and approachable to important people. Remember, you don’t have to lead all the time. Know when your contribution is essential and how you can help others become leaders too."
CAE_64,"**Text: Films on Video - Film Critic Nick James Reviews Recent Releases**

A. **Abyss**  
Before *Titanic*, director James Cameron created this tense Cold War thriller about oil workers and navy experts trying to rescue a nuclear submarine deep underwater. The friendly banter and brave attitude of foreman Bud and his team remind us of tough heroes in movies by Howard Hawks. The film's design and special effects are very impressive, but the dialogue and character development are weak. Despite the skill in making the film, the story feels like a typical B-movie.

B. **The Thin Red Line**  
This video release of the James Jones novel about the battle for Guadalcanal, directed by Andrew Marton, offers a different view compared to Terrence Malick's new film. While Malick's version is mystical and poetic, Marton's film is more traditional, focusing on one soldier and his difficult relationship with his tough sergeant. Malick's film is richer and more complex, but Marton's version has its strong moments, especially a flashback where the soldier dreams of his wife, which is portrayed more harshly than Malick's softer imagery.

C. **On Guard**  
This film, loosely based on Paul Feval's 1875 novel, is a fun swashbuckler that stands out among musketeer stories. Fabrice Luchini plays a clever villain who causes chaos behind the scenes. Vincent Perez is a lively hero, though his role is short. Daniel Auteuil, while a bit too serious for a light film, also has his moments as a swordsman. The filmmakers use familiar costume-drama clichés with so much humor and charm that it doesn't matter.

D. **Character**  
Set in early 1900s Rotterdam, this film tells a serious story. The detailed production and costumes make it look like a museum piece. Jan Decleir plays the harsh bailiff Dreverhaven, who is cruel when evicting tenants. His troubled relationship with his son is central to the story, but the filmmakers focus too much on the period details and not enough on the dark themes.

E. **The Good, the Bad and the Ugly**  
This newly re-released video shows off director Leone's skills. The sound editing is particularly impressive, making every sound clear. The story is harsh, and whenever it slows down, Morricone's powerful music brings excitement back. Morally, there is little difference between the good (Clint Eastwood), the bad (Lee van Cleef), and the ugly (Ell Wallach), as they all act ruthlessly in the post-Civil War West.

F. **The Longest Day**  
The publicity for this three-hour war epic boasts ""Forty-eight International stars."" With four directors and 23,000 extras, it feels overdone. The early scenes, where battle-hardened veterans wait for news about the invasion, drag on for both the audience and the soldiers. While it is impressive in terms of logistics, it is best experienced on the big screen. Watching it on video does not do it justice."

**BOOK A** Steve Martin's *Compelling Evidence* is indeed very interesting. The story is about a lawyer who is trying to start a new practice after leaving a powerful law firm. He ends up defending his boss's wife when she is accused of murdering her husband. The trial scenes are exciting, and the outcome is uncertain until the end, with a surprising twist in the final pages. This is a great first book in a popular genre.

**BOOK B** *Curtains for the Cardinal* starts with a strong beginning and follows Sigismondo, a problem-solver for the rich people of the Italian Renaissance. He gets involved in a mix of politics, church secrets, and serious murder, but we are confident he will find out who is guilty. The plot is complicated, and the book is a bit too long, but it is still very enjoyable.

**BOOK C** *File Under: Deceased* introduces a new detective from first-time author Sarah Lacey. Leah Hunter is a tax inspector who seems ready to investigate when a strange man suddenly dies in front of her. Despite facing challenges and the disapproval of a handsome local detective, brave and skilled Leah is a strong character.

**BOOK D** *Double Deuce* by Robert B. Parker features Spenser, a smart private investigator, who helps his friend Hawk get rid of drug dealers in a poor area of Boston. The dialogue is quick and clever, and while there are not many deaths, there is more thinking than usual. It is high-quality entertainment, as always from Parker.

**BOOK E** *False Prophet* by Faye Kellermann features her regular detectives, Pete Decker and Marge Dunn, who investigate an attack and robbery at the home of a famous film star's daughter. The author's easy writing style and attention to unusual human behavior make this an enjoyable mystery.

**BOOK F** Diane Henry and Nicholas Horrock, a husband and wife team, write together. *Blood Red, Snow White* features another lawyer and a female client, but the action takes place outside the courtroom, and the lawyer becomes a victim as the story unfolds. The book combines romance, money, and violence to create an exciting suspense novel.

**BOOK G** *Dead for a Ducat* by Simon Shaw features actor Philip Fletcher as a target. A funny group of characters comes together to film a story about Robin Hood, but Philip feels this is not the right direction for his career. Simon Shaw usually entertains, but this time, the shift from dark comedy to farce is not as strong as his usual work.

**BOOK H** *Fall Down Easy* is Lawrence Gough's best book in a while. Canadian police are searching for a clever bank robber who targets female bank tellers. The slow build-up of tension and the portrayal of the smart, troubled robber make this book stand out from typical detective novels."

I might be too old for this adventure, but here I go! At 34, Tim Pozzi has left a good job to go backpacking. He thinks about why he and others his age are making this choice. This summer, I quit my job and decided to rent out my flat to travel in South East Asia for a year. You might think I'm lucky, but I'm 34 years old and feeling nervous. I have traveled before. After university, I spent two years backpacking in North and South America, and I promised myself I would do it again someday. But then I fell in love, started a career, bought a flat, and got used to earning a salary. I slowly realized that I was giving up my own happiness for my job. When I handed in my resignation, it felt like I was taking control of my life again. 

I have no ties now. Many of my friends are married with children, and while they wouldn’t want to change places with me, they envy my freedom. I’m not in a relationship, and I don’t have strong career goals. I feel I should make the most of my freedom, at least for my friends! But why am I so nervous? First, I need to make all the arrangements. How can I let someone else live in my home? How do I organize the rental? And I still need to decide where to go. I tend to procrastinate and am already behind my planned schedule. I thought, “I might as well enjoy the summer in England,” and then, “Why not wait for the start of the football season?” 

Ending emotional ties makes it harder. I’m delaying because I wonder if I can still handle backpacking. Will I be able to adjust to a simpler way of life? Will I feel out of place among younger backpackers? Maybe not. I’ve noticed that more Britons in their late twenties and thirties want to break free from their lives and travel abroad. Jennifer Cox from Lonely Planet says that more people are realizing that adventure is possible: “People who always say, ‘I wish I had that opportunity’ are now understanding they can have it anytime. They just need to be brave, organized, and confident enough to do it.”

For Danny, a 30-year-old accountant, and his girlfriend Tammy, a 28-year-old teacher, this trip is a chance to enjoy life before settling down. They bought a round-the-world ticket for a year. Danny says, “I’m willing to give up job security for this trip. There’s always a worry that I won’t move up in my career when I return, but I think it’s a risk worth taking. When I left the office, I threw my calculator into the river as a sign of defiance!” 

For Matt, who just left the Army, traveling for a year was a time of change. “In the military, there’s a strict way of doing things. I needed to change that to live well as a civilian.” There are many reasons for people my age to travel, but some common factors exist. Angela Baron from the Institute of Personnel Development says, “Today, we have a more flexible workforce. Many people work on short-term contracts, so if your contract ends, you have nothing to lose.” Larger companies are even allowing career breaks. “If you’ve invested time and money in training someone, it’s good to know they’ll return instead of going to a competitor.”

Dan Hiscocks, managing director of Travellerseye, a company that shares stories of ordinary travelers, says more thirty-somethings are reevaluating their lives. “If you’re not happy with your job—and many people aren’t—it’s no longer just about sticking it out. Now people know that opportunities exist and that a job isn’t forever. Travel gives a chance to reflect and think about life.” 

Is wanting to travel just another sign that my generation struggles with adulthood? Jennifer Cox doesn’t think so. “It shows a better-educated, more stable society where we care less about paying bills and more about living a balanced life. We’re taking the time to ask, ‘Is this what I want?’” Ben, a 32-year-old picture researcher going to Central America for a year, believes he’s not running away. “I’m running towards something. I want to grab the things I want for myself.” But he feels nervous about leaving his comfortable routine—going to the office every day, saying “hi” to everyone, and having coffee.

I share Ben’s worries about leaving a stable life with few challenges, and I’m not sure I would be going on this journey if I hadn’t found my boss so difficult. As Jennifer Cox points out, “This is common. There’s often a trigger, like a breakup or losing a job, that pushes people to travel.” It may have taken a push to get me moving, but I’m now looking forward to the next 12 months with excitement. No matter what happens, I’ll be proud to have taken this step. I believe many of us older backpackers feel the same way."
CAE_42,"**Text: Plugging in at Home**

Georgina McGuiness took a long break from journalism and felt out of touch with new technology. In this text, she shares how she changed her home into a productive workplace.

The Christmas before last, I turned 37 and realized that I needed to revive my journalism career. I felt like my skills were outdated, stuck in the 1980s when typewriters were common. I noticed that many job ads required experience in desktop publishing, which I didn’t have. I thought I would have a better chance of hosting a seminar on nuclear physics than learning to use a computer for layout. I was known as the family technophobe; even using a pocket calculator was difficult for me, and I still didn’t know how to use the timer on the video.

I knew I had to act quickly to improve my skills. I thought leaving home before my children would be hard, but then I entered a competition in a local newspaper. To my surprise, my family won a computer package. We received a laptop for my husband and a personal computer for the family. We jumped into this new world of technology, and terms like cyberspace, Internet, and surfing became part of our everyday language. We started chatting online with people from around the world. The children stopped watching TV, and I set up a small office in the kitchen with a phone, a fax machine, a CD-ROM, and a modem to connect to the Internet. I had everything I needed to work from home while still taking the kids to school.

My children were already comfortable with computers from school, but I was nervous. I worried that I would lose my work if I pressed the wrong button. However, I learned the basic skills I needed. It turned out to be logical and easy. With practice, I improved a little each day. I recently started freelancing for a magazine, writing about two articles a month, and I feel proud that I have the best of both worlds.

How has the computer helped me? In school, I always worked at a messy desk and often lost important papers. The computer has made me more organized, especially with office tasks. I can keep track of income and expenses using spreadsheets, and ready-made invoices and letterheads save me a lot of time. As a journalist, being online allows me to research stories, ask for information in forums, and discuss the pros and cons of working from home with people worldwide.

However, there are some downsides to working from home. I can feel isolated without face-to-face contact. There are also distractions, like household chores, and when the kids are home, we sometimes argue over who gets to use the computer. Still, many people are buying multimedia PCs not just for education and entertainment but also for convenience, avoiding the daily commute to the city.

As we move into the next century, what defines home workers? A report called PC Usage in UK Homes describes the typical computer user: they are around 38 years old and well-educated; 93% own a personal computer, 32% have a CD-ROM, 38% have a laser printer, and 50% have a modem. Considering this, I feel I am ahead of the game. Who knows, one day I might be emailing a column to a newspaper in Melbourne or even publishing my own magazine from home. The possibilities in cyberspace seem endless."
CAE_59,"**The Tartan Museum**

The modern buildings of Scotland's national museum look very different from the historic city of Edinburgh where it is located. But are the exhibits inside just as impressive? Sally Varlow visited the museum just before it opened.

You cannot miss the new Museum of Scotland. It stands out on the corner of Chambers Street in Edinburgh, with its large yellow sandstone tower and unique buildings, which are shaped like cheese wedges and have a hanging garden. Last winter, people had mixed feelings about the building. Some called it a ""masterpiece"" or ""stunning,"" while others were more cautious or even negative. Now that the inside is almost ready for visitors, the exhibitions may face similar opinions.

The museum does tell the story of the nation and has a timeline to help visitors understand the displays. However, it does not let its important treasures, like Mary Queen of Scots' jewels and silver from Holyrood chapel, be overshadowed by national pride. The main question is whether people will find the museum interesting enough to return. Dr. David Clarke, the head of exhibitions, believes that visiting should be a fun and visual experience, designed for everyone, even those with little knowledge of history.

Dr. Clarke is strict about what is displayed. He does not want imaginary scenes from the past, as he believes they give a false idea of history. He wants the public to see the truth. This means that what visitors see is based on what experts know. However, the challenge is whether the stories of the objects can be told clearly using explanation panels, captions, and multimedia, with only about 30 computers in the museum.

Just before the opening, it is still hard to tell how effective this will be. Some things are clear, though, like the stunning views of Edinburgh Castle. Inside, visitors will notice a series of galleries that connect to each other, each with different sizes and shapes. The walls are light-colored and designed to look like large stone blocks, with deep display cases. Natural light comes through narrow windows and roof lights, creating a space where visitors can enjoy each item on display.

Thanks to a group of children aged 9 to 12 from all over Scotland, the museum also has a Discovery Centre. The children wanted to be able to interact with the displays. Although they did not get that, they did create a special hands-on area for kids in what was supposed to be a temporary exhibition gallery. As a result, the Twentieth Century gallery on the top floor is the only temporary exhibition. It will change every three years and features items chosen by Scottish people that have had a big impact on life in Scotland during the twentieth century. Suggestions included an electric guitar, televisions, thermos flasks, and favorite toys. While this idea is fun, it may not address more serious topics.

Overall, Dr. Clarke is correct when he says that ""objects open windows on the past more vividly than anything else."" As for the modern architecture, it looks great from the inside and the top, but whether it fits well in its location is still up for debate."
CAE_54,"**Text: The Future of Newspapers**

The idea of change can be both comforting and scary. Change means moving from one place to another, but the change for newspapers moving online is uncertain and difficult. Many people believe that this change will happen eventually. It is clear that print newspaper sales are falling, while visits to their websites are increasing. For example, newspapers like The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian have seen their print sales drop by 8% to 10% each year, but their online traffic keeps growing.

However, there are some surprising facts. A recent survey showed that global newspaper circulation actually increased by 1.1% last year, reaching 512 million copies a day. While sales in Western countries have decreased, Asia has seen growth. News magazines, which many think would struggle in the digital age, reported a 5.4% increase in sales.

The same trend is seen in books. E-readers like Kindle are becoming very popular, with sales rising significantly. Yet, when bookstores looked at the sales of physical books over the last six months, they found only a small decrease of 0.4%. This suggests that people are enjoying both digital and print formats.

The idea that young people are no longer reading newspapers is not entirely true. Recent surveys show that nearly 5 million people aged 15 to 35 still read major national newspapers. Different countries have different trends. In Britain, print sales have dropped by 10.8%, but in Germany, the decline is only 7%, and in France, it is just 3.1%.

Media experts once believed that online advertising would support the shift to digital newspapers. However, digital ad revenues are now falling, and many US newspapers have started charging for online access. The best way to attract paying readers seems to be offering both print and digital subscriptions together. Print newspapers still play an important role in selling online subscriptions, as they generate much more advertising revenue than online ads.

Maintaining both a print edition and a website is challenging and costly for newspaper companies. However, print newspapers still have a strong presence, and being noticed online is much harder."
CAE_32,"**Photographing People**

People are the most interesting subjects for photography. A photo with a person is usually more engaging than one without. However, photographing people can be challenging. Besides technical skills, photographers must pay attention to actions, gestures, and expressions. The presence of a camera can sometimes make people act differently.

**A. Grouping People**  
When taking group photos, avoid straight lines. Ask people to stand at different angles and distances. If possible, have some people sit or kneel in front so all faces are visible, or raise your camera to get a better view.

**B. Posing for Pictures**  
People often feel stiff in front of a camera. Help them relax by suggesting comfortable positions, like folding their hands or putting them in their pockets.

**C. The Right Approach**  
Do not pretend you are not taking a picture when it is obvious. This can create tension. Most people will agree to have their photo taken, even if they hesitate at first. They may feel self-conscious, so you might need to guide them. A photo can be less interesting if the subject looks away from the camera.

**D. Eye Contact**  
A photo is more powerful if the subject looks at the viewer. Ask them to look into the lens, but they don’t have to smile. They might not be able to do this for long, so remind them just before you take the picture. You can also say something funny to get a natural reaction.

**E. Candid Concentration**  
Instead of looking directly at the camera, the subject can focus on something else in the picture. This can make them feel more comfortable, and it gives the impression that you are capturing a moment without them noticing.

**F. Expressions and Gestures**  
Expressions and gestures tell us a lot about a person. For example, a laughing child can make viewers smile, while a sad face can evoke sympathy. Look for common expressions like shrugs, winks, or smiles; they are a quick way to communicate feelings.

**G. Situation Interest**  
While close-up shots of a person can be powerful, the background can add more context. When including a background, avoid distracting details. Make sure the subject stands out against the background, which can be done by using a wide-angle lens.

**H. Interaction**  
Photos of people interacting, like talking or laughing together, can be very appealing. Look for moments of connection, such as eye contact or a friendly gesture, to capture the relationship between people.

**I. People and Places**  
Many photos of people are taken during trips. To improve these pictures, use a standard or wide-angle lens and step back to include the background, like a building or landscape. Position your subjects close to the camera while ensuring the background is visible. A slightly higher camera angle can help achieve this balance.

**J. To Pose or Not to Pose?**  
Decide why you want to take the picture. If it’s to remember someone you met briefly, a clear posed photo is good. However, family pictures can become boring if they are all formal poses. Candid shots of events are often more lively and can capture genuine moments, creating better memories for the future."
CAE_65,"**Text: Under Sarah's Spell**

Sarah Janson is a trompe-l'oeil artist. Her paintings create the illusion of reality, making things look real even when they are not. In this interview with Joanna Watt, we learn more about her.

Not many artists choose not to sign their work, but Sarah Janson is one of them. She believes that the artwork is more important than the artist. She says, ""It's not the artist who is important, but the work."" Sarah is very humble and almost makes it seem like her paintings create themselves. This attitude makes the interview a bit challenging at first. She admits, ""I just don't like to shout about myself,"" and she is nervous when asked to be photographed.

After some time, Sarah becomes more comfortable, and the interview turns into a fun and interesting conversation. She has been a trompe-l'oeil artist for sixteen years. Before that, she spent two years drawing at art school, earned a degree in graphic illustration, and worked at a publishing house. However, she was not satisfied with illustration and decided to work with a specialist decorator named Jim Smart. He asked her to create one trompe-l'oeil painting, and that sparked her interest. She left to start her own business, unsure of where it would lead but feeling it was the right choice.

Sarah's skills in observation and attention to detail, developed through her illustration work, are very important for her trompe-l'oeil art. She often gets asked where people can learn this art, but she believes it cannot be taught. ""Trompe-l'oeil is the school of life. It's all about observation,"" she explains. She is always learning and believes that if you think you have mastered something, you should give up.

Sarah is honest about her weaknesses. For example, she struggles to paint bread, which she says always looks like grey concrete. She also finds math challenging. When she had a big project to paint the ceiling of a chapel, she felt confused about the measurements and thought, ""You're not Michelangelo. Who do you think you are?"" This self-doubt makes her view her talent in a distant way. Sometimes, she talks about herself in the third person, saying things like, ""When I finished that ceiling, I thought, 'Well, I didn't do it, she did.'""

Her trompe-l'oeil work is unique and stands out from others. She has many important projects for both businesses and private clients. Much of her art is inspired by architecture. For example, she created a trompe-l'oeil dining room based on a Venetian palace and a painting that makes it look like you can enter two more rooms at the end of a hallway.

However, there is a risk with trompe-l'oeil art: once people understand the trick, they may lose interest. Sarah knows this and says, ""Trompe-l'oeil has to do two things. First, it must draw you in; it's got to trick you. Secondly, it has to hold you and engage your imagination."" She believes that trompe-l'oeil art should also be personal to the client. ""I love the interaction with clients; that is where the ideas are born,"" she says. Some clients have clear ideas, while others do not, so she listens carefully to understand their vision.

Many of her clients become friends because she spends a lot of time with them while working on their projects. Sarah appreciates her clients, saying, ""I am very grateful for the mad ones who have let me loose on their walls."" They are happy with her work, which keeps her busy, even though she tends to downplay her talent. ""I really don't like to shout about myself,"" she repeats. ""Like my work, I am very restrained. I don't want it to shout. You become bored with things that shout."" 

While this may be true, it is hard to get bored with Sarah or her art. Her work deserves more recognition, and I am willing to promote it, even if she might not like it."
CAE_61,"**Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success**

Daniel Goleman looks at the 'people skills' that are important for success in our jobs.

A. The rules for work are changing. We are now judged not only by our intelligence or training but also by how well we manage ourselves and interact with others. This new way of judging is used to decide who gets hired or promoted. It helps to identify who is likely to be a top performer and who may not do as well. These new rules are important for our future job opportunities. They focus on social skills and personal qualities, such as initiative, empathy, adaptability, and persuasiveness. These skills are part of what we call emotional intelligence.

B. In a time when job security is low, personal qualities are becoming more important in the workplace. For many years, these qualities were called different names, like 'character' or 'soft skills.' Now, we have a clearer understanding of these abilities, which we call 'emotional intelligence.' This means being able to understand and manage our own feelings and the feelings of others. In the workplace, emotional intelligence includes self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and good social skills. Some people think emotional intelligence just means being nice, but it can also mean being honest and confronting difficult situations. It is about managing feelings so that we can work well together towards our goals.

C. More businesses are realizing that developing emotional intelligence is important for good management. The more complex a job is, the more emotional intelligence matters. Even if someone has strong technical skills, a lack of emotional intelligence can hold them back. Many people have succeeded despite having low emotional intelligence, but as work becomes more collaborative, companies that encourage teamwork have an advantage. In today’s workplace, where teamwork and customer service are key, emotional intelligence is essential for success in every job.

D. Unlike IQ, which does not change much, emotional intelligence can grow as we learn from our experiences. Studies show that most people become better at managing their emotions, motivating themselves, and understanding others over time. This growth in emotional intelligence is often called maturity. We can learn these skills and use them to help us succeed, especially when job stability is uncertain. Emotional intelligence is not a magic solution for struggling organizations, nor does it guarantee success. However, if we ignore the human aspect, nothing else will work as well as it could."
CAE_52,"Text: 'Should the media make money from content they do not own? Digital cameras and camera phones have made it easier to capture important news events, but social media has changed how we share photos. Many journalists now look to social networks for images during fast-moving events. However, some reporters have used content created by users (UGC) without asking for permission. There are guidelines that say images on social media can be used without permission in special cases or when there is strong public interest, but there is still debate about whether this is right. Research shows that about one in ten people would film or take pictures of a news event, which means UGC is important for the future of the media. To keep a good relationship with the public, the media must make sure that people are fairly rewarded for their work and that permission is always asked for.'"
CAE_28,"**Simplified Text: Ancient Chinese Medicine in the West**

Acupuncture is a practice that is over two thousand years old. It comes from traditional Chinese medicine, which also includes herbal medicine, massage, diet, and exercise. Acupuncture is used to treat many health issues, but it is especially known for helping with pain. Some general practitioners (GPs), midwives, and physiotherapists use it regularly to relieve pain.

**A. What is Traditional Chinese Medicine?**  
Traditional Chinese medicine believes that health is when the energy of the mind, body, and spirit are balanced. This energy, called Qi (pronounced ""chee""), flows through the body along pathways known as meridians. There are twelve main meridians, each connected to an internal organ, and many smaller ones that carry Qi to every cell. If the flow of Qi is blocked or weak, it can lead to weakness or illness. During a visit to an acupuncturist, they will check for imbalances in your Qi by feeling your pulse, looking at your tongue, and assessing your overall health. They will ask about your medical history, current health, mental state, and your eating and sleeping habits. Acupuncturists use very thin needles that are inserted into the skin. They may also use heat from burning herbs or apply pressure to certain points to help the flow of Qi.

**B. Acupuncture Points**  
The points used in acupuncture are connected to the meridians and may not be close to where you feel pain. Many people report feeling a mild ache or tingling when the needle is gently moved. This can be done by hand or with a machine. Acupuncturists believe this sensation means the needle has reached the Qi in a meridian. There are over three hundred acupuncture points on the main meridians, with many more that are used less often.

**C. Scientific Understanding**  
Even though not all doctors believe in traditional Chinese medicine, many accept that acupuncture can help relieve pain. Scientists have suggested that acupuncture might work by blocking pain signals from reaching the brain or by releasing natural pain-relieving chemicals in the body called endorphins.

**D. Types of Pain Treated**  
Many people with long-term pain try acupuncture as a last option. It is commonly used for back pain, sports injuries, arthritis, headaches, and pain after surgery. Acupuncturists also claim it can help with menstrual pain, facial nerve pain, and pain in terminally ill patients.

**E. Modern Use of Acupuncture**  
Although acupuncture has been practiced in China for over 2,000 years, using it instead of anesthesia during surgery started in the 1950s. This helped some doctors outside China believe that acupuncture has real benefits. In China today, acupuncture is used in many types of surgeries, from tonsil removal to heart surgery. Needles can be used alone, with electrical stimulation, or with medication. While some people report little to no pain, experiences can vary. Many people might not like the idea of being awake during surgery, but acupuncturists say that acupuncture does not have the side effects of regular anesthesia, like nausea, and recovery is faster.

**F. Effectiveness of Acupuncture**  
Like many alternative therapies, it is hard to conduct clinical trials for acupuncture. However, studies show that 50 to 80 percent of people find it effective for chronic pain. Acupuncturists often report similar success rates. They understand that it may not work for everyone and that people respond differently. Traditional acupuncturists suggest that for long-term pain, it usually takes six to seven visits to feel significant relief, but some improvement can be felt after just two or three visits.

**G. A Different View of Pain**  
Western and Chinese medicine have different views on pain. Acupuncturists look at the whole person, not just the specific symptoms. They spend time diagnosing the problem and looking for underlying issues in the Qi. They also consider external factors that may affect the pain, such as weather conditions. These details are important for deciding how to treat the pain with acupuncture, which is not something most medical doctors would consider.

**H. Traditional vs. Modern Acupuncture**  
Some medical professionals have training in traditional acupuncture, while others, including many GPs, prefer scientific explanations. However, many traditional acupuncturists believe that using traditional Chinese medicine is necessary for deep healing, which is hard to measure in studies. It is important to choose a qualified acupuncturist, who should refer you to a medical doctor if needed."

P.D. James is a well-known crime writer whose gentle appearance hides a clever and creative mind. Her full name is Phyllis Dorothy James, and she has a calm presence that makes her seem like she could have been a headmistress at a girls' school. However, she is actually quite shy. She admits that her main character, Adam Dalgliesh, the detective in her books, is based on herself, or how she might have been if she were a man. Dalgliesh likes to solve crimes alone, just like P.D. James prefers to write in private. She believes that she can write anywhere as long as she has complete privacy.

Although she is considered one of the best crime writers in Britain, she is too modest to agree with this. Her 12 detective novels are very popular and read by millions around the world. She enjoys the books of her friend Ruth Rendell, especially those written under the name Barbara Vine. P.D. James often reads works by women authors like Iris Murdoch and Anita Brookner, but she also appreciates male writers like Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh, whom she thinks were the best novelists of their time.

P.D. James found success later in life. She was 42 when her first crime novel, *Cover Her Face*, was published. She was born in Oxford and grew up in Cambridge, where her family moved when she was 11. She met her husband there, who was a university student, and she loves the city. This is why she chose it as the setting for her book *An Unsuitable Job For A Woman*.

Her life has not always been easy. After her husband, Connor Bantry White, returned from World War II very ill, she had to work long hours to support him and their two young daughters, Clare and Jane. Although she had many ideas for stories, she had little time to write. Thankfully, her husband’s parents helped take care of her daughters during those tough years.

While working full-time in administration for the National Health Service, she used her strong organizational skills. At one point, she managed five psychiatric outpatient clinics. She then worked for 11 years at the Home Office, first in the Police Department and then in the Criminal Law section, focusing on juvenile crime. While working in forensic science, she became used to seeing dead bodies, but she was not interested in death itself. Instead, she loved the structure of writing a crime novel. 

P.D. James always enjoyed reading detective stories and knew she wanted to be a writer. She did not want to write about her own difficult experiences, so writing detective stories felt like a good way to learn how to be a serious novelist. She realized that it was possible to follow the traditional rules of a detective story while still writing a meaningful novel about people. She believes that writing detective stories helps to bring order to chaos. Solving a crime shows that life is valuable, even if the person involved is not likable. She thinks that nobody truly enjoys violence."

**The Pen is Mightier than the Psychoanalyst**

The study of handwriting to understand a person's character is becoming more popular. In some countries, if you apply for a job, you will likely be asked to provide a sample of your handwriting. This handwriting sample can help decide if you are suitable for the job. Handwriting analysis, also known as graphology, is considered a real science in many places. Researchers believe it can help identify certain health issues, like heart disease and cancer, and can show psychological states and emotional problems. 

More companies are using handwriting analysis for job guidance and during interviews. Many large companies now hire graphologists to examine the handwriting of job candidates. However, many doctors and psychiatrists are not convinced about the value of graphology. 

Patricia Marne, a professional graphologist for over 20 years, argues that handwriting should be taken more seriously. She believes handwriting can show psychological traits and some medical conditions. She states, ""Handwriting is a strong indicator of social class and intelligence. It can also help determine if a person should focus on arts or sciences and whether they have a deceitful or honest character.""

According to Ms. Marne, graphology can help assess possible criminal behavior: ""Criminals often have disturbed handwriting, which is usually poorly shaped. Many criminals come from difficult backgrounds and have emotional issues. This can appear as childish handwriting or in the way they write letters multiple times."" 

Ms. Marne claims she can tell if people are honest or manipulative. For example, young male offenders often have very tall letters, which suggests they live in a fantasy world. Graphologists can also predict if someone might become violent, if they are under a lot of stress, or if they have psychopathic traits. Handwriting can even indicate potential suicides. 

She explains that heart and lung problems can sometimes be seen in handwriting. ""You cannot make a diagnosis from just one sample unless the writing is clearly shaky. But if handwriting changes over time or becomes disconnected, it could mean something serious has happened."" A strong emotional upset can also change a person's signature temporarily.

Ms. Marne says handwriting can reveal other psychological traits. For example, people whose letters connect in a thread-like way may be clever but deceitful. Those who write mostly in capital letters may be hiding their true selves. Light pressure in writing shows sensitivity and low energy. Original handwriting, which differs from standard styles, shows confidence and creativity. Disconnected writing often indicates a person who is a loner. Very small signatures suggest insecurity, while circles over the letter ""i"" show a desire for attention. Crossing the ""t"" heavily can indicate intolerance and a condescending attitude.

Ms. Marne believes it takes six years of study and experience to analyze handwriting accurately, along with empathy and intuition. She thinks more research is needed to support graphology scientifically. She believes this will happen soon, stating, ""It is actually more accurate than psychoanalysis because it can reveal a person's entire history, including emotional crises, without asking them questions that they might answer incorrectly.""

Despite how interesting this may sound, there is little strong evidence to support these claims. Some psychiatrists criticize them, saying handwriting is influenced by education, artistic skills, and the type of writing taught, and does not have any other meaning."

**Is your office working well?** Fresh air and good chairs are important for a happy and healthy workplace, according to a new survey. We visited four different offices to see how healthy and happy they were. Our expert panel included a building health consultant, an ergonomist (who studies working conditions), and an occupational psychologist. Here are their opinions.

**Office A: Advertising Agency**  
**Building Health Consultant:** This office is very simple; it has no central heating or mechanical ventilation, and the windows open directly to the street. It is surprising that this space works, but the small team of seven people seems happy. They adapt to the seasons by opening doors and roof panels or using electric heaters, similar to what they do at home. This may be the reason: they have created a comfortable working environment without too many rules.  
**Ergonomist:** The furniture is mismatched and creates bad sitting positions. Many chairs are old, not adjustable, and some are broken. However, the staff has a varied work schedule, which helps reduce fatigue and boredom.  
**Occupational Psychologist:** The staff enjoys the variety of work and the office space. They feel the office is ""just the right size"" — small enough to know what others are doing, but large enough to focus on personal tasks. The office is attractive and fun, showing both efficiency and creativity.

**Office B: News Service**  
**Building Health Consultant:** This office may not be very exciting, but it is comfortable and the staff does not dislike it. The air quality and maintenance are good, helped by a No Smoking policy.  
**Ergonomist:** The company has hired an ergonomist, so the chairs are excellent, and the lighting and computer equipment are good. The layout could be better, but the environment feels impersonal with grey, bare walls.  
**Occupational Psychologist:** The walls are mostly bare except for planners and a poster about maternity rights. Most staff have worked there for at least five years, and relationships are good. The office could improve by arranging desks to make sharing information easier and displaying success stories on the walls.

**Office C: Bank**  
**Building Health Consultant:** This office gets mixed reactions from employees. It feels like being in a glass case, with many people around. Despite having smokers and non-smokers in a small space, the air does not feel stale.  
**Ergonomist:** The office is very standard and uninspiring. The desks are just okay, and not all chairs meet the requirements for computer work. Computer screens are often on low desks, which is not suitable for modern equipment.  
**Occupational Psychologist:** Staff support each other well and have good technology. There are many awards on display. The wood paneling and brown carpet make the office feel a bit dull, but it is busy with activity.

**Office D: Newspaper**  
**Building Health Consultant:** There is not much good to say about this building. The air conditioning is poor, causing big temperature changes. The space is cluttered, and most people do not have enough desk space. The office is very dusty, and the roof collects dust that falls on people below.  
**Ergonomist:** The furniture looks more like it belongs in a workshop than an office. Many chairs are not good for people using computers, especially those shorter than 1.75 m. Most chairs are old and do not adjust well, making it hard to get close to the desk.  
**Occupational Psychologist:** The office has old brown chairs, dirty carpets, and dust everywhere. There is a lot of room for improvement — it needs cleaning, and individual achievements should be recognized. The air conditioning needs to be fixed, especially with so many smokers. When we visited, there were few conversations; everyone seemed stressed and focused on deadlines. The company should encourage teamwork."
CAE_38,"**Chewing Gum Culture**

Chewing gum is popular, does not belong to any social class, and Americans chew about 12 million sticks of it every day. This ancient habit has turned into a big business. Each stick of chewing gum has fewer than ten calories, but it is considered food and must meet the standards of the American Food and Drug Administration.

Today, most gum is made from synthetic materials, with added pine resins and softeners that help keep the flavor and improve the texture. However, this was not always the case. The ancient Greeks chewed a resin from the mastic tree, which grows mainly in Greece and Turkey. Greek women especially liked mastic gum to clean their teeth and freshen their breath. American colonists learned from the Native Americans in New England and chewed resin from spruce trees. In the early 1800s, lumps of spruce for chewing were sold in the eastern United States, making it the first commercial chewing gum in the country.

Modern chewing gum began in the late 1860s with the discovery of chicle, a milky substance from the sapodilla tree found in Central America. Gum made from chicle was smoother, more enjoyable, and more elastic to chew, leading to the growth of a whole industry. However, attempts to grow sapodilla trees commercially have not been successful. As the chewing gum market has expanded, synthetic alternatives have been created.

Today, the few remaining chicle gatherers, known as chicleros, live a difficult and dangerous life. They travel for miles to collect sapodilla in very humid conditions. The environment is dangerous, with poisonous snakes and many insects. One of the most concerning is the chicle fly, which lays its eggs in the ears and nose of the gatherers. Despite these dangers, experienced chicleros can climb a mature tree quickly to cut a path in the bark for the white sap to flow into a bag below. They must carry the liquid back to a camp, where it is boiled until it becomes sticky and is made into bricks.

Life at the camp is also hard, with a boring and often unhealthy diet based on maize, along with a local alcohol made from sugar cane. Even though this work is tough, chicleros worry about their jobs. Not long ago, the United States imported 7,000 tonnes of chicle each year from Central America. Last year, only 200 tonnes were collected in the entire Yucatan peninsula of Mexico.

As chewing gum sales have increased, manufacturers have turned to synthetic materials to lower costs and meet demand. At the same time, gum producers are finding clever ways to market their products. They claim that chewing gum helps you relax, gives you energy, and reduces stress (soldiers in both world wars were often given gum). The most important claim is that it helps reduce tooth decay. Plaque acid, which forms when we eat, causes tooth decay. Our saliva helps neutralize this acid and provides minerals like calcium, phosphate, and fluoride, which protect our teeth. Gum manufacturers say that chewing for 20 minutes can increase saliva flow.

Research is ongoing to create new textures and flavors. Glycerine and other vegetable oils are now used to mix the gum base. Most new flavors are artificial, but some still require natural ingredients. Additionally, 137 square kilometers of land in America is used to grow mint for the two most popular chewing gums in the world."

Sue Brown is a hotel inspector. Christopher Middleton watched her during an inspection at the Globe Hotel. Just one minute into the inspection, things are already going wrong, but the hotel staff do not realize it yet. The receptionist is busy talking on the phone and does not notice Sue and Christopher. Sue comments, ""She hasn't even acknowledged us. Very poor."" This is a common mistake that Sue has seen many times in her 11 years as an inspector. She expects better from a hotel with three red stars, which means it is among the top 130 hotels out of 4,000 in the guide she works for.

Before they even get a warm welcome, Sue notices that the entrance from the car park is through a door with no staff, just a buzzer, and a long, empty corridor. ""This is not what I expected,"" she says. Things get worse when the receptionist tells them, ""We have no record of your booking."" It turns out that most of the hotel’s rooms are empty that night. One room is on the top floor, but Sue does not like it because it feels stuffy and has a big hole in the wall behind the wardrobe.

When Sue started her career, people called her ""The Woman in Black,"" even though she never wore black and did not think she was very tough. The next morning, after paying her bill, she reveals her identity to the hotel’s general manager, Robin Greaves. He looks scared when he sees her. He quickly apologizes for a bad smell in the lounge, saying, ""We think there’s a blocked drain."" Sue suggests that he should guide guests to another lounge instead of the one with the smell. Greaves takes notes and seems to hope that Sue's feedback will help the hotel improve.

Not everything is negative. Sue praises Emma, the assistant manager, and Trudy, the young waitress, who shared interesting information about the hotel’s 400-year history. The dinner also meets the hotel’s two-rosette food rating, which makes Greaves hopeful. He asks, ""What do we need to do to get three rosettes?"" Sue replies, ""Don’t serve a pudding that collapses."" Greaves looks disappointed.

Sue’s job is to tell the hotel about problems that many guests might not mention. She remembers a time when a woman complained that Sue got her son fired because he served her apple pie with his fingers. Some letters she receives include false claims about her attitude or demands for bribes. ""You get used to it, but it still hurts,"" she says.

Sue must not only tell the hotel about her findings but also write a full report. The hotels pay for her advice, as there is a fee to be included in the guide. However, being recognized with red stars makes it worth it. Greaves is relieved to hear that Sue will not recommend taking away the Globe's red stars. The bad news is that another inspector will return in the next two months to check if the problems have been fixed. Greaves smiles weakly and says, ""We'll look forward to that."""

Doug Scott, a mountaineer, shares his experiences of climbing the highest mountains on each continent, known as the Seven Summits. He started this journey later in life and will describe each mountain in the order he climbed them.

**A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)**  
While climbing Mt. Everest, Doug and his partner, Dougal Haston, were in a snow cave, 91 meters below the summit. Dougal started talking about sleeping bags with their Equipment Officer, Dave Clark, even though only they were there. Doug thought this was odd, possibly due to low oxygen levels. He began talking to his own feet, which were getting cold. They were not just worried about surviving but also about how well they could survive. Over the next two days, Doug remembered their time on the summit ridge and felt confident climbing with Dougal. He focused on finding a better rhythm to reach the summit.

**B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)**  
Mt. McKinley is known as one of the most dangerous mountains. In April 1976, Doug and Dougal arrived at the Kahiltna Glacier and spent four days carrying equipment and food to the base. After the first day of climbing, they realized how difficult their task was. They followed a route from 1967 but then chose a new route to the summit. They decided to climb with all their gear on their backs, which was a new approach for this mountain. After three days, Doug's sleeping bag was wet, and they spent a tough night on a windy ridge. Because of the low air pressure, it felt like they were much higher than they actually were. Finally, they reached the summit and celebrated their success.

**C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m)**  
In September 1976, Doug and his friend Paul Braithwaite flew to Nairobi to climb Mt. Kenya. However, they ended up climbing Kilimanjaro instead after getting a free ride. They got lost in the jungles on the lower slopes, which was serious because water was hard to find. On the second day, they found some arrows painted on trees and a trail of trash that led them to a rock pool. They tried to climb a steep wall but had to turn back due to falling rocks and ice. Instead, they took the Umbwe route to reach the summit.

**D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)**  
In January 1992, Doug and his wife, Sharu, arrived at Punta del Inca and met a guide named Phil Erscheler. Phil was leading a group up a less crowded route, and they decided to join him. After waiting for bad weather to pass, they left base camp. The Polish Glacier was icy and dangerous, so they chose to take the standard route instead. The wind was strong as they walked to the summit, and they camped outside a refuge before heading back down. At base camp, they met a group planning to climb the Seven Summits, which made Doug consider this goal for the first time.

**E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)**  
Doug learned that climbing Vinson Massif could be funded by guiding others. In November 1992, his team traveled to the South Pole. During this time, the sun stays above the horizon, and the atmosphere is very refreshing. On December 7, they set out for the summit. Despite strong winds and very low temperatures, they all reached the top within eight hours, although they could barely see due to a storm.

**F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)**  
In the summer of 1994, Doug's team gathered in St. Petersburg. When they arrived at Terskol, they had to pay a fee for bringing foreigners into the area, but it was later waived. After a few days of getting used to the altitude, they took a cable car up to 3,900m and then walked to a refuge at 4,200m. Two days later, they faced strong winds as they climbed. They thought they reached the summit but found there was still more to climb. They returned to the refuge and then descended the volcano.

**G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)**  
On their expedition to Carstensz, Doug and his team wanted to create a new climbing route and spend time with the local Dani people. They were warned about possible dangers from bandits but decided to continue. On May 12, they started climbing. The weather improved, and two team members went ahead while Doug and another member climbed more slowly. They reached the summit by 11 am, and Doug received a standing ovation for completing his seventh summit. Mission accomplished!"

**Style Merchants**

Style is important in many parts of our lives today, from clothing to home decoration and accessories. Jo Foley shares some of the fashion trends for this year.

**Ned Ingham: Dress Designer**  
Ned Ingham creates beautiful and romantic wedding dresses. He advises people to avoid traditional, stiff dresses and the overly frilly style, and instead choose simpler designs. Ingham has been drawing and designing wedding dresses since he was a child. At 16, he went to fashion school to learn how to cut and make clothes. You don’t have to be a bride to wear an Ingham dress; he also designs elegant evening dresses in modern colors and fabrics. For those who prefer classic styles, he offers a traditional navy-blue summer suit, which has been a staple in women's wardrobes for many years, but he makes it look fresh and new.

**Sally Quail: Jeweller**  
Sally Quail used to work for an art dealer but has no formal training in jewellery design. She started designing her own engagement ring when she couldn’t find one she liked. This led her to become a designer in 1990. Now, many famous people wear her jewellery. Her unique style features large semi-precious stones set in gold, creating stunning necklaces, bracelets, and rings inspired by 18th-century designs. Recently, she has started using diamonds, saying, ""I reached that moment in every woman's life when she wants a diamond.""

**Lily Grimson: Handbag Designer**  
Lily Grimson has been in the competitive fashion industry for just four years, but two of her handbag designs have been chosen for a major exhibition. All of her bags are handmade in the UK and are not just ordinary bags; they are stylish and glamorous, made from high-quality materials like calfskin and silk. A Grimson bag is special because of its elegance and attention to detail.

**Peter Little: Hairdresser**  
For over 20 years, Peter Little has styled the hair of many famous people. He believes that most women want hair that looks natural and is easy to manage at home. His goal is to make sure his clients look like they haven’t just come from a salon. However, his services are expensive, costing £250 for the first appointment, and there is a three-month waiting list. Peter has also created his own line of hairdryers and styling tools, so people can style their hair at home.

**Penny Pratt: Florist**  
Penny Pratt runs a small flower shop and also works as a flower consultant for a large supermarket chain and top restaurants. She has no formal training in floristry and left her teaching job 10 years ago to try something new. Her modern flower arrangements have won many design awards, helping her start her own London Flower School. She has also given successful lectures in Japan and the USA. Penny believes that flower arrangements should be simple but strong, with fewer leaves. For wedding bouquets, she advises that all flowers should be of the same type."
FCE_19,"**Text: Five-Star Luxury and Modern Technology**

The Merrion Hotel, a new five-star hotel, has opened in Dublin after two years of work converting four large 18th-century houses. This project focused on what customers want and included the latest technology for both staff and guests.

General Manager Peter MacCann wants his staff to know guests by name. However, he uses a computer system to keep track of guests' preferences. This system helps the hotel provide special service to returning guests. Although it cost £250,000 to install, MacCann believes it will be worth it over time because of its efficiency. For example, if a guest asks for certain music CDs during their first stay, those CDs will be ready for them on their next visit, thanks to the guest-history feature.

Many hotel guests often complain about room temperature. The Merrion has a high-tech system that allows guests to adjust the temperature in their rooms. They can change it by three degrees around the normal 18°C, and the front desk can adjust it anywhere from 14°C to 25°C.

Business travelers will find the hotel especially appealing. MacCann estimates that about 65% of his business will come from this group. To meet their needs, the hotel has created a business center in each room. Each room includes three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that also works as a photocopier and printer, and video-conferencing equipment.

Technology changes quickly, so the hotel has prepared for future improvements by laying extra cables. They rent televisions instead of buying them, allowing for easy upgrades to newer models. DVD recorders can also be updated when needed. Despite all this technology, MacCann wants guests to feel comfortable, not overwhelmed. The hotel has 145 spacious and well-furnished bedrooms that are welcoming.

The Merrion also features a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a beautiful garden. The food is excellent, with Chef Patrick Guilbaud, who has two Michelin stars, running the restaurant. Moving his restaurant to the Merrion has allowed him to create a modern kitchen and improve parking facilities. For the hotel, having a successful restaurant brings benefits without financial risks. With great technology and a skilled staff, the Merrion Hotel is likely to succeed."

Artist Susan Shepherd is well-known for her flower paintings. The large garden around her house provides many of her subjects. It is filled with her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wildly and spread all over the garden. The two long flower borders along the path that goes from east to west are full of color, shape, and structure. This beauty is partly due to the previous owners, who loved gardening and left plants that Susan liked. She also kept the gardener, Danny. 

Susan says, ""In fact, it was really his garden."" She and Danny got along well. At first, he would say some of her ideas were not worth it, but when she told him she wanted to paint those plants, he understood her vision. 

Susan prefers to paint detailed studies of individual plants instead of the whole garden. Sometimes, she paints a group of plants, but usually, she picks one flower and takes it to her studio. ""I don't set the whole thing up at once,"" she explains. ""I take one flower out and paint it, which might take a few days. Then I bring in another one and build up the painting that way. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.""

Her busiest time is spring and early summer when the tulips bloom, followed by the poppies. ""They all come out together, and you're so busy,"" she says. But she also finds beauty in the way flowers change as they decay. For example, with tulips, ""you bring them in and put them in water, then leave them for a day, and they change shape. They open up and look amazing. At first, they seem boring, but they change all the time.""

Susan has always loved plants. ""I studied botany in school and collected wildflowers from the countryside,"" she says. ""I didn't care much for garden flowers then; I thought they looked fake, like silk or plastic. I was fascinated by how wildflowers could grow in tough places, like cracks in rocks or on cliffs.""

Today, her garden has many plants from faraway places, but they seem just as comfortable in her garden as they do in their original homes, like China or the Himalayas. She has a relaxed attitude towards her garden, like a caring aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don’t cause serious trouble.

With two upcoming exhibitions to prepare for and plenty of subjects to paint, Susan has found it hard to spend time in the garden. She now hires an extra gardener, but she knows that to stay connected with her art, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""

Many trees in the Brackham area were damaged in the strong storms that March. The town lost two big lime trees from the old market square. The loss of these trees changed the look of the town center completely, which upset some of the local residents. Normally, Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, the head of the local police, would have been among those upset. However, during the storm, when the wind knocked down the walnut tree in his garden, he was too sick to notice. Pelham, a large and healthy man, was seriously ill for the first time in his life with bronchitis. When he first felt pain in his head and tightness in his chest, his wife, Molly, tried to convince him to see a doctor. He believed the police needed him and ignored her advice, trying to keep working. This made him forget things and made him short-tempered. It was only when his colleague, Sergeant Lloyd, took him to the doctor that he finally agreed to go. By then, he was too weak to argue. Soon, she took him to the pharmacy to get his antibiotics and then home to his wife, who sent him straight to bed.

On Thursday morning, when Molly told him that the walnut tree had fallen during the night, Pelham could hardly believe it. On Thursday evening, he weakly asked if the house was damaged and felt relieved to hear it was not. He then pulled the sheets over his head. It was not until Saturday, when the antibiotics worked, his fever went down, and he got up, that he realized the loss of the walnut tree had changed the living room's appearance. The Pelhams' large house was in a big garden. It was expensive, but Pelham had no regrets about buying it. The garden had given them privacy. Now, the storm had changed that. Before, the living room had a beautiful view of the walnut tree, which let in light but also hid the old furniture they had brought from their previous home. Without the tree, the room felt too bright, showing the worn furniture in all its bad condition. The view from the window was not nice either. The tall house next door, which was hidden by the tree, was now visible, with its unattractive purple bricks and pipes. It had many upstairs windows that seemed to watch the Pelhams' every move.

""Doesn't it look terrible?"" Pelham said weakly to his wife. But Molly, standing in the doorway, sounded more happy than upset. ""That's what I've been saying since we moved here. We need to buy a new sofa, no matter the cost."""
FCE_16,"**Text: Living in the Valley**

We had been living in our valley for sixteen months when we first noticed the dangers in the surrounding hills that could threaten our survival. It was the year when the storms came early, even before November ended. Until then, we felt safe in our valley, protected by the hills. Soon, snow began to fall. Within a day, it was about 15 centimeters deep. It almost completely blocked our lane and made the path by the stream slippery and dangerous. In the hills, the snow was much deeper and lasted longer. The wind blew strongly up there, but in our valley, we only felt sudden gusts of wind; the trees swayed, but their branches stayed strong. Still, we knew we had reasons to worry. The snow and wind were annoying, but they did not really trouble us much. The river, the Ryburn, which usually flowed gently, was our biggest concern. It reminded us of what could happen if the water from the hills was not controlled by the dams built many years ago.

Soon, the snow started to melt. Day after day, we watched dark clouds gather over the hills to the west. These grey clouds spread over the valleys, warning us of what was coming. We had seen enough of the sky; now we began to watch the river, which was becoming fuller and wilder. The snow was washed away as more rain fell from the clouds, but the reservoir in the hills was filling up and getting close to a dangerous level. Then it happened - for the first time in years, the reservoir overflowed. It was like a small Niagara Falls, as the water rushed over the dam and into the stream below. The river seemed wild as the water poured down towards its lower parts. Just a couple of meters from our cottage, the stream looked furious beneath the bridge. It was much deeper than we had ever seen it so close to our home, crashing against its banks. For three days, we hoped it would stay below its limits. Luckily, our hopes were answered as the dam held, and the water began to go down.

In the past, before the dam was built, the river had flooded nearby villages many times. Now, the dam controls the river's flow, and usually, everything is fine. The large amount of water from the hills, caused by snow and heavy rain, stays behind the dam, with only occasional overflow. Because of this protection, we can enjoy the big clouds over the valley and appreciate the great power of the river. Thanks to the dam, we feel that our home in the valley is still safe and secure."

Film critic Mark Adams reflects on his ten years of work for a newspaper called The Front Page. Writing articles about films for this newspaper was his first real job. Before that, he had done some reviews of novels for other newspapers, films for a magazine, and radio work. This is how he met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, who also worked in radio and television. Tom hired Mark, but he was not mainly a journalist, so he was not very careful in choosing his team.

At first, Tom wanted a group of critics to cover different art forms like books, TV, theatre, film, and radio. They would have a weekly lunch to discuss which topics to cover, and there would be guests to make it more enjoyable. Mark felt like he was living a dream: a new newspaper, and he was part of the team. It seemed surprising that a new paper could start in a busy market. He even thought a rich person was helping him personally and pretending to hire him because he lacked self-confidence. The first time he saw someone reading The Front Page on the London Underground with one of his reviews, he felt very shy.

Tom's idea for a team of critics did not work out as planned. They did not meet as a group, so they communicated by phone. It turned out that the public preferred to have one reviewer for each subject, so Mark decided to focus on films. Without Tom's initial support, they would not have developed the current system, where Mark writes a detailed weekly article about one film. He enjoys this way of working. He would not want to do the usual film critic job, which means reviewing every new film. That routine would make him bored quickly. He would not want to sit in a screening room on a Monday morning thinking, ""What terrible film do I have to watch now?"" 

The freedom he has allows him to expand his ideas or, if the week is dull, to create something interesting from little. But what is his role as a critic? He believes people choose films based on stars, advertising, or the director. Some people are loyal to certain types of films, while others avoid them. It is rare for someone who dislikes westerns to watch one after reading a review, or for a romantic film lover to skip a love story because of a critic's opinion. So, if a film review is not just a guide for consumers, what is it? Mark does not feel he must be ""right"" about a movie. He does not think there should be a specific number of ""great"" or ""bad"" films each year. His job is to present an argument. He does not see himself as a judge, and he does not want to be one."

Why would a schoolgirl want to swim 1500 meters, cycle 40 kilometers, and then run 10 kilometers? Because ""it's fun."" 

A teenager who loves sports is looking for a training partner for triathlons, preferably a girl. This is a chance to work with someone who could be an Olympic champion. The partner should really enjoy long-distance running (about 15 kilometers regularly), swimming (especially in cold water during winter), and cycling (a love for 100 kilometers is a plus). It is important to be able to do all three activities without taking a break.

Triathlons are becoming very popular in the Olympics. They attract large crowds who are amazed (and sometimes shocked) by athletes who swim 1500 meters, cycle 40 kilometers, and then run 10 kilometers without stopping. It might be exciting for the audience, but why do triathletes push their bodies so hard? What makes a talented 17-year-old, who does well in school, give up so much for this challenging sport?

Melanie Sears, a young athlete, has not yet learned the usual phrases about personal satisfaction and mental challenges that many athletes use when asked why they compete. She explains, ""You swim 1500 meters, then run out of the water and jump on your bike while still wet. Of course, you get cold. After the 40-kilometer bike ride, you have to run 10 kilometers, which is tough when you are tired. But it’s really fun, and it’s all worth it in the end.""

Melanie started competing in triathlons when she was 14. ""I won the junior section, but I was the only junior there. It felt easy, and I waved at my friends while I was racing."" Feeling confident, she entered the National Championships. Although she had the second fastest swim and the fastest run, she did not do well overall. ""I was following a man, and suddenly we ended up at the sea. We realized we had gone the wrong way. I ended up cycling 20 kilometers too far. I cried while running.""

But she did not give up and is determined to keep going. ""Sometimes I wish I could stop because then the pain would end, but I am afraid that if I stop just once, I would want to stop again."" Her determination impresses Steve Trew, the director of coaching for the sport. ""I tested her fitness,"" he says, ""and she worked so hard on the running machine that she fell into a wall. She gave it her all, while most people stop when they feel they can’t go on. She just kept going.""

Melanie was the top junior in this year's European Triathlon Championships, finishing 13th. ""I was almost as good as the top three in swimming and running, but I was much slower in cycling. That’s why I am working hard on it."" She is trying to convince her parents, who will pay £1,300 for her trip to New Zealand for the World Championships, to buy a £2,000 bike (it’s a special deal with £1,000 off) so she can compete in national 25 km and 100 km races later this year.

However, there is a cost. Her intense training has made her a bit of a loner. ""I don’t have a social life,"" she says. ""I’m not really into parties. After two hours of hard swimming on Friday nights, I just want to sleep. But I do call and write to the other girls on the team."" What do they talk about? Boys? Clothes? ""No, we talk about our times in races.""

Where will all this focus lead her? Melanie has tried other events, like the triathlon ""sprint,"" where you only swim 750 meters, cycle 20 kilometers, and run 5 kilometers. She wants to enter even tougher events than the triathlon. ""The big problem is, I don’t have anyone my age to train with,"" she says. It’s interesting, isn’t it?"
FCE_70,"**Text: The Collectors**

Amanda Roy writes about the things she collects and why many people enjoy this hobby. I have always loved collecting, and one in three adults shares this interest. Collecting is a world of passion, envy, enthusiasm, and joy. However, if you decide to collect, remember this: only collect things you truly love. 

Since ancient times, people have wanted to collect. Early humans collected pebbles and wore them as necklaces. They were attracted to the shapes and colors of these pebbles, which were their first attempts to gather objects for intellectual and spiritual reasons. Over the years, not much has changed. Children still collect stones and seashells just for their beauty.

I have been collecting all my life, from flowers like tulips to pottery and paintings. My first collection was stones I found in my parents' garden. When I was six, I went to a school in a remote, cold part of England. When my parents visited, they took me to a local museum filled with objects collected by people in the past. I was fascinated by these items. 

Surprisingly, I am not alone in my interest in collecting. One in three adults enjoys this hobby. The reasons people collect have become a topic of great interest. Some believe it is the only part of their lives where they have complete control. For me, it is simply something I enjoy.

One famous collector was the Duc de Berry in France. He had a ""room of wonders"" filled with natural and artificial curiosities, like cups made from coconut shells and carved ivory beads. Another collector, Catherine the Great of Russia, owned more than 4,000 paintings. However, you do not need to be rich to start a collection. I have collected many different items, like tulip bulbs and china cups, with great determination. 

I remember the day I convinced another tulip collector to sell me a special bulb. I planted it and cared for it until one year it disappeared—stolen by another collector. I also collected 350 American rag dolls, searching all over the USA for different designs. Sadly, this collection was destroyed when my house caught fire. The next morning, I stood in my front hall and saw the remains of my furniture and my collection. I was not sure which loss made me sadder.

I find it interesting how collections change hands. A silver spoon that once belonged to a king or a poet gives value to items traded in markets. As small objects become popular among collectors, their prices rise. For example, toys from the 1950s are now valuable, especially if you kept the original boxes. (Unfortunately, I threw away both the boxes and the toys!)"
FCE_3,"**My Line of Work**

Four people talk about their jobs.

**Lisa - Exhibition Programmes Organiser, Science Museum**  
I am in charge of creating temporary exhibitions. This means I plan and design the exhibition and promote it. I need to learn about the exhibition topic beforehand and talk to important people to understand the main themes and goals. I decide what objects and pictures should be shown. I also ensure that the public can understand the exhibition, which involves planning interactive displays, workshops, and performances. I work with engineers and electricians to make sure the exhibition is safe for visitors. Before the exhibition opens, I help design and write brochures and leaflets to inform people about it.

**Janet - Teacher of London Taxi Drivers**  
When I arrive at 7:30 a.m., the first thing I do is check the accounts. Then, I see what new maps and documents need to be created to help students learn the routes for the London taxi-driver test. By midday, about 50 students are in school, figuring out how to make the journeys. They find the most direct routes, using the correct one-way streets and turns. I help when there are disagreements, like whether a right turn is allowed at a certain junction. When they are close to the test, I give them a simple route, but I tell them they must take a different route because the road is closed. The next student must find another route, and I will give them a reason why they can’t go that way. This is to make them think.

**Sarah - Marine Conservationist**  
I live by the coast and work from home. My job involves answering phone calls, creating educational materials, and setting up training courses. Sometimes, I go to our main office, but I usually work on the coast. I collaborate with schools and study centers and run courses for coastal managers and decision-makers about the sea. I take them out to sea in a boat to help them understand the life beneath the water. This often changes their views, as it is very different from making decisions on a computer. I feel lucky because conservation is my hobby, so I enjoy my job. However, I work for a charity, which means I always need to find more money. This makes it hard to achieve everything I want.

**Chris - Map and Atlas Publisher**  
My job is quite varied. I ensure that our publishing program meets market needs and that we keep around 300 copies of the books we publish. We have very high standards for information and content. We receive many letters from readers about issues like international boundaries, which need careful responses. I discuss future projects and current sales with co-publishers. I work with a passionate team, which makes the job more enjoyable. The downside, like many jobs, is that there is too much administration to handle, which leaves less time for more interesting tasks like product development and design."
FCE_10,"**Text: A Holiday in Ireland**

Every June, we went to Ireland. Since the four of us started going on holidays together, we spent the first two weeks of the month at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. It is a big house by the sea, not far from the village of Ardbeag. The English couple who own the house, the Malseeds, have made some additions to it, but they did it very carefully. Strafe found Glencorn for us. He saw an advertisement when the Malseeds were still advertising. ""How about this?"" he said one evening and read the details. 

The summer before, we had gone to a hotel recommended by friends, but it was not a good experience because the food was terrible. The four of us have been playing cards together for a long time: Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia, and me. They call me Milly, but my real name is Dorothy Milson. Dekko got his nickname at school; Dekko Deacon sounds nice, I guess. He and Strafe were school friends, which is why we call Strafe by his last name, like the teachers used to. We are all about the same age and live close to the town where the Malseeds lived before moving to Ireland. We always think it is a funny coincidence.

""How very nice,"" Mrs. Malseed said, smiling to welcome us again this year. She seems to know when guests are arriving because she is usually waiting in the large hall that always smells of flowers. ""Arthur, take the luggage up,"" she told the old porter. ""Rose, Tulip, Lily, and Geranium,"" she said, naming the rooms we would stay in. Mrs. Malseed painted flowers on the doors instead of using numbers. In winter, when not many people come to Glencorn Lodge, she takes care of little details like that; her husband handles repairs and decoration.

""Well, well, well,"" Mr. Malseed said as he entered the hall from the kitchen. ""A hundred thousand welcomes,"" he greeted us in the Irish way. He was smiling, and his dark brown eyes sparkled, making us feel special, not just another group of guests. Everyone smiled, and I could tell the others felt that our holiday had truly started. Nothing had changed at Glencorn; everything was good.

Kitty from the dining room came out to greet us. ""You look younger every year, all four of you,"" she said, making everyone laugh again. Arthur led the way to our rooms, carrying as much luggage as he could and returning for the rest. After dinner, we played cards for a while, but we didn’t play for too long because we were still tired from the journey. 

In the lounge, there was a man alone and a French couple. There were other people at dinner, of course, because Glencorn Lodge is always full in June. From our table by the window, we could see some guests walking on the lawns and others taking the path down to the beach. In the morning, we would do the same: walk along the beach to Ardbeag and have coffee at the hotel there, returning in time for lunch. In the afternoon, we would drive somewhere. I knew this would happen because over the years, we had developed this routine. Since we first came here, we had all fallen in love with the beautiful landscape."

Sarah studied French and History of Art at Oxford Brookes University and sees this job as a fun way to spend a year or two before starting a career. She enjoys meeting successful people through her work.

Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to the chalet, which can host up to 18 guests each week. She has her own breakfast before preparing breakfast for the guests, which includes porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants. After breakfast, she cleans up and either makes afternoon tea for the guests or cleans the rooms, which she finds the least enjoyable part of her job. By around 11 a.m., she is ready to ski and enjoys being on the slopes until about 4:30 p.m.

After skiing, Sarah returns to the chalet to prepare dinner. She takes a shower first but does not sleep, as she believes it would make her feel worse. Dinner is a three-course meal served at 8 p.m., and coffee is usually served by 10 p.m. After dinner, she cleans the kitchen because she dislikes coming back to a messy space the next morning. Sometimes she chats with the guests, but other times they prefer to be alone. She finds that good guests can make her week enjoyable, while some weeks are not as good.

Sarah lives in a chalet with friends, and they usually go out around 11 p.m. They often start their night at a place called Bananas, then go to G Jay's, and sometimes end at Dick's T-Bar. However, she does not stay out too late on Saturday nights because Sundays are her busiest days. She describes Sundays as ""a frightful day"" because she has to prepare breakfast for guests leaving early at 7 a.m. After they leave, she cleans quickly, strips the beds, and gets everything ready for the new guests.

If she hasn’t done the shopping on Saturday, she does it on Sunday. By around 3 p.m., after finishing the cleaning, she prepares tea for the new guests who arrive around 4:30 p.m. Sometimes the new guests seem confused and have many questions. Between tea and dinner, Sarah helps guests who need ski boots or equipment and then gets a ride back to the chalet. Soon, it is time for dinner again, and sometimes she enjoys a drink afterward, but if she is too tired, she goes to bed early."
FCE_27,"Miss Rita Cohen was a small girl with pale skin who looked much younger than Seymour's daughter, Marie, but she said she was six years older. One day, she visited his factory. She wore overalls and big shoes, and her curly hair framed her pretty face. Seymour found it hard to believe that she was studying at the University of Pennsylvania and doing research on the leather industry in New Jersey for her Master's degree. 

Several times a year, someone would contact Seymour to ask if they could visit his factory. Sometimes, he would help students by answering their questions over the phone or giving them a short tour if they seemed serious. Rita was almost as small as the children from Marie's third-grade class, who had visited the factory years ago to see how gloves were made. Seymour remembered how Marie loved to watch the workers shape and press each glove using hot brass hands that looked like they had been flattened. As a child, Marie called them the ""pancake hands.""

Rita asked, ""How many pieces come in a shipment?"" Seymour replied, ""Between twenty and twenty-five thousand."" She took notes and asked, ""Do they come directly to your shipping department?"" He explained, ""They go to the tannery first. We buy the material, and they prepare it for us. My grandfather and father worked in the tannery here in town, and I did too for six months when I started."" 

""Have you ever been inside a tannery?"" he asked. ""Not yet,"" she answered. ""You should visit one if you want to write about leather. I can help you arrange that. Tanneries are old-fashioned. The technology has improved, but they still look similar to how they did hundreds of years ago. It's hard work. Tanning is one of the oldest industries; they found 6,000-year-old tanning tools in Turkey. The first clothing was made from animal skins that were tanned by smoking them. It’s a fascinating subject. My father is an expert on leather; you should talk to him. If you start a conversation about gloves, he could talk for two days. Glovemakers really love their work.""

""Have you ever seen anything being made, Miss Cohen?"" he asked. ""Not really,"" she replied. ""I saw my mother bake a cake when I was a child."" This made him laugh. She was innocent and eager to learn, reminding him of Marie, who was much taller than Rita but shared a similar bright spirit. 

""I have an idea,"" he said. ""We will take you through the whole process. Come on! We are going to make you a pair of gloves, and you will watch them being made from start to finish. What size do you wear?"""

Chris Arnot talks to four people with dream jobs to see if they are as great as they seem.

**A. Raquel Graham**  
Raquel Graham calls from a taxi on her way to the airport. She cannot meet us tomorrow because her boss needs her in Los Angeles. As a personal assistant to a pop star, she often travels around the world at a moment's notice. Raquel loves her job and has a good relationship with her boss. However, she has one small problem: she does not like flying. ""On a nine-hour flight to California, I usually take sleeping pills to help me relax,"" she says. Her worst experience was flying on Concorde. ""It felt so closed in with those tiny windows."" When she is not traveling, she works in offices in Manchester and London. She has to do some boring tasks like organizing schedules, attending meetings with lawyers and accountants, planning trips, and making more travel arrangements. She did not apply for this job; a chance meeting with a pop group manager led to her getting work behind the scenes. She also took a secretarial course in the evenings. Five years later, she was in the right place when her boss needed a personal assistant.

**B. David Brown**  
David Brown has worked as an accountant and a golf caddy, which is someone who carries a golfer's bags. He prefers being a caddy because golf is his passion. However, there are some downsides. He earns a small flat fee plus a percentage of the winnings, which usually ranges from £25,000 to £35,000, but much of that goes to travel and hotels. He started caddying for golfer Greg Norman when he was 31. ""You are not just carrying bags. You give advice, use your knowledge about the game, and try to understand the course,"" he explains. Recently, his accounting skills were recognized by European Tour Productions, and they made him the statistical data administrator. He collects and analyzes statistics from the caddies, which are important for TV commentators, golf magazines, and the players.

**C. Martin Fern**  
Martin Fern is the editor of the 'Food and Drink' section of a daily newspaper. One of his easier tasks is to taste food at the best restaurants. What does he think about expensive restaurants? ""For those who can afford it, it's their choice,"" he says. ""I would rather spend £120 on a meal I will remember than buy a microwave."" His cooking talent led to a friend offering him a food column in a Saturday Review. At that time, he was the creative director of an advertising agency, and it provided him with extra income. When he was 42, another newspaper offered him a full-time job. ""It meant a 50% cut in my guaranteed income,"" he says, ""but it was a chance to turn my passion into a career."" He still cooks at home and tries to stay fit by cycling a couple of miles to the nearest subway station.

**D. Dick Prince**  
""I started writing children's stories about 20 years ago,"" says Dick Prince, one of Britain's most popular children's authors. ""Before that, I loved words and enjoyed writing, but I mostly wrote poetry. Then I had an idea for a story. I had been a farmer and knew about chickens being killed by a fox. So, I wrote a story called The Fox Busters, which became my first published children's book."" Where do his ideas come from? ""It's not easy; I have to work hard on them,"" he says. ""I usually do this in the mornings. I don't wake up at dawn, though. After lunch, I spend a couple of hours typing what I wrote in the morning. I use an old portable typewriter instead of a laptop, which I dislike. I receive between 50 and 100 letters a week, and that is the part of being a writer that I enjoy the most. I try to answer them all, but now I have some help with that."""
FCE_66,"In the lumberyard by the lake, there was an old two-story brick building. Outside, there were large piles of soft sawdust. That afternoon, feeling bored, a group of boys followed Michael up a ladder to the roof of the building. They sat with their legs hanging over the edge, looking at the lake. Suddenly, Michael said, ""I dare you to jump down,"" and without thinking, he jumped off the roof and landed in the sawdust, rolling around and laughing. ""I dare you all!"" he shouted. ""You're all cowards,"" he teased, trying to get them to jump too.

The other boys looked down from the roof, nervous but eventually one by one, they jumped and landed safely in the sawdust, smiling with relief. In the warm afternoon sun, they lay on the sawdust, telling jokes. After a while, one of the boys suggested they go back up to the roof and jump down again. Although they were not very excited, they climbed back up and started jumping off again, but soon only Michael was left on the roof. The others were down below, smiling and calling, ""Come on, Mike. What's wrong with you?""

Michael wanted to join them, but he hesitated at the edge of the roof, feeling nervous. He tried to count to ten to jump, but he couldn't. The boys started laughing at him, getting tired of waiting. ""Come on, you're a coward! Do you think we're going to sit here all night?"" they shouted. When he still didn't jump, they began to walk away, still teasing him. ""Who started this? What's wrong with you?"" he called after them. 

For a long time, he stayed at the edge of the roof, looking down sadly. He was alone for nearly an hour while the sun set over the lake. His clothes were wet from sweating. Finally, he closed his eyes, jumped off the roof, and landed heavily in the sawdust. He lay there for a long time in silence because the workmen had gone home. He wondered why he had been so scared to jump earlier. Eventually, he got up and walked home, feeling ashamed and wanting to avoid everyone.

When he got home late for dinner, his stepmother said coldly, ""You should be able to get home on time by now. If you won't come home, maybe you should stay out tonight."" She was a strong woman with soft skin and a little grey in her hair, always patient. But Michael, feeling gloomy and miserable, hardly listened to her. He was still thinking about the boys laughing at him on the sawdust pile."
FCE_44,"**Careers Advice**

Are you unhappy in your job and unsure how to change it? Kitty Doherty offers some helpful advice. Many people who want to change their job seek help from a careers adviser. You will need to write a short history of yourself and take some tests called 'psychometrics'. After the tests, you will receive a summary of the results and suggestions for different careers, along with any retraining you might need.

I decided to try Career Analysts, one of the largest career advice organizations. Taking the careers test felt like being back in my science exams. I was in a group of about ten people, answering questions under time pressure. I had to remind myself that it wasn't about passing or failing. It was hard to see how the psychometric tests could show an accurate picture of me. The tests included finding mistakes in lists of names and numbers and matching similar shapes.

After the tests, I had a long conversation with an adviser. Based on our discussion and the test results, he created a report with his observations and recommendations. I agreed with most of his conclusions, but I was a bit disappointed to learn that I had not done well in the scientific and technical tests. I am sure many sick people are glad I never became a nurse! However, it was comforting to hear that I had made the right choices regarding journalism.

Changing your career doesn't always mean making a big change. Last March, after working as a marketing manager for five years, 25-year-old Donna Laney lost her job. Her friends suggested she visit Career Analysts for help. ""Losing my job was a great chance for me to step back and look at my career,"" Donna says. ""I wanted to rethink my skills and interests."" Some of the results surprised her. ""I didn't realize I had a talent for design. But in the end, I had to consider the cost of retraining in design against my financial situation,"" she explains. Other suggestions included taking a year off to work in the Far East. ""I decided to use my existing skills and move into a job that suited me better than insurance. I am now a Public Relations officer. I believe I would have reached this point without Career Analysts, but they helped me understand what I really wanted to do. I have sent several friends there, and they are all happy with the service.""

Some people feel they would not have reached their goals without help. A visit to Career Counselling Services helped 26-year-old Juliet Greene make important decisions. ""After working at a major bank for six years, I found my job boring and wanted a new challenge. I had no idea what I wanted to do, so I went to Career Counselling Services with an open mind. I took the tests, which showed I was interested in sciences,"" she says. ""I had four sessions with an adviser. The third session was recorded, which was helpful because you forget many things you say. After the fourth meeting, I carefully listened to the test results and decided I wanted to study geology. I plan to start a degree course later this year. I think the advice from Career Counselling Services was worth the fee. I'm much happier now and more positive.""

However, career advice does not work for everyone. Amanda Margetts, a 24-year-old sales representative, says, ""I reached a point in my career where I didn't know what to do next. I thought a careers adviser might suggest something new. Although I received many ideas, I rejected them because they either required a big pay cut or a lot of retraining. I didn't learn anything new about myself,"" she says. ""You have to share a lot of personal information with the adviser, and I felt that if I had told a friend the same things, they would have given me similar advice."""
FCE_22,"**Text: Fun at the Dentist's**

If you visit W. Lloyd Jerome's dental office in the center of Glasgow, you will see bright, modern paintings on the walls and a stylish blue couch where patients sit while he checks their teeth. Jerome says, ""Fifty percent of people only go to the dentist when they are in pain instead of for regular check-ups. This is because they are scared."" To change this, he has tried to create a place where people feel comfortable. That is why he decided not to wear a white coat, which many people connect with pain. He believes that dental treatment should happen in a relaxing, interesting, and enjoyable atmosphere.

This idea is surprising for many people who usually think of dental visits as painful or very formal. Jerome explains, ""If people are relaxed, entertained, and treated well, they will forget their past bad experiences."" One of his new relaxation methods is using virtual-reality headsets. ""We were the first dental practice in Britain to use them, and they are very popular. The headsets are used during the first check-up, where the patient sits comfortably on the blue couch and watches a film about underwater wildlife while I check their teeth. Then the headset shows a special camera that gives the patient a view of their mouth.""

Surprisingly, most patients enjoy this part of their visit. Another important detail is that the office smells more like a perfume shop than a dentist's office. Today, it smells like orange. Jerome says, ""When people walk in, I want them to feel with all their senses that this is not a typical dentist's visit. Smell is very important. The usual dental smell can make people nervous if they are afraid of dentists."" I also found the pleasant smell in the office very nice.

Although he is known as Glasgow's most stylish dentist, Jerome takes his work very seriously. The relaxation methods are important, but the quality of treatment is the most important thing. For example, Jerome uses a special tool that sprays warm water on the teeth to clean them instead of scraping. It feels a bit strange at first, but as long as people are relaxed, it is not painful at all.

Five years ago, Jerome went to the United States to learn about dental techniques. ""One thing I learned there is that when you make it easier for the patient, it also makes it easier for you,"" he explains. He believes that his patient-focused approach is the beginning of a change towards a less formal style in British dentistry.

At that moment, a patient arrives. Jerome quickly goes over, offers him a cup of tea (herbal or regular), asks what video he would like to watch, and gently leads him to the chair. The patient seems to enjoy this special treatment, and it is easy to see why. The office feels more like a fancy beauty salon than a regular dental practice."

**Bitter Water Hits the Big Time**

Chocolate, which comes from South America, is now a huge global business worth millions of pounds. In the UK, people spend over £230 million on chocolate during Easter, which is about eight percent of all chocolate sales for the year. Only at Christmas do people buy more chocolate. 

Although chocolate production started on a large scale in the last century, the cacao plant was first grown by the Aztec, Toltec, and Mayan civilizations in Central America over three thousand years ago. The cacao tree is a tropical plant found in Africa, South and Central America, the West Indies, and Southeast Asia. Its fruit is the size of a melon and contains 20 to 40 seeds. When dried, these seeds become cacao beans, which are used to make chocolate. In English-speaking countries, they are often called cocoa beans, a name that comes from a spelling mistake in the 17th century.

The Aztecs used cocoa beans as money and made a drink called xocoatl, which means ""bitter water"" in their language, Nahuatl. This drink was flavored with spices and used in ceremonies and to welcome guests. The Spanish liked the drink better with cinnamon and sugar, but it took another hundred years for the recipe to reach the rest of Europe.

In the late 17th century, chocolate houses opened in major European cities where people could drink chocolate. Until the last century, the drink was made from solid chocolate blocks that had to be melted in hot water. In 1826, CJ van Houten from the Netherlands invented chocolate powder by removing most of the cocoa butter from the crushed beans. The chocolate bar we know today started in 1847 when a company in Bristol, Fry and Sons, mixed cocoa butter with chocolate liquor and sugar to create a solid block. A Swiss company later added milk solids to make milk chocolate.

At the beginning of the 20th century, French companies dominated the British chocolate market. In 1879, the English company Cadbury named their factory Bournville, hoping to attract some French style. Then, Cadbury introduced the Dairy Milk bar, which started as Dairymaid in 1905. Smart advertising linked it to the healthy qualities of milk from the English countryside, making it popular against French brands.

Currently, chocolate consumption in Britain is stable at about four bars per week. This has led manufacturers to find new ways to attract customers. One new idea is the ""extended line,"" where chocolate bars are turned into ice cream, soft drinks, or desserts to appeal to chocolate lovers who want something different.

However, cacao farmers are still struggling due to a drop in cocoa bean prices in the late 1980s. Many small-scale farmers went out of business. So, next time you enjoy a chocolate bar, think about the farmers who grow the cacao."
FCE_18,"**THE SHELL ARTIST**

At 83 years old, Peter Cooke has become a master in his craft. He still wants to try new things, like making paper and working with feathers, but for now, he focuses on creating beautiful objects from shells. As he shows me his work in his apartment, he asks, ""Am I boring you?"" There is a fine line between being boring and being passionate, but Cooke is definitely passionate, thanks to his charm and the beauty of his creations.

He points to some shell-covered decorations above his fireplace. ""I won’t mind if people don’t buy them because I love them,"" he says. He never intended to sell his work, but about five years ago, some friends encouraged him to have an exhibition so more people could see his art. This led to a successful exhibition in London, where 70% of his pieces were sold. His second exhibition opened yesterday, featuring 86 pieces, with prices starting at £225 for a shell flower in a crystal vase. Cooke says he has no control over the prices and is open about them. He believes that no one else makes art like his, and the gallery owner told him that one day, when he stops creating, everyone will want his pieces.

Cooke wishes he had started this work earlier in life because he believes he could have made even more amazing things. Although he still has many ideas, he feels limited physically compared to when he began. However, his work is very different from the common shell crafts found in seaside shops. ""I have a miniature mind,"" he says, which has led him to create boxes covered in thousands of tiny shells, small pictures made from shells, and baskets of incredibly realistic flowers.

He has developed his own methods and uses materials he finds. For example, he uses cardboard from laundered shirts for flower bases, a special glue from a sail-maker, and washing-up liquid to clean the shells. ""I have an idea of what I want to do, and it just happens,"" he explains. Yet, the detail and color in his work show that it is not random.

Cooke searches for beautiful, tiny shells not just on his local beaches in Norfolk, but also in places like France, Thailand, Mexico, South Africa, and the Philippines. He insists that he only collects dead shells and defends himself against critics who accuse him of harming the beaches. ""When I collect shells, I hear people walking on them much faster than I can collect them. The ones left behind are broken by the sea. I would never take shells with living creatures in them, but once they are empty, why shouldn’t I collect them?"" His argument is strong, especially considering the beauty he creates from the shells he collects."
FCE_62,"**The Schoolgirl Model**

Kira Langer is a 15-year-old girl who models and appears on magazine covers. When she is not working, she studies for her school exams. Jane Laidlaw shares more about her.

I arrived at the agency and the receptionist told me that Kira would be late. I was worried because I had read negative things about models, thinking they might be difficult or vain. I wondered how late she would be—an hour? Three hours? What if she decided to go to the hairdresser instead of meeting me? If she was late, she might be in a bad mood and not want to talk. 

However, when Kira, the winner of the Looks magazine supermodel competition, arrived, she was smiling and relaxed, accompanied by her mother. She was not wearing fancy clothes, just a simple black dress and trainers. Kira was friendly and seemed like a normal girl. Since she is under 16, she must have an adult with her when she works, and her mother looked proud of her.

Kira seems a bit confused by her sudden fame, which was unexpected. It was her older sister who encouraged her to enter the modeling competition. Kira initially said no, but her sister sent in some photos anyway. When Kira learned she was a finalist, she was at school. This achievement gave her the confidence to continue, and she won easily. The Select model agency in London offered her work right away.

Now, Kira finds it challenging to balance her two lives. Her friends and teachers are proud of her, but some people at school are not kind. They say she thinks too highly of herself. Kira finds this hard to handle because she is not arrogant. She explains, ""They think that because I became a model, I can't be the same person. The only thing that has changed is that I am more confident, but not in a bad way.""

Being a busy model affects her social life. The agency can call her at any time for a job the next day. She cannot make plans with her friends because she does not know her schedule. However, her friends understand and do not complain about her modeling.

Kira has the looks, talent, and support to have a great career ahead of her, even before finishing her school exams. As I finish the interview, I ask her what she would like to do if she didn't have her beauty. She thinks for a moment and replies, ""I would like to do what you are doing."""

Father and son start Gold Rush

Terence and Chris Madden have traveled from the cold north of Canada to the hot lands of Africa in search of valuable metals. The father and son team—one is an explorer and the other is a mineral expert—believe their mine on a Welsh mountain could have up to 10,000 ounces of gold. After ten years of digging in the Welsh hills, they think they are very close to finding a gold vein worth five million dollars. ""As we dig, we are finding high levels of gold; now we just need to dig a few more meters to where it is concentrated,"" said Terence, 68, from Liverpool.

The pair have dedicated their lives to finding gold. Their search began when Terence read about gold worth millions buried in the 'Dolgellau gold belt,' an area near the Welsh town of Dolgellau. While reading old mining journals and newspapers at the Welsh National Library in Aberystwyth, they chose the best area of land to explore. Since they first cleared the land and found pieces of gold in the rocks, they have spent the last ten years getting permission to work from the landowners, taking soil samples, and removing old cars and trash. They have dug out 150 tonnes of greenstone rock to create a tunnel and a 10-meter shaft.

Now, they are running out of money. They have spent their savings on this dream and need to convince someone to invest £50,000 to dig a few more meters to reach the gold. Chris Madden says, ""Right now, this seems unlikely, but we have a few people we can contact.""

As news spread through the valleys about their dig, the excitement of gold began to attract the attention of local people as well as gold diggers. Dolgellau depends on tourists, and residents are cautiously hopeful. ""It would bring more people here if they are right,"" said Peter Woolven, manager of the Royal Ship Hotel, ""but if these two find gold, I hope millions of people do not come and damage the hillside.""

The Welsh gold industry has greatly declined since its peak in the late 1880s when thousands of people worked in many mines across the countryside. One of the last remaining mines, Clogau-St David's, which made wedding rings for the Queen and the Princess of Wales, closed a month ago. However, individual gold diggers are returning. George Hall, another prospector, plans to dig a tunnel deep into the hill on the other side of the ridge from the Maddens. ""Searching for gold is very emotional,"" said Hall, 70. ""It's adventurous and exciting, the thrill of uncovering hidden treasure. Maybe I will be lucky this time."""
FCE_31,"**Text: IN HOT WATER**

Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends a lot of time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She teaches and researches marine geochemistry, which means she studies the chemical processes in the sea. Rachel is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she is not teaching, she gets into a small steel vehicle for underwater exploration and dives three kilometers down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes. 

Inside the vehicle, space is very limited. Rachel says, ""I can reach out and touch the two pilots."" They cannot stand up or move around, and they must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last for 16 hours: three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours to collect rock and water samples, and three hours to return to the surface. If there is a problem and they need to get to the top quickly, they can press a panic button. This releases a small escape vessel that rises quickly to the surface. Rachel adds, ""No one's tested it yet, but I don't think it would be a very pleasant journey.""

Rachel remembers her first time in the vehicle. It was on a ship, and she got in with an instructor who explained the emergency procedures, including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack. They were testing how she would react in such a small space. Now, Rachel has made six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian crew. They traveled five days west of the Canary Islands in the Atlantic to a site with many underwater volcanoes, where black smoke comes out of the chimneys. The Russian team was dropping off scientific equipment to study a project that would create a hole 150 meters through a volcano.

When Rachel is not at sea, she works in her office at the Oceanography Centre in Southampton. She says, ""Two-thirds of my salary comes from teaching, which I love, but I do it so I can continue my research on the 'black smokers.'"" This is another name for underwater volcanoes, where water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke. This water flows out at a rate of one meter per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees.

Rachel recalls a frightening moment when she first dived with an American team. They were towing equipment when suddenly there was an explosion. She heard a huge bang as shock waves hit their vehicle, and she thought, ""I'm going to die."" They waited in silence, and when nothing happened, they felt incredible relief—they were still alive!

Diving to the deepest part of the ocean is an adventure for Rachel. Every time she looks out of the porthole and sees the chimneys, she feels a sense of wonder. She thinks, ""Here I am at the bottom of the sea, and no one else on this planet has ever seen them."" After studying the black smokers for three years for her PhD, seeing them in person was an amazing experience."
FCE_58,"Text: ""I was dirty, smelly, hungry, and a bit sunburned. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. My body was tired, and my mind was confused by foreign train schedules, money, and languages. 'Never again,' I said as I returned home. I said the same thing the next year and the year after that. All I needed was one train ticket, and because I was under twenty-five, I could travel anywhere in Europe for a whole month. 

Sleeping in a train corridor is different from sleeping in a regular bed; the train's movement rocks you to sleep. Carrying all your things in a backpack makes you travel simply and can lead to wasteful habits, like burning socks that smell bad or throwing away finished books. However, this carefree way of traveling is part of the Inter-Rail spirit, where common sense can be forgotten along with your paperback book and socks. All you need is one of those tickets in your hand. 

A system that lets young people travel through many countries in one day is special. On my first trip, my friends and I didn’t realize how much we could do with this train ticket. We thought it was just a cheap way to get to our campsite in southern France. But the idea of traveling non-stop was too exciting; there was always another country just over the border. And the extra miles? They cost us nothing. 

We were not completely uninterested in culture, but this was our first holiday without parents, like many other Inter-Railers. We planned our own schedule and focused only on the sights we could easily see. It was a chance to escape guided tours and do something different. I was proud that in many places, all I wanted to see was the view from the train station. We were just trying to enjoy ourselves, like most other Inter-Railers who shared train corridors, food, money, and music with us. 

The excitement of travel comes from arriving in a place that was just a name before. It feels like the city didn’t exist until the train arrives, and you see it with your own tired eyes for the first time. Only by seeing Europe, watching the changing landscapes, and noticing different lifestyles can you truly understand the continent. Everyone knows what is there, but it means nothing until you see it yourself. This is why other people's holiday photos can be boring. While the train trip may not let you discover new things in the world, it is a valuable personal experience. Europe is large, and Inter-Rail gives people a great chance to realize this, even if it didn’t happen for us right away."""

Arriving at an airport in another country and finding out that your luggage has been left behind can be very disappointing. At best, you will have to wear the same clothes for hours or even days until the airline returns your bags. At worst, you might be in a different climate, far from home, and stuck in clothes that are not suitable for the weather. 

Airlines do not often share how many bags they lose, but it is common for travelers to experience this problem at some point. Even the best airlines can make mistakes, and it is not always possible for them to ensure that your checked luggage travels on the same flight as you, especially if you have to change planes during your journey. 

The system works like this: Airlines require passengers to check in early, which gives enough time for bags to be processed and loaded onto the plane. Minimum connecting times (MCTs) are the shortest time needed to transfer between flights, and these times are also extended to help with baggage transfers. Usually, this system works well. However, extra security checks and air traffic issues can lead to flight delays, which can cause problems with luggage handling. 

Human error can also happen, such as when a destination label gets torn off a bag. These issues can be worse at large airports, known as 'hubs', because they handle many bags. For example, last year, London’s Heathrow airport served over 41 million passengers, with nine million of them changing planes. British Airways alone had two million transfer passengers at Heathrow, most of whom had to transfer between Terminal 1 (for domestic and European flights) and Terminal 4 (for long-distance flights). 

Even efficient airports like Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Singapore, and Zurich can have bad days. The chance of losing luggage when changing planes is higher at some airports. In the United States, Miami airport is known for losing bags when passengers make quick connections to Latin America. 

To avoid losing your luggage, try to book direct flights whenever you can and check in early. If you must change planes, it is best to fly with the same airline for all your flights. Allow extra time for connections by taking an earlier flight to the transfer airport, and make sure to label your luggage with your home and holiday addresses, including your flight numbers. 

If your luggage still goes missing, contact the airline staff in the baggage area and fill out a property irregularity report (PIR) before leaving the airport."
FCE_2,"**The Kingfisher**

Wildlife photographer Charlie James is an expert on the kingfisher, a beautiful blue-green bird that lives near streams and rivers and feeds on fish. Old trees hang over the stream, providing some shade to the shallow water. The main colors in this scene are soft greens, browns, and various yellows from the sunlight, creating a calm atmosphere like the gentle sounds of water in the breeze. The kingfisher moves quickly and gracefully, almost like a flash of light, and it is gone in an instant. However, its image stays in your mind, and its impact is much greater than its small size.

Charlie James fell in love with kingfishers when he was young. He feels a strong connection to this little bird, but he cannot explain exactly why. The kingfisher is part of many legends. In Greek mythology, it is a moon goddess that turned into a bird. Another story says that the kingfisher flew so high that its upper body became the blue of the sky, while its lower body was burned by the sun. There is some truth to this story. Even though kingfishers have many shades of blue, they do not have blue pigment in their feathers. Instead, the structure of their feathers scatters light, making them appear blue. This is why a kingfisher can look bright blue or rich emerald green depending on the angle of the light.

It is no surprise that many wildlife photographers love kingfishers. Their beautiful colors and the fact that they can be watched from a distance make them fascinating. Charlie James's first hideout was an old blanket he put over his head while waiting near a kingfisher's favorite spot. The bird returned within minutes and sat just one meter away. However, it took him four more years to take his first good picture. During this time, the European kingfisher became a big part of his life. He spent as much time as possible by a stream where kingfishers lived. Unfortunately, school took away some of his time with the birds, and he missed classes, calling himself an ""academic failure."" But his passion for this widespread kingfisher, the only one that breeds in Europe, was noticed. At 16, he was hired as an advisor for a nature magazine. He later worked as an assistant to the editor and eventually became a freelance wildlife film cameraman.

Now, he dreams of making the perfect kingfisher film. ""No speech, just beautiful images that say it all,"" he says. ""I like to photograph parts of kingfisher wings..."" His voice trails off as he thinks about the colors of the bird he has spent more than half his life observing, which still fascinates him. His photographs express some of his feelings, but Charlie knows that there is much more to his relationship with the kingfisher than what his work can show."
FCE_68,"**Text: Conducting an Orchestra**

Giving directions to an orchestra is not easy. Anne Inglis talks to five new conductors about their experiences.

**A. ANNE MANSON**  
Anne Manson, 30, asked to attend conductor Claudio Abbado's practice sessions in Vienna. She ended up filling in for an absent assistant and was later asked to help with another opera. ""I had to lead the first orchestral rehearsal for Abbado. I wasn't nervous. I have always felt good about standing in front of an orchestra."" Manson, who is from America, works with a well-known opera company in London that focuses on modern works. She is also gaining recognition in other European countries, thanks to support from the British Arts Council. Since her first experience, she has assisted Abbado on several projects.

**B. ANDREW CONSTANTINE**  
Andrew Constantine, 31, believes the hardest part of being a conductor is finding the right opportunities. He won a major competition in 1991 after trying twice before. Looking back, he feels lucky about the timing: ""If it had happened earlier, I would have been forgotten."" The competition gave him many chances to perform and a role as an assistant to a famous conductor. However, he finds it hard to shake off the ""competition"" label: ""If in three years my name is still linked to the competition, I will be worried."" Fortunately, orchestras like the English Chamber Orchestra, which hired him after the competition, are inviting him back. If this doesn't happen, his career could suffer.

**C. WASFI KANI**  
Wasfi Kani, who founded Pimlico Opera, enjoys the long practice periods that come with opera productions. ""The music deserves four weeks of attention,"" she says. Kani began conducting seriously in her late twenties. After university, she worked in London until Pimlico Opera became fully professional two years ago. Taking lessons with Sian Edwards was a turning point for her. ""I saw her conduct and realized she was my size. I had always learned from much bigger people, which makes a big difference."" She appreciates the complexity of opera: ""There are many arguments, and you have to consider the personalities of the singers.""

**D. ROGER VIGNOLES**  
Roger Vignoles, 48, says, ""Conducting surprised me, but it fascinates me."" He started as a musician in an opera house and worked with good conductors. Last year, he was asked to direct Handel's Agrippina from the piano at a festival, something he had never done before. ""It was easier than I expected. I knew the music well and what I wanted it to sound like. I tried my best to achieve the performance I wanted. People respect my skills as a musician. I learn from every experience I've had, both in musical style and performance. Now, I will do whatever people ask to discover what I enjoy.""

**E. WAYNE MARSHALL**  
In 1986, conductor Simon Rattle noticed Wayne Marshall, a young assistant conductor, and told his agent about him. Now 32, Marshall soon found himself conducting a musical in London on short notice, which was a tough start. He had to manage some relaxed professional musicians who were reading newspapers during the show: ""I was firm with them. I always gave a clear beat and aimed for the best result. Many orchestral musicians I’ve seen don’t seem to need advice from a conductor. But I’m never afraid to express what I want. If people see you are worried, it gets worse. I have never studied conducting formally, and no book teaches you how to conduct, but people have been kind to me. I am determined and know what I like."""
FCE_23,"**Variations on a Theme**

If you are thinking about taking children to a theme park, there are many options in Britain. We asked five families to review some of the best parks.

**Fun Island - The Burns Family**  
Last year, we visited a large theme park in the US and thought Fun Island would be boring in comparison. However, we were pleasantly surprised. The park is great for younger children, so our three-year-old felt included. The kids loved the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. There is a special dodgems ride for very young kids, which was a big hit. For older children, there are scarier rides like Splash Out, where you jump into a pool! After five hours, my husband Steve and I were ready to leave, but the kids wanted to stay because they were having so much fun. Our only complaint is that the park could use more atmosphere and better scenery. However, the staff were very helpful, and we found the park to be clean, well-organized, and safe.

**Wonderland - The McMillan Family**  
None of us had been to a theme park before, so we didn’t know what to expect. We thought our son Oscar might be too young, but he loved it. He enjoyed the Mountain Train and especially liked Little Land, which has small models of famous buildings. The older kids liked the ferris wheel and driving toy cars on a real road layout. We spent six hours there and appreciated the places to relax. The landscaping was beautiful, and the staff were friendly and helpful. There was something for everyone, including adults.

**Adventure World - The Jeffree Family**  
After seven hours, we still felt there was more to see. The children loved the Big Top Circus, which had an amazing trapeze act. We tried the Terror Line, and although the girls were scared and kept their eyes shut, they said they enjoyed it. Their favorite ride was Running River, where you think you will get wet, but you don’t. Toy Land is also great fun for younger children. The kids looked at the new ride, Fear Factor, but we were relieved they were too small to go on it! The park is so well designed that even waiting in line for rides isn’t boring. It was very clean, and the staff were wonderful. On one ride, I couldn’t sit with both girls, so a staff member offered to sit with one of them.

**The Great Park - The Langridge Family**  
We arrived at one o'clock and were disappointed that the park closed at 5 p.m. This is a great theme park for younger children because the rides are not too scary. I am not very brave, but I still had fun. We all loved Exotic Travels, a boat ride that starts slowly and then becomes very exciting. We waited for half an hour for Lightning River, and it was over too quickly! I wouldn’t go on the Big Leap, but it looked fun if you are brave enough. If the children had been a bit older, they might have found it too easy, but they were the right age and loved it.

**Fantasy World - The Break-all Family**  
According to the park's advertising, there is 'No Limit to the Fun', and we definitely felt that way. Europe's tallest roller-coaster, the Rocket, is the main attraction, and Ben thought it was the scariest ride. Jennie thought the Hanger, where you hang upside-down 30 meters above the ground, was even worse! There are about a dozen main rides, which the older children went on several times. Sarah was too small for some rides but enjoyed the Long Slide. We found the staff's attitudes varied. Some were great with younger children, but the welcome was not always friendly. You need a full day to enjoy Fantasy World. We wouldn’t have dared tell the kids we were going home early."
FCE_60,"**Running a Business in the Countryside**

Five women share their experiences of starting a business in the countryside.

A. **Christine Hogan** runs a computer-aided design business that earns over £200,000 a year and has four full-time employees. She says, ""My customers are friends."" Christine moved from London to the countryside when her children were young. She wanted a job she could do from home. Since she had experience with computers, her husband suggested she start a computer-aided design business. It was challenging at first and required a lot of money. However, she was careful with her spending and kept the bank informed. Working from home saves money, and she can work in the evenings if needed. Her business remains small, and most customers pick up their work instead of having it delivered.

B. **Maggy Sasanow** is a greetings card designer who works from home. She studied art at university and wanted to work in a museum, but after moving to the countryside, she decided to start her own business. She creates a range of 50 greetings cards that she sells to museums. Maggy works in a large room upstairs. One downside of working from home is that there are always chores to do, like mowing the lawn. She does not advertise her business; instead, customers hear about her through word of mouth. Although she misses sharing ideas with others, she believes the benefits of working alone outweigh the drawbacks.

C. **Delia Turner** runs a curtain-making business that has faced ups and downs. She started her business eight years ago when it was growing. In two years, her earnings increased from £24,000 to £80,000, and she employed six full-time workers. However, due to a decline in the economy, she had to let them go, which was difficult because jobs are hard to find in her area. Now, she makes curtains at home with her husband’s help and works with women who also work from home. Delia knows she must lower her prices when needed and look for new opportunities.

D. **Tessa Strickland** manages her children's book publishing business from her farmhouse. She moved to the countryside three years ago for financial reasons and because she loves the area. Tessa enjoys the flexibility of working when she wants. Most of her income comes from deals with Australia, the Far East, and North America, so she often takes calls at unusual hours. The challenge is staying disciplined and closing the office door when needed. She publishes children's books from different cultures and collaborates with authors and artists. Initially, she felt lonely because all her professional experience was in London.

E. **Meg Rivers** runs a cakes-by-post business and a shop that earns £250,000 a year and employs six people, some part-time. She started her business ten years ago at home. Interested in health, she began making fruit cakes with high-quality ingredients. Friends and family started asking for cakes, and soon she was sending them all over the country. Seven years ago, she rented a small building where everything is made, and now she has a baker and an assistant. Meg no longer bakes herself, as she focuses on managing the business. Her biggest challenge has been the financial side, as she did not have a lot of money to start with."
FCE_1,"**Meet the Amazing Watkins Family**

The Watkins family is special because they are all involved in music. The sons are composers and award-winning musicians, while their dad makes musical instruments. 

John and Hetty Watkins, who are teachers in South Wales, wanted to buy a cello for their ten-year-old son, Paul, but found it too expensive. John thought about making one himself. He discovered a school nearby that offered evening classes in instrument making and attended for about three years. 

After trying to make violins and violas, John finally made his first cello, which Paul loved. John has now retired from teaching and works full-time as a craftsman, making about twelve violins each year. One of his violins was even sold to a famous American musician, Jaime Laredo.

Paul and his younger brother, Huw, started playing music when they were young. Paul remembers climbing up to play the piano as soon as he could. Although their dad wanted Paul to play the violin, Paul was more interested in the cello player in his dad's music group. He took cello lessons and really enjoyed it. Huw, on the other hand, did not want to play the violin.

Huw, now 22, is becoming a successful pianist and composer. Paul has achieved great things with the cello his dad made. He won the string final of the BBC Young Musician of the Year competition and became the principal cellist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra at just 20 years old. He played his father's cello until recently when he borrowed a 304-year-old cello from the Royal Academy of Music.

Paul will soon perform on television with his new cello in Elgar's Cello Concerto. He believes that even though the piece has a famous history, he will play it in his own style. However, he will not be able to watch himself on TV because he will be performing at the Cheltenham Festival that same night. Huw will also be busy, as his String Quartet will have its London premiere at the Wigmore Hall that evening. John and Hetty will have to be very organized to keep up with all their sons' musical events in the coming weeks."
FCE_53,"**Looking after the Countryside: The National Trust**

The National Trust is an organization that aims to protect the British countryside. Gill Page visits the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and speaks with Gareth Roberts, a warden who works for the Trust to care for its beautiful areas.

According to Gareth, a National Trust Warden needs common sense and good people skills. ""You are always dealing with farmers, visitors, conservationists, and building companies,"" he explains. Gareth grew up on the Lleyn Peninsula and worked on his parents' farm until he got married. About 80 people applied for the job of National Trust Warden for the Lleyn Peninsula. In the end, Gareth's local knowledge and farming experience helped him get the job, even though he did not have formal training. 

Gareth says that working on the farm helps him understand the farmers' problems. ""I can talk to them on the same level,"" he says. His farming background also helps him handle the physical work of the job, like building fences, planting trees, and repairing walls. Since joining the Trust, Gareth has learned more about nature conservation. He remembers picking flowers and collecting butterflies when he was younger. Now, he wonders where he would find those flowers and nests. He realizes that farming has changed the countryside, but he believes it is not the farmers' fault; they were just following government advice.

When Gareth started his job, farmers and conservationists often disagreed. Both sides wanted things done their way. Now, they are talking and understanding each other better. ""We are at a crossroads, and it only takes a small step to bring them together,"" Gareth says. 

Gareth's work includes conservation, allowing public access to Trust land, planting trees, and working with tenant farmers. ""My job is to make sure tasks are completed efficiently and without too much trouble,"" he explains. He enjoys seeing projects finished, but he spends about half his time on reports and paperwork.

Gareth is passionate about his job and enjoys talking to the public, although he finds some people's attitudes frustrating. ""Some visitors come in, demand everything, and leave as if they have a right to it,"" he admits. ""Being polite to those people can be annoying!"" But, as Gareth says, it all comes down to common sense. 

If you have plenty of common sense and like outdoor work, you might consider applying to be a warden like Gareth. However, don't expect a job to open up on the Lleyn Peninsula for a long time!"
FCE_55,"**The Netball Captain**

In our series about women in sports, Suzie Ellis met England's netball captain, Kendra Slowinski. Kendra is the captain of the England netball team. When I met her, she was having a typical day as she prepared for the World Championships next month. She had taught at a local school and then trained in a supermarket car park. 

I asked her, ""Don't you get strange looks?"" She replied, ""I'm too focused on my movements and my feet to notice anything else. I might see cars slow down out of the corner of my eye, but that's all."" 

Kendra said, ""My whole life now is about being my best for the Championships. I have a strict schedule to get fit."" This will be her fourth World Championships, and it will be the biggest one yet, with 27 countries participating. ""We will have home support, which is very special,"" she said. ""It's important to improve the reputation of netball in this country. There will be more pressure because of the home crowd. People expect us to start the tournament with a good game.""

Their first match is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. ""As far as I know, we have always beaten them, but they will be exciting to play. They have a lot of talent."" The England team is currently ranked fourth in the world. However, Kendra warns that the World Championships will be challenging. ""You have to push yourself to play every day. There is no rest between games like in a series. You can still win a series if you lose the first game, but the Championships are different. You only have one chance, and you must be ready to take it.""

In the fifteen years she has played at a high level, the sport has become harder and faster. Players are more aggressive on the court. ""You don’t train hard not to win,"" Kendra says. ""But once the game is over, we become friends again."" 

Netball is also using more scientific methods for fitness testing. ""It is important that we all think and train like world-class players,"" Kendra explains. ""As captain, I believe I should have a strong mental attitude and lead by example. I see my role as supporting and encouraging my team.""

Kendra adds, ""From the start of my netball career, everything has been carefully planned. I decided some time ago that this competition would be my last as a player."" She will likely coach young players in the future, but for now, she is focused on her final big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she may have tears in her eyes."
FCE_50,"**SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS**

How can parents help a child with exceptional musical talent? It can be difficult to know the best way to support their gift. Some parents may not realize their child's needs until they show frustration through difficult behavior. While most schools can support children who excel in academic subjects, musically gifted children often need special attention that regular schools may not provide, especially if music is not a priority there. 

Children who are musically talented, and those whose abilities are encouraged by their parents or teachers, may benefit from attending a specialist music school. In Britain, there are five such schools, which have been established recently. These schools create a supportive environment for gifted children aged seven to eighteen, allowing them to develop their musical skills with the help of professional musicians.

At specialist music schools, students spend about one third to one half of their day on music activities. This includes individual lessons (up to three hours a week for their main instruments), playing in orchestras and chamber groups, voice training, conducting, and music theory. They also practice in well-equipped private rooms, sometimes with a teacher. The rest of their time is spent on a limited academic program that focuses on essential subjects like English, math, basic sciences, and languages, although students can study more subjects if they wish.

All five British specialist music schools are independent, with small class sizes and a high number of teachers compared to students. Most children at these schools live there full-time, which means they spend their formative years with peers who share similar goals and interests.

However, there are some disadvantages. One major issue is the cost; fees can be high (between £12,000 and £17,000 a year for boarders). Each school tries to help parents of gifted children with scholarships and financial aid. Additionally, not all parents want to send their children to boarding school, especially at a young age. Many directors of these schools have concerns about admitting children as young as seven into such a strict environment. They emphasize that their goal is to help children become well-rounded individuals.

It is important to note that separating musically gifted children from their peers at an early age can create stress. Some early signs of musical talent may fade during the teenage years, and the pressure to succeed can lead to feelings of failure. However, all specialist schools monitor their students closely and provide help when needed.

While many former students feel they gained a lot from the high-quality music education, some worry about the limited academic program, which often takes a back seat to music. Many musically talented young people are also very intelligent and can handle academic challenges, so they may feel frustrated if their academic needs are not met.

For these reasons, it might be better to wait until a child is older and can make their own choices before considering a specialist music education. Children who are also academically gifted may thrive in a regular school with a strong music program or by combining a normal school schedule with music training at junior departments of music colleges. These colleges offer Saturday morning lessons with excellent teachers, as well as orchestral and chamber music experiences. However, this option may not be available for families living far from London or other major cities."
FCE_25,"**Text: An Eye for Detail**

Artist Susan Shepherd is well-known for her flower paintings. The large garden around her house provides many of her subjects. It is filled with her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wildly and spread all over the garden. The two long flower borders along the path that goes from east to west are full of color, shape, and structure. This beauty is partly due to the previous owners, who loved gardening and left plants that Susan liked. She also kept the gardener, Danny. ""In fact, it was really his garden,"" she says. ""We got along very well. At first, he would say, 'Oh, it's not worth it' for some of the things I wanted to add, but when I told him I wanted to paint them, he understood what I meant.""

Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants instead of painting the whole garden. Sometimes, she paints a group of plants, but usually, she picks one flower and takes it to her studio. ""I don't set everything up at once,"" she explains. ""I take one flower out and paint it, which might take a few days, and then I bring in another one to add to the painting. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.""

Her busiest time is spring and early summer when the tulips bloom, followed by the poppies. ""They all come out together, and you're so busy,"" she says. But she also finds beauty in the way flowers change as they decay. For example, with tulips, ""you bring them in and put them in water, then leave them for a day, and they change shape. They open up and look amazing. At first, you think they are boring, but they keep changing.""

Susan has always loved plants. ""I studied botany in school and used to collect wildflowers from the countryside,"" she says. ""I wasn't really interested in gardening then; I didn't like garden flowers because they looked fake, like silk or plastic ones sold in shops. I was fascinated by how wildflowers could grow in difficult places, like cracks in rocks or on cliffs.""

Today, her garden has many plants from faraway places, but they seem just as comfortable in her garden as they do in their original homes, like China or the Himalayas. She has a relaxed attitude towards her garden, like a caring aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don't cause serious trouble. With two upcoming exhibitions to prepare for and plenty of subjects to paint right outside her door, it has been hard for her to find time to work in the garden. She now hires an extra gardener, but she knows that to stay connected with her art, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""
FCE_34,"**Text: Keeping Holiday-Makers Happy**

Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex, is in her second year as a chalet girl in Val d'Isère, France. She works for a company that provides cooking and cleaning services for visitors who come to ski and stay in wooden houses called chalets. Sarah graduated last summer from Oxford Brookes University, where she studied French and History of Art. She sees being a chalet girl as a fun way to spend a year or two before starting a more permanent job. ""It's a good way to meet successful people,"" she says.

Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to work. She has her own breakfast before preparing breakfast for the guests, which includes porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants. After breakfast, around 9:30 a.m., she cleans up and either makes afternoon tea for the guests or cleans the rooms, which she finds the least enjoyable part of her job. By 11 a.m., she is ready to ski. ""On a good day, we can ski until 4:30 p.m.,"" she says.

After skiing, Sarah returns to the chalet to prepare dinner. She takes a shower first but does not sleep because she believes it would make her feel worse. Dinner is served at 8 p.m., and coffee is usually ready by 10 p.m. After dinner, she cleans the kitchen. ""There's nothing worse than coming into a messy kitchen the next morning,"" she explains. Sometimes she chats with the guests, but other times they prefer to be alone. ""Good guests can make a week great, but some weeks are not as good for various reasons,"" she adds.

Sarah lives in a chalet with her friends, and they usually go out around 11 p.m. They often start their night at a place called Bananas, then go to G Jay's, and maybe end the night at Dick's T-Bar. However, she does not stay out too late on Saturday nights because Sunday is her busiest day. ""It's a tough day when you don’t want to cook breakfast feeling tired,"" she says. 

On Sundays, she starts work earlier, with breakfast for guests ready by 7 a.m. After the guests leave, she cleans quickly, clearing breakfast, stripping beds, and getting everything ready for the new guests. If she hasn’t done the shopping on Saturday, she does it now. By around 3 p.m., after cleaning, she prepares tea for the new guests who arrive around 4:30 p.m. Sometimes they are confused and have many questions. ""I think the mountain air affects them,"" she jokes.

Between tea and dinner, Sarah helps guests who need ski boots or equipment and then gets a ride back to the chalet. Soon, it is time for dinner again, and she might chat with friends, but sometimes she is too tired and goes to bed early."

Mandie Currie is a zoo-keeper who spent a day at the magazine Marie Claire. ""Choosing what to wear was hard because I usually wear a uniform at the zoo. I first went to a photo studio, then to press previews, all before lunch. The zoo is a calm place, and I felt rushed here when I could be quietly with an animal. Some fashion team members seemed stressed, but my job is not very stressful. During a fashion shoot in the afternoon, I laughed thinking about how I usually clean cages or handle rats. I find it interesting to see how magazines work, but I really enjoy my job at the zoo, so I will stay there.""

Alice Cutler, a fashion assistant at Marie Claire, spent a day at London Zoo. ""I arrived in my leather boots and dark blue trousers. The zoo gave me a green polo shirt to wear, which was good because I got very dirty. While I stroked an elephant, I thought Mandie was probably packing clothes. By five o'clock, I was dirty but had a great day. When I retire from fashion, I could see myself working with elephants, maybe in Africa.""

Karen Hodson, a nurse at Hammersmith Hospital, worked with the television gardening show Ground Force. ""I was very excited to meet the team, and Alan Titchmarsh, the presenter, was really nice. I enjoyed being outside because I sometimes don’t see daylight due to my shifts. Even though it was hard work, it was fun. I thought I was strong, but I felt weak compared to the team. I didn’t expect gardening to be so physically demanding or require so much planning. I am more enthusiastic than effective at gardening, so I don’t plan to quit my nursing job.""

Charlie Dimmock, a landscape gardener on Ground Force, worked a shift at Hammersmith Hospital. ""I made beds and handed out medicine. I thought I would feel faint doing some tasks, but I was surprised that it didn’t bother me. The friendship among the nurses was great, and it felt very different from my usual male work environment. I feel my job is less important compared to nursing. My day at the hospital was not pleasant, but it gave me a great sense of satisfaction.""

Lucy Harvey, a personal trainer, spent a day with Ryanair as cabin crew. ""I changed into the uniform, and as soon as I put it on, I felt different—people looked up to me. Before the flight, our supervisor talked about safety and what to do if someone had a heart attack, which I knew from my fitness training. When passengers boarded the flight to Paris, I handed out magazines. Everyone stared at me, and I felt very self-conscious. On the return flight, we had 80 schoolchildren who wouldn’t sit still. I wished I was back in the gym with one sensible adult.""

Sonia McDermott, an air hostess with Ryanair, spent a day as a personal trainer in a gym. ""I was nervous about this swap because I don’t exercise. I was surprised by how much attention you give to one person. In my job, I meet 130 passengers four times a day. At lunch, I was surprised to see that some trainers didn’t eat very healthily, but they all drank a lot of water. I wouldn’t change my job for this, but it has inspired me to join a gym and try to be healthier."""
FCE_26,"**On the Rails: Five Celebrities Share Their Favorite Train Memories**

**A. Andrea Thompson - Newsreader**  
I fell in love with the south of France a long time ago and try to visit as often as I can. There is a local train from Cannes that goes along the coast and crosses into Italy. It takes you past some beautiful sea views. No matter the weather or the time of year, the journey is always magical. Out of the other window, you can see some of the best gardens and homes in France. It feels like you are looking into the lives of the rich and famous. The passengers are always lively, with a mix of tourists and locals, all enjoying the stunning trip.

**B. Raj Patel - Explorer**  
I have had many great train journeys, but my favorite is the Nile Valley Express, which travels through the desert in northern Sudan. When I was young in South Africa, I missed a family train trip from Cape Town to the Kruger National Park because I was considered too young and troublesome. I was sent to stay with an aunt instead. When I moved to England as a teenager, I still hadn’t traveled by train. London Waterloo was the first real train station I saw, and its large glass dome amazed me.

**C. Betty Cooper - Novelist**  
I am very grateful to one train in particular: the Blue Train, which took my husband and me on our honeymoon across France to catch a boat to Egypt. On the train, my husband gave me a pink dress, which I thought was wonderful. Someone said that pink is good for the brain, and I have worn it ever since. The journey was lovely, traveling through France and then by boat up the Nile. It was the perfect way to relax after all the wedding planning.

**D. Martin Brown - Journalist**  
We were working on articles about a round-the-world trip and had to cross a desert in Africa. There was no road, so we took the Desert Express. The schedule was not reliable; we were just told to wait for a day. We heard that the driver would often wait for days if he knew people were still coming. When the train finally arrived, many people rushed to get on, even climbing onto the roof for free. At night, the train passed through some of the most beautiful landscapes I have ever seen. It felt like a dream, like traveling across the moon.

**E. Arisu Mezuki - Actress**  
Most people form their favorite memories of trains when they are young, but that’s not my case. I grew up in Singapore and Cyprus, where I saw very few trains. It wasn’t until I was a teenager that trains became important in my life. I made a film that featured a railway in Yorkshire. Most of the filming was on an old, unused part of the line that volunteers had taken care of. That’s where my love for steam trains began. When we weren’t filming, we took every chance to ride the train, and when I returned last year, it felt like time had stopped. Everything was still the same, even the gas lights on the station platform!"

Are you trying to get your story published? If you are unsure where to send it, our expert Margaret Stubbs can help. Many readers of this magazine ask, ""I have written a story/book. Who should I send it to?"" 

First, you need to research the market and learn about publishers. It is also important to practice your writing skills. Turning your writing into something that can be sold requires knowledge about the publishing world. No matter what type of writing you do, you should understand the markets you want to reach. 

One of the best ways to learn about these markets is to read as much as you can. Visit your local library, bookshops, and newsagents. Reading widely will help you understand what kinds of writing publishers are currently accepting. Remember, this knowledge needs to be updated regularly because new publications come out all the time, and editors may change jobs or focus on different topics.

If you are unsure about what to write, let’s say you want to write short love stories. First, find out which magazines publish love stories, as this market is quite limited today. Get recent copies of these magazines and see what types of stories they are buying. Pay attention to who their readers are, as these readers have specific expectations, and the editor wants to meet those needs.

Writers often ask me, ""This story has been rejected three times. Am I wasting my time? Do I have a chance?"" As a former teacher, I never want to discourage anyone. However, it is likely that the work is not yet ready for publication. Many new writers are too eager to send out their work before they are prepared. If you have only written one story or article, it is very unlikely to be published. This is rare. When you hear about someone’s success, they usually have years of experience in publishing or journalism before achieving it.

When you finally send out your work, keep writing more stories while you wait for a response. Write ten more stories, or even twenty. Each one will improve your skills, and you will start to see yourself as a writer, which will boost your confidence. Instead of giving up on your stories, work on improving them. 

In the beginning, I recommend not sharing your work with others. Remember, every successful writer has faced many rejections before finding success. Do everything you can to advance your writing career. Look for a creative writing course nearby, or join a local writers' group to gain ideas and confidence from other aspiring writers. Think of yourself as a writer and practice writing every day if you can."

On the last day of a difficult year, I was waiting at the Baltimore railway station for the 10:10 train to Philadelphia. There were more people than I expected. The usual clean and bright feeling of the station was gone. Elderly couples with matching luggage filled the benches, and many college students had left their bags on the floor. A grey-haired man was walking around, talking to different people. He looked well-off with his tanned skin, nice sweater, and soft beige coat. He approached a woman sitting alone and asked her a question. Then he came to a girl near me, who had long blond hair. I thought about talking to her too. The man asked, ""Are you going to Philadelphia?"" She replied, ""I’m going north, but to New York."" He thanked her and moved on.

Now, I was paying close attention. He asked an old lady if she was going to Philadelphia, but when she said she was going to Wilmington, he just walked away. I moved closer, pretending to look at the platform. I was going to Philadelphia, and I understood why he didn’t ask me. He probably thought I looked unreliable. He quickly glanced at me and then went to the other end of the waiting area. He looked stressed and asked a woman reading a book, ""Please tell me you’re going to Philadelphia!"" She looked up and said, ""Yes, I am.""

""Could I ask you a favor?"" he said. I stood a few feet away, pretending to check my wrist, even though I didn’t have a watch. I could tell the woman was becoming cautious. The man noticed too and said, ""I promise it’s nothing too difficult!"" They announced my train, and people started moving toward Gate E, pulling their wheeled bags behind them.

The man explained, ""My daughter is flying out this afternoon for a study year abroad from Philadelphia. I put her on a train this morning, went grocery shopping, and came home to find my wife upset. My daughter forgot her passport and called from the station in Philadelphia, not knowing what to do."" The woman listened sympathetically. I would have stayed quiet to see where this was going. 

""So I told her to stay at the station, and I would get someone to bring her passport."" I thought it was strange he didn’t go himself if it was so urgent. The woman asked, ""Why don’t you go yourself?"" He replied, ""I can’t leave my wife alone for that long. She’s in a wheelchair."" I thought this was a weak excuse. I looked at them again. The man was holding a padded envelope, not a plain one, which seemed odd. It looked stapled shut too. I thought to myself, ""Be careful, lady."""

John Moore, the owner of a restaurant, talks about his relationship with his son Gary, who is a famous TV chef. John believes that everyone has a chance in life. His chance was to run a restaurant, and Gary's chance was to cook. When John found out about a restaurant for sale, he quickly went to see it. The place was in bad condition, but it was just what he wanted.

Running the restaurant reminded John of his childhood. He remembers being sad when his mother went to work in a factory and left him alone. Because of this, he wanted to make time for family. His wife took care of their children and managed the finances while John ran the restaurant. They lived above the restaurant and always made sure to have meals together. This helped their children, Gary and Joe, become confident. From a young age, they would talk to the regular customers, which gave them a good start in life.

Gary was a lively child. When he was about seven, he jumped into a corner bath like it was a swimming pool and knocked himself out. As he grew older, he had to earn pocket money. He started with small jobs and by age ten, he was working in the kitchen every weekend, which gave him plenty of money at school. He was disciplined and often woke up before his father. In a family business, everyone helps out, and John was happy to see Gary working.

Although Gary was not very good at school, he excelled in the kitchen. By age 15, he was as skilled as the adult chefs and sometimes even managed the kitchen. He could prepare over a hundred meals, and John knew Gary would pursue a career in catering. When Gary needed work experience for school, John sent him to a friend’s restaurant.

Recently, Gary started playing the drums and formed his own band. John wonders what will happen to Gary's cooking if his music career takes off. He advised Gary to focus on one thing at a time, saying, ""If you chase two hares, you catch neither."" John also told Gary that he needed to achieve his goals by age 30, or it might be too late.

At 17, Gary went to catering college. On his first day, while other students were just starting, Gary quickly chopped vegetables and sliced meats, finishing his work in an hour. He even helped others with their tasks. John is amazed by how successful Gary's TV cooking show has become and feels very proud of him. He has always taught Gary that hard work is necessary to achieve anything because no one gives you success for free. Gary has recognized the opportunities he has and has taken full advantage of them. John believes that as children grow up, they may only remember a small part of what their parents say, but he is happy that Gary seems to have listened at times."

Finding a good flat in Dublin that you can afford is very difficult. The best way to find one is through personal contacts. If you know someone who knows someone else who is moving out, that can help. But if, like Jo, you have just arrived in Dublin, you don’t have any contacts to help you find a place. So, Jo had to stay in a hostel and look for a flat. For Jo, Dublin felt very unfamiliar. She felt nervous when she took the train to start her new job there. She didn’t question why she was going; everyone at school expected her to leave her small town. They all wanted to escape and experience life. Some of her classmates had moved to nearby towns like Ennis or Limerick, where family members helped them settle in. But Jo was going to Dublin alone.

Jo’s mother thought it would be good for her to stay in the hostel permanently. It was run by nuns, so her mother believed she would be safe. Her father hoped the hostel would be warm because they are often cold. Jo’s sisters, who worked as waitresses, thought she was crazy for staying in a hostel for a whole week. However, Jo didn’t know they were still talking about her while she answered an advertisement for a flat in Ringsend. The ad said, ""Own room, own television, share kitchen, bathroom."" It was very close to her workplace and seemed too good to be true. Jo hoped it would be nice and that the people living there would like her, and that it wouldn’t be too expensive.

There wasn’t a long line for this flat because it was more about finding a ""Third Girl Wanted"" than just a flat to rent. The mention of ""own television"" made Jo wonder if it was too fancy for her, but the house looked normal. It was a simple red-brick house with a basement. The flat was upstairs, and as Jo climbed the stairs, a cheerful girl with a college scarf came down. ""Desperate place,"" she told Jo. ""They’re both awful. Common as dirt.""

Jo asked, ""What do you mean?"" The girl replied, ""She didn’t have to do anything. She just looked around and acted like it was terrible in a posh accent. We wouldn’t want her here, would we, Pauline?"" Pauline, who had colorful clothes and bright hair, was a punk. Jo was surprised because she had seen punks on the street but had never talked to one before. 

""I'm Jo, I work in the post office and I called about the flat,"" she said. Nessa, the girl with the college scarf, invited Jo to have tea with them. She brought out three mugs: one with 'Nessa', one with 'Pauline', and one with 'Other' written on it. ""We’ll put your name on a mug if you come to stay,"" Nessa said kindly."
FCE_43,"**Text: Behind the Dolphin's Smile**

People love dolphins. We enjoy watching them in seaside areas, movies, and TV shows. However, according to the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society, dolphins are in serious trouble. Mark Simmonds reports on the decline of dolphin populations.

Dolphins are special to us. They are very intelligent, sensitive to human feelings, and they inspire us with dreams of freedom in the ocean. Our affection for dolphins has been supported by TV shows. First, there was Flipper, and now there is Darwin from Seaquest. But these happy images hide the truth about dolphins living in polluted and overfished seas today.

The population of North Sea harbour porpoises, a type of dolphin, has decreased by up to 89,000. You might think that such popular animals would be protected by law and cared for in special marine reserves. Unfortunately, this is not true, and the lack of protection could lead to a major wildlife disaster.

There are forty different types of dolphins around the world. In northern Europe, the most common dolphins are the striped, common, bottlenose dolphins, and the smaller harbour porpoise. The striped and common dolphins usually live far out in the open sea and are seen only in small groups. We know very little about them. Bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises were once often seen near European coasts. Bottlenose dolphins are very social and used to be found along the Channel coast and in rivers in Britain, including the Thames. Now, they can only be found in small numbers in the Moray Firth in Scotland and Cardigan Bay in Wales. The few that remain show signs of stress, such as skin injuries.

It is hard to understand exactly why dolphin numbers are decreasing. Overfishing is reducing fish populations and threatening local fishing industries, which also puts dolphins and porpoises at risk. Porpoises need to find food quickly, and if fish are removed from one area, they may not survive long enough to find food elsewhere. They can also get caught in fishermen's nets, which they cannot see. Many modern fishing methods use large nets that are either left floating or pulled quickly through the water. In recent years, many dead dolphins have washed up on the beaches of France and Cornwall. Marks and cuts on their bodies show that they died after being caught in these nets.

Dolphins can also store harmful substances in their bodies. For example, pesticides can build up in their fat. Female dolphins produce milk that contains these poisons, which can harm their young. There is already one case of a young dolphin dying from its mother’s poisoned milk.

Another serious threat to dolphins comes from human activities. Dolphins live in groups and rely on sound to understand their environment. Noise pollution from ships and oil drilling travels much better in water than in air, which may disturb dolphins in ways we do not fully understand."
FCE_51,"**Getting Fit**

Exercise is very important for your mind, body, and spirit. It helps you stay balanced, especially when life feels chaotic. You might be tired of reading about fitness, but there are many good reasons to exercise, and very few reasons not to. 

Exercise helps improve your muscle tone and can quickly change your body shape. It makes your muscles stronger and helps you maintain good posture, which is how you hold your body when sitting or standing. It can also prevent muscle imbalances that might lead to injuries. Additionally, exercise can improve specific areas like your thighs, stomach, and upper arms. It is good for your heart, lungs, and blood circulation.

You may have heard these benefits many times, but here’s something new: exercise can help reduce feelings of depression and tiredness, and it can help you sleep better. It also helps manage stress and can relieve some medical conditions. 

If you still need convincing, just remember that exercise is good for you. There are many types of exercise you can try, such as aerobics, jogging, or using weights. However, be careful not to train too hard or lift too much weight, as this can cause injuries. If you are unsure about what exercises are right for you, it’s a good idea to talk to your doctor.

Good posture is essential for improving your body shape. If you have poor posture, it can make you look and feel less energetic. To improve your posture, imagine that a helium balloon is pulling the top of your head up towards the sky. This can help you lift your chest and breathe better, while also making your body look slimmer.

Stretching is also important. It helps improve flexibility and makes it easier to move. Stretching can prevent injuries caused by overuse. If you stretch four or five times a week, you will become more flexible and fit. 

A good exercise routine should include a warm-up, stretching, an energetic workout, and a cool-down period."
FCE_11,"**IN THEIR NATURAL HABITAT**

What keeps filmmakers Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman away from their homes for months? They are searching for the perfect shot. In the jungles and plains of East Africa, it can be very hard to find them. Right now, they are in the Ngorongoro Crater, which has experienced six months of almost constant rain, causing many problems. Newman explained that they had to buy an expensive piece of equipment so that if one of their vehicles gets stuck in the mud, Amanda can pull him back to safety. Their teamwork has produced some of the best wildlife films on TV, including a popular film about leopards. While this film was being shown, they were already back in the field, this time following the shy jackal.

Traveling filmmakers have been exploring the world to film exotic wildlife since television began. I spoke to Newman during one of his rare meetings with other people at a safari lodge. He said, ""We do have occasional arguments, but we get over them quickly."" Neither of them sees themselves as the leader, and they get along well because they both view the animals in a similar way. 

""When we are moving, we have to set up our tents each night. But this time we are staying in a more fixed camp. We set out at 5 a.m. each morning, so we make tea the night before and keep it warm in a vacuum flask."" Their daily meals consist of pre-packed food that is heated and served by whoever is available. ""It's not unusual for us to be out for up to eight weeks, so cooking can be stressful,"" says Newman. 

It can be a tough life, but being in remote areas allows them to get close to the animals. Newman remembers filming a family of lions, where one lioness would often go off alone. When she returned, she would greet all the other lions and even came to greet their car as part of her routine.

Newman first worked with Barrett in 1988 on a film called ""The Great Rift."" Two years later, they began working together to film Arctic foxes. Since then, they have learned to spend four months in the field to gather enough material for each half-hour film. Before they can start filming, they must submit a script for approval. 

""Amanda and I developed a good working relationship from the beginning,"" says Newman. ""We share the same ideas and vision. We aim to create a film that captures the true spirit of the place and the animals, and that touches people's hearts. I believe if you can make people feel something, that is much better than just appealing to their minds."""
FCE_14,"**The Netball Captain**

In our series about women in sports, Suzie Ellis met England's netball captain, Kendra Slawinski. Kendra is the captain of the England netball team. When I met her, she had a busy day, which is normal for her as she prepares for the World Championships next month. She taught at a local school and then had a training session in a supermarket car park. I was surprised to learn about her training location. I asked her, ""Don't you get strange looks?"" She replied, ""I focus so much on my movements and my feet that I don’t notice anything else. I might see cars slow down a little, but that’s it.""

Kendra said, ""My whole life is about being my best for the Championships."" She follows a strict schedule to be as fit as possible. This is her fourth World Championships, and it will be the biggest one yet, with 27 countries participating. ""We will have home support, which is very special,"" she said. ""It’s important to improve the reputation of netball in this country. Playing at home means there will be more pressure than usual. The crowd will have expectations and will support us more. People want us to start the tournament with a good game.""

Their first match is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. Kendra believes they have always won against them, but she knows they will be a tough team to play. The England team is currently ranked fourth in the world. However, Kendra warns that the World Championships will be challenging. ""You have to push yourself to play every day. There is no break between games like in a series. You can still win a series if you lose the first game, but the Championships are different. You only have one chance, and you must be ready to take it.""

In the fifteen years Kendra has played at a high level, the sport has become harder and faster. Players are more aggressive on the court. ""You don’t train hard to lose,"" Kendra says. But after the game, everything changes. ""We are all friendlier after the match.""

Netball is also using more scientific methods for fitness testing. ""It is important that we all think and train like world-class players,"" Kendra explains. As captain, she believes it is essential to have a strong mental attitude and to lead by example. ""I see my role as supporting and encouraging the team.""

Kendra has planned her netball career carefully from the start. She decided that this competition would be her last as a player. She may coach young players in the future, but right now, she is focused on her final big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she is likely to have tears in her eyes, knowing her loyal supporters will be with her every step of the way."

Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends a lot of time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She teaches and researches marine geochemistry, which means she studies the chemical processes in the sea. Rachel is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she is not teaching, she gets into a small steel vehicle for underwater exploration and dives three kilometers down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes.

Inside the vehicle, Rachel says, ""Space is very limited. I can reach out and touch the two pilots. We cannot stand up or move, and we must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last for 16 hours: three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours to collect rock and water samples, and three hours to return to the surface.""

""If there is a problem and we need to get to the top quickly, we can hit a panic button. This releases a small escape vessel that rises quickly to the surface. No one has tested it yet, but I don’t think it would be a pleasant journey.""

Rachel remembers her first time in the vehicle. It was on a ship, and she got in with an instructor who explained the emergency procedures, including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack. They were testing how she would react in such a small space. Now, Rachel has made six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian crew. ""We went to a site five days' sail west of the Canary Islands. There is a large area of underwater volcanoes that blow out black smoke. The Russian team was dropping off scientific equipment to study a project that would create a hole 150 meters through a volcano.""

When Rachel is not at sea, she works in her office at the Oceanography Centre in Southampton. ""Two-thirds of my salary comes from teaching, which I love, but I do it so I can continue my research on the 'black smokers.' This is another name for underwater volcanoes, where water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke. It pours out at a rate of one meter per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees.""

""The only time I was scared was during my first dive with the Americans. We were towing equipment when suddenly there was an explosion. There was a huge bang, and I thought, 'I'm going to die.' We looked at each other in silence, waiting. When nothing happened, we were so relieved - we were still alive!""

""Diving to the deepest part of the ocean is an adventure. Every time I look out of the porthole and see those chimneys, I feel a sense of wonder. I am at the bottom of the sea, and no one else on this planet has ever seen them before. I studied the black smokers for three years for my Ph.D. When I finally saw them for real, it was an amazing feeling."""
FCE_56,"**Interview Tips**

First impressions are very important. Studies show that people form opinions about us within the first few minutes of meeting. They notice how we dress, our eye contact, our body language, and how we speak, including our speed, volume, and tone of voice, as well as the words we use.

Mary Pearce wanted to be a teacher. She worked hard to earn her degree and felt confident when she graduated. She applied for a job at a nearby primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher. On the day of the interview, she noticed a small hole in her jacket. She thought about changing but decided it would make her late, and she believed being on time was very important. Unfortunately, Mary did not get the job. A friend who worked at the school told her that the Head Teacher said, ""If someone doesn't take the time to present her best image at an interview, what kind of teacher will she be?""

Simon Grant, a hotel manager, says that candidates who care about their appearance are more likely to care about their jobs. People often think that what is inside matters most, but in an interview, it is important to present yourself well. However, many people overlook the importance of a professional image.

For example, Janet Goodwood worked for ten years as an administrative assistant in a large accounting firm. When the office manager retired, she applied for the position but did not get an interview. She thought it was a mistake and asked the Director of Personnel what happened. He told her that she did not fit the image of an office manager and suggested she improve her wardrobe before applying again. Janet was shocked because she believed her work performance should matter more than her appearance.

Movement and gestures also affect an interviewer's first impression. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian found that only 7% of our message about feelings comes from the words we use, 38% from our voice, and 55% from our facial expressions. When our facial expressions and words send different messages, the listener will pay more attention to the non-verbal message. Therefore, it is important that your words match your body language. Mixed messages can confuse the interviewer.

It is also important not to seem too desperate for the job or too eager to please. Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, applied for a promotion and had a great interview. She was offered the job immediately. However, she was too enthusiastic about the offer. Once her boss saw how excited she was, he offered her a lower salary than she expected. She believes she could have negotiated a better salary if she had controlled her excitement.

Finally, what we say and how we say it can affect the success of an interview. David Artesio, a manager of an employment agency, suggests learning about the company before the interview. For example, the annual report can provide information about the company’s activities. Mentioning an area that interests you during the interview can show your interest in the company.

Business consultant Marian Woodall advises having a few questions ready and avoiding long, confusing sentences. She says, ""Poor communicators talk in paragraphs. Successful communicators talk in short sentences and highlight important points."""

Matt Froggatt used to work as an insurance agent in London, but now he runs a sheep farm. He says, ""After 14 years in the City, it became boring and no one was enjoying their work anymore. I didn’t plan to leave for another five or ten years, but then I lost my job unexpectedly. I didn’t get a great pay-off, but it was enough to start my farm. My big break came when I met the head chef of a well-known hotel restaurant. By supplying them with meat, my reputation grew, and now I also sell meat online. I’m happy to be out of the office, but surprisingly, my work hours are still long, about 80 to 90 hours a week, and I’m still selling a product.""

**The Painter**  
Ron Able White was a manager in advertising, but now he makes a living as an artist. He explains, ""Painting started as a hobby, but I found it much more exciting than my job. It made sense to take redundancy and become an artist. The career counselor I spoke to was very surprised when I told him, 'I don’t want to go back to my old job.' Most people my age need to find work quickly for money. My wife and I married young, and our children are grown, so we took a risk and moved to northern England, where we didn’t know anyone. We left our friends behind, but luckily, many of them still visit us.""

**The Hat Maker**  
Katherine Goodison worked as a lawyer for five years before starting her own hat-making business in her London flat. She says, ""Being a lawyer was fun and paid well, but the hours were terrible. I didn’t want to become a senior partner and work even more, so I left. Many people thought I would get bored, but that never happened. The key is to have deadlines. In fashion, there are always collections and new designs to work on, so I keep a strict schedule. I feel happier now and less stressed, but I miss socializing with colleagues. What I love about this job is that I am fully responsible for my work. If I do a bad job, I am the one to blame. When you work for a company, you care, but when your name is on the product, you care even more.""

**The Masseur**  
Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16 years before becoming a masseur at the Life Centre in London. He shares, ""I was in finance from the age of 22, making deals. I enjoyed the excitement, but I didn’t find the work rewarding. I almost lost my job in 1989, but I decided to resign and travel for a year. During that time, I thought about what I wanted to do. I was interested in health, so I visited top gyms and spoke to the owners about how they started. I knew I needed qualifications to change careers, so I took massage courses. Then, I got part-time work at the Life Centre. I have no regrets. I used to feel out of control, but now I have peace of mind and control over my life, which is the best part."""
FCE_6,"**Text: Dedicated to Their Sports**

Four young athletes share their experiences.

**A. Darius (Runner)**  
I have always loved sports. I tried many, but I was best at football and athletics. When I was 14, I tried out for a professional football team, but I chose to focus on athletics instead. My biggest achievement was competing for my country in the youth team and winning a medal. Unfortunately, it did not get much media attention, which was disappointing. I hoped to get some sponsorship because training can be expensive. I train at home all winter and then go to Florida for three weeks before the season starts. It’s fun there with great facilities and nightlife, but I have to be disciplined. If friends invite me out the night before training, I have to say no. I wish I could go, but dedication is important in this sport. My main goal is to compete in the next Olympics—that would be amazing.

**B. Gabriel (Surfer)**  
The surfing community is small, so I often see the same people at competitions. Professional surfers take their sport seriously, and the best waves are usually at dawn, so I have to skip late-night parties. I don’t mind too much, but I do enjoy sleeping in, which I often have to give up. However, it is worth it because my dedication helped me win the National Championships last year. After a win, I always celebrate with a big night out, and if I win money, I treat myself to a nice trip. Winning the championship also led to me hosting a surfing series on TV, so I guess I’m a bit of a celebrity now.

**C. Dieter (Yacht Racer)**  
When five guys are on a boat together, we have a lot of fun. We are traditional and celebrate our wins in style. Some people say we act a bit childish, but we don’t seek media attention. Sometimes reporters seem more interested in our celebrations than our race results. I spend eight months a year away, so it’s nice to come back and hang out with friends from different backgrounds. You can’t focus on the sport all the time; it’s not healthy. I am known in sailing, but I rarely get recognized in public. I wouldn’t want to be a celebrity. I do receive nice letters from fans asking for signed pictures, and I reply to each one, even if it takes time.

**D. Tomas (Tennis Player)**  
It feels great to walk onto the court and feel the crowd’s support. At my last tournament, it got a bit overwhelming with so many people around. I enjoy being recognized by fans when I’m out shopping, but it has its downsides. My last girlfriend didn’t like it when I got too much attention from female fans. Tennis players travel a lot, and that’s part of why we broke up. It was tough, but sacrifices are necessary in sports; you have to be serious and professional. I try not to let it bother me too much. I want to focus on my game now and enjoy life more after I retire, which comes early in this sport."
FCE_33,"**Text: Young Shoppers**

Shopping in supermarkets with children can be very difficult for parents. One mother explains, ""They want everything they see. If it’s not the latest sugary cereal, it’s a Disney video or a comic. Usually, they want all three. I can’t afford all this, and if I give in to their requests, I feel guilty about buying unhealthy food. I hate saying no all the time, and I get stressed before we even leave the house. I try to avoid taking them shopping, but then I worry that they are missing out on learning how to make their own choices. I feel stuck.""

Research shows that children ask for something to buy every two minutes when they are in a supermarket. Over £150 million is spent each year on advertising aimed directly at children, mostly on television. This amount is likely to grow, and supermarkets are where this advertising is most effective. Children often do not understand why their parents say they cannot buy certain things, and arguments about how bad sugar is for their teeth are not convincing when compared to attractive ads.

Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, ""Most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, but these ideas are not always correct. It is important for parents and children to talk about food. If children only learn about products from TV ads, they get a very one-sided view. Parents feel frustrated because they are competing with the advertising industry and often have to disappoint their children.""

The Independent Television Commission, which controls TV advertising, does not allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy products. However, Dibb points out, ""The main goal of advertising is to persuade people to buy something. So even if they cannot say, 'Tell your mom to buy this,' that is still the effect.""

Shopping with children can be stressful for parents because they have to decide which requests to agree to and which to refuse. One mother says she is patient when discussing food with her children, but she still feels unhappy about how she handles their requests: ""My son pays attention to ads but is critical of them. We talk a lot about different products and look at labels together. I’ve talked about it so much that he thinks all ads are bad. Now, we have very little conflict in the supermarket because the children don’t ask for things I don’t want to buy.""

Parents also admit they are sometimes inconsistent in their responses to their children's requests. Mike, a father of a seven-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter, says, ""We refuse to buy him sweets because we say they are bad for him, but we are buying double cream and chocolate for ourselves. It’s nice to buy good things, and it’s normal for children to want to share that. But I still get annoyed by their requests. It depends on my mood. If I’m feeling good, I’m more likely to say yes. It’s hard to be consistent.""

Supermarkets could help reduce conflicts between parents and children by removing sweets from checkout areas or providing supervised play areas. Although parents might spend less if their children are not with them, the idea of shopping without their children’s demands could attract more customers, making up for the difference."

The Merrion Hotel, a new five-star hotel, has opened in Dublin after two years of work converting four large 18th-century houses. This project focused on what customers want and allowed the hotel to use the latest technology for both staff and guests.

General Manager Peter MacCann wants his staff to know guests by name. However, he uses a computer system to keep track of guests' preferences. This system helps the hotel provide special services for returning guests. Although it cost £250,000 to install, MacCann believes it will be worth it over time because of its efficiency. For example, if a guest asks for certain music CDs during their first stay, those CDs will be ready for them on their next visit, thanks to the guest-history feature.

Many hotel guests often complain about room temperature. The Merrion has a high-tech system that allows guests to adjust the temperature in their rooms. They can change it by three degrees around the normal 18°C, and the front desk can adjust it anywhere from 14°C to 25°C.

Business travelers are a significant part of the hotel's market, making up about 65% of guests. To meet their needs, the hotel has created a business center in each room. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that also works as a photocopier and printer, and video-conferencing facilities. 

Technology changes quickly, so the hotel has prepared for future improvements by laying extra cables. They rent televisions instead of buying them, allowing for easy upgrades to newer models. DVD recorders can also be updated when needed. Despite all this technology, MacCann wants guests to feel comfortable, not overwhelmed. The hotel has 145 spacious and well-furnished rooms that are welcoming.

The Merrion also features a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a beautiful garden. The food is excellent, with Chef Patrick Guilbaud, who has two Michelin stars, moving his restaurant to the hotel. This change has allowed him to create a modern kitchen and improve parking facilities. For the hotel, having a successful restaurant brings benefits without financial risks. With great technology and skilled staff, the Merrion Hotel is likely to succeed."

Emma Marsden asked six women who live life fully to share how they find their energy.

A. **Jeanette Kupfermann, Journalist and Author:** ""I get my energy from excitement. I need to be challenged and learn new things. Right now, I'm learning flamenco dancing, which is very energizing. If I'm bored, I feel drained. Being effective, even in small ways, gives me energy.""

B. **Linda Kelsey, Magazine Editor:** ""I have a lot of work, but I enjoy it. Work is not a burden for me. I need enough sleep to feel good. When I only get six hours, I feel tired. Exercise helps me, but I have to find the energy to do it! I do yoga once a week and try to work out at home. After exercising, I feel much better. I often feel low in the afternoon, so I think it's good to eat something then.""

C. **Annie Nightingale, Disc Jockey:** ""I don’t eat healthily for energy; I think it comes from being enthusiastic and positive. I dislike negative people. I believe we should enjoy life and set goals. I love my job, and the last two years have been exciting. I’m surrounded by lively young people, which energizes me. I enjoy taking photos and writing fun song lyrics during my travels.""

D. **Floella Benjamin, Author and Children's TV Presenter:** ""My energy comes from doing things I enjoy. I believe in being positive about life. I love working with kids because they are full of energy. Communicating with others gives me energy—just smile at someone and see how it feels when they smile back. I try to eat healthily and don’t smoke or drink, but I don’t have a strict exercise plan. I get my energy from playing with kids.""

E. **Deborah Moggach, Author and Playwright:** ""What I love most is creating a garden from a wasteland. I once turned a concrete area into a garden, which was more energizing than any workout. Knowing that someone wants to read my writing also gives me energy. I enjoy sneaking into nature, and if caught, I act surprised and say I didn’t know it was private.""

F. **Katherine Monblot, Therapist:** ""I believe you need to be interested in what you do. I like taking risks and get bored easily, which keeps me motivated. Doing things I don’t want to do drains my energy. I used to be on many committees, but I didn’t like the demands on my time. You have limited energy, so focus on what matters most to you."""
FCE_45,"**ICE SKATING**

Ice skating has been around for thousands of years. Archaeologists have found skates made from animal bones, which were used until iron skates appeared in Scandinavia around 200 AD. For the wealthy people in Scandinavia, skating was an important skill. In the early 1900s, skating was seen as elegant, but everything changed at the 1924 Winter Olympics when 11-year-old Sonja Henie brought a more athletic style, making skating very popular.

Today, ice skating combines art and athleticism, making it both beautiful and physically challenging. For beginners, balance and control are very important, and you can only go faster as you get better. Your body position is key to maintaining balance. Keep your legs slightly bent and your knees relaxed, leaning a bit forward. Relaxation is crucial in skating, more than in many other sports.

To start skating, your heels should almost touch, and your feet should point outwards. Push forward with your back foot while making a small movement with the other foot. It’s not too hard! If you practice this for a while, you can gradually make longer movements as you gain experience. Learning how to fall safely is one of the first skills a skater should master. Even professional skaters fall sometimes. To fall without getting hurt, stay relaxed to reduce the impact with the ice. To get up, use your hands to kneel, then stand up.

Once you feel confident on the ice, you can try different styles like figure skating, freestyle, distance skating, speed skating, and pair skating. The best way to start is by learning figure skating and then basic freestyle. Most ice rinks offer good guidance, so you can quickly learn the basic moves, and soon you will be able to do turns, jumps, and spins in freestyle.

If you watch skilled skaters, you will notice how relaxed they are and how smoothly they move. To achieve this, it’s important to follow a regular exercise program. Skating with a stiff body can be dangerous, so warm-up exercises should focus on your legs, back, shoulders, ankles, and knees. After skating, do the same exercises to prevent stiffness.

Skating helps improve balance, coordination, relaxation, and movement. It also boosts heart and lung health and strengthens the body. When combined with swimming or jogging, it creates a great fitness program for overall health."

If there is one thing that can make you cry with happiness, it is seeing a talented child receive a medal. Julia Gregson spoke to three young stars and their mothers about the joys and challenges of their lives.

A. **Annika Reeder**, 15, won a gold medal in gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games. She wants to be a physiotherapist and compete in the next Olympics. ""The training is very hard right now. I don’t have time to watch TV, go out with friends, or do much besides gymnastics and school. I try to take it one day at a time. When I feel really tired, my coach sometimes gives me a day off, but usually, I keep going. You can’t take too many days off because it makes your body stiff.""

B. **Annika's mother**: ""From a young age, Annika showed great talent. I have seen some parents push their children, but that doesn’t work. To perform at Annika's level takes a lot of time and energy, and you have to want to do it. People often say that we, as parents, have sacrificed a lot, but they don’t see what the sport has given us. We love it and what it has done for Annika. Before gymnastics, she was a shy girl who hid behind me, but now she has met people from all over the world and gained confidence.""

C. **Sarah Stokes** started show-jumping at the age of ten and has since won the British National Championship. ""It’s great that my parents enjoy show-jumping because they train me and take me everywhere in the horse box. The shows can last from one to five days. I never get tired of it; I love the excitement and fun of show-jumping. Even if my parents weren’t involved, I would still do it because I am very determined. I’m happy when they are proud of my wins, but I do it for myself. This year, I want to qualify for the British young riders (under-18) team. My big dream is to win a gold medal at the Olympics.""

D. **Sarah's mother**: ""From the moment Sarah first sat on a horse at age 1, I knew she had found her passion. When she was 5, she would wake up early to exercise her pony. To qualify for big shows, we travel all over England. To save money, we sleep in the living area of our horse box. Sarah is very organized. She is completely happy on a horse and knows what she is doing. Watching your child succeed at something they love is an amazing feeling.""

E. **Jane McShane**, 10, is the Under-14 Chess Champion in Britain. ""Tournaments are really friendly. I know everyone, and it’s fun. When I play, I don’t focus as much as I should. I just look around and don’t think too much. I’m not worried about becoming arrogant; I don’t talk about my success at school because I don’t like to feel embarrassed.""

F. **Jane's mother**: ""Jane played her first game when she was 5. My father said, 'Let’s see if she likes it.' He had tried to teach me chess when I was young, but I found it boring. Jane loved it from the start. By the end of that day, she had memorized all the moves, and by age 6, she was beating adults. I am proud when she wins, but if she wanted to stop playing tomorrow, I would support her. I don’t want to hold her back because she is talented. If she has this gift, I want her to reach her full potential."""
FCE_29,"Text: 

It's true - we are all getting taller. Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy. The teacher jokingly asked, ""What do you want to be? The flagpole on a ship?"" This was funny because Chris was already almost two meters tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is the tallest man in Britain. 

Every decade, the average height of people in Europe increases by about one centimeter. More tall people are being born, but this does not mean we are becoming a super race. Instead, we are returning to how our ancestors looked. According to Professor Chris Stringer, a palaeontologist, we are becoming like Cro-Magnons, the people who lived 40,000 years ago.

For most of human history, our ancestors had a varied diet. Women gathered fruits and herbs, while men hunted animals. One study found they ate from 85 different wild plants. However, about 9,000 years ago, agriculture started, which changed everything. Farmers took over many green areas, and now just three plants—wheat, rice, and maize—provide more than half of the calories we eat. This limited diet has harmed our health. 

In a study in Ohio, scientists found that when healthy hunter-gatherers began farming corn, they became sick and underweight. Tooth decay and diseases increased. Although corn was thought to be a good food, it caused health problems. Farming spread because one piece of land could feed many more people than hunting could. 

Today, many people who rely on farming are still poorly nourished. Only in Europe, the US, and Japan are diets starting to reflect the variety of our ancestors' diets again. As a result, the average height of men is now 179 cm in the US, 180 cm in Holland, and 177 cm in Japan. This is a positive change, but it also brings challenges. 

Even though people are getting taller, the standard bed length has stayed at 190 cm since 1860. Legroom in planes and trains seems to be getting smaller, and clothing companies have to change their products often. The question is: how tall can we get? 

Some scientists believe we might reach a height of 193 cm this century. However, there is a twist. While individuals may be growing taller due to better nutrition, as a species, we are actually getting smaller. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, humans were rounder and taller to keep warm. As the climate has warmed, we have become thinner and shorter, even when well-fed. If global warming continues, we might shrink even more. In other words, our growth could be affected by climate change."
FCE_57,"**Text: Studio Audiences**

What is it like to be in the audience when a television show is being made? Cosmo Landesman found out. Studio audiences are a common part of television, but many people do not understand them. When we see people getting excited on game shows, we often wonder who they are. 

Some people think that studio audiences are the least important type of audience. I have heard that even people who work in television do not respect them, comparing them to cattle. I used to think that studio audiences were made up of silly people wanting a moment of fame. However, there is no typical studio audience. They come from different backgrounds, jobs, and income levels. Television shows try to attract various types of people for different programs.

Many of us who watch television at home do not understand why anyone would want to be in a studio audience. Why would someone apply for tickets, travel far, and sit through hours of waiting just to watch what they can see at home? One reason is that people hope to appear on television for a moment. I did not believe this until I spoke to Angela, who said, ""I came for a chance to be on TV."" Another reason is that people are curious to see how a show is made. But the most common reason I heard was, ""A friend gave me a ticket.""

Most of us have never been in a studio audience, but we think we know what it is like. You sit close to strangers while someone holds up cards that say APPLAUD or LAUGH, and you clap or laugh when told. This may be true for some shows, but not all. As one studio manager said, ""We believe a show should be good enough not to need these signs.""

Is there a real difference between being in a studio and watching at home? For Claire, being in a studio is ""more exciting,"" while Charlotte enjoyed being part of live television. ""Last year I saw my favorite comedian. When you watch him at home, you miss a lot."" What I missed was seeing the live actors; I could only see the back of someone’s head. The opening scenes were so far away that I ended up watching the show on a studio monitor.

Going to a studio may not be the best way to watch television, but that is not what matters. For most of the audience, it was just fun and a free night of entertainment."

**Favorite Places**

**Bruce**  
I don’t like wild landscapes that have no human touch. I prefer places with people. When I travel, I enjoy lovely villages with old temples, not empty deserts. When I was eight, I went to school in England. On Saturdays, I would ride my bike to the village of Lastingham in its beautiful valley. Cycling helped me relax from school. I loved exploring the high hills, quiet valleys, and old villages. Coming from Scotland, I found the landscape both familiar and different, and I still visit there today. I used to write about my adventures in my private diary. This was my first attempt at travel writing, which later became my career.

**Sophia**  
There is a small train that goes from Hythe to Dungeness, run by volunteers. I always travel first class because it doesn’t cost much more than the regular ticket. The scenery is not amazing. The train goes across Romney Marsh with its sheep and next to a canal. But there is one part of the journey I always look forward to - when the train goes through back gardens. For a few moments, we passengers see people doing everyday things, like making tea or folding a deckchair. I see myself in their eyes, a woman in a small train carriage, looking into other people’s homes. I like the ordinary landscape of fields, sheep, and a distant grey sea. It makes me look more closely and find something new.

**Matthew**  
The Hartland Peninsula is a quiet and beautiful coast. The beaches are hard to reach and have many rocks, so there are not many people here. A few brave surfers come, but most visitors prefer to enjoy the beauty of the sea. This coast, facing the Atlantic, is known for shipwrecks. There are walking paths along the coast that you can combine with trips into beautiful valleys filled with oak trees, ferns, and wildflowers. We stay in simple self-catering accommodation with a family who owns property in the village of Southole.

**Annette**  
My favorite place in England is the Trough of Bowland, a wide-open moorland that is perfect for hiking. There are not many people living there and not many visitors. It is a quiet and remote area, and I like the feeling of space. I found this place by chance when I was a student, and since then I have visited every year, either alone, with my boyfriend, or now with my son. It has changed little since my first visit. Having a child makes these visits more special. It makes me sad that he is growing up in a city.

**James**  
I bought Glenthorne, my favorite house in Britain. I wanted peace and to reconnect with my English roots. I grew up in what is now Sri Lanka, but when I was twelve, I went to school in Devon, in the west of England. I used to ride my bike around the moors and village streets. There was a story about a place we would never cycle past: if you went down the driveway, you would never return. That place was Glenthorne. It is my dream place. It is a magical, quiet, romantic house. You can only hear the sea, wind, and birds."
FCE_42,"**HAPPY HUNTING GROUND**

We are a family that loves animals. One afternoon, my daughter called me at work to tell me she had found a beautiful pine snake. She asked, ""Can we keep him?"" I replied, ""Yes, but only for one night."" We had a special tank ready for animals like this, so we could admire it and look it up in our natural history book.

I got home late and quickly started boiling some water when I heard my sons screaming, ""Oh, Mother! Help! Do something!"" I rushed to their bedroom. The problem involved our cat, Domino, and a white mouse named Bianca, which I had received as a Mother's Day gift. Domino was running around the room with the mouse in his mouth, trying to escape and enjoy his catch while avoiding the children who were waving their arms.

In the chaos, I tripped and fell. As I was thinking about how to stop Domino, I noticed the snake. It had escaped and was slithering off the table and onto the floor. I crouched down as the snake moved, while the kids and the cat were jumping around in a loud, chaotic scene. The dog was barking, and the pot in the kitchen boiled over. I quickly turned off the gas and returned to the chaos with renewed energy. 

I managed to grab Domino by the tail and rescued the small, wet mouse from his jaws. Interestingly, this same mouse was caught by Domino three more times but lived a long life before dying of old age. 

Feeling encouraged, I looked at the snake to find a way to catch it, but it seemed impossible. In the end, I sat on the floor like a snake-charmer, rocking back and forth. Slowly, the snake relaxed and rested its head on its body, but it still looked suspicious. I carefully placed my hands under the snake and stood up, then walked to the end of the garden. I wanted to give the snake a chance to live freely, so I pointed it towards a nearby tree.

When I finally let go of the snake's head, expecting it to attack me, it instead slid over my shoulders like a colorful shawl, making itself comfortable. We stood there in the fading light, with my four children, me, and the snake. My oldest son, DJ, broke the silence with a scientific comment: ""You know what it is, Mum? You're nice and warm, and the shed isn't."" 

I asked the children to help encourage the snake to move on. Slowly, it did, climbing up the wall and disappearing over the roof. As the last bit of its tail vanished, my three-year-old son Clay sighed and said what we were all thinking: ""Boy, that was one big snake!"""

In our fast world of phones, faxes, and computers, the old art of letter writing is at risk of disappearing. However, I believe that receiving a letter is special and cannot be replaced by any other way of communicating. There is excitement when a letter arrives, joy in seeing who it is from, and pleasure in reading its contents.

Letter writing has been part of my life for as long as I can remember. It probably started with the little notes I wrote to my mother. She always made sure I wrote my own thank-you letters for Christmas and birthday gifts. It didn’t matter if they were short or messy, as long as they were letters.

When I left home at 18 to study medicine in London, I wrote to my parents every week, and they wrote back. Sometimes my father wrote, and I loved receiving his long, funny letters. Most letters from home talked about everyday life with my parents and their friends. We also made phone calls, but I remember the letters the most.

I also received letters from my boyfriends. Many of them had to work or study far away, so we kept in touch through letters. Writing letters actually helped our relationships. I found it easier to express my feelings in writing than by speaking.

I enjoy letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. Short notes are nice, but it’s even better to get a whole year’s worth of news! I especially love receiving letters in airmail envelopes with beautiful stamps. I get letters from friends in different countries, like Mangala in Sri Lanka, a penfriend in Australia, and another in Vancouver. There’s also a lady from France who writes to me. We started talking in a restaurant after a holiday, and I asked for her address. If she hadn’t replied, we would have missed out on a great friendship. Now, we write to each other regularly. I can practice my French with her since she doesn’t speak English. We have visited her home twice, and she has stayed with us.

My biggest success in letter writing happened this summer when my family and I visited my American penfriend in Texas. We had been writing to each other for 29 years but had never met. Everyone was surprised that our friendship lasted so long. The local newspaper even wrote about us on the front page!

I am happy that my children are continuing this tradition. Like my mother, I make sure they write their own thank-you letters. My daughter writes me little letters, just like I did for my mother. She and my son have their own penfriends in Texas, organized by my penfriend. I strongly encourage everyone not to let letter writing become a lost art."

**Careless Tourists Damage Ancient Rock Art**

Many ancient pictures carved into the rocks at one of France's most important tourist sites are being slowly destroyed. Scientists and researchers are worried that the 36,000 drawings on rocks in Mont Bego in the French Alps are being damaged so quickly that they may not survive for future generations. The mountain is believed to have been a place for prayer and worship, and it has drawings that are 4,000 years old. These include pictures of cows, fields, and different gods and goddesses. However, as more people visit the site, the pictures are being ruined by careless graffiti.

Jean Clottes, the chairman of the International Committee on Rock Art, says, ""People think that because the pictures have been there for so long, they will always be there. But if the damage continues at this rate, there will be nothing left in 50 years."" He has seen tourists stepping on the drawings, which wears away the rock and damages the artwork. Some visitors even take pieces of the rock home as souvenirs. ""When people can't take a good photograph, they rub the drawings to make them clearer,"" he explains. ""The drawings are already polished by the weather, and if the sun is shining and visitors can't see them well, they rub and scrape them to make them look fresher.""

Other researchers have noticed that some people come with long sticks to scratch their own drawings or names into the rocks. Experts disagree on the best way to protect the drawings. Henry de Lumley, the director of the Museum of Natural History in Paris, believes the only way to save the site is to make the whole mountain a ""no-go"" area, allowing the public to visit only on guided tours. He says that if this is not done, the site will be completely destroyed, and important research will be affected.

Clottes disagrees with this idea. He says, ""Henry de Lumley's plan is very strict, and while it may be effective, it will also cause protests from local people."" He reminds us that the site was declared a historic monument by the Ministry of Culture, and we must do everything we can to protect it.

David Lavergne, a regional architect, also wants to keep the site open. He says, ""Henry de Lumley's idea isn't perfect. Our department believes the best solution is to let people visit the site, but it is hard to stop visitors from causing damage because the area is so large. I would prefer that everyone could see it, but the main problem is money. We do not have enough funds to hire enough guards. We may need to think about charging a fee, as there seems to be no chance of government funding.""

In Nice, Annie Echassoux, who has also researched the site, is worried that as the mountain becomes easier to reach—since tourists can now avoid the long walk by hiring vehicles—the damage will increase quickly. She believes the only solution is to block off the area and provide guides. ""You can't say the plan can't go ahead because there is no money,"" she says. ""That is not good enough. Money must be provided because the Ministry of Culture has classified this area as a historic site. If we do not take action, we will be responsible for losing the drawings for the next generation."""
FCE_32,"**Text: Young Shoppers**

Shopping in supermarkets with children can be very difficult for parents. One mother explains, ""They want everything they see. If it’s not the latest sugary cereal, it’s a Disney video or a comic. Usually, they want all three. I can’t afford all this, and if I give in to their requests, I feel guilty about buying unhealthy food. I hate saying no all the time, and I get stressed before we even leave home. I try to avoid taking them shopping, but then I worry that they are missing out on learning how to make their own choices. I feel stuck.""

Research shows that children ask for something to buy every two minutes when they are in a supermarket. Over £150 million is spent each year on advertising aimed directly at children, mostly on television. This amount is likely to grow, and supermarkets are where this advertising is most effective. Children often do not understand why their parents say they cannot buy certain things, and arguments about how bad sugar is for their teeth are not convincing when compared to attractive ads.

Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, ""Most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, but these ideas are not always correct. It is important for parents and children to talk about food. If children only learn about products from TV ads, they get a very one-sided view. Parents feel frustrated because they are competing with the advertising industry and often have to disappoint their children.""

The Independent Television Commission, which controls TV advertising, does not allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy products. However, Dibb points out, ""The goal of advertising is to persuade people to buy something. Even if they cannot say, 'Tell your mom to buy this,' that is still the effect.""

Shopping with children can be stressful for parents because they have to decide which requests to agree to and which to refuse. One mother says she tries to be patient when discussing food with her children, but she still feels unhappy about how she handles their requests: ""My son pays attention to ads but is critical of them. We talk a lot about different products and look at labels together. I’ve talked about it so much that he thinks all ads are bad. Now, we have very little conflict in the supermarket because the children don’t ask for things I don’t want to buy.""

Parents also admit they are not always consistent in their responses to their children's requests. Mike, a father of a seven-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter, says, ""We refuse to buy sweets for him because they are bad for him, but we buy double cream and chocolate for ourselves. It’s nice to buy good things, and it’s normal for children to want to share that. But I still get annoyed by their requests. It depends on how I feel. If I’m in a good mood, I’m more likely to say yes. It’s hard to be consistent.""

Supermarkets could help reduce conflicts between parents and children by removing sweets from checkout areas or providing supervised play areas. Although parents might spend less if their children are not with them, the idea of shopping without their children’s demands could attract more customers, making up for the difference."
FCE_65,"**Text: Climbing Walls**

In the past, climbers went to mountains to climb. Now, people can enjoy climbing in many places, both indoors and outdoors. The audience watches closely as the French climber Francois Lombard hangs upside down by just two fingers on a climbing wall. He is competing in the World Cup Climbing Championships at the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham. This arena is better known for the TV show Gladiators, but both events have one thing in common: The Wall. The ability to hold these events is thanks to new technology that is developing quickly.

Before the mid-1960s, climbers practiced on natural cliffs where there were good climbing spots. In winter, they had to deal with cold weather, go for walks, or climb on snow and ice in Scotland. As climbing became more popular, it was important for climbers to stay fit. Since they could not use cliffs for much of the year, they started to train on brick edges or stone buildings. This helped them keep their fingers strong and avoid boredom.

Soon, many sports centers began to build climbing walls using special bricks designed for climbing. One of the first climbing walls was built by Don Robinson, a physical education teacher, in a corridor at Leeds University in the mid-1960s. He created a wall with natural rock set in concrete. Throughout the 1970s, many climbing walls like this were built in sports halls, but they had some problems. These walls were only vertical, while real cliffs have different shapes like overhangs and slanted rocks. Once built, the walls could not be changed, and climbers would eventually get bored with the same routes.

In 1985, a Frenchman named Francois Savigny invented a new material that could be shaped like the holds found on cliffs. These holds could be attached to any wall and removed when climbers wanted something new. French manufacturers also started to create climbing panels on steel frames. Unlike heavy concrete, steel frames could be built anywhere as free-standing structures. This system allowed climbers to have many different holds to choose from, giving them endless options for climbing."
FCE_61,"**Text: 'So You Want to Be an Actor'**

If you tell someone that you want to be an actor, they will probably mention that it is a risky career. Acting is indeed risky because there are many actors but not enough jobs for them. When you decide to become an actor, some people you thought were your friends might think you are making a bad choice, while others may support you. Everyone will give you different advice. Ultimately, it is a personal decision, and you are responsible for your own choices and dreams.

There are no easy paths to becoming an actor. There are no exams to pass, and even after training, there is no guarantee that you will succeed in the profession. Success often depends on a mix of luck and talent. However, there is always a need for new actors, and acting can bring excitement, glamour, and sometimes good pay.

Many people ask what talent is. I think talent is a mix of natural skill and imagination, with imagination being the hardest to measure. It also involves courage and belief in what you are doing. 

Where does the desire to act come from? It can be hard to explain why you want to act. In theater, the important moment is the connection between the actor and the audience. This connection is what motivates actors to perform. 

When you ask successful actors how they achieved their success, they often do not have a clear answer. They know some things about their skills and techniques, but they do not take anything for granted. They understand that their success depends on their current job, and fame can be temporary. 

Disappointment is a big challenge for actors. Last month, you might have been out of work, doing other jobs like selling clothes or waiting tables. Then, you might get a chance to audition for a role. However, even if you really want the job, you might not get it. Because of this, actors often avoid discussing their chances of success. They find ways to cope with the stress of competing for roles and the fear of rejection. No one likes to be rejected, and this possibility exists from the moment you start auditioning. You are saying that you are available, willing, and hopefully talented enough for the job. In many ways, your success depends on how much you care about acting; if you don’t care, others may not care about you either."

It's true - we are all getting taller. Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy. The teacher jokingly asked, ""What do you want to be? The flagpole on a ship?"" This was funny because Chris was already almost two meters tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is the tallest man in Britain. 

Every decade, the average height of people in Europe increases by about one centimeter. More tall people are being born, but this does not mean we are becoming a super race. Instead, we are returning to how our ancestors were. We are starting to lose the effects of poor diets from the past. Professor Chris Stringer, a palaeontologist, says, ""We are beginning to reach our true potential. We are becoming like Cro-Magnons, the people who lived 40,000 years ago.""

For most of human history, our ancestors had a varied diet. Women gathered fruits and herbs, while men hunted animals. One study found they ate from 85 different wild plants. However, about 9,000 years ago, agriculture began, which changed everything. Farmers took over many green areas, and now just three plants—wheat, rice, and maize—provide more than half of the calories people eat today. This limited diet has harmed our health. 

In Ohio, scientists found that when healthy hunter-gatherers started farming corn, they became sick and underweight. Tooth decay and diseases increased. Although corn was thought to be a good food, it caused health problems. Farming spread because one piece of land could support many more people than hunting could. 

Today, many people who rely on farming are still poorly nourished. Only in Europe, the US, and Japan are diets starting to reflect the variety of our ancestors' diets again. As a result, the average height of men is now 179 cm in the US, 180 cm in Holland, and 177 cm in Japan. This is a positive change, but it comes with challenges. 

Even though people are getting taller, some things have not changed. The standard bed length has been 190 cm since 1860. Legroom in planes and trains seems to have gotten smaller, and clothing companies are always adjusting their sizes. The question is: how tall can we get? 

According to Robert Fogel from the University, we might reach a height of 193 cm this century. However, scientists warn that while individuals may be growing taller due to better nutrition, as a species, we are actually getting smaller. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, humans were slightly rounder and taller to keep warm. As the climate warmed, we became thinner and shorter, even when well-fed. If the planet continues to warm, we might shrink even more. In other words, our growth could be affected by global warming."

**The Farmer**  
Matt Froggatt used to work as an insurance agent in London, but now he runs a sheep farm. He says, ""After 14 years in the City, it became boring and no one was enjoying their work anymore. I didn’t plan to leave for another five or ten years, but then I lost my job unexpectedly. I didn’t get a great pay-off, but it was enough to start the farm. My big break came when I met the head chef of a well-known hotel restaurant. By supplying them with meat, my reputation grew, and now I also sell meat online. I’m happy to be out of the office, but surprisingly, my work hours are still long, about 80 to 90 hours a week, and I’m still selling a product.""

**The Painter**  
Ron Able White was a manager in advertising, but now he makes a living as an artist. He explains, ""Painting started as a hobby, but I found it much more exciting than my job. It made sense to take redundancy and become an artist. The career counselor I spoke to was very surprised when I told him, 'I don’t want to go back to my old job.' Most people my age need to find work quickly for money. My wife and I married young, and our children are grown, so we took a risk and moved to northern England, where we didn’t know anyone. We left our friends behind, but we’ve been lucky; many of them still visit us.""

**The Hat Maker**  
Katherine Goodison worked as a lawyer for five years before starting her own hat-making business in her London flat. She says, ""Being a lawyer was fun and paid well, but the hours were terrible. I didn’t want to become a senior partner and work even more, so I left. Many people thought I would get bored, but that has never happened. The key is to have deadlines. In fashion, there are always collections and new designs to work on, so I keep a strict schedule. I feel happier now and less stressed, but I miss socializing with colleagues. What I love about this job is that I am fully responsible for my work. If I do a bad job, I take the blame. When you work for a company, you care, but when your name is on the product, you care even more.""

**The Masseur**  
Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16 years before becoming a masseur at the Life Centre in London. He shares, ""I was in finance from the age of 22, making deals. I enjoyed the excitement, but I didn’t find the work fulfilling. I almost lost my job in 1989, but I decided to resign and travel for a year. During that time, I thought about what I wanted to do. I was interested in health, so I visited top gyms and spoke to the owners about how they started. I knew I needed qualifications to change careers, so I took massage courses. Then, I got a part-time job at the Life Centre. I have no regrets. I used to feel out of control, but now I have peace of mind and control over my life, and that is the best part."""
FCE_5,"**Text: A Successful Game**

Two brothers are discovering that their childhood game is great for business. Dave and Norm Lagasse, two bearded brothers in their forties, are sitting in their simple home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA, and enjoying their childhood memories. In front of them is a wooden board with round plastic pieces. They are playing the old game of pichenotte, which they say is unique. Their grandfather, Lucien Rajotte, a grocer from Quebec, Canada, brought the game to the USA and taught it to his family. Soon, every weekend and holiday, the family played the game and, as Dave says, ""had the best time ever."" Eventually, the family moved to New Mexico, but they continued to play pichenotte with the board that Grandpa made from old wooden crates.

When visitors came over, they were often curious because the game was unknown in the southern USA. Three years ago, Dave noticed that the old pichenotte board was cracked and decided to make a new one. The new board was beautiful. A relative saw it and wanted one, and then a friend wanted one too. To see how much interest there was, the brothers took one of Dave's new boards to a sports bar in Santa Fe. ""People started to watch,"" says Dave, ""and said, 'No way I'm playing that silly game.' But soon they sat down, and before long, they couldn't get up from the table!""

When people asked about the game's origins, Dave did some research. He found that the game likely started in India, where a similar game called 'carroms' is played. This game was adapted into 'squails' in British pubs, and British people brought it to Canada a century ago. Pichenotte is the French-Canadian version that developed in Quebec. 

Pichenotte can be played by two to four people and is a game of skill. Each player has 12 pieces or 'pucks' that they flick across a wheel-like board using their finger. Flicking a puck into a small hole is worth 20 points, while three rings around the hole are worth 15, 10, and 5 points. There are also eight small posts that act as obstacles. The game usually lasts about two minutes.

After seeing how popular the game was at the bar, the Lagasse brothers made more boards and took them to markets and craft fairs. Crowds gathered, money was exchanged, and the game's popularity grew. Soon, championships were held, and a trophy called the 'Lord Pichenotte Cup' was created. As word spread, the boards sold quickly, and the brothers decided to start a pichenotte business full-time. They set up a workshop in their garage and began making boards. They have produced more than 450 boards so far. Made of birchwood and mahogany, each board weighs 12 kg and is 1 cm thick. Norm explains, ""They're very durable because they need to handle a lot of use."" They sell for $595 each on the brothers' website.

Currently, there are no professional pichenotte players or TV shows about the game. However, the day may come when the brothers' garage will be home to a luxury car instead of tools and wood. Until then, they are happy to spend their free time playing the game they hope will bring them success."
FCE_41,"**WELCOME TO THE MODEL VILLAGE**

When you first enter the Model Village, it is hard to believe that just a few years ago, this area was a piece of waste ground, flat and covered with brambles. For a long time, it was seen as useless land. However, with careful planning and hard work from one man, supported by his wife, this land has been transformed into the beautiful place you see today.

Many thousands of tons of soil and clay were moved to change the flat area into the lovely landscape you see now. Although machines like bulldozers helped, a lot of hard work was also done by hand. Once the land was shaped, about 1,000 tons of topsoil were added to create lawns, flower beds, and rock gardens. 

In building the Model Village, hundreds of trees and shrubs were planted. These plants were carefully chosen to survive in the salty air near the sea and to withstand strong winter winds. Most plants came from local garden centers, but some were brought from as far away as Canada and New Zealand.

The whole village was created by Colin Sims, who made over 100 models by hand over nine years, starting in 1972. The models are made from different materials like stone, concrete, treated wood, and plastics to resist all kinds of weather. At first, Colin needed help from experts to learn how to use these materials, but soon he became an expert himself.

You will notice that all the models are built to the same scale and that great care has been taken with even the smallest details. This was achieved through patience and special building techniques. The Model Village has become a popular attraction, known for its high-quality work and maintenance. The methods used to create these realistic models have been used in other model villages in England and have even been taught in some college courses.

All the buildings in the village show traditional British architectural styles and are not based on any one specific place. One of the most impressive buildings is the Manor House, a typical 13th-century stone building with a brick tower and stone walls, inspired by manor houses found in the West Country. As you walk around the village, you will also see the Castle, St Mary's Church, a zoo, and a mini-golf course, which is the newest addition.

We ask you to stay on the paths during your visit and not to touch any of the models; even a small mistake can lead to hours of repair work for us. You can take photos from the pathways only. Dogs are welcome on a short lead.

To make your visit more enjoyable, you will find buttons in front of some working models. Press these buttons to see the models operate. At the end of your visit, we would love to hear your comments. We are always planning new models, and your ideas can help us create a more interesting display. We also want to know if there are any models that you think need improvement. We are constantly updating the models and need your feedback.

We hope you enjoy your visit and look forward to seeing you again. Don't forget to tell your friends about it!"

Every week, British tabloid newspapers publish pictures that invade people's privacy and break the rules set by newspaper editors. While some pop stars do pose for paparazzi sometimes, this is not common. More often, serious harm is done to public figures when their private moments are shown on the front page. However, very few people report these issues to the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), which was created to handle such problems. These pictures rarely serve the public interest. For example, do private photos of pop stars help solve crimes? How does a picture of a famous actress on a hotel balcony protect public health and safety? The actress has complained about long-lens photos before, and since she was in a hotel—a place where people expect privacy—she had a good reason to complain, but she did not take any action. It is a scandal that the PCC did not start an investigation. 

The PCC should also look into a recent shocking story about a pop star's love life. Like the actress, the pop star has not made a formal complaint. Shouldn't the PCC take action against these shameful attacks? This seems like a good idea. It could lead to many decisions against newspapers, which would be reported by other media. The public would not support these newspapers, and editors would have to stop publishing such material. Photographers would also be affected, as they would no longer be able to afford to hide and take pictures of celebrities without their consent.

If the PCC decided to act like a ""police officer,"" there would be several challenges. How would it decide whether to start an investigation? Should it contact the victim and encourage them to complain? If the person still refused to act, should the PCC proceed anyway? Celebrities and royals might expect that any story about them would be investigated, and they could be upset if it wasn’t. The task is too big for the PCC. How could it realistically monitor all of the British press, including national and regional newspapers and magazines? 

There is also the issue of embarrassment. Even if someone's privacy has been violated, would they want the added embarrassment of an investigation? Most people probably just want to move on with their lives. Some may have other reasons for staying quiet. They might have a worse story that they want to keep from the press, and they know that complaining could make it public. In this way, the PCC could become an enemy.

One British comedian faced problems with the press when he and his wife were secretly photographed on their honeymoon in the Caribbean. He did not complain then, nor did he complain later when he and his family were photographed during a holiday. He was afraid that the newspaper, News of the World, would publish the pictures again with a new story about his anger, claiming they thought it was just a joke and that, as a comedian, he would have a sense of humor about it. This fear is understandable. People believe they will become targets again if they challenge the tabloids. It is difficult to find an easy solution to this serious problem."

Many college graduates receive advice when starting their first job. This article focuses on what to consider when moving to a second job. We are not talking about those who are looking for a temporary job while searching for a permanent one, or those who leave a job they don’t like after a few weeks. Instead, we will discuss how to choose a second job that matches your career goals after gaining some experience and skills.

What kind of job should you look for? It depends on your long-term goals. You need to think about whether you want to specialize in a certain area, aim for higher positions, or explore a wider field. Whatever you choose, it is important to select your second job carefully. You should plan to stay in this job for two to three years. Future employers will look closely at this job when you apply for your next position. It should show that you are serious about your career. Most importantly, it should help you grow, develop new skills, and give you more responsibilities.

If you want to travel, now might be a good time to do it. You can work temporarily when you return and then find your second job. Employers will appreciate that you have satisfied your desire to travel and are less likely to leave again.

Juliette Davidson spent her first year after graduating from St. Aldate's College working for three lawyers. It was a good first job because they were supportive. She learned how to work in an office and improved her typing skills. However, there was no chance for promotion. One day, she decided to leave, bought a plane ticket, and traveled for a year.

Now, Juliette works as a Personal Assistant to Brenda Cleverdon, the Chief Executive of Business in the Community. She says, ""In two and a half years, I have become more skilled, and my job has really grown."" From the start, her boss wanted to help her develop. Although her job title is the same, her responsibilities have changed. She has moved from mainly typing and answering phones to handling most of the correspondence and budgets. She also answers questions from company chairmen and people wanting to start their own businesses. Brenda includes her in all her work and gives her specific projects and events to organize."
FCE_17,"**Text: 'What is the Secret of Confident People?'**

Confident people may seem like they were born that way, but most will say it is a skill they learned over time. Nina Hathway talks to five people about how they became confident.

**A. Jenny**  
When I finished school, I was very shy and thought I would always be that way. At about twenty-five, I was asked to help at my daughter's school. I was nervous but surprised myself by doing well. Someone suggested I take a university course. On my first day, I felt very anxious, but my confidence grew over time, and I became more outgoing. Looking back, working at the school changed my life and helped me in many other areas.

**B. Michaela**  
My journey began four years ago when my father got sick, and I had to take over the family business. I was scared and became a bit too aggressive. I thought that was what being confident meant, but I learned that true confidence comes from believing in yourself. If work gets too hard, I don’t feel guilty about leaving some tasks for the next day. When I face something difficult, I remind myself that I have nothing to lose. Fear can make you feel unconfident, so I often talk to myself to push those fears away.

**C. Lisa**  
People think I am very confident, but the calmer I seem, the more scared I actually am. I had to learn to look confident because it is very important in TV. Interviewing people has shown me that many of us feel tense in important situations, but we feel better when we talk to friendly people. My mother gave me great advice when I was a teenager worrying about my clothes: 'Who is looking at you? Everyone is too busy worrying about themselves.' I remember this often. I also believe you gain confidence by facing your fears. When I took my driving test, I was very nervous, but I passed. After that, I felt I could handle anything.

**D. Barbara**  
My confidence comes from enjoying my work, but I have built it up over the years. If you keep working and learn from your mistakes, you will feel more confident next time. I work hard and am liked in the restaurant, but not everyone will like you. You must accept yourself and not try to be what others want. My company offers many training courses, which have helped my self-esteem. They also encourage us to set realistic goals. It is helpful to see that you are achieving something instead of trying to do everything at once and ending up with nothing.

**E. Kim**  
After college, I worked as a secretary and often sat in meetings without speaking up, even when I disagreed. Eventually, I found the confidence to share my thoughts. When I first worked in politics, I had never spoken in public and would shake with nerves. I told myself, 'Don’t be silly. People do this every day, so you can too.' I also found it helpful to write down a few notes to refer to, like a comfort blanket! I believe everyone feels a bit nervous when speaking in public. The real secret to confidence is telling yourself, 'Nothing is impossible.'"

Paul Forster visits a kite-flying festival and spends a nervous night in the forest. Adnan Ali smiled widely when I gave him his broken kite. ""You should keep it,"" he said, ""it's a tradition - if the line breaks, the finder keeps it... and I have many more."" He pointed to a pile of beautifully decorated kites at his feet. All the kites were exactly 120 cm wide and long, made of tissue paper and bamboo. We sat in the shade of the tall trees behind the Beach of the Seven Lagoons in Kelantan, looking at Malaysia's biggest kite festival. 

In the center of the beach, there were 10 platforms where helpers held up the kites, and a line of nervous competitors held the lines of their kites, waiting for the countdown. When the whistle blew, the crowd cheered, and the kites flew into the sky like rockets. More than 500 men and boys had signed up for the competition, which lasts for five days every year. Each competitor had entered four different kite designs, which would be judged on decoration, stability in the air, and flying ability. 

""Flying kites isn't very hard,"" Adnan said, ""but making them takes real skill. Come to my house, and I'll show you how to do it."" This was one of five invitations I received that day, and I decided to accept. At his house, I drank cold milky tea and ate fish crackers in a large, shiny room. As night fell, he asked me to come back the next day to start fixing his kite, but I couldn't. Instead, I explored the southern part of the state, driving towards Kuala Lumpur, through beautiful mountains covered in thick rainforest. 

I took a wrong turn, and the smooth road suddenly ended at a river. A small boat was waiting to take people across. Nearby, I saw a sign that pointed up a path into the forest, saying: ""Jelawang Jungle 3 km."" Before I started, it would have been good to know that most of this distance was uphill, steep, and slippery. When I reached the path, I found a man named Baba waiting with a flask of tea. He took care of a tent kitchen and a few bamboo huts. I decided to stay there, trying not to think about the insects crawling under my thin mattress. 

The night was completely dark, filled with different sounds. A nearby waterfall roared, and many creatures moved and made noise. In the morning, I saw a stunning view of five ranges of green mountains. In the afternoon, it rained. First, the wind blew, then lightning struck the treetops. Moments later, I was soaked. As I slid down the hill, I wondered how the giant butterflies avoided the big drops. I also worried about my car being washed away (it sometimes happens) and the chance of drowning if I opened my mouth. Luckily, my car was still there, covered in mud, at the bottom of the hill. 

In Kota Bahru, the capital of Kelantan, everyone asked me questions: ""Where are you from?"" ""How old are you?"" But their questions were friendly. While Kelantan is famous for its kites, I will always remember it for the kindness of its people."

A. **Melanie, 22, Dancer**  
I love shopping! I can't spend enough money. When I have cash, I go shopping and feel happy. I find it hard to walk past sale signs. My boyfriend is the same, so we often go shopping together. We are both addicted to shopping!

B. **Brenda, 40, Office Manager**  
I don’t like shopping much. My husband does most of the food shopping because he cooks and knows what he likes. I take my kids shopping for clothes, but I don’t enjoy it because we all have different tastes. I don’t spend money on myself often, so when I do, I feel guilty and don’t tell my husband the real price.

C. **Juliet, 28, Personnel Manager**  
I only shop for what I need. I really dislike shopping and only go when I have to. When I do shop, I know exactly what I want and won’t settle for anything else. Shopping makes me tired, and I would rather be doing something else.

D. **Anita, 35, TV Producer**  
I like to look around sometimes, but I usually know what I want and where to find it. I don’t waste time and try to get in and out quickly. However, I do have some clothes in my wardrobe that I regret buying, so maybe I’m careful but sometimes make mistakes.

E. **Lizzie, 41, Secretary**  
I really dislike shopping. I find it hard to find clothes I like, and the shops are too noisy and messy. Luckily, I don’t have to shop for clothes often because I get most of my clothes for free. For food shopping, I go to the supermarket once a week and do it quickly.

F. **Lisa, 22, Actress**  
I’m a happy shopper. Sometimes I go shopping with my friends, and we often end up buying things. I don’t usually go with a specific item in mind, but if I see something I like, I buy it.

G. **Suki, 26, Art Gallery Assistant**  
I’m a careful shopper. I enjoy shopping, but I don’t buy much. I usually know what I want and don’t spend too much. Sometimes I shop to feel better, but then I often regret spending too much money.

H. **Ann-Marie, 29, Nursery Worker**  
I love shopping, but only on certain days and never on Saturdays because it’s too busy. I’m a careful shopper. I have a good idea of what I want and don’t buy things right away. I like to check other shops to find better deals, which takes me a long time.

I. **Linda, 32, Restaurant Manager**  
I don’t like shopping, maybe because I work in the city center and the shops don’t interest me anymore. When I have to shop, I go but don’t try things on because it’s too much trouble. The clothes I buy don’t always fit, but I don’t mind making mistakes rather than spending a lot of time in shops."

**New Picture**  
The Gallery now has a beautiful still life painting by the Dutch artist Jan van Os from the 18th century. This large painting (89.1 cm x 71 cm) shows flowers and fruit in bright colors on wood. It is one of the first paintings of this kind in the Gallery. The painting is signed and dated 1777 and 1778. It is common for artists to date their work in two years because they wait for certain flowers to bloom in different seasons. This painting was kindly given to the Gallery by Miss Violet Churchman in memory of her sister, Ida Nancy. It is now displayed in Room 25.

**Special Exhibition**  
The exhibition ""Painting in Spain during the late 18th century"" opened in the Sunley Room on 15 March. The Gallery has recently acquired works by three Spanish painters from this time: Paret, Melendez, and Francisco Bayeu, who are the main focus of the exhibition. They are joined by Francisco's brother Ramon, Antonio Gonzalez, and two Italian artists who worked in Spain during this period: Corrado Giaquinto and Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. The exhibition will be open until 31 May.

For a group of children aged ten to fifteen, Saturdays are spent learning how to cook. Their weekly lessons in small classes are so popular that there is a waiting list of 30 children who want to join. Parents pay £280 for the course, where their children can have fun and learn to make good food. 

Bill, who is ten years old, says, ""I love my mum's cooking, and now I can do it better than her. The teachers make us laugh, especially when we sit down to share the food we've made."" 

Flora, who is twelve, has some trouble with onions. She says, ""I love cooking. I made a meal for ten friends, and they really enjoyed it. My mum suggested I find a hobby instead of doing nothing on weekends. I liked staying at home, so I wasn't very excited at first. But I'm really glad I decided to come."" 

Their teacher, Philippe, says, ""It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, even if the kitchen isn't always tidy when they cook! As adults, we keep learning more about food. If parents get their children interested in cooking when they are young, they will have the skills to make food for themselves when they leave home."""

PET_21,"**MONEY**

What is money? The pound, the dollar, and the franc are types of money, similar to how a gram or a kilometre measures weight or distance. The main difference is that you can use money to buy things. For example, a five-pound note can be used to buy a book, a large bag of sweets, or a few cinema tickets. However, the note itself is just a piece of paper that costs very little to produce.

Thousands of years ago, people did not have money like we do today. There were no banks or shops. Back then, Mr. Green, a farmer, would trade the corn he grew for honey from Mr. Hive. This was a simple exchange between two people who each had something the other wanted. Over time, most societies created their own forms of money, called 'currencies', to make trading easier. Eventually, different currencies started to connect, which is why today we all use a national currency."
PET_46,"**Text: Write a Winning Story!**

You could win £1,000 in this year's Fiction Prize and have your story published in Keep Writing magazine. Ten other lucky winners will receive £100 each. We are looking for people who can write good stories. The judges include Mary Littlejohn, a novelist, Michael Brown, a television reporter, and Susan Hitchins, the editor of Keep Writing. They want interesting and original stories. Last year, detective fiction was very popular, but the winner wrote a love story.

You can write about anything you like, but here are some tips to help you:

1. **Write About What You Know**: This is important advice for every writer. Last year, many stories were about love, family, and friendship problems. Try to make ordinary situations interesting so that people want to read them.

2. **Get Your Facts Right**: Make sure your descriptions are accurate. If you write about a town or how a jet engine works, be sure you have the correct information.

3. **Hold the Reader's Attention**: Start your story in an interesting way and end it with a surprise. A weak ending can ruin a good story. Develop your story carefully and think of something unusual for the ending.

4. **Think About the Characters**: Make your characters feel real by using good words to describe them.

Your story must be your own work, between 2,000 and 2,500 words, typed, double-spaced, and printed on one side of each page. We cannot accept stories sent by fax or email, even if you are close to the deadline. You must include the application form with your story. Unfortunately, we cannot return your story or discuss our decisions.

You should not have had any fiction published in any magazine or book in this country. This is a new rule based on popular request. Your story must not have been published in any form, such as on radio or TV, anywhere in the world.

You need to pay a fee of £5 to the Writers' Association. Make your cheque payable to Keep Writing and send it with the application form and your story to us. The closing date is 30 July, and we will inform the winner within one month. If you win, you must agree to have your story published in our magazine."
PET_3,"**THE FIRST WOMAN SCIENTIST**

Hypatia was born in Alexandria, Egypt, in 370 A.D. For many centuries, she was the only woman scientist recognized in history. Her father was the director of Alexandria University, and he ensured that she received the best education possible. This was rare because most women at that time had few chances to study. After studying in Athens and Rome, Hypatia returned to Alexandria and started teaching mathematics. She quickly became well-known for her understanding of new ideas. Although we do not have her books, we know she wrote several important works on mathematics. Hypatia was also interested in technology and created several scientific tools to assist her work. During her time, many rulers were afraid of science, and those involved in it were often in danger. In March 415, Hypatia was attacked in the street and killed."

PET_27,"**Text: Grass**

Grass is one of the most successful plants in the world. There are more than 9,000 different types of grass, and they can be found in every part of the earth. Grass is the only type of flowering plant that can grow in very cold places like the Arctic and Antarctic. Grasslands are home to many animals, from small insects and birds to large animals like cows and lions. All these animals rely on grass in some way.

One interesting fact about grass is that it grows back quickly after being cut or damaged. Unlike other plants, new leaves grow from below the ground, not from the top. This is why many animals can live together in one area. When they eat all the grass, there is always fresh grass available because it starts to grow again."
PET_44,"Text: Kal Kaur Rai, the Young Achiever of the Year, has always loved fashion. She recently won this title at the Asian Business Awards. Since she was a child, she enjoyed drawing clothes and creating designs. However, she never told her parents, who run a supermarket, that she wanted to make fashion her career. She thought they wanted her to choose a more traditional job, so she studied management at university.

After finishing university, Kal moved to London and worked at an advertising agency. She had to go to many industry events but could not afford the designer clothes she wanted. To solve this, she started making skirts and tops for herself. When her friends saw her creations, they asked her to make clothes for them too. 

Kal then found a small shop in London that agreed to sell her designs. The clothes were very popular, and none of them were returned. This success encouraged her to leave her job in advertising, take a £20,000 loan, and start her own women's clothing brand. Her parents were supportive of her decision, which made her very happy.

Now, her clothes are sold in over 70 stores, and her business earns more than £500,000. Her designs are featured in fashion magazines, she creates outfits for pop stars, and she gained public recognition by winning this award. Kal feels grateful for her success, saying, ""What I do is my hobby - and I get paid for it! But remember, I've worked hard for this."""

It is about 20 minutes by bus from the center of town, and many buses stop outside the hotel. Guests should avoid buses with a blue sign that says ""Express"" because they do not stop near the hotel. An underground station is less than 100 meters away.

The main building has 200 comfortable, heated single rooms, each with hot and cold water. Showers, baths, and toilets are at the end of the corridors. The hotel also has a shop, sitting rooms, four television rooms, a table tennis room, a library, and a laundry. There are eight pianos for guests to use.

PET_49,"**Simplified Text:**

Mark Ottaway took a train journey from Darwin, in northern Australia, to Adelaide, in the south. The Ghan train travels across Australia, from the warm northern coast through long stretches of desert to the cooler Southern Ocean. It is often called the ""famous Ghan,"" but it is known for being late. 

The idea of a train link between Darwin and Adelaide started in the 1920s with a line that went from Adelaide to Alice Springs. However, there were often floods that made it hard for trains to run. A new line was finished just a few months before my trip. The railway was built for speeds up to 115 kph, but the Ghan is not a fast train. It has few stops, and most passengers are on holiday. The Ghan does not offer luxury like the Orient Express, but the food on board is very good. The railway was originally made to transport goods, not passengers. It was believed that sending goods from Europe to southern Australia through Darwin and the train would save time and money compared to shipping around the continent. 

It is rare to complete a transcontinental railway, and the Ghan claims to be the first north-south railway in the world. As I waited to get on the Ghan, I noticed that everyone was excited about the trip. Most of my fellow travelers were older Australians who were eager to board. Our first stop was Katherine, where the Ghan stayed for four hours. Some passengers got off to take a boat trip. I stayed on the train until Alice Springs, where I joined a two-day trip to Uluru (Ayers Rock) with a small group and a guide. Climbing the rock is not encouraged now, and few people do it. Our group walked around the rock and watched the beautiful sunset. 

From Alice Springs, there are two trains a week going south, so many passengers stop their journey there. The view from the train after Alice Springs is not very interesting; there is a lot of flat land with only cattle to see. But on the third day, at dawn, we reached the foothills near the Southern Ocean. My journey was ending, and even though the train did not meet all the promises in the advertisements, it took me to some of the most amazing sights in Australia."
PET_31,"**Climbing to the Top of Britain**

Every year, thousands of people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland. Because it is in the north, the weather can be very cold. Climber Keith Hewitt shares his experience of climbing Ben Nevis for the first time.

""It was February, and it was my first big winter climb. We chose a route up the north face of the mountain to Tower Ridge. This climb is six hundred metres high, probably the longest in Britain. We planned to camp for three days in the 'Carries', which are large bowls cut into the mountain halfway up. We carried tents, sleeping bags, and metal spikes for our boots. You need these spikes on Ben Nevis because the snow can be very hard, making it feel like walking on ice. 

Even though some people in our group were very experienced, we packed a lot of safety equipment, including lights to attract attention, hard hats, and extra clothes. The weather forecast was good, with no strong winds, but we still felt nervous when we started. Climbing Ben Nevis in winter is always a challenge.

The path quickly became steep, and my legs felt heavy. I was the weakest member of the group, so I had to take more breaks. The others sometimes stopped to let me catch up, but as soon as I arrived, they would start climbing again. I promised myself that I would train better before my next climb.

After climbing 200 metres, we reached the start of Tower Ridge, the path that would take us to the top of Ben Nevis. It is only a metre and a half wide, and the mountain drops hundreds of metres on each side. We knew we had to stay calm and focus on every step as we moved slowly along it. After seven hours of climbing, we finally reached the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and the island of Skye, which is 48 kilometres away. However, we were not so lucky because a mist had come down.

Getting back down to camp can be just as hard as going up. You need to read a map well; a wrong turn could lead to dangerous slopes in winter. I was glad we decided to take turns reading the map. That first time, I only felt I really enjoyed the experience when I was safe in the tent. But at least I made it to the top."""
PET_58,"**Anna's New School**

This week has been very exciting because we have moved into our new school building! It is an amazing place. The builders used wood for the whole building, just like in our old school, but this one is also designed to be environmentally friendly. The school took many months to build, and we watched it being built. It was exciting to see the builders clear the land, but it also meant that some nice open space was lost. The noise from the building machines was very loud, and sometimes the builders had to stop because it rained a lot. We started to think the building would never be finished.

Now, we have five classrooms, which are much bigger than the ones in our old school next door, which was very old. We also share one room with people from the town for meetings. There is a nursery, a nice dining room, and big changing rooms that we are looking forward to using when our new sports field is ready.

When you enter the school, you will notice that there are no heaters! Instead, the heat comes from everyone inside - the children, the teachers, and the computers. The building is designed to keep the heat inside, and it also keeps the sound in, so when we sing in our classrooms, it feels like we are in a concert hall!

Another interesting thing is that the school roof has a tree on it! The builders put it there after finishing the roof because it is a custom in Austria, where the roof was made. The electricity for the lights and computers comes from a wind turbine on a hill behind the school. We went with our teacher to see it yesterday, and it spins very fast. It is so big that you can see it from far away! We took some pictures to put on our website.

Even though we are already using the school, some parts are still being finished. For example, we are putting on a play for our parents, but we have to go back to our old school hall to do it. The new hall will be ready by next year. We are very happy with our new school, and our teachers say we will learn much faster now that we are here!"

A month ago, I never thought that on a Saturday afternoon in November, I would be 30 meters above the ground and enjoying it. Now, as I looked down at the river far below, I understood why people love rock climbing. My friend Matt and I arrived at the Activity Centre on Friday evening. The place where we stayed was not great, but we had everything we needed: beds, blankets, and food. We were happy to be out of the city and in the fresh air.

On Saturday morning, we met the other ten members of our group. Cameron came with his friends, Kevin and Simon, while sisters Carole and Lynn came with their friend Amanda. We all came from different places and did not know the area. We knew we would spend the weekend outdoors, but we were not sure how.

Half of us went caving in the morning, while the others went rock climbing. We switched activities at lunchtime. Matt and I went to the caves first. Climbing out was harder than going in, but after a lot of effort, we finally got out—covered in mud but happy and excited about what we had done."
PET_23,"**Letter to the Newport Evening News**

On Saturday afternoon, I left my handbag on the bus. Inside it were my cheque book, address book, and my purse, which had about £50 in cash and some credit cards. When I realized what I had done, it was too late. I didn’t know what to do. I am 72 years old, far from home, and I felt very worried. I stood by the side of the road and cried.

A young man saw me and asked what was wrong. I told him what happened. He kindly gave me some money for my bus fare home. When I told the bus driver about my handbag, he said I could keep the fare. I got home safely, and soon after, the phone rang. It was the manager of CityBus, the company that owned the bus. He said they had found my handbag and offered to bring it back to me.

I was amazed to get my handbag back with everything inside still there. I want to thank everyone who helped me that day. I really appreciate their kindness and honesty.

PET_60,"**Sharks**

Sharks are some of the most frightening animals in our oceans. They are very good at finding food underwater because they can see well and feel movement through special lines on the sides of their bodies. This makes sharks dangerous for smaller sea animals that they eat.

Although sharks are similar to other fish in some ways, their bodies are different. For example, most sharks must swim all the time to breathe and stay alive, so they hardly ever sleep. Also, if sharks are turned upside down, they can stop moving completely. This is a useful technique for researchers who need to study sharks. It helps them learn more about these interesting creatures."

PET_53,"**Text: Joining the Kirov Ballet**

My name is Nathalie. Last year, I became one of the youngest foreign students to join the Kirov ballet school in St Petersburg, Russia. On my first day of ballet class, I felt nervous because I didn’t know anyone. Everyone came over to ask me questions in Russian. I tried to respond in Russian, and then they switched to English, so we could talk. Now, six months later, everyone is very friendly, my Russian has improved a lot, and I understand my teachers well.

For the first two weeks after I arrived, my mom stayed with me. When she left, I felt a bit sad. I even called home late one night to talk to her because I was feeling lonely. The classes in Russia are much harder than those in my ballet school in England, and I eat a lot to keep my energy up. This helps me meet the school’s high standards.

In the evenings, I like to watch my favorite movies on my computer, but sometimes I fall asleep before they finish. Now that I have settled in, I feel at home here. I enjoy walking around the city and visiting different shops, even in December when it was very cold. I bought a fur hat because it was minus 10°C, but the locals said that was mild for that time of year! At least my room is warm and cozy.

Right now, we are getting ready for a new production, and there is also a competition for young dancers that I plan to enter. I feel very lucky to be here."
PET_55,"**THE ICEHOTEL**

For many years, the Arctic was a popular place to visit in the summer to see the land of the midnight sun. However, in winter, the few people living there enjoyed the snow and ice by themselves. By the end of the 1980s, people began to see the dark and cold winter as a good thing. In the winter of 1990, a French artist named Jannot Derit was invited to open an exhibition in a specially built igloo (a building made of snow) in the small town of Jukkasjarvi, located on the frozen Torne River. This building, called Arctic Hall, attracted many visitors to the area. One night, a group of foreign guests decided to sleep in Arctic Hall. The next morning, they were very happy with their experience, and the idea of an ice hotel was created. Today, it is famous around the world.

When winter starts, a team of snow builders, architects, and artists from different countries come to Jukkasjarvi to build the hotel for that year. As each part is finished, it opens to visitors and guests, while other parts are still being built. The first part is completed in December, and each week after that, a new part opens until January 7th, when the hotel is fully completed. Since the ICEHOTEL is built outside using natural winter materials, the finishing date can change depending on the weather.

In spring, as the weather gets warmer, the hotel melts. Inside the hotel, the temperature is never colder than -5 to -8 degrees Celsius, no matter how cold it is outside. Guests receive winter clothes like warm overalls, hats, and gloves as part of their stay. It is also a good idea for guests to bring sweaters, scarves, and plenty of woollen socks. They should choose shoes that are larger than usual to fit the thick socks. If you plan to visit the hotel, you can buy warm sweaters, woollen socks, and more on the ICEHOTEL website. You can order these items along with your booking, and they will be delivered to your room when you check in.

The hotel is located in the village of Jukkasjarvi, 200 km above the Arctic Circle, but only 15 km from Kiruna airport and 17 km from Kiruna train station. You can arrange bus transport from the airport or train station to the ICEHOTEL."
PET_50,"**Text: Shopping for Furniture**

A report by Dave Worthington

Homestyle, a new furniture shop, had to close shortly after it opened at midnight last Thursday. Up to 6,000 people rushed to the shop. There were many special offers, like a leather sofa for £45 (only until 3 am) and a bed for £30 (only between 3 am and 8 am). The shop's regular hours will be from 9 am to 9 pm every day, but Homestyle had said it would stay open for the first 24 hours. However, it had to close within half an hour of opening.

A police officer who was called to the shop said: ""The police knew a large crowd was expected, but people were not patient. The shop quickly became full, and the managers wisely decided to close the doors. The people outside got angry because they thought everything would be sold before they could get in, and they refused to wait quietly until there was space for them. Another problem was that there was a long line of cars trying to get to the parking lot. I couldn't believe that many people left their cars in the middle of the road and walked the last few meters to the shop. This blocked the road completely.""

One customer, Jenny Smith, who got into the shop, said: ""I waited in line for three hours, and I didn't have time to buy what I wanted. But the staff were very calm and explained what was happening. They had no choice, as it wasn't safe. I will come back when they reopen, but I don't want to wait in line again."""

PET_34,"**Text: Free-diving in the Caribbean**

Tanya Streeter is a free-diver who holds four world records in this sport. Free-diving is when people dive deep into the ocean using only one breath of air. In 2003, Tanya made history by becoming the first person to dive 120 meters deep while holding her breath and then swim back up without any help. A year earlier, she had dived deeper but used a balloon to come back up. This time, she held her breath for over three and a half minutes, making her the first woman to break a world record previously held by a man.

During her dive, a team of fourteen safety divers watched her from different depths. Some people think free-diving is too dangerous because of accidents that have happened, but Tanya believes that safety and training are very important. Most free-divers focus on one or two types of events, but Tanya keeps a consistent training schedule. Two-thirds of her training is done in the gym, while the rest is split between the pool and the ocean. She uses an exercise bike to improve her heart fitness but avoids running to protect her knees. Instead, she prefers fast walking to stay fit.

When she practices diving, Tanya usually travels away from home. She aims to do fourteen dives over four weeks, taking a rest day between each dive. It is important for her not to get tired, as this could affect her performance. When she is not training, Tanya often makes public appearances to promote sports products and supports environmental organizations through research and films.

Tanya grew up on the Caribbean island of Grand Cayman, where she loved swimming and exploring rock pools to see sea life. She feels that her life now is like living her childhood dreams. Because she is famous in some countries, she believes people listen to her when she talks about environmental issues. Looking to the future, Tanya, who is now in her thirties, plans to continue breaking her own world records. She started free-diving at the age of twenty-five and wants to keep competing for many more years."
PET_12,"**CARTOON FILMS**

Cartoon films have very few limits. If you can draw something, you can make it move on the screen. New ideas and advanced computer programs are making cartoons exciting for people of all ages. By the end of the 1970s, many in the film industry thought cartoons were only for children. However, a few directors had original ideas that showed cartoons could be fun for both adults and children. 

Not every cartoon film was successful. For example, *The Black Cauldron* did not do well because it was too scary for children and too silly for adults. Directors learned from this mistake, and film companies started to make a lot of money again."

""I never thought I would spend part of my first year at university filming *The Finnegans*. I had only acted in school plays, but I loved the book since I was eleven. My grandmother used to say I was just like Polly Finnegan, and I always dreamed of playing her. 

Before starting university, I took a year off to travel. While I was in Chile, my mother emailed me to say they were planning to make the book into a TV drama. I knew I had to try for the role. My mother was surprised at first, but she sent my photo to the director and convinced him to meet me. I flew back and got the part.

Filming started a week after university began, so I asked for permission to be away for three weeks. When I returned to university, I woke up at 6:00 am to catch up on the essays I had missed. I didn’t tell my university friends about the filming, but they found out and thought it was exciting. It was an amazing experience, and I feel very lucky.

After university, I definitely want to make acting my career. I am not from an acting family, but my grandfather was an opera singer. I have tried for other TV roles, but I haven’t received any offers yet. I’m not sure how I managed everything because I also had a busy social life. When filming ended, I didn’t know what to do next. Since then, I have acted in two college plays. Unfortunately, I haven’t been home much, and now that my first year at university is over, I am going to Greece for the summer with friends."""

When I opened the first 'Body Shop' in 1976, my main goal was to earn enough money to feed my children. Today, 'The Body Shop' is a fast-growing international company. Over the years, I have learned a lot, and much of this knowledge is shared in this book. I believe we have important ideas about running a successful business while staying true to our values.

This is not just a typical business book or a story about my life. The main message is that to succeed in business, you need to be different. Business can be enjoyable, it can be run with care, and it can help others. In both business and life, I want to have fun, feel like I am part of a family, and be excited by new experiences. I have always wanted the people who work for 'The Body Shop' to feel the same way.

Now, this book shares my ideas with the world. I hope there are no limits to our 'family' and to what we can achieve. I find this thought exciting, and I hope you do too."
PET_4,"**A Journey Along the Beautiful Douro River**

Jules Verne operates a 'hotel ship' on the Douro River in Portugal. The MV Lady Ivy May can accommodate 160 guests in double cabins, all with outside views and private bathrooms. On the ship, which has air-conditioning, you will find a sun-deck, lounge, bar, dining room, shop, and library.

**Itinerary**

**Day 1:** You will leave London Heathrow in the early evening and arrive in Oporto. A guide will meet you and take you to the Lady Ivy May, where you will spend the night.

**Day 2:** After sightseeing in Oporto in the morning, you will return to the ship and sail to Entre-os-Rios. This part of the journey takes four hours.

**Day 3:** You will continue up the river. In the early evening, the ship will stop at Peso da Regua, known for its port wine. At dinner, you can enjoy delicious local food and drink.

**Day 4:** After breakfast, you will travel by bus to the ancient town of Lamego. You will visit the cathedral, several churches, and a museum that used to be a palace. The museum has a great collection of paintings, tapestries, and sculptures. After the visit, you will return to the ship and sail to Tua.

**Day 6:** In the morning, you will drive to Sao Joao da Pesqueira for one of the best views in the Douro Valley. After lunch on the ship, you will take the Douro River Valley railway for a scenic ride to Regua, where the Lady Ivy May will be waiting for you.

**Day 7:** You will visit Vila Real before returning to the ship for lunch. Then, you will sail down the river to Oporto and spend the night on board.

**Day 8:** You will arrive in Oporto with enough time for sightseeing and shopping before your flight back to London Heathrow."
PET_30,"**HONEY**

Honey is a sweet liquid made by bees. It is made of water and sugars. Bees can travel up to seventy-five thousand kilometers and visit over two million flowers to make just half a kilo of honey. The color and taste of honey depend on the type of flower the bees visit. There are more than three hundred types of honey. Lighter-colored honey usually has a milder taste than darker honey. 

In ancient times, honey was the main sweet food because sugar was very rare. The ancient Egyptians valued honey so much that they used it as payment. Today, honey is produced and eaten all over the world. Research shows that honey can help reduce tiredness and improve athletic performance. However, honey is not just food; it can also be used for sore throats and is found in many skin and hair-care products."
PET_7,"**Text: Norwich**

Norwich is the capital of East Anglia, a region in Britain, and has been a place to live for over two thousand years. It started as a small village by the River Wensum. By the time of the Norman invasion in 1066, it had grown into one of the largest towns in England. Norwich has two cathedrals and a mosque, making it an important center for different religions. The first cathedral was built in 1095 and recently celebrated its 900th anniversary. In 1994, Norwich celebrated the 800th anniversary of receiving a Royal Charter, which allowed it to be called a city and to govern itself.

Today, Norwich is smaller than cities like London or Manchester, with a population of about 150,000. However, in the 16th century, it was the second city of England. It continued to grow for the next 300 years, becoming wealthy and famous for having many churches and pubs. Nowadays, there are fewer churches and pubs, but in 1964, the University of East Anglia was established in Norwich. With a growing student population and its success as a modern commercial center (it is the largest center for insurance services outside London), Norwich now offers a variety of entertainment options, including theatres, cinemas, nightclubs, busy cafes, excellent restaurants, and arts and leisure centers. The city also has a football team known as 'The Canaries', which wears green and yellow.

One of the city's recent developments is a modern shopping center called 'The Castle Mall'. For over two years, the people of Norwich dealt with a large hole in the city while builders worked on the main car park. They moved nearly a million tons of earth to create a park on the roof of the Mall, complete with water pools and many trees. The local people are happy that the old open market still exists in the city center, next to the new shopping center. Both areas continue to thrive, showing that Norwich has successfully combined the old and the new."
PET_43,"**The Albuquerque Balloon Festival**

Every autumn, the sky above Albuquerque, a city in the southwestern United States, fills with bright colors. This is the Albuquerque Balloon Festival, a nine-day event that happens every year. The first festival took place in 1972 to celebrate the 50th birthday of a local radio station. It started with about twelve hot-air balloons taking off from a parking lot in the city. Since then, the festival has grown a lot. This year, at least a thousand balloons from more than a third of the countries in the world are expected to participate at its current location outside the city.

**What to See**

The pilots communicate with each other using radios, and they all light up the burners of their balloons at the same time. This event is called a ""balloon glow,"" and it is a great chance to take amazing photographs. To see the ""glows,"" you should arrive just after nightfall or before 5:30 am, as the balloons rise into the dark sky. During the day, you can walk among the balloons and talk to the pilots as they get ready for take-off. The balloons come in many sizes and colors, with some shaped like animals or cartoon characters, as well as popular products like soft drinks and fast food. Kids will enjoy it too. 

In the afternoon, you can even take a balloon flight over the desert with one of the many companies that offer rides. Another option is to take the cable car from the desert floor to the top of the nearby mountains, which is the longest ride of its kind, and enjoy a great view of the festival. There are many other attractions for visitors of all ages, including balloon races and fireworks on the opening night and the last three nights of the festival.

**The Albuquerque Box**

This is a local wind pattern that creates perfect conditions for balloon flying. The Sandia Mountains protect the balloons from strong winds and create gentler winds at different heights. This allows skilled pilots to control the direction of their balloons by going up or down.

**Practical Advice**

Buy your tickets in advance online to avoid long waits at the festival. Wear several layers of thin clothing because it can be cool at night and in the early morning, but during the day, sunglasses and sunscreen are important. Bring a flashlight for night events and, of course, don’t forget your camera. If you use film instead of digital photography, make sure to bring high-speed film for evening and night pictures."

The Eden Project, located in the south-west of England, is one of the most popular tourist attractions in the UK. At first glance, the large 'biospheres' on this old industrial site look like something from a science-fiction movie. Each biosphere represents a different climate zone, showing visitors how important the connection between people and plants is. It is surprising to see how many everyday products come from plants, such as wood, rubber, fruit, rice, sugar, coffee, and chocolate. More than 135,000 different types of plants are grown here. No matter how cold it is outside, computer-controlled heaters keep the plants at the right temperature. In the Rainforest Zone, the air is always humid because of a large waterfall. Another zone mimics the environment of the Mediterranean, California, and South Africa, and there are plans to create a desert zone in the future."
PET_11,"**Text: No Title**

Some people have said they do not like this year's collection, New Writing 3, but I do not understand why. Getting 500 pages of original writing of this quality for £6.99 is quite impressive, right? Most of the book is made up of fiction, including parts of novels and complete short stories. There are enjoyable pieces by well-known writers like Candia McWilliam and Rose Tremain. Interestingly, many lesser-known writers have written mainly about food. I recommend you avoid reading Jane Harris's ""Those Nails"" right after eating, as it has some very unpleasant scenes that might upset you! 

The collection also features great work from nineteen poets, including R. S. Thomas and John Burnside. There are excerpts from novels that are still being written by Jim Crace and Jane Rogers. Lastly, there is a bit of non-fiction, including a funny article by Alan Rusbridger about some newspapers and an extraordinary piece by Ursula Owen about her own life. This is an outstanding collection, and I am excited to see what next year's edition will bring!"

""The best age to start learning the violin is between three and six,"" says Margaret Porter, a violinist and music teacher. ""This is when children are discovering the world."" Margaret, who lives in London, usually teaches children who are three or four years old, but she has also accepted some eager five-year-olds. When she began teaching the violin in 1972, her first class was made up of her children's five-year-old friends.

Margaret's students have group lessons. Each group has about twelve students, and each lesson lasts one hour, taking place every two weeks. In addition, each student has one individual lesson with her every week. Parents must also attend the classes because it is important for them to be involved in their children's learning.

From the very first lessons, students learn to play by ear. They do not start reading music until they have been playing for several years. For a long time, there is a big difference between how they play and how they read music. Margaret explains that her teaching method is not meant to create great violinists. She often suggests that students who do very well should leave and learn the violin using more traditional methods."
PET_56,"**Moonshine**

The band Moonshine released their third CD last week. ""Here Again"" is a follow-up to their previous CD, ""The Waves."" There have been some changes since the last CD: Tom Wilcott is now playing bass guitar instead of Simon McVee, who left the band last year, and Tom Simpson has joined as the new drummer. 

From the first song, which is a dance tune, it is clear that the band is moving away from slow songs. The second song is also a dance track and is even louder and heavier. Most of the later songs are in the band's usual slow style. These two dance tracks will surprise many fans, but either of them could easily become a hit single because they are excellent. 

Singer Rob Letchford has a chance to show his talent, hitting each note perfectly. Fans should be thankful he recorded these songs before he had throat problems, which caused the band to cancel their next tour. (Anyone who bought tickets does not need to worry, as all the concerts will be rescheduled once Rob has recovered.)

On this CD, Moonshine demonstrates that they can create great music in different styles, from the slow songs we know to the upbeat ones that make you want to dance. However, I felt that they placed their best songs at the beginning, and the last few tracks were not as strong. Despite this, ""Here Again"" is sure to be a big hit and will bring more success to the band."

San Francisco is located on the northern California coast. The first Europeans to find this area were led by a Spanish explorer named Gaspar de Portola, who saw it for the first time in 1769. Interestingly, San Francisco Bay is a great natural harbor, but it was discovered by land, not by sea. 

In 1849, many people came to San Francisco hoping to find gold. However, it was not the gold seekers who became rich. The wealthiest people were those who owned banks and law firms, and they built large houses on a hill called Nob Hill. 

Today, many tourists visit San Francisco to see famous places like Chinatown and the Golden Gate Bridge. Some even take a short boat trip to Alcatraz Island to visit the old prison."

The most famous diary in English was written by Samuel Pepys. It gives a detailed and interesting view of everyday life in England from 1660 to 1669. Pepys writes about important events of that time, such as diseases, an enemy navy coming up the River Thames, and the Great Fire of London. He also shares personal stories, including his mistakes—like often falling asleep in church or looking at pretty girls. He talks about his home life, including arguments with his wife and how they made up, as well as his worries about her health. Besides reading, he enjoyed music, the theatre, card games, and parties with good food and fun. Pepys was a busy man with many important jobs; he was a Member of Parliament and the President of the Royal Society. He is also remembered for his contributions to the British Navy."
PET_33,"**The History of Shoes**

In the past, people did not think much about whether shoes were comfortable or stylish. Early shoes were likely made from animal skins, which people tied around their ankles to keep warm. Today, we still use leather, but we also have shoes made from materials like silk, plastic, and cotton, depending on current fashion trends. 

It was only about 150 years ago that people started wearing different shoes for each foot. Before that, shoes were straight and could be worn on either foot. All shoes used to be made by hand, but now most shoes are made by machines in large factories. The invention of sewing machines helped the shoe industry produce many more shoes at lower prices, making them available to more people."

When I hurt my back, I had to stop running for a while. I wanted to help more women get into running, to show them how enjoyable it can be and to help them feel confident. So, I started a running club for women in my area. I was frustrated with many race organisers who complain about not having enough women in the sport but do not provide separate changing rooms for them.

I put up posters, and 40 women of different ages and fitness levels joined. Most of them were interested in losing weight, but I don’t think they had thought much about running before. If they did, they imagined it as painful training. They didn’t see it as a chance to chat and smile while running in beautiful places, like by a river.

At first, they could only run for one minute, but now they can run for thirty minutes. They have also learned about diet and staying fit from other runners. I wanted to support women in running, and it has been a joy to see their progress, almost as much as they have enjoyed it themselves."
PET_40,"**THE HISTORY OF THE IDITAROD - THE LAST GREAT RACE ON EARTH**

In the 1880s, gold was found in Alaska, the northernmost state in the USA. Many people moved there to try to get rich. New towns were built quickly, including one called Iditarod, which means 'far, distant place'. In 1909, Iditarod grew so fast that it briefly became the largest city in Alaska.

In the summer, supplies could be brought to these towns by boat. However, in winter, the rivers and ocean froze, making it hard to reach them. So, in 1910, a winter trail was created for dog teams pulling sleds. They delivered mail, food, and clothes to the gold miners. This trail was called the Iditarod Trail. It took a team of dogs about three weeks to travel across Alaska. They stopped at 'roadhouses' where the drivers could sleep and eat.

The trail was used every winter until the 1920s when airplanes replaced boats and dog teams as the main transport. However, in 1925, the dogs became famous again when a disease called diphtheria struck the city of Nome. The medicine needed to cure the disease was in Anchorage, on the other side of Alaska. Airplanes were new, and no one was sure if they could fly in the cold. The only skilled pilot, Carl Eielson, was away at that time. So, it was decided to use dog teams to transport the medicine instead.

The journey was over 1,000 kilometers, mostly along the Iditarod Trail. It took twenty dog teams just six days to complete the trip. Leonhard Seppala, a Norwegian searching for gold, traveled the first 400 kilometers. He relied on his dog Togo to find the way through the heavy snow, and Togo proved to be a great guide. The last part of the journey was done by Gunnar Kaasen, who had driven dog teams in Alaska for 21 years. His lead dog was Saito. At one point, Balto, another dog, refused to go further, saving the team from falling into icy water. The diphtheria outbreak was stopped, and Balto became a hero.

Today, a dog sled race is held every year from Anchorage to Nome, following the route of that famous journey in 1925. This race is called the Iditarod and is known as 'The Last Great Race on Earth'."

The village of Jukkasjarvi is located in Swedish Lapland, where winter temperatures can drop to -40°C. Despite the cold, around 6,000 tourists visit each year to see one of the most unique hotels in Europe. In this hotel, everything is made of ice, including the rooms where you can eat, drink, and sleep. You can even have a wedding there! The bar is also made of ice, so it is not a good idea to put hot drinks on it. 

The bedrooms are kept at about -4°C, but guests receive special sleeping bags to keep warm. If needed, they can also get suitable outdoor clothing. The hotel lasts for only six months because it melts in the summer, and every winter, it is rebuilt. Building the hotel requires 10,000 tonnes of ice and 30,000 tonnes of snow."

In 1988, Maria Mutola was playing football as the only girl on an all-boys team in a local competition in Mozambique. ""We won,"" she said. ""At first, no one thought it was a problem that I was a girl. But then the team we beat complained."" This story was published in a local newspaper, and Jose Craveirinha, who supported other African athletes, learned about Maria. He went to meet her and saw her kicking a ball outside the football club. He quickly realized that she was very fast.

""He talked to me about athletics. I didn’t understand what he meant. The only sport I knew was football. Then he bought me running shoes and took me to train. It was very hard work, and my legs really hurt."" Jose spoke to her parents and convinced them that she could be successful, which would help their family. They agreed to let him take her away to train.

In 1991, she finally accepted an invitation to train in the United States. She had said no before because she knew she would miss her family. Her background was different from the girls she met in the US. She said, ""They were good athletes, but while I worried about my parents having enough to eat, they worried about dresses and make-up. They knew very little about me and even less about my problems. But I knew I was lucky to be there. The trainers were excellent, and I learned a lot.""

Today, Maria still runs and spends most of the year happily living in South Africa with her mother."

The Grand Canyon in the United States was formed by the Colorado River. Many people visit Grand Canyon Park to walk, run, and especially to enjoy the view. The view is amazing, and it is even better because of the Skywalk. The Skywalk is 1,219 meters above the bottom of the Grand Canyon. It is a platform made of glass, so you can see the beautiful rocks below. Up to 120 people can stand on it at the same time. The Skywalk opened in 2007, and since then, thousands of visitors have enjoyed it. To protect the glass, you must wear special covers over your shoes. Walking on the Skywalk feels like flying high in the air, like a bird."

The Rocky Mountains stretch almost the entire length of North America. They begin in the Northwest but are also found a few hundred miles from the center in the southern regions. Although the Rockies are smaller than the Alps, they are still very beautiful. There are many roads that go through the Rockies, but the best way to see them is by train. 

You can start your journey from Vancouver, which is one of the most beautiful cities in Canada. This city is located near the water and the mountains, allowing people to ski just 15 minutes by car from the city center. In the past, thirty passenger trains left Vancouver every day for the cross-continent railway. Now, there are only three trains a week, but the trip is still an exciting adventure. You can sleep on the train, which is enjoyable, but you will see some of the best views at night."
PET_42,"**Text: ZOOS**

People have kept animals in zoos for over 3,000 years. The first big zoo was called the Gardens of Intelligence, opened by the rulers of China. In the past, animals in zoos were trained to perform for visitors, but this is no longer done. Now, the main purpose of zoos is to let people see animals behaving naturally.

Today, most cities have a zoo or wildlife park. However, not everyone agrees with zoos. Supporters of zoos believe they help us learn about nature and allow us to see wild animals up close. They think these experiences would not be possible without zoos.

On the other hand, some people do not like zoos. They believe it is wrong to keep animals in cages. They also argue that in poorly managed zoos, animals may live in dirty conditions and eat the wrong food."
PET_59,"**JAZZ**  
By Katie Atkins, aged 14  

I play the trumpet in my school jazz band. Last month, we had a jazz competition with bands from local high schools, and our band won! Each band wore different costumes, from black school uniforms like my band to bright T-shirts. We didn’t look like professional adult bands, but we were all used to performing in competitions, so the quality of our playing was amazing, especially since we are all so young. Players from each band even made up new tunes right on stage. It was exciting to watch, but even better when my band played!  

We have a great jazz band at my school, but not everyone who wants to join gets accepted—only about half of the students. However, anyone who is eager to play can go to jazz practice before school, and we often spend time together after school, listening to jazz and learning about it. There are also trips to jazz summer camps across the country. I have been to a couple and learned a lot.  

Adults are often surprised that young people are interested in jazz. My music teacher thinks it’s because pop music isn’t challenging enough for serious music lovers like me. I find jazz exciting because it feels both new and old at the same time. You can create your own music, but you also feel connected to its history, as you play on stage like great jazz performers did before you. My school is very lucky because we have great teachers and supportive parents. Without them, we wouldn’t get far with our music!"
PET_54,"**Text: Watering the Desert**

In Marrakesh, Morocco, it can rain anytime from November to March. However, it does not rain often. When it does rain, the city's water pipes cannot handle the sudden floods, causing the streets to become like rivers. Many winters have been dry recently, so when it rains, the local people are very happy. 

The parks and gardens in Marrakesh do not rely on rain; instead, they get water from a system of underground channels that were built in the 11th century. These channels bring water from the mountains all year round. Places that are mostly dry but receive water this way are called oases.

If you travel south from Marrakesh, you will reach Skoura. In Skoura, every piece of land is divided into small squares by water channels, and people use these squares to grow food. The snow-covered Atlas mountains in winter create a beautiful view."

Three years ago, Alan, Kath, and Gareth joined a circus. Kath says, ""People laugh when we tell them, but it's true. Gareth has wanted to be a clown since we took him to the circus when he was three.""

When Alan lost his job, he and Kath decided to look for full-time jobs in the circus. They both found jobs with a famous circus, and Gareth started training to be a clown. He calls himself Bippo. They travel with the circus in the summer and go home in the winter. Gareth's brothers are old enough to take care of the house while they are away.

Kath explains, ""I can't say it was easy. There was a lot to think about and organize. We only had a car and a small caravan to sleep in, and we were leaving our nice house. The only thing Gareth missed was his long, hot baths.""

Gareth shares, ""People ask about my education, but from the start, someone has always come to teach me wherever we go. I use the same books as my classmates at school, and I have a computer. I've never fallen behind.""

You can read or listen to the news stories and articles by our members on the Eight-eighteen website.

We have three centers across the country where young people can meet other members and join projects. We plan to open more centers in the future. Since we started in 1994, when we were called 'Young News', over 2,500 young people have been members. Sophie is one of them. She says: ""I first heard of Eight-eighteen when they interviewed me for an article about young people's opinions on hip hop music. I was amazed by the opportunities they had. Age didn't matter; they were trusted to do stories on their own. I started going to the Eight-eighteen center in my city, got some training, and was a member until I turned 18. Eight-eighteen helped me achieve more than I thought possible. With the skills I learned, I got a job at 19 and am now the youngest employee on a major news website, checking articles before they are published.""

**Get Involved at Every Level**

When you join Eight-eighteen, you will receive training and participate in monthly meetings to decide who will write each news story. Eight-eighteen encourages members to share their skills. 'Peer trainers' are experienced members who are 12 years old and older. They train new members and teach them basic journalism skills. As they gain more experience, some members present sessions to young people and adults outside of Eight-eighteen, often in youth clubs and summer camps. These young trainers are always supported by older staff who go with them on these trips.

Eight-eighteen News holds training sessions for new members three times a year. Our next training for new members will be in February. If you or someone you know is interested in joining, call Director Den Ley at 01622 657874 for more information. The Eight-eighteen program is suitable for children with reading and writing skills at all levels. Membership is free, and there is no test to join."
PET_28,"**Antarctica Sightseeing Flights Website**

Welcome to our website! Here is what you need to know before booking a flight. During the short summer in Antarctica, we offer sightseeing flights from Sydney, Australia, on a Boeing 747. These flights take you over Antarctica and back. The exact dates for next year are not confirmed yet, but if you book now, your deposit can be moved to a different date if needed.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**How long is the flight?**  
The average flight lasts 12 hours. About four hours into the flight, we usually see the first sea ice and icebergs. We spend four hours flying over Antarctica and the rest of the time returning home. During the flight, experts who have worked in Antarctica will talk about the environment and history, and they will answer your questions. There is also a camera next to the pilot that shows a view from the cockpit throughout the flight.

**Will I get a seat next to a window?**  
All passengers receive two boarding passes. At the halfway point of the flight, you will be asked to move to the seat shown on your second boarding pass. Business and first-class passengers will have a window seat for half of the flight and a seat next to a window for the other half. Economy passengers will have either a window seat or a seat next to a window for half of the flight and an end-of-row seat for the other half. While flying over Antarctica, we encourage passengers to get up and move around the plane so everyone can enjoy the views. The pilot will fly in long 'figure 8s' over interesting places to give everyone a good view from both sides of the plane.

**What happens if the weather is bad?**  
We have 17 different flight plans approved. On the morning of the flight, the captain will check the satellite images of the clouds and choose the direction that offers the best views.

**Will I see penguins and other wildlife?**  
Most wildlife in Antarctica lives at sea level, which is over 3,000 meters below the plane, so we cannot see them clearly. We do not land in Antarctica for environmental reasons. If you want to see Antarctic wildlife, you would need to join a boat tour.

**Can I take photographs?**  
Yes! You can bring all types of cameras. We also have some fun photo opportunities on board where you can try on Antarctic cold weather clothes."
PET_35,"**Text: Little Chefs**

For a group of children aged ten to fifteen, Saturdays are spent learning how to cook. Their weekly lessons in small classes are so popular that there is a waiting list of 30 children who want to join. Parents pay £280 for the course, where their children can have fun and learn to make good food. 

Bill, who is ten years old, says, ""I love my mum's cooking, and now I can do it better than her. The teachers make us laugh, especially when we sit down to share the food we've made."" 

Flora, who is twelve, has some trouble with onions. She says, ""I love cooking. I made a meal for ten friends, and they really enjoyed it. My mum suggested I find a hobby instead of doing nothing on weekends. At first, I was happy staying at home, so I wasn't very interested. But now, I'm really glad I decided to come."" 

Their teacher, Philippe, says, ""It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, even if the kitchen isn't always tidy when they cook! As adults, we keep learning more about food. If parents get their children interested in cooking when they are young, they will have the skills to make food for themselves when they leave home."""
PET_5,"**Winter Driving**

Winter can be dangerous because it is hard to predict what will happen, and accidents can happen easily. Fog can appear suddenly over a hill. Ice may be hidden under melting snow, ready to make you lose control of your car. A car coming towards you might slide across the road unexpectedly.

**Rule Number One** for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly. Quick or sudden movements can make it hard to control your car. When you turn the wheel, brake, or speed up, do it gently and slowly. Imagine you have a full cup of hot coffee on the seat next to you. Drive carefully so you don’t spill it.

**Rule Number Two** is to pay attention to what could happen. The more ice there is, the further ahead you should look. Test how long it takes to stop by braking gently. Remember, you might be driving faster than you think. Generally, allow double your normal stopping distance on wet roads, three times this distance on snow, and even more on ice. Try to keep control of your car at all times to avoid problems."
PET_41,"**Craigie Aitchison**

The painter Craigie Aitchison was born in Scotland. He moved to London to study law but decided to go to art school instead. At art school, he found the traditional drawing classes hard, but he continued to paint. In his late twenties, the Italian government gave him money to study art, and he became interested in early Italian artists, which can be seen in some of his work. He loved the greens and browns of the Italian countryside and the bright light there, and he wanted to capture this light in his paintings. 

To do this, he painted colors thinly, layering them from light to dark, but he admits he is never sure what the final result will be. He says, ""It's a secret - because I don't know myself. I don't start by painting yellow, knowing I'm going to put anything on top."" Like many talented people, Aitchison makes it seem easy. He believes, ""Anyone can do the colors - you can buy them. I just notice what you put the colors next to.""

Unlike some artists, he does not make drawings before starting a painting because he thinks that if he did, he might get bored and not finish the painting. Instead, Aitchison changes his paintings many times before they are done. This is why he prefers to work with models who do not ask to see their pictures while he is painting. He says, ""If I feel they're worried and want to look at the painting, I can't do it.""

Since moving to London, he has not felt connected to the Scottish art scene. He claims he is not interested in following any tradition and just paints in his own way. However, his work still inspires young British painters."
PET_38,"**Text: 'Rock Band'**

Two years ago, our 14-year-old son, Ben, asked us for a set of drums for his birthday. At first, we were against the idea because of the noise. Ben argued, ""It's better than watching TV or playing computer games in my free time, and it will keep me out of trouble."" In the end, we agreed. We said, ""Okay, but you must think about the rest of the family and the neighbors when you play.""

That was just the beginning. Since drums are hard to move, Ben's band members started coming to our house with their guitars and other equipment. So, for several hours a week, our house shakes with their music and singing. At least Ben's hobby has been good for our health: whenever the band practices, my husband and I go for a long walk. 

I must admit that, even though their music can sound a bit strange, they are a friendly and polite group of young men. I cannot judge their musical skills; after all, I didn't expect my parents to like the same music I did when I was a teenager. They do play regularly in local clubs for young people.

Our main worry is that they might not spend enough time on their schoolwork because of their music, but this hasn't happened yet. I always remind Ben how important his studies are. One thing is certain: Ben was right; playing music has kept him out of trouble and he is never bored."
PET_17,"**Text: Atlantic College**

Last week, I visited Atlantic College, a great private college in Wales. This college offers students important experiences outside the classroom, along with the chance to study for their exams. The students, aged 16 to 18 and from all over the world, study in the morning. In the afternoon, they participate in useful activities, such as helping on a farm, caring for people with learning difficulties, or checking rivers for pollution.

One of the best things about Atlantic College is that its students come from many different backgrounds and countries. Since the fees are £20,000 for two years, many students receive financial support. About a quarter of the students are British, and many of them can only attend because they get help from the government.

Barbara Molenkamp, a student from the Netherlands, said, ""I really admire the college for encouraging international understanding among young people. You learn to live with and respect others, even those you may not like. During the summer holidays, my mother noticed that I argued much less with my sister.""

In summary, Atlantic College provides an excellent education with methods that really work."
PET_47,"**Text: Being an Older Student**

At 32 years old, I have just completed my first year at university. I attend lectures regularly and have learned to read books quickly and write long essays. I decided to go to university after being away from school for fourteen years. As a secretary, I earned a decent salary, but I felt bored because my job did not challenge me. I became unhappy thinking that I was stuck in that job. I envied the students at the local university who seemed happy, carefree, and excited about their future. 

Now that I am a student, I find it difficult to connect with younger classmates. They often mistake me for a teacher and ask me questions I cannot answer. I also feel distant from the professors because, even though we are the same age, I know much less than they do. However, I am grateful for this chance to study because I understand that having a qualification is important for getting a good job. Unlike most eighteen-year-olds, I prefer spending my weekends studying rather than going out to parties. 

There are also typical student benefits, like long holidays and discounts for theaters and cinemas. I often worry about what I will do after university, but I hope that continuing my education at this age has been a smart decision."
PET_48,"**Henry Ford**

Henry Ford was born on a farm in Michigan in 1863, but he did not enjoy farming. When he was fifteen, he started working as a mechanic. In 1893, he built his first car. After driving it 1,500 kilometers, he sold it and made two larger cars. In 1903, he founded the Ford Motor Company. By using strong but light steel, he created affordable cars for regular people. In 1908, he produced the first Ford Model 'T', which cost $825. Soon, he was selling 100 cars every day. By 1927, the Ford Motor Company was valued at $700 million. Early Ford cars were simple and inexpensive, but this simplicity sometimes meant fewer choices. Henry Ford famously said about the Model T, ""You can have any color you like, as long as it's black."""

KET_19,"**Rebecca Stevens**

Rebecca Stevens was the first woman to climb Mount Everest. Before this achievement, she worked as a journalist and lived in a small flat in south London. In 1993, Rebecca left her job and family to travel to Asia with other climbers. She discovered that life on Everest is very difficult. ""You must carry everything on your back,"" she said. ""You can only take what you really need. You can't wash on the mountain, and in the end, I didn't even take a toothbrush. I usually like to be clean, but there is no water, only snow. Water is very heavy, so you only take enough to drink!""

When Rebecca reached the top of Mount Everest on May 17, 1993, it was the best moment of her life. Suddenly, she became famous. Now, she has written a book about her journey, and people often ask her to speak about it. She also has a new job on a science program on television. Rebecca is well-known today and has more money, but she still lives in her small flat in south London, surrounded by her pictures and books about mountains!"

KET_13,"**Text: CANADA GEESE**

Canada Geese are large birds with blue and white feathers. When autumn comes, they need to fly south to find warmer weather. The winters in Canada are very cold, and the birds can die if they stay there. 

Last spring, a man named Bill Lishman found sixteen young Canada Geese on his farm. These young birds had lost their parents. Bill thought, ""These young birds will not know how to fly south in the autumn."" Bill had a small plane, so he decided to teach the geese to follow him. 

All summer, he took short flights in his plane, and the young geese flew after him. When autumn arrived and the weather got cold, Bill flew to Virginia in the United States, which is 600 miles south of his home in Canada. The geese followed him the whole way. 

After reaching Virginia, Bill left the geese there and returned home. This spring, he waited for the birds to come back, but they did not arrive. So, Bill flew back to Virginia to find them. He searched for two weeks but could not find them. When he returned home, he was surprised to see the geese waiting for him. They had found their way home without his help!"
KET_16,"**ESTHER'S STORY**

When Esther finished school at sixteen, her aunt Flory gave her £500 for her birthday. Most of Esther's friends chose to go to college, but Esther decided to use her aunt's money to start her own business. She bought fruit, sugar, and glass jars to make jam. She sold the jam for £1 a jar to her friends and quickly made back her aunt's £500.

At first, Esther's parents did not want her to spend her time making jam. They thought she should study and hoped she would become a teacher or a doctor. However, Esther did not listen to them and continued making jam. After a few months, she began selling it at the local market. Then, she started making orange juice, which she sold to a school where one of her friends worked.

After two years, her business grew very large, and her parents were proud of her. She made many types of food and sold them to shops and supermarkets. She was so busy that she needed to hire some people to help her."

KET_46,"**Corryvale Farm**

Corryvale Farm is located in the west of England. Stephen and Jenny Blackler raise cows and chickens and sell milk and eggs. However, most of their income comes from Jenny's sheep. She has 50 sheep, and each sheep produces enough wool for six sweaters. Every six months, Stephen shears the wool from the sheep to keep them cool.

Five years ago, Jenny made some sweaters from the wool and tried to sell them at local markets. Unfortunately, it was summer, and the hot weather meant people were not interested in buying sweaters. Instead, she decided to make socks. Everyone loved the socks because they were affordable, durable, and easy to wash. This is how Jenny's business began.

At first, she made the socks at home, but soon she had thousands of customers. To keep up with the demand, she started sending the wool to a factory, where machines now make all the socks. There are six colors, five sizes for all ages, and different types of socks for walkers, athletes, and skiers. Jenny is especially busy during Christmas because Corryvale socks are a popular gift. In her office, she has many letters from happy customers around the world."

KET_10,"**Text: 'BURGLARS PREFER THE AFTERNOON'**

Most house burglaries happen between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m., according to the police. Inspector Ian Saunders told our newspaper that the number of burglaries has increased by more than 30% compared to last year. He also mentioned that 67% of burglaries occur when people leave their homes and forget to lock a door or a window. 

Inspector Saunders explained that burglaries at night are rare because families are usually at home during that time. However, winter afternoons are the best time for burglars because it gets dark, making it hard for them to be seen. Many houses are empty during this time because people are still at work.

Inspector Saunders suggested that it is a good idea to leave lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when you go on holiday. This can help keep burglars away. He also encouraged neighbors to watch over each other's houses when someone is not home and to call the police if they notice anything unusual. 

""We will also give you advice on how to make your house safe,"" Inspector Saunders said. ""This kind of help is free."""

KET_44,"**The History of Farming**

Before farming started, people searched in the forest for plants and fruits to eat. This meant they had to move around a lot to find food. However, about 12,000 years ago, in the Middle East, people began to grow their own food. These people were the first farmers. Farming allowed people to stay in one place, and over time, their villages grew larger. Some villagers could then do other jobs, like making clothes, because the farmers provided food for everyone. 

However, farming was hard, especially when the weather was bad, and some people did not have enough food. Today, farmers can produce more food, and it can travel thousands of kilometers from where it is grown to our homes."

My working hours are usually from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., but sometimes I work from 1 p.m. to 9 p.m. At work, the first thing I do is check flight times on my computer and then I talk with some of the flight attendants. Sometimes I go on long flights to see how the flight attendants are doing. That is my favorite part of the job, but I also enjoy office work. Traveling can be tiring.

Many years ago, farmers looked at the sky, animals, and flowers to understand the weather better. Now, there are many computer programs that help us learn about the weather, and people can even get weather updates on their mobile phones. Today, many people still believe in old ideas about the weather. For example, they say that if the sky is red in the evening, it will be sunny the next day.

Bollywood is the name of the film industry in Mumbai, India. It produces almost 1,000 films every year. Since its first film in 1913, Bollywood has created over 29,000 films, which is much more than the USA. This makes it the largest film industry in the world. 

Most Indians enjoy watching films more than any other leisure activity, and about ten million people go to the cinema every day. Bollywood films often tell romantic love stories, and singing and dancing are important parts of these films. Indian films are also popular outside of India. Last year, Bollywood earned over $500 million by selling its films to other countries.

Indian actors make more films each year than American actors in Hollywood, but they earn less money. This is why most Bollywood films cost around $2 million to make, while Hollywood films usually cost at least $5 million. Most Bollywood actors are young and work hard, but they often have short careers. Amitabh Bachchan, who many consider India's greatest actor, is an exception. He has starred in more than 140 films over a career that has lasted almost 40 years."

There are many types of parrots, but they all have strong beaks and feet that help them climb and hold food. Some of the largest parrots can live for up to 80 years. They are very loud, but they are also smart and can learn to talk easily. Some zoos have shows where you can watch parrots perform tricks they have learned."
KET_25,"Text: 'HOWARD BONNIER

Bray is a lovely village about fifty kilometers west of London. A young Englishman named Howard Bonnier opened a restaurant called The Palace there about three and a half months ago. Not many people in Britain know Mr. Bonnier yet, but he is already quite famous in France. This is because he has written for French magazines about many of the best restaurants in that country. He is only 29 years old.

When Howard was a teenager, he often went to restaurants with his parents. He enjoyed this so much that he decided not to spend a lot of money on clothes and CDs. Instead, he used his money to visit France and eat at good restaurants. He also bought many French and English cookbooks - he says he has more than two hundred and fifty!

So why did he decide to open a restaurant? Simply because he loves cooking. Has it been easy? He says it is expensive to start your own restaurant and it is much harder to cook for fifty people than to cook for your family, but he is sure he has made the right choice.'"
KET_34,"**Text: John Pickering**

In a small town in central England, John Pickering cuts the grass and waters the flowers in a park. Last week, he was in Tokyo, where millions of Japanese people watched him on television because he is currently the number one singer in Japan. A few months ago, John visited Japan to perform in dance clubs in Osaka and Nagoya. A disc jockey heard his songs and played them on his radio show. Many young people called the radio station to ask for his songs to be played again. 

John, who goes by the name Jon Otis when he sings in Japan, plans to continue working in the park in England. He is not sure how much money he will make from his music. ""I must keep my job in the park,"" he says. ""I still have to pay my bills!"" The other gardeners do not know that he is famous in Japan and have never heard him sing. John's wife, Denise, who works in a hospital, says, ""This will not change the way we live. I only know John Pickering, not Jon Otis!"""

KET_26,"**Text: Line Dancing**

Many people in Britain have started a new hobby called line dancing. In almost every town, you can find clubs and classes for this fun activity. 

""Line dancing is easy to learn. If you can walk, you can do it!"" says Fiona Lever, a teacher. ""You don’t need a partner because you dance in groups. It’s a great way to make new friends. In my classes, there are people of all ages. The boys enjoy it because they can make a lot of noise with their feet while dancing!""

When did line dancing start? Most people believe it began about fifteen years ago when American country music became popular in Britain."
KET_8,"**The Rhino**

There are five types of rhinos in the world today. The Black and White Rhinos live in the open fields of Africa, while the other types live in forests in Asia. All rhinos have large, heavy bodies. Their skin is very tough, and they have very little hair. A rhino stands on four short legs, and each foot has three toes. They usually walk slowly, but they can run at speeds of up to 50 kilometers per hour. Rhinos are generally quiet and calm animals, and they eat grass and other plants. A baby rhino weighs about 40 kilos when it is born and stays inside its mother for around fifteen months. An adult rhino can weigh over 200 kilos and may live for up to 50 years."
KET_4,"**THE HISTORY OF THE LONDON POLICE**

Today, there are police officers everywhere, but in 1700, London had no police at all. A few old men tried to protect the city streets at night, but they were not paid much. About 300 years ago, London was growing. The city was very dirty, and many people were poor. There were many thieves who stole money in the streets, so people stayed at home as much as they could.

In 1750, Henry Fielding began to pay a group of people to stop the thieves. They were like police officers and were called 'Bow Street Runners' because they worked near Bow Street. Fifty years later, there were 120 Bow Street Runners, but London had grown very large and needed more police. So, in 1829, the first Metropolitan (or London) Police Force was created with 3,000 officers. Most of the men worked on foot, but some rode horses. Until 1920, all the police in London were men. Today, London police officers are paid well, and those who still ride horses earn even more than the others."

KET_7,"Text: 'Visit the Edinburgh Festival! Every year, many people travel to Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland, to enjoy the Edinburgh Festival. For three weeks in August and September, the city is full of actors and artists from around the world. They come to Edinburgh for the largest arts festival in Britain. During this time, the streets are filled with music and dance from morning until night. You can even see artists painting in the streets. One of the highlights of the Festival is the 'Fringe', where students perform comedy shows in small venues and cafes. Many tourists visit the Festival to watch new films, plays, and listen to music from famous musicians. This year, there are over five hundred performances with actors from more than forty countries. Tickets for these shows are quite affordable, and it is often easier to see your favorite star in Edinburgh than in London. So, plan to visit Edinburgh next summer, but remember that finding a room can be hard, so it’s a good idea to book your hotel now!'"
KET_43,"**ICE FISHING**

If you drive north from Toronto for three hours, you will reach Lake Nipissing. In winter, the lake freezes, and many Canadian fishermen go there every weekend. They build small wooden houses on the ice and paint them in bright colors. Inside these houses, they try to catch fish that swim under the ice. 

Bob Marvisch has been coming here for twenty-five years. He says, ""You need clothes that are light but warm: two pairs of socks, gloves, several thin sweaters, and a snow suit on top. Catching fish is easy."" 

First, you break the ice and make a small round hole in it. Then, you take a fishing line and put some bread on it. You put the line through the hole and into the water. When the fish eat the bread, you pull the line up. The fish are usually between ten and twenty centimeters long. Some people like to eat them, but when I catch three or four fish, I prefer to have some chocolate or another snack! Today, I have caught twenty-five! It's a great sport, and you can meet nice people here!"

KET_11,"**Text: Madame Tussaud's Museum**

One very famous place for tourists in London is Madame Tussaud's museum. In this museum, people can see wax figures of famous individuals. Madame Tussaud was born in France in 1761. Her uncle, who was a doctor, created wax figures of people and opened a museum in Paris. Marie helped him with this work.

In 1789, during the French Revolution, Marie was sent to prison. While in prison, she had to make wax copies of the heads of famous people who had died, including Queen Marie Antoinette. In 1795, Marie married Francois Tussaud, and in 1802, she moved to London with her wax figures. She opened a museum there, and her figures can still be seen today."
KET_14,"**BICYCLES**

Bicycles are an affordable and environmentally friendly way to travel. The first bicycle was created about 150 years ago. Initially, bicycles were quite expensive, so only wealthy people could afford them. These early bicycles looked very different from the ones we see today. Over time, as bicycles became cheaper, more people started to buy them. Many began to ride bicycles to work and for leisure.

Today, cars are used more than bicycles because they are faster and keep you dry in the rain. However, some people still choose to cycle to work. They believe there are too many cars in city centers, making it hard to find parking."
KET_63,"**The Elephant Show by Daniel Allsop, age 14**

Last summer, I went to Thailand for a beach holiday with my family. One day, we visited a park near our hotel. The park had beautiful flower gardens, but we were excited to see the elephant show. 

We went to a large area with seats on three sides. Three elephants came in with their trainers and stood in front of a big piece of white card. Each elephant was given a paintbrush and started to paint on its own card. The trainers sometimes gave the elephants a new brush with paint and took the old one away. Slowly, following their trainers' instructions, the elephants created pictures on the cards. I couldn't believe my eyes! One picture showed a river, another showed a tree, and the third showed a bunch of flowers. When the trainers held up the paintings, everyone wanted to buy one. 

We also gave the elephants the bananas we had brought for our lunch. Twenty years ago, elephants worked in the forest. Now, they do not work there anymore, but the smartest elephants live in special places where visitors can watch them."
KET_56,"**Text: Big Cats**

There are many types of cats, and they vary in size, appearance, and behavior. Tigers are the largest cats, measuring up to 3.7 meters from head to tail. While most cats dislike water, tigers often enjoy lying in water when it is hot. 

Lions are unique because they live in large family groups. These groups work together to hunt for food. Lions usually inhabit flat, open areas where they can see far and easily track other animals. 

All cats have good eyesight, which helps them catch smaller animals for food. They also need to be fast and strong."

The ostrich is the largest bird in the world, and an adult can weigh more than 90 kilos. Most wild ostriches live in southern Africa, but there are only a few left in the wild. Like all birds, ostriches have wings, but they cannot fly. They use their wings to help them turn while running. Ostriches can run very fast, at speeds of 65 to 90 kilometers per hour, making it hard for other animals to catch them. Baby ostriches are about the same size as chickens and take around 3 years to grow into adults. Ostriches eat plants and can survive for many days without water."

I enjoy the competitions and being in the mountains because it is so beautiful. But free-riding, which is when you do what you want outside of competitions, is the best for me.""

Mount Kilimanjaro is the tallest mountain in Africa. Many people have climbed it, including a seven-year-old boy and an 87-year-old man. There are different paths to reach the top. The Marangu path, which is five kilometers long, is considered the easiest. It usually takes about five days to climb and is very popular with tourists. However, only half of the climbers who attempt to reach the top succeed. This is often due to sudden changes in the weather. At the start of the climb, it can be hot and rainy, but at the top, climbers find ice and snow, and the temperature can drop below 20 degrees Celsius. Climbers should bring both sunglasses and warm clothing!"
KET_29,"**Text: Otters**

Not many people have seen an otter. These animals live near rivers and build their homes from small pieces of wood. They usually come out at night. Otters are very good swimmers and can swim faster than 10 kilometers per hour. They have thick brown fur that keeps them warm in the water. An otter can close its ears and nose, which allows it to stay underwater for several minutes. 

Twenty years ago, there were very few otters in Great Britain. The rivers were very dirty, which caused many fish and insects to die, so otters could not find enough food. But today, there is plenty of food for them because the rivers are clean again."

KET_59,"**Text: Buildings**

People have always built buildings. We need houses to keep us warm and dry, and we build stadiums to watch football matches and concerts. We also have buildings like museums to display beautiful things. 

Many people work together to create a building. The architect decides how the building will look and draws plans to show their ideas. Engineers ensure that the building is strong and safe. Then, workers carefully construct it.

The Sydney Opera House is a famous modern building with a beautiful roof. However, the building is attractive from all sides, not just the top. Another well-known building is the Olympic Stadium in Munich. This interesting structure looks like a tent made of glass."

In the past, Gail was known for finishing second in big competitions. She always smiled and laughed, and people in her city love her for this. 

Everything changed in 2004 when she ran her first half-marathon, which is a long road race. She won with a very good time, the fastest of any British woman that year. Gail's manager and husband, Mike Rollins, used to race when he was younger, but he had to stop because he hurt his right leg. He can still run a little and sometimes trains with Gail. However, it is not fun for Mike when Gail runs faster than him and he cannot keep up.

Gail trains hard. She does a long run in the morning and fast runs in the afternoon. She always takes a break from running on Sundays. Mike says, ""I am with her all the time. Sometimes I ask, 'Are you sure you should be eating that?' It's usually cakes, but she can eat almost anything."""
KET_52,"**Text: Piano Players - Their Early Years**

**Ivan Petrov**  
Ivan was born on a farm in Russia. From the age of twelve to eighteen, he studied in Poland. His first music teacher could not play the piano but taught him and his sister songs from operas. His mother started teaching him the piano when he was six years old. At the age of ten, he decided he wanted to write music and soon began working on his first song.

**Oleg Gagarin**  
Oleg was the youngest of five children. When he was four, his father, who enjoyed playing the piano, taught him some traditional Russian music. At six, he began taking lessons from a piano teacher in his city. Oleg quickly started winning prizes for his piano playing. When he was fourteen, he attended a music college in Austria for two years. After that, he returned to Russia.

**Josef Heptmann**  
Josef's father was German and taught music in Poland, where Josef was born. The family moved to Germany when Josef was two years old, and a year later, he began playing the piano. He gave his first concert when he was six. At ten, he performed fifty-two concerts in two months during a trip to England! Josef loved music, but he was also interested in physics and languages. He is very busy now, but one day he hopes to write his own music."

Bill Prince-Smith was a farmer, a teacher, and a dentist before he became a writer of children's books at the age of 60. Now, thirteen years later, he has written more than 80 books. Every day, he goes to his office to write. In the evening, he gives his work to his wife to read. ""She tells me when she doesn't like something,"" says Bill. ""My ten grandchildren don’t live nearby, but they also read my stories and tell me if they are good or bad."" This way, Bill has learned what young children like to read.

Bill writes about life in his village and the farms around it. His fifth book is his favorite: *The Sheepdog*, which is about a farmer and the dog that helps him. ""I have always liked animals,"" says Bill, ""and dogs are very clever; they learn quickly."" Last year, the book was made into a film with real animals and actors. The film-makers used the latest computer technology to make it look like the animals are speaking. Bill was very happy with the film. ""Sometimes film-makers change books, but they didn’t change mine, and I love the film."""
KET_35,"**POSTCARDS**

Today, many people enjoy sending postcards to their friends and family. These postcards usually have pictures of places like beaches, mountains, or castles, and you can write a message on the back. Many people send postcards when they are on holiday because they are inexpensive, and the pictures are often nicer than the photos people take themselves. 

The first postcard was sent at the end of the 1800s. It had a picture of a seaside town. Later, postcards included images related to current events, like accidents or visits from important people. People liked these postcards because newspapers at that time did not have pictures."
KET_5,"**Dinosaurs**

No one has ever seen a dinosaur because the last one died about 60 million years ago, long before people existed on Earth. We do not know exactly why they all disappeared. The closest living relatives of dinosaurs are birds. Dinosaurs were not all the same; there were more than 5,000 different kinds. Some were very small, while others were huge. The largest dinosaurs were bigger than any other land animals that have ever lived. For example, the Brontosaurus was twenty meters long and ate plants. The Tyrannosaurus Rex was not as long, but it was very strong. It had sharp teeth for eating meat and could run fast because it had long back legs."
KET_41,"**BEARS**

Bears can be dangerous animals. An adult bear is very strong and can harm a person. They are good at climbing trees and can run very fast. However, they do not see well and, like most animals, they find food using their sense of smell. 

There are seven types of bears. The largest is the white polar bear, which can be almost three meters tall. There are two types of black bears: one lives in the forests of North America, and the other lives in Southeast Asia. Not all black bears are actually black; they can be dark brown or reddish-brown. 

Many people love the black and white panda bear, which comes from China. Unfortunately, not many pandas live in the wild today because it is hard for them to find food."

Crocodiles live in warm areas of the world, such as Africa, South America, and Northern Australia. They usually stay in slow-moving water, but they can swim quickly and move fast on land. You often see crocodiles in large groups. They eat many things, including fish, birds, and small animals. Sometimes, they can also eat larger animals or even people. There are more than ten different types of crocodiles, and they all have very sharp teeth. Although they lose teeth often, they grow new ones quickly. Most crocodiles are about 3.5 meters long, but some can be much larger. Crocodiles can live a long time; the oldest one in a zoo lived to be 66 years old."

In 1783, two French brothers created the first balloon that could carry people into the sky. One hundred and twenty years later, in 1903, the Wright brothers built the first powered airplane and flew it in the United States. In 1918, the US Post Office started the first airmail service. 

Over the next thirty years, airplanes changed a lot. In the 1950s, airplanes became much faster because they were equipped with jet engines. In 1976, Concorde was built in the UK and France. It is the fastest passenger airplane in the world, flying at 2,500 kilometers per hour, which means the trip from London to New York takes only four hours. 

Today, millions of people travel by airplane, and it is hard to imagine a world without them."
KET_47,"**The Globe Theatre**

Visiting the theatre in London 400 years ago was very different from visiting a modern theatre. The building was round and had no roof, so people could get cold and wet if the weather was bad. The queen enjoyed going to the Globe Theatre, which was by the River Thames, to watch the plays of William Shakespeare. At that time, all the actors were men. The audience ate, talked to their friends, walked around during the show, and some even threw things at the actors! 

Today, you can still visit the Globe Theatre. A new theatre has been built in the same place near the river. You can enjoy a Shakespeare play there or learn about life in the seventeenth century."
