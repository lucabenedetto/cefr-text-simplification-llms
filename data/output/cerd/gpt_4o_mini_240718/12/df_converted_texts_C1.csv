**Garbage in, garbage out**

Charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems like a good idea for the environment and the economy. However, it may not be as effective as it seems. In many developed countries, the way we collect rubbish is similar: at regular times, garbage bags or bins are taken away by a special truck to a landfill. Economists find this strange because, in most places, this service is free. Households pay for it through local taxes, but a family that produces a lot of rubbish pays the same as an elderly couple who produces very little. However, the cost of rubbish disposal is not zero. The more rubbish people throw away, the more collectors and trucks are needed, and the more local authorities have to pay for landfills.

This creates a basic economic problem: if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. A common solution is to make households pay for the disposal of their waste. This would encourage them to throw away less and recycle more, assuming local governments provide places to collect recyclable materials.

However, economists Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman found that what seems like a logical solution can lead to complicated and sometimes disappointing results. They studied several American towns that started charging households for rubbish. The most common method was to sell stickers or tags that residents had to attach to their rubbish bags. Only bags with these tags would be collected each week.

In a study published last year, Fullerton and Kinnaman looked at a scheme introduced in July 1992 in Charlottesville, Virginia, a town with about 40,000 people. Residents were charged 80 cents for each tagged bag of rubbish. While this seems like a good use of market forces, the authors concluded that the benefits of the scheme did not cover the costs of printing materials, paying sellers, and the wages of those running the program. 

Although the number of bags collected fell sharply by 37%, this was mainly due to a behavior called the ""Seattle stomp,"" where people crammed more rubbish into each container instead of buying more tags. This method of compacting rubbish is less efficient than using machines at landfills. The weight of rubbish collected in Charlottesville fell by only 14%, which is a better measure of disposal costs than volume. In 25 other Virginian cities without a pricing scheme, the weight of rubbish also fell by 3.5%.

Worse still, some people chose to dump their rubbish illegally instead of paying for collection. Although it is hard to measure, the authors estimate that illegal dumping may account for 30-40% of the reduction in collected rubbish. 

On a positive note, there was a 15% increase in the weight of materials recycled, suggesting that people preferred to recycle (which is free) rather than pay for rubbish removal. However, this increase may not be directly related to the fee, as many residents were already part of Charlottesville's voluntary recycling program.

In a more recent study, Fullerton and Kinnaman looked deeper into the economics of rubbish. They found that while pricing does reduce the amount of rubbish, the effect is small. On average, a 10% increase in sticker prices only reduces rubbish by 0.3%. This is less than in other studies, but it makes sense. To significantly reduce rubbish, people would need to buy less of almost everything. A small tax on garbage is unlikely to make a big difference.

If this is true, we should consider whether other factors, like income and education, are just as important as price. For example, in wealthier towns, people tend to throw away more rubbish and have less time to recycle.

Should we conclude that charging households for rubbish is a bad idea? Not necessarily; free disposal is likely too cheap. However, the effects of seemingly simple policies can be complex. Detailed economic models are often needed to understand them, and sometimes the results are not pleasant."

Theodore Zeldin explores how our work life might change. Do you feel respected and valued in your job? Success in a career is no longer enough. Many professions feel they are not appreciated or understood, and even famous individuals often feel bitterness despite their success. Loving your work used to be enough to be part of a respected group, but now you must consider how your job affects you as a person, your mind, character, and relationships. This question is very important. No matter how skilled you are, if your work makes you boring or unable to connect with others outside your field, then no amount of status or money can make up for your lack of personal fulfillment.

I am trying to find ways for work to focus on personal fulfillment instead of just serving industrial needs. Work should not only create wealth but also provide a meaningful lifestyle, help us discover hidden talents, and allow for diverse human connections. However, this change will not eliminate unemployment. As more people get educated, they seek jobs that are interesting and enriching.

A lifetime of work should be seen as a work of art, with the fulfilled individual at its center. Even middle-class jobs, like those of doctors, accountants, and architects, no longer have the appeal they once did. Doctors often feel more stressed than their patients, accountants worry about ethics, and architects rarely get to use their creativity. Middle managers, who once felt proud of their status, are losing their confidence. Meanwhile, the companies and institutions they work for are shrinking. Efforts to decentralize decision-making and improve skills have not succeeded in gaining employee commitment. In Britain, only 8% of employees feel their values match those of their organizations.

I have started to investigate various occupations to see how they shape or harm individuals. I have looked at how different cultures have expanded the idea of human potential and how courage can be developed. I have focused on important issues like happiness, love, friendship, and respect. Now, I am concentrating on finding more satisfying ways to earn a living. Many experts focus on increasing the profits of companies, but we also need to examine ourselves as human beings and consider what kind of people we want to work with.

How many of us feel truly alive at work? How many are like part-time slaves, feeling trapped by our qualifications and careers, working not to improve ourselves but because we see no other choice? For example, 10% of the workforce is in the hospitality industry. Many intelligent and lively people endure low pay and long hours because the concept of a hotel has not changed much since the days of the Ritz. A hotel is not just a place for travelers to sleep; it is a small version of the United Nations. People from around the world meet in hotels, but they often do not interact.

Many hotel staff are foreigners eager to learn new languages and cultures, yet they have only superficial interactions with guests. Hotels could become cultural centers, connecting guests with the city and each other. Hotel managers could utilize the knowledge of their student employees instead of assigning them only basic tasks. If they paid attention to their staff's true ambitions, they would see many other services hotels could offer. However, they are often limited by accountants who advise focusing on one main activity to maximize profits. 

It is time to rethink what this means from a human perspective, not just a financial one. For me, work is about relationships. Many people now want work that allows for independence and personal expression. They should have the opportunity to design their own jobs and choose their colleagues and customers, within practical limits. This requires the ability to communicate across different professional languages and connect with people who may seem very different at first.

Everyone understands the importance of communication, but true conversation is different. Traditional conversation is not the same as the new kind of conversation that people feel is missing today. This new conversation is more personal and creates a bond of respect between participants. It allows for a deeper understanding of one another and can change both people involved. It is more than just relaxation; it is a powerful way to establish equality. Every meaningful conversation we have can change the world, even if just a little."
CPE_24,"**Text: Broadcasting: The Social Shaping of a Technology**

The term 'broadcasting' originally referred to the act of spreading seeds widely by hand. This idea is not just about farming; it also represents a hopeful view of modern progress. It suggests planned growth that can lead to a fruitful outcome if conditions are favorable. The metaphor implies that there are central resources available for spreading and reproducing this growth.

We need to explore why a new technology that sends words and images electronically was organized in a way that fits this agricultural metaphor. Although television is linked to two-way communication methods like the telegraph and telephone, it was designed from the beginning as a centralized 'mass' medium. This means that it was set up to send signals from a central source to private homes, which matched the social and economic structures of modern societies.

There were attempts to create different forms of television, but these remained just experiments. Two lesser-known alternatives are worth mentioning because they show what television could have been in a different social setting. In the early 1930s, radio enthusiasts in Britain experimented with two-way television as a possible substitute for regular telephones. Popular science magazines like Radio News published articles on how to build television transmitters and receivers, and many amateur experimenters were active across the country. However, in 1938, the British Radio Manufacturers Association established standards for television equipment and channel regulations that pushed these grassroots innovators out of the picture. This marked the end of a potential counter-cultural development of television as a widely accessible and egalitarian form of communication.

Broadcasting was not only influenced by strong economic interests but also by the fundamental structures of modern societies. Despite the efforts of TV amateurs, television in the early 1930s was mainly a medium for public entertainment in the USA and was often seen as a competitor to the film industry. In fact, during the 1930s, most people experienced television in public spaces, especially in Britain and Germany.

While the idea of amateur, two-way television was unlikely to succeed, systems based on collective public viewing were operating in several countries during the 1930s. These systems could have posed a greater challenge to the domestic use of television, but this threat did not materialize. Manufacturers recognized the potential for mass sales of home television sets once prices dropped. Given the separation between public and private life that is characteristic of modernity, centralized broadcasting to a wide domestic audience was the most suitable way to organize the medium.

As working-class people improved their living standards and joined consumer society from the 1920s onward, the dream of the home as a center for entertainment and cultural experiences became a reality for many in Western countries. This trend is now occurring on a global scale. There is a clear link between social modernization and the dominant structures of broadcasting. While social and economic changes led to greater centralization of power and capital, the breakdown of traditional communities created new lifestyles. People became more mobile, both socially and geographically, which often left them feeling isolated compared to those in more stable early communities.

Centralized broadcasting addressed the need for governments to efficiently inform all citizens and helped create a unifying 'imagined community' within the nation-state. The widespread nature of these processes made broadcasting the dominant form for both radio and television. However, it is important to also consider the positive view of broadcasting as a tool for democracy. During the period between the World Wars, many countries recognized broadcasting as a way to ensure equal access to the resources needed for informed participation in political, social, and cultural life.

Television is evolving, and there is a possibility that the term broadcasting may become outdated or insufficient. If this happens, the metaphor will only refer to a specific organization of audio-visual technology during a certain centralized phase of social modernization."

Sometimes, it feels like no matter how many things you own, you never feel secure. While it is natural to want a home that meets your needs, there comes a point when the desire to acquire more possessions becomes excessive. Modern advertising is designed to exploit our insecurities. A common message we receive is that if you don’t have certain items, you are somehow less valuable. To see how much advertising influences you, try not to read any billboards the next time you walk down the street. These expensive messages constantly shape our thoughts in persuasive ways, often without us realizing it. We are surrounded by them—on television, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, t-shirts, and the internet—all urging us to buy more.

**Caves**

Research institutions and universities worldwide have spent years studying caves, focusing mainly on their origins, water systems, and biology. Caves are a small but intriguing part of the natural world, sparking our curiosity and desire for knowledge. Because they are natural features, they have been studied for a long time, especially in areas where caves impact our lives. However, exploring caves requires physical skill, which means that cave research often involves both professional scientists and amateur enthusiasts who visit caves for recreation.

**Weather Watch**

Many observant people, using only their senses, laid the groundwork for meteorology, which has evolved since the 17th century into a complex science. Today, satellites and electronic devices provide us with quick weather information, and computers can solve complicated calculations much faster than humans. Meteorological terms can be difficult for non-professionals to understand, and it may seem like there is no place for simple weather knowledge. However, human experience remains essential in turning data into weather forecasts. Personal observations can still offer valuable insights that help professionals understand the complexities of the atmosphere."
CPE_16,"**MUSIC AND THEATRE**

Until recently, I believed that opera was primarily theatre. However, after working at a national opera house, I realized that music is actually the main focus, with theatre being secondary. This makes sense, but I come from a theatrical background where the spoken word and the actor are most important. In theatre, once the performance starts, there is no one directing the action, and the performers and audience usually share a common language.

At musical performances, whether in a concert hall or an opera house, many audience members, like me, may not have a deep understanding of music. Some might feel embarrassed about their lack of knowledge, while most are simply amazed by the performers' skills. A talented singer or a skilled string section is easy to admire. Even a decent musician demonstrates years of hard work. Watching top-class music is similar to watching an athletics event; we know athletes are doing something we can relate to, but we also see how much better they are than us.

In contrast, theatre audiences have different expectations. They often do not fully appreciate an actor's skill and may not be particularly impressed by performances that seem similar to what they could do. They frequently ask actors how they memorize their lines, but this does not mean they are less demanding than concert audiences. In fact, many theatre-goers are also concert-goers. This suggests that audiences and performers interact on more equal terms in theatre, regardless of how challenging the material is.

The question arises: does music need to learn from theatre about this relationship? I believe it does. I have seen how a different approach can enhance the experience for concert-goers. Live music is inherently theatrical, filled with emotion, humor, and intimacy. It can be unpredictable and connects with the audience both individually and collectively. However, traditional music presentations often emphasize a hierarchy between performers and listeners, with strict dress codes and excessive respect for conductors and soloists.

On the other hand, contemporary music audiences sometimes disrupt performances by applauding between movements or after impressive pieces. While this is often a genuine expression of appreciation, it can also interrupt the flow of the performance. 

Is there a solution? Yes, many initiatives are underway to attract new audiences to concert halls and opera houses and to break down the barriers that make people feel that ""serious"" music is not for them. I recall a remarkable event, the community opera ""In Search of Angels,"" which took place in various locations within a cathedral and the surrounding town. This experience was not only musical but also transformative for many audience members, who were actively involved.

What I desire in music is more of the risk and creativity that the best theatre can offer. This can come from using unusual or challenging locations that disrupt normal expectations, creating surprising effects for both performers and audiences. While some plays are presented in conventional ways, I believe there is potential for change in how music is experienced.

As an enthusiast of both theatre and music, I want both art forms to flourish and for more people to enjoy the pleasure I find in being part of the audience."

**Sand**  
While I appreciate sand's amazing ability to be turned into useful items like glass and concrete, I am not a big fan of it in its natural form. To me, it mainly acts as a barrier between a seaside parking lot and the ocean. It blows into your face, gets into your food, and can swallow important items like car keys and coins. When you are wet, it sticks to you like glue and is hard to remove, even with a strong hose. However, the strange thing is that as soon as you step onto a beach towel, get into a car, or walk on a recently cleaned carpet, it falls off you easily. For days after, you find small amounts of it on the floor every time you take off your shoes, and you spread even more when you take off your socks. Sand seems to stay with you longer than many illnesses. So, as far as I’m concerned, you can keep the sand.

**Lock and Key**  
The search for a safe home, privacy, and security has existed since humans first built permanent homes. The simple wooden beam behind the door has changed to electronic locks activated by plastic cards with countless combinations. However, the desire to keep out intruders remains. The appeal of a lock and key is partly psychological. Recently, some companies have tried computerized locking systems, where smart cards control electronic locks through a digital command. But people do not prefer them. You might accept them at work, but at home, everyone wants the comfort of using a physical key. Therefore, when one locksmith company created a new electronic system, they made sure to include a real metal key in the device.

**Modern Art**  
I felt nervous about visiting the new Tate Modern gallery because, like many people, I find modern art confusing. I know I like some of it, especially furry items, neon light sculptures, and large photographs. Maybe if I knew more about it, I would have stronger opinions. However, art is not meant to be understood in a strict way. The goal is not to fully grasp it, but to let it speak to you. This is a great idea, but it has not worked for me in the past. This new gallery has tried to give visitors real insight into the reasons behind the artworks. The first thing I noticed was the labels, which provided context and explained what the art was trying to convey. Instead of staring blankly at the pieces as I used to, these helpful bits of information allowed me to understand better."
CPE_46,"**Every Picture Tells a Story**

**Adapting Novels for Film**

Turning novels into films often means reducing and simplifying the original story. This can be frustrating for writers, but it can also be enlightening. While working on a script, I realized that I could remove much of the dialogue and description from a scene in the novel and still convey the same message. This does not mean that the original dialogue and descriptions were unnecessary. It relates to how each medium engages the audience and the type of repetition it uses. 

In this context, ""redundancy"" refers to the repeated mentions of character traits and speech tags like ""he said."" A character's trait only needs to be described once, but reminders help the audience understand better. In dialogue, we can often guess who is speaking from the context, but speech tags make it easier to read. 

Stage plays, which mainly consist of dialogue, mimic real speech's redundancy to varying degrees. In some modern plays, this can be excessive, making the dialogue seem almost entirely repetitive, which can confuse the audience about the actual message.

**Watching Movies**

When watching movies, viewers can feel completely immersed in the film's world. This experience allows them to escape from reality, at least for the duration of the film. However, once the lights come on, this illusion is shattered, and they return to the real world. People often do not feel accountable for the time spent watching a film, and this sense of unreality can lead to a lack of serious consideration of movies as an art form. Many from previous generations, including our parents and teachers, viewed films as mere entertainment rather than art. While they enjoyed being entertained, they did not appreciate the artistic value of movies.

**The Film Studios**

The Leiper Film Company studios consisted of many different buildings. The layout was confusing, with only a few recognizable landmarks like the Script Department. Most of the space was filled with small, similarly furnished rooms used for meetings, which were hard to identify without a complicated system of letters and numbers. Finding a specific room was a challenge. 

The studio lacked a clear main entrance, having three equal entrances that offered no guidance. This made it difficult for newcomers to navigate. However, there were not many outsiders, as the organization preferred to keep them away. It was assumed that employees could find their way around. Through their teamwork, they created films that allowed viewers to escape from everyday life, even if just for a few hours.

**Film-Makers**

It seems that many people want to make movies. Bookstores are filled with guides on scriptwriting and film production, and universities offer related courses. There are competitions that reward aspiring filmmakers with equipment, like the camera used by Robert Rodriguez to create his film *El Mariachi*, which cost $7,000 and launched his career as an independent director. Rodriguez reflects on his early success, noting that he felt pressure to achieve his breakthrough film before turning 26, just like famous directors Orson Welles and Steven Spielberg did.

In the past, filmmakers were expected to take their time to develop their skills. They often worked behind the scenes as editors, writers, or cinematographers, learning the craft by directing low-budget films. For example, John Huston was 35 when he made his first film, *The Maltese Falcon*, and Fred Zinnemann, who directed *High Noon*, found his stride in his forties. Today, without the support of studios or television, aspiring filmmakers often have to forge their own paths."
CPE_3,"In the past, the council houses spread across the western part of the city, with many rows of small, shabby homes made of orange brick or pale white stucco. In the summer, the chemicals from the May and Baker factory, located two miles away, created a strong smell of sulphur that lingered around the doors and gardens. A common sight in that area of Norwich in the early morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he walked along someone’s front path. I have forgotten much of my early life, but I remember sitting near an upstairs window, looking at the houses as they disappeared into the distance. 

Later, I have memories of faces I cannot name, my mother ironing towels in a house that I don’t think was ours, and snow falling on the turrets of a large mansion at Earlham. It is not surprising that my mother appears in these early memories. I remember her as a small, precise, and often angry woman, and I never fully understood the reason for her anger, so I could not do anything to make it better. Even as a child, when I went with her to the small shops in Bunnett Square or on longer trips into the city, I sensed something unusual about her personality. She was the most solitary person I have ever known, feeling alone even in a crowded room. 

Her solitude was combined with a strict sense of propriety that was unusual for the West Earlham estate. This sometimes resulted in intense spring-cleaning sessions or strict instructions to ""behave properly."" I found this moral code hard to understand, and even now, I am not sure I fully grasp it. It meant not wandering into neighbors' gardens or damaging their rose bushes while walking down the street; it meant sitting quietly for long periods in a silent dining room, hands folded across my chest, listening to radio programs my mother enjoyed; it meant countless rules and restrictions. 

Over time, other figures appeared in these strict early memories. Despite her solitude, my mother had a few friends. There was Mrs. Buddery, who was obsessed with the Royal Family; Mrs. Winall, who rarely spoke except to agree with others; and Mrs. Laband, who was more lively and somewhat disapproved of by the others. Looking back, I realize that this trio was not good company; they often talked about their bad legs, the cold weather, and ungrateful children, a category in which I often felt included. 

Reflecting on this, it felt like a heavy weight made up of the West Earlham houses, my mother, her friends, and the pressure to ""behave properly"" rested on my shoulders, and I felt it was my responsibility to break free from it. However, this was not easy. Growing up in West Earlham followed a predictable pattern. Until you turned five, you stayed at home and got in your parents' way (I remember long, aimless days playing on a rug while my mother sat coldly in an armchair). Then, in September after your fifth birthday, you were sent to Avenue Road infants school, half a mile away. The lucky few had mothers with old bikes and child seats, which were unusual contraptions with makeshift safety straps. I remember my mother letting me walk with other children in the street for this journey. 

If I recall anything from those early years, it is the summer holidays, when I caught glimpses of the world beyond West Earlham: a vague old man next door to Mrs. Buddery who told stories about his time in the Merchant Navy; a charity fair held at a house far away where a kind woman offered lemonade and tried to interest me in something called the League of Pity, a kind of junior charity. However, my mother dismissed it, saying the organizers were ""only after your money."" My mother often spoke about mercenary motives, and she held politicians in deep contempt. If she thought of the House of Commons, it was as a place where wealthy people opened letters filled with money sent by a gullible public. 

I may exaggerate and overlook her good qualities while focusing on her flaws. However, there was little kindness in my mother; it seemed to have been drained from her. To be fair, she was aware of her role in my education. Occasionally on Sundays, she would take me, dressed in my ""good clothes,"" on the 85 bus to the Norwich Castle Museum. Hand in hand, we would walk through rooms filled with paintings by the Norwich School of Artists. My mother was not completely against this activity and eventually developed some opinions about the art. I remember her stopping in front of a painting of a Roman soldier in full armor and saying, ""Well, I wouldn't want to meet him on a dark night!"" This was one of the few times I remember my mother trying to make a joke."
CPE_10,"**Text: Philadelphia Avenue**

I walked down the odd-numbered side of Philadelphia Avenue. The evening was getting darker, and the air was humid with a light drizzle that made my walk feel secretive. I knew this side of the street well; I remembered our neighbors, the Matzes and the Pritchards, Han Kieffer's grocery store, and the houses of my first playmates, all girls. Although I didn’t know everyone by name, each house was clear in my memory, just like the small troughs in the sidewalk that carried rainwater from the roofs to the street, which I would skate or scoot over.

As the street sloped down, I noticed a slight decline in the social status of the houses: the porches were lower, and the front yards were smaller. Over the years, things changed: wooden porch railings were replaced with wrought iron in a style that reminded me of the South or Spain. In Shillington, houses I remembered as homes had turned into stores, and strangely, some stores, like Pep Conrad's and Han Kieffer's, had become homes again. I wondered how the residents used those open spaces and how they lived with the lingering smells of the goods that used to be sold there.

**Bachelor Fads Furniture Designer Rick Gilbert**

Rick Gilbert lives in a flat that used to be a curtain warehouse. It has the typical features of a loft, like exposed brick and large doors that once allowed curtains to be moved from trains nearby. However, Gilbert did not want a completely open space for practical and aesthetic reasons. He explained, ""In my last place, my living and working areas were mixed. It was hard to relax or start working when everything was in view.""

To create a more defined space, he used a large piece of corrugated plastic near the entrance. This screen hides the office, creates a hallway, and leads to the kitchen in the middle of the flat. He wanted the kitchen to be a neutral area where he could cook for friends or make coffee for clients. To balance the modern look of the plastic and stainless steel kitchen, he chose light wood for the floors. His flat is filled with modern furniture, but it also has sentimental pieces from his parents or items he found at markets.

**Bruce Chatwin**

Bruce Chatwin's life and writing are filled with secrets and lies, yet he was a brilliant and unique author. His first book, *In Patagonia*, published in 1977, is a remarkable work of imagination. It reinvented travel writing, combining the excitement of a thriller, the charm of romantic fiction, and the deep insight of great literature. Even in this book, Chatwin mixed fact with fiction; he often changed details to create a more engaging story or to highlight the essence of what he wanted to convey. He suggested that through travel, one could uncover rich histories that seemed to exist just to inspire future explorers.

**Swimming**

During a warm summer rain, I rushed across my lawn and jumped into the pool. As I swam, I kept my eyes just above the water. Each raindrop created a small splash that turned into a bubble and burst. The best moments were when the rain became heavier, drowning out the sound of birds and creating a mist over the water, as if the pool was rising to meet the sky. It was during this summer in 1996 that I began to think about a long swim across Britain. I wanted to follow the rain as it traveled across the land to the sea, escaping the frustration of swimming laps and feeling trapped like a tiger in a cage.

Many of us live in a world where everything is labeled and explained. This trend makes our reality feel more like a visual experience. That’s why activities like walking, cycling, and swimming are so important; they allow us to reconnect with the wild and ancient parts of our world by stepping off the beaten path and breaking free from the official narratives. A swimming journey would let me explore the parts of our world that still hold mystery, like darkness, misty forests, or high mountains."
CPE_67,"**Crying**

Charles Darwin believed that crying did not have a clear purpose in human evolution. However, recent research suggests he was likely mistaken. Scientists now emphasize the social importance of crying, with psychiatrist John Bowlby noting its role in forming the bond between a mother and her child. Many people think that tears, especially in children, mainly show feelings of helplessness. 

Understanding why adults cry is more complicated. It appears that the sound of crying is less important than the visual message it sends. Crying may have been beneficial for early human groups by helping to build trust and social connections. 

There are also other reasons for crying. We might cry to show sympathy for those facing great injustice. Additionally, tears can come unexpectedly, often causing embarrassment, when we hear touching music or powerful speeches. We may also cry while watching emotional movies, and interestingly, this happens more often when we are with others than when we are alone. The social role of crying seems clear, but research on this topic is ongoing."
CPE_27,"**Text: The Heat is On**

We have all heard about global warming, but how much warmer will the Earth become, and how will it affect our lives? Most people have some understanding of global warming, but few know its consequences. A warmer climate is likely to change the weather in all parts of the world. Since the atmosphere is closely connected to every aspect of our planet, any climate changes will significantly impact plants, animals, water, and soil. Humans have learned to use these natural resources to our advantage, allowing us to produce food, build cities, and support billions of people. Therefore, any changes to these resources must be taken seriously.

The challenge we face is understanding how the world will change and what is causing these changes. Over the last century, human actions have significantly increased the levels of certain gases in the atmosphere, which are closely linked to global temperatures. These increased levels are likely already affecting the global climate, but our limited knowledge of the global heat balance makes the current and future situations uncertain. 

We know that greenhouse gas levels have fluctuated in line with global temperatures over the past 40,000 years, suggesting a strong connection between the two. Evidence indicates that the Earth's surface has warmed by about 6°C over the last century. Most scientists believe this warming is not entirely natural and is partly due to human pollution. 

A lot of research has been done to predict the conditions resulting from higher global temperatures. Most of this research uses computer programs called general circulation models (GCMs). These models analyze the interactions of temperature, pressure, solar radiation, and other climatic factors to predict climate conditions for the past, present, or future. However, they are simplifications of reality and have many limitations. Their results are only approximate, and they are slow and expensive to run. 

Despite these challenges, most people agree on one important aspect of climate change: the rate of change will be faster than anything we have experienced before. The predictions from GCMs provide some insight into the world we will live in over the next few generations. Currently, they suggest that the average global surface temperature could rise by between 1°C and 3.5°C by the year 2100. They also predict that global sea levels will rise by 15-95 cm and that changes in rainfall patterns will occur. Scientists expect extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, floods, and droughts, to become more common in some areas. 

These forecasts highlight the potential impact of climate change on the natural environment and humans. Changes in climate could affect the locations of ecosystems, such as forests and grasslands, the variety of species they contain, and their ability to provide essential benefits for society. This includes food production, water resources, and human settlements. Some effects may be irreversible and likely unfavorable in many regions, but not all impacts will be negative. In fact, some climate change effects may be beneficial. 

For example, in Australia, research has shown that wheat yields have increased by about 0.5 tonnes per hectare since 1952, partly due to climate trends. Warmer temperatures have led to fewer frosts, which has reduced damage to crops. However, many predicted effects of future climate warming are concerning. Even small changes in climate can affect water availability, especially in dry regions or areas already facing shortages. 

The Mediterranean Basin is one example where decreasing rainfall has been observed, particularly in western-central areas. In southern Portugal, rainfall has become more concentrated in a shorter period, affecting seasonal patterns. Another serious concern is the impact on glaciers, which will affect ice, vegetation, wildlife habitats, and human structures. There is a strong possibility that Arctic ice will melt completely, making marine transport easier but increasing risks from icebergs.

Perhaps the most dramatic effect of global warming will be rising sea levels. This will occur due to the thermal expansion of oceans and melting ice. With about half of the world's population living in coastal areas, the consequences of rising sea levels could be severe. Increased flooding and inundation are likely, affecting cities like London, New York, and Tokyo. Many people could lose their homes and livelihoods, leading to millions of environmental refugees. 

The most severe consequences may be faced by small, low-lying island nations, which could disappear entirely if worst-case scenarios occur. This would be devastating not only for the people and cultures of these islands but also for the countries that would need to accommodate those displaced."

Wanted: a middle-aged, married couple for a 501-day round trip to Mars. Applicants must be physically and emotionally strong. This will be the profile of the first astronauts on Mars if multi-millionaire Dennis Tito's plans to launch a capsule on January 5, 2018, succeed. The capsule will take the crew to about 160 km above Mars. The spacecraft will use Mars' gravity to return to Earth without using extra fuel, as fuel efficiency is very important. The 2018 deadline is set because the next time Mars and Earth will be aligned for a launch is in 2031. It is a challenging task, but there is a race to develop new technologies. If these technologies are ready in time, the spacecraft might succeed. Even if it never leaves Earth, the efforts to reach these goals will still be valuable for future missions."
CPE_44,"**AESTHETICS**

The existence of artworks, which are the basis for aesthetic theory, can actually hinder our understanding of them. This is because these artworks are physical objects, like buildings, books, paintings, or statues, that exist separately from human experience. The true essence of a work of art lies in how it interacts with our experiences, but this can make it harder to grasp its meaning.

Moreover, the high regard for certain artworks, due to their long history of admiration, creates established ideas that can block new perspectives. Once an artwork is considered a classic, it often becomes disconnected from the human experiences that led to its creation and the effects it has on our lives. When we separate artworks from their origins and their impact on our experiences, we create a barrier that obscures their broader significance, which is what aesthetic theory aims to explore. Art then exists in a separate world, detached from the materials and goals of other human activities.

A key challenge for anyone writing about the philosophy of fine arts is to reconnect the refined experiences that artworks provide with the everyday events and struggles that everyone recognizes as part of life. Just as mountains are not isolated but are part of the earth's processes, artworks should not be seen as separate from human experience. Those studying the theory of art must make this connection clear.

If we accept this idea, we may reach a surprising conclusion: to truly understand artistic products, we need to temporarily set them aside and focus on the ordinary experiences that we usually do not consider aesthetic. We must take a detour to arrive at a theory of art, as theory is about understanding and insight. For example, one can enjoy flowers for their beauty and scent without knowing about plants scientifically. However, to understand how plants flower, one must learn about the interactions of soil, air, water, and sunlight that support their growth.

To grasp the aesthetic in its most profound forms, we must start with it in its raw state—through the events and scenes that capture our attention and provide enjoyment. Yet, the ideas that elevate art to a distant status can make many people uncomfortable with the idea that they enjoy their everyday activities partly because of their aesthetic qualities. 

Today, the arts that resonate most with the average person are often not recognized as traditional art forms, such as movies, jazz, comic strips, and sensational news stories. When art is confined to museums and galleries, people seek enjoyment in their daily lives instead. Many who oppose the museum view of art still hold onto the mistaken belief that separates art from ordinary experiences, a belief that many theorists and critics also support. The times when special artworks are closely linked to everyday activities are when appreciation for them is strongest and most genuine."
CPE_22,"**Observing Lions**

In popular culture, lions hunting for food are often seen as a remarkable display of teamwork. As the sun sets, a group of stealthy lions emerges from the shadows to surround their unsuspecting prey. They appear to be the perfect social animals, setting aside minor disagreements to work together for a common goal: their next meal. However, after many years of studying these animals in the wild, we have developed a different perspective. When we began our research in 1978, we aimed to understand why lions hunt together, raise cubs, and scare off rivals with their roars. If we measure an animal's success by how many offspring survive, then cooperation might not be beneficial. If one animal is too generous, it may end up helping its companions at its own expense. So, why do lions seem to ignore the rules of self-interest? We thought we could answer this question in two to three years, but lions are experts at being inactive. We would add them to the list of unreactive noble gases like krypton, argon, and neon. Therefore, it has taken various research methods to find clues about their behavior. Since wild lions can live up to 18 years, we are only now beginning to understand the answers to our questions.

**Pop Music Review**

The release of Bedrock's third album marked a significant moment in the career of a talented but previously unstable band. ""New Life"" started a movement that changed the direction of rock music in this country for the rest of the decade. Gone were the serious themes, dull clothing, and heavy guitars of the past; instead, a lighter mix of melodic local styles emerged. This album combined social commentary and strong emotions with sounds from fairground organs and brass bands. Humor and irony were prominent, and the singers proudly expressed their backgrounds. The album showcased Bedrock as skilled collectors and observers, as well as versatile songwriters. They playfully addressed traditional English themes like sunbathing and Sunday afternoons. However, the album's true strength lay in its deeper, more melancholic tracks, such as ""So Low,"" a beautiful song loosely based on weather, and ""To the Brink,"" a serious ballad. The beauty of ""New Life"" is its consistently high quality—16 tracks with no filler, an impressive achievement in an era of lengthy CDs.

**Extract from an Autobiography**

As a child, I was always intrigued by stories of 'The Sibyl,' the wise women who held great influence in the ancient world. Initially, I only knew of one from a story my mother told me. An old woman from Cumae offered Tarquin, the King of Rome, nine books for 300 gold pieces. When he refused, she burned three of them and offered him six for the same price. After he refused again, she burned three more books. He eventually bought the last three for the full price. Even then, I recognized a valuable lesson in the story about salesmanship and life. As an only child, I often felt lonely. I would ask to play with other children, but they would refuse. My mother advised me to do something so interesting that the other kids would want to join me. It worked, and it’s a lesson I’ve never forgotten. When I had the opportunity to write a travel book, I needed to find a topic that resonated with my life. I’m not an enthusiastic traveler; at the first chance, I sent my editor a long list of places I was unwilling to visit. Ultimately, I’m only interested in ruins, as I prefer to travel through time in my mind.

**What Happens to Your Manuscript?**

When you submit your manuscript, it will likely join a pile waiting for someone to review it—the so-called slush pile. This person is usually either a junior member of the editorial team (often under 18) or an experienced freelancer who works a few mornings a week. Neither has much power, but they are generally supportive and looking for something original. The junior member hopes to make a name for themselves and find a promising author, while the experienced freelancer aims to justify their ongoing employment. If they find your novel promising, they will pass it to a senior editor, and it will eventually be discussed in an acquisition meeting. The editor who champions your work must justify accepting it based on its quality and potential sales, as well as whether you seem like a long-term author. They will also consider how marketable you are, which is crucial when a new novel needs all the support it can get. For this reason, publishers often prefer to meet potential authors before finalizing an offer."
CPE_39,"**Text: Advertising on Trial**

If you work in an advertising agency, the early 1990s were likely very challenging. The recession was worse than expected, affecting industrialized countries for thirty years. In Britain, 1991 saw a decline in gross domestic product (GDP), high interest rates, reduced consumer spending, job losses for over half a million people, and around 75,000 homes being repossessed. Every business was impacted, with some sectors, like vehicles and construction, seeing a 30% drop in activity. Many people and companies around the world faced difficulties.

While advertising professionals were not the only ones losing jobs, those who remained often felt intense pressure. They were seen as responsible for helping companies financially, which meant they were closely watched by their colleagues and bosses. Additionally, they were expected to do more with smaller budgets, being told that ""less is more."" Despite these challenges, the importance of marketing grew. Companies began to focus more on creating products and services that customers wanted, rather than just what was easy for them to produce. 

As a result, marketing received more attention from management, and some brands started to be genuinely marketed. This increased the status of marketing professionals but also added to their workload. Marketing was often mistakenly seen as a solution to all problems. Since about half of marketing budgets go to advertising, the pressure on advertising professionals increased. 

The early 1990s marked a downturn for the advertising industry, partly due to the economic situation. However, there were also deeper changes that would not simply disappear when the economy improved. The recession led clients to closely examine their advertising budgets and question the effectiveness of their spending. Many companies were unsure about the return on investment from their advertising, making the industry feel like it was on trial.

Client companies expressed a desire for better strategies, targeting, creativity, media placement, and overall thinking. They wanted the best talent from advertising agencies and expected them to work hard to produce excellent results. While this situation does not necessarily evoke sympathy for the advertising industry, it highlights that many advertising professionals faced the same challenges as their clients: how to achieve more with less.

Several factors made effective advertising even more difficult. Some were direct results of the recession, such as debates over production costs and a reluctance to take risks, which are often essential for good advertising. Other changes were happening regardless of the economy, including demographic shifts, the growing power of retailers, changing consumer needs, the rise of sponsorship, and stricter advertising regulations. Additionally, some companies faced the new challenge of advertising internationally.

These issues forced advertising professionals to reconsider the famous saying by Lord Leverhulme: ""Only half my advertising works. The trouble is I don't know which half."" The pressure to increase the effectiveness of advertising was greater than ever. Unfortunately, help for those seeking to improve their advertising was not readily available. Companies and agencies were too busy managing these challenges to discuss them, and those who succeeded often kept their strategies private. While conferences and seminars offered some insights, the available literature on advertising often did not provide practical guidance. Many books presented advertising as a flawless process, which was not true and did not assist the employees responsible for the results."
CPE_18,"**The Allure of the Kitchen**

When I was in university, I decided I wanted to become a chef. This choice was unusual among my peers. Cooking was not a popular career; it seemed unattractive. Chefs often have tough lives: the work is long, stressful, repetitive, and poorly paid. However, these factors did not discourage me. I was unhappy at university. The studies were difficult, and the social life felt closed off and self-important. Becoming a chef appeared to be the perfect escape from the pretentiousness of college life. It offered a sense of seriousness and integrity that I felt was missing in my studies.

My desire to cook was not just a reaction to my university experience; it also reflected a deeper appreciation for food. This appreciation began when I had a meal at a well-known restaurant in London. It was a transformative experience. I still remember my starter vividly. After that meal, I felt an overwhelming urge to learn the secrets of this wonderful art. I turned my student life into preparation for a career in cooking. My history degree felt meaningless, distracting me from my true passion. I learned about cooking by reading cookbooks, exploring markets, and preparing elaborate meals.

**The Swimming Instructor**

The school's swimming instructor was a former drill sergeant, small and muscular, with tattooed arms. When I asked him to teach me how to dive, he instructed me to sit on the edge of the pool, raise my hands above my head, and roll forward, pushing off with my feet. I practiced this until the hour was over. On my next visit, he had me stand up and dive off the edge. He was strict, and every time I surfaced, he looked at me disapprovingly: ""Don't look down, look up!"" ""Keep your legs straight."" ""Point your toes!"" 

The following week, I climbed up to the high diving board. It was fixed and slightly bent at the front. It felt extremely high as I stood there, trying to gather my courage. Gradually, the noise around me faded, and I felt enveloped in silence. I waved my arms as I had been taught, tried to look up instead of down, and jumped into the air. For a brief moment, I felt like I was flying. When I hit the water, I landed awkwardly, and my legs flailed. The instructor looked at me with disdain and shook his head. But even he could not take away my joy. I thought, ""This is what they mean by 'free as a bird.'""

**The Traveller**

For those of us who value a comfortable bed, running water, and the likelihood of living until tomorrow, the idea of a traveller can seem both strange and fascinating. These are people who willingly take risks, climbing dangerous mountains, sailing alone on small boats through rough seas, and eating whatever they can find, even insects. They can live for months in uncertainty. 

It is easy to see such people as oddities, and we might dismiss them as eccentric: hermits, extreme divers, or writers. While they do exist, their unusual world is far from our daily lives, and we can easily ignore it, returning to our own comforts like microwave ovens and answering machines. We are relieved that the only risks we face are predictable, like crossing a busy street.

**Sailing**

Jonathan Raban is afraid of the sea, which is likely why he spends so much time on it. He does not claim to be an expert sailor, but he is skilled. His main reason for sailing is that, as a writer, he enjoys writing about his experiences on the water. Sailing provides him with stories to tell.

Raban's small boat has a device that shows sailors their exact location anywhere on Earth. While he appreciates this technology, he also believes that the invention of the compass was a mistake. He thinks it has created a disconnect between people and the sea. Since the compass was introduced, sailors have focused on it instead of observing the waves and feeling the ocean. The sea, once full of life, has become just a space to navigate. Because of this, the person steering the boat can often be replaced by an autopilot, which may be why Raban has time to observe the waves so closely."
CPE_62,"**Holiday Reading**

Summer brings us two great joys: escaping home and reading books. These joys are closely connected. Books can help us feel more at home in the wider world. We can relate our own experiences to those in great books written long ago or in faraway places because there are fewer types of people than there are individuals. In the writings of others, we discover our own thoughts, embarrassments, and dramas. Authors can find the right words to describe feelings we thought we were alone in experiencing, or they can express our thoughts with a clarity we struggle to achieve. What is shy and confused within us is clearly and confidently expressed in their work, which is even more striking if the author is from a distant place or a different time. We feel thankful to these strangers for reminding us of who we are.

Through reading and travel, we escape the dullness of routine. Our eyes are most open during the first few days in a new place, and perhaps also when we read a great book, which reveals things we had previously overlooked. Our minds become like radar, picking up on details we hadn’t noticed before, such as the colors of the sky, the changing expressions on a face, the insincerity of a friend, or a sadness about a situation we didn’t know we could feel sad about.

**Author's Note**

These reflections on travel were published as articles in the Observer newspaper over seven years. I have restored some small edits made by the editor for space, but otherwise, I have added very little. I corrected a few obvious mistakes, but only if they were minor details I should have gotten right initially. With hindsight, I could have made more improvements, but that would have been endless. For example, in the second article about China, I thought the Hong Kong dollar would remain stable, but a year later it fell. If I rewrote it to predict this, it would no longer be a report from that time. Like any traveler in Southeast Asia or elsewhere, I was there in that moment, unaware of what would happen next, and focused on understanding what had already occurred. This is the true story of mass air travel: the world opening up to people who have no special qualifications to explore it except the price of a ticket. However, I have never believed that all my fellow travelers were completely unaware. Even a postcard can have a purpose.

**Ecotourism**

If there were awards for tourism phrases that have been misused, ""ecotourism"" would win first prize. The term first appeared in the early 1980s, reflecting a rise in environmental awareness and a realization by tour operators that many travelers wanted to ensure their presence abroad would not harm the environment. It quickly became a popular marketing term for holidays. Today, the ecotourism label includes everything from two-week tours with remote tribes to one-hour boat trips through an Australian gorge. Any tour that involves cultural interaction, natural beauty, wildlife, or a bit of adventure is likely to be labeled ecotourism. While the original intentions were good, the lack of regulations and a clear definition left many travelers confused in an ecotourism maze.

**Transylvanian Journey**

I lost my notebook from my journey in Transylvania for 50 years, but I found it again a few years ago by chance. It has helped me remember that time and write about it, but it hasn’t been as reliable as I hoped. In Transylvania, I had a much easier time than I expected, moving from one welcoming country house to another, often staying for weeks. When I settled down during those long stays, my writing stopped too; I thought there was nothing to record. I was often slow to start writing again when I moved on, and even then, quick notes sometimes replaced longer narratives. Worried that some details might be out of order when I began writing this book, I surrounded those sections with many qualifications. However, realizing that these pages were not a guidebook made me think it didn’t matter much, so I let the story unfold without unnecessary complications."
CPE_49,"**Text: Fashion**

Fashion is often thought of as a modern idea, mainly influenced by capitalism in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. However, many fashion historians argue that fashion, especially in terms of style and design, has a long history. They often begin their studies with the growth of markets and trade in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. As societies have become more complex, populations have grown, and new technologies for making various types of clothing and accessories have emerged, the meanings associated with dress have also become more complex. Therefore, it is hard to determine what any piece of clothing or accessory truly means today. For instance, a man's suit, which is often seen as a symbol of uniformity, can have very different meanings depending on the context and the person interpreting it.

**Writer**

Reports about publishers competing for popular manuscripts can create a misleading image of life for most novelists. For those of us who are not best-selling authors, there are two main ways to make a living. The smartest writers work in the evenings and have other full-time jobs that will still be there if their book is not quickly published or made into a film. Others, like me, take on various writing-related jobs, such as teaching, leading workshops, and writing articles. I have heard of a writing job at a chocolate factory, but I have never found anything like that. Somehow, by balancing part-time jobs and using credit cards, and often thanks to the support of those mentioned in the Acknowledgements section of books, I manage to write my novel.

**Sudden Fame**

The small venues where we performed across the country were starting to sell out, and we needed extra security to manage the growing number of excited fans. We had to use secret entrances to avoid being overwhelmed by admirers at the village halls and ballrooms where we played. On the few nights we were not working, it was hard to leave the house without being followed by enthusiastic fans. In just a few days, we became celebrities. Our actions were closely watched by our fans, and our management took care of all our needs. Although my shyness never completely disappeared, it was replaced by a strange, naive confidence that only people who are naturally shy and suddenly find themselves in the spotlight can understand. In short, I felt completely out of my depth emotionally."
CPE_31,"**Text: Music - The Challenge Ahead**

Technological advances are changing our lives at work, home, and during our free time. Susan Hallam discusses how these changes affect music in Britain. In the late 20th century, there was a rapid increase in ways to listen to music, such as through radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, videos, and new multimedia techniques. However, this has led to a decline in live music performances and full-time jobs for professional musicians. 

It is clear that access to music will continue to grow, as it meets many human needs. On a national level, no major state event is complete without music. For individuals, music offers many formal and informal activities. A society without music is hard to imagine. The real question is not whether there will be music in the 21st century, but what kind of music it will be and whether people will still feel the need to learn to play instruments.

I believe that there will still be a need for musical skills. The music industry is a major source of income in Britain, and musical talent will remain important for various professions, especially in the media. Additionally, there is evidence that playing an instrument can help develop skills early on. Research in the USA suggests that listening to or making music positively affects spatial reasoning, which is one measure of intelligence. While these results need further confirmation, studies in Europe show that group music lessons can improve social relationships in schools and help children focus, especially those with behavioral issues.

Current research is also exploring how playing an instrument might help develop transferable skills. For example, regular practice can lead to good study habits and concentration, while performing in concerts can teach punctuality and organization. For these reasons, there will likely be a continued demand for instrumental teaching in the near future.

What about the long-term future? Will there be a change in focus, and if so, what will it be? I believe two possibilities are likely. First, the types of music people listen to will become more diverse, with new genres combining different styles. Second, technology will play a larger role in composing and performing music, making it easier for more people to create music without needing advanced technical skills. However, this may also reduce the need for live performances and musicians focused solely on that.

At the same time, more people of all ages will want to participate in music-making, often in community settings that reflect their local musical traditions. If this vision for the future is to happen, the music profession must prepare. Instrumental teaching will need to change to help more people learn various instruments throughout their lives. This will require adjustments to the curriculum and assessment methods to stay relevant for a wider audience.

Training for musicians will be crucial. They must be able to motivate and teach learners of all ages, work with diverse groups, and develop skills in communication, social interaction, entrepreneurship, and management for community work. This represents a significant shift from traditional practices and will require a response to demands for public accountability. 

Positively, this change offers an opportunity for those in music education to showcase the high quality of music teaching available. Finally, we must work to raise the profile of music itself. Music is essential in our lives, but it is often taken for granted. Everyone in the music profession needs to collaborate to ensure that this perception changes."
CPE_58,"**The Actor's Craft**

Actors sometimes face criticism and scorn. Much of this negativity comes from the actors themselves when they are asked to discuss their work in interviews. Instead of sharing their true feelings, they often resort to tired clichés or gossip. Paul Scofield once wrote to a friend that an actor's work is only alive when performed. He believed that discussing it makes it feel empty and theoretical. Each time an actor performs, they start anew, learning from the characters and the writer. After a play ends, they often feel empty until the next performance, and this emptiness is evident in discussions about acting.

**A Review of Hamlet**

Adrian Lester's portrayal of Hamlet captures the transition from boyhood to manhood with remarkable simplicity and confidence. His control over the text and his physical presence elevate him from a promising actor to a leading performer. Lester plays a young man filled with suppressed anger, using sharp wit and humor that make him both intimidating and endearing. His performance is skillful, evident in the way he holds his body, suggesting a character waiting to be brought to life. Similarly, Handy's portrayal of Horatio conveys a sense of being moved by an inner force.

**What is Acting?**

What does it mean to act? Is it merely copying behavior, or does it create something new? This question lies at the heart of theatre.

**One Director's Approach to Rehearsal**

This director's rehearsal process begins with a technique called ""dropping in."" The stage manager displays the script on a screen while the actors listen quietly. When it’s their turn to speak, they read the first line, reflect on its meaning, and wait for the impulse to speak. For example, if the line is, ""Queuing all night, the rain, do you remember?"" they take a breath and let the thought come to them. They might visualize a memory, like waiting in line for a concert. The director encourages actors to be open and trust that something will happen in the moment.

**The Perfect Theatre**

The ideal theatre should make you feel that your presence matters. Attending a live performance is a special event, and the staff should recognize this. It can feel isolating if the people working there seem indifferent. The theatre must create a connection between the performers and the audience. Everyone should feel engaged and not distant from the actors. The design of the auditorium is crucial; it should suit the human voice and body. If the space is too large, it can diminish the experience. Many theatres built in the late nineteenth century successfully created an intimate atmosphere. I appreciate theatres that show a sense of history, like worn stone steps in a church, reflecting layers of human experience. 

When it comes to plays, you cannot please everyone. You cannot predict what the audience will want to see. When you go to the theatre, you seek something unexpected; otherwise, you might as well stay home."
CPE_37,"**Text:**

**Paul Simon**  
Rock and roll in the 1950s was mainly a music movement for young people, but it also had a significant effect on the middle class and older generations. It opened doors for the next wave of rock stars, who listened to this exciting and unusual music, knowing it would be an important part of their lives. For Paul Simon and many other young people in the US, the best way to hear this new music was through Alan Freed's radio show, Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party. Freed's show was essential listening for many young aspiring rock stars. Just like John Lennon, who was 3,000 miles away in Liverpool, listening to Radio Luxembourg—the only European station playing rock and roll—Paul Simon was captivated by the music from Freed's show. He was getting ready for the next big step for a teenager obsessed with rock and roll: moving from just listening to creating his own music.

**Snow**  
I couldn't see a clear path, but I thought I would be fine if I walked carefully. The wind was strong, pushing me over as I struggled on the icy ground. Suddenly, the snow that looked harmless gave way beneath me. I fell into a hole about four feet deep. The snow had formed a roof over a gap between two rocks, and when it melted, it left only a thin layer that I fell through. I managed to pull myself out, feeling shaken and worried about what would have happened if the hole had been much deeper. I leaned against a pine tree sticking out of the snow to think about my situation. After an hour, I had only gone about half a mile. It was clear that I would have to change my plans.

**Qualitative Research**  
There are many books that aim to help researchers understand qualitative research. While a lot has been said about how to collect data, these books often do not explain how to analyze that data. There is still a lot of confusion about how researchers go about analyzing their data. To address this, we invited various social scientists who have worked on qualitative projects to share the methods they used. The goal was to provide insight into the process of qualitative data analysis, rather than to create a guide for new researchers. This task involves making unclear processes clearer. Although this may seem easy, we have found it quite challenging. Therefore, we allowed our contributors to present their work in different styles, including personal stories and more formal approaches."
CPE_2,"**Simplified Text:**

**Screen Learning**  
Recently, I saw my six-year-old son eating noodles in a funny way. He was pulling them up with his teeth and pretending to be a dinosaur. He said, ""I'm a little dinosaur."" He was acting out a scene from a TV show, so I asked him what he remembered about dinosaurs. He didn’t remember much. There is a trend to use the internet and computers for learning, but is learning from a screen really effective? One writer shared his experience with an interactive program he tried with his son. The father read the words while the son played with the pictures. The father thought that if his son had spent ten minutes reading a book, he might have learned something. Research shows that learning happens best in an environment where there is conversation with teachers or parents. Technology can be useful for teaching our children, but traditional education is still very important.

**Hollywood**  
By 1918, most of the world’s film-making had moved to Hollywood. The local people were not happy, seeing their neighborhood in Los Angeles changed by these newcomers. However, they eventually accepted this change because of the American value of success, which is measured by box office earnings. Hollywood can recognize a good film, one that can create stars and make money. In less than a hundred years, Hollywood has transformed from a small village to a place as famous as New York, Rome, or Paris. Physically, it has changed a lot; a century ago, you would walk through orange groves to get to the village store. Yet, in some ways, it still feels like a small village, focused mainly on films: how much money they make, who is dating whom, and who is involved in which project. Many successful people try to leave Hollywood to live elsewhere, but it remains the main place for anyone in the entertainment industry.

**Photography**  
Photography was created by artists in the nineteenth century as a way to capture their surroundings. They wanted a lasting record of what they saw, and photography provided that. The combination of light, lenses, and special surfaces created images that were more detailed and realistic than what painters could create in a long time. This upset many artists, who initially enjoyed the new images but later claimed that photography could not be considered art. They believed that photography was too connected to reality and relied too much on machines to be a true expression of creativity. Despite this criticism, photographers recognized that they had discovered a new art form. They used photography like other artists use brushes and pencils to show their view of the world and its beauty.

**Book Illustration**  
During the time of black-and-white book illustrations, it was common for every children's book to have illustrations. This also applied to many novels for older children, which saw a decline in print runs. Although children's publishing was active, it often operated on a low budget, leading to many average-quality works. However, the best artists always submitted their best work. Therefore, the collection of black-and-white illustrations is a mix of both valuable and less valuable pieces, making it a great place for research and discovery. The best illustrations are likely to be shown to the public again, either through reprints of classic books or exhibitions of original works. There are signs that interest in this art form is growing again, and soon a publisher may create a series of classic children's book illustrations from this time, either by reprinting them or designing new editions using the original artwork."
CPE_68,"**Text: Blogging: Sharing Our Lives Online**

Not long ago, a website warned about the dangers of public check-ins, which are online announcements of where you are. The message was clear: while you might think you are simply saying, ""Hey, I'm here,"" you are also letting many people know your location, including those you might not want to meet. This reflects a growing understanding that there can be negative consequences to the constant sharing that the internet encourages. 

The internet offers many exciting opportunities to share our lives with a global audience, which can lead to wealth and fame. However, as we dive into this online world, we often find ourselves overwhelmed and lost in the chaos of sharing personal stories and photos. This situation may seem discouraging, but there is hope. The path forward was laid out for us by early internet pioneers who explored these challenges long before social media existed.

In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting on the World Wide Web, which was mainly used by graduate students and scientists. The web was created at CERN, a physics lab in Switzerland, to help researchers share their work. Hall saw a different opportunity: to share his own life. He created a detailed online autobiography filled with personal stories, photos, and art. In January 1996, he began a daily blog, attracting many readers who were fascinated by his bold exploration of this new medium. Hall's approach was open; anyone who crossed his path could be featured on his site, and no topic was off-limits. While some might see this as exhibitionism, there was also a unique beauty to his work.

However, one day, visitors to Hall's site found it replaced by a single video titled ""Dark Night."" In it, he shared that he had fallen deeply in love, but when he wrote about it online, he was told, ""either the blog goes, or I do."" Hall felt that sharing his life online made people distrust him. The blog was removed, but the issue of sharing personal information remains. While sharing online can be enjoyable, expecting it to make people want to be close to you can lead to disappointment.

In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a young woman in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, an anonymous coworker shared her blog's address with the company's vice presidents, including some she had criticized, which led to her losing her job. Researchers studying online behavior have a term for this: the ""online distribution effect,"" which describes how people often feel they can say things online that they would never say in person. However, our online lives are connected to our real lives, and ignoring this can lead to serious mistakes.

Armstrong's story had a positive outcome. Although she was upset and stopped blogging for a while, she eventually got married and restarted her blog, focusing on her new family. Today, she is a well-known ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her household. Once a cautionary example of the risks of online sharing, she has now mastered the art of sharing her life carefully. Armstrong's experience teaches us an important lesson: just because the internet allows us to say anything, it doesn't mean we should."
CPE_23,"**Text: Enough Sleep?**

Tiredness is often seen as a common issue in modern life. As wealthier and busier countries have developed, sleeplessness and anxiety have also increased. Research in the USA shows that 40 million Americans suffer from chronic sleep problems. Some popular novels in Britain even feature characters who cannot sleep or focus on sleep research. 

A key concern is that ""People need more sleep,"" says a sleep researcher. Many people reduce their sleep when they are busy, often waking up early to avoid traffic. Recently, a researcher conducted an experiment where participants were allowed to sleep for up to 14 hours a night for a month. After three weeks, they settled into an average of eight hours and fifteen minutes of sleep, showing a strong need for rest.

In Europe, a university sleep research lab in the English Midlands has studied various topics, including how fatigue affects sailors and the impact of airport noise on sleep. They recruit participants through student newspapers, offering £5 an hour and asking them to change their sleep patterns. Dr. Louise Reyner reassures participants who worry about electrodes on their heads, explaining that the lab focuses on physical aspects of sleep.

In a dark room, there is a motorway simulator where participants drive while answering questions. They are asked to come at 2 PM, a time when people naturally feel sleepy, especially after little or no sleep. As they drive, one participant tries hard to stay awake but begins to blink more frequently and eventually nods off, causing the car to drift off the road. Dr. Reyner suggests that drinking two cups of coffee can help someone stay alert for at least half an hour. She also recommends various products like energy drinks and caffeinated gum, especially for shift workers.

What do we know about sleep? Humans, like other mammals, follow a daily sleep cycle. When asleep, we go through four stages, from light sleep to deep sleep. Dreams usually happen during light sleep, and the brain temporarily paralyzes the body to prevent injuries. There are theories that sleep helps repair the body or restore muscles, but it is unclear if this happens faster during relaxed wakefulness. 

Scientists agree that women tend to sleep about half an hour longer than men, and older people generally need less sleep, though the reasons are unknown. Some researchers even suggest that sleep allows us to ""travel through time without injury.""

Historically, sleep patterns have changed. A history professor studied British sleep habits from 1500 to 1850 and found that people would go to bed early, wake up after midnight for a while, and then sleep again. This time was often used for reflection or even nighttime activities. However, by the 17th century, with the rise of artificial light, wealthier people began to adopt a more efficient sleep pattern. The industrial revolution further changed sleep habits, making people work longer hours in lit buildings.

In some non-western cultures, the old sleep patterns still exist. People may sleep for a few hours, wake up, and then sleep again. For some tribal societies, continuous sleep is difficult due to noise and the need to stay alert for dangers. It appears that people everywhere are in need of more sleep."
CPE_60,"Text: ""We are talking about big cowboy boots. Really expensive boots. I stood in my 800-dollar designer cowboy boots on the rocks in the Arizona desert. Money was not a problem. I wore a complete cowboy outfit, and if you had the outfit, you might be a cowboy. But I was not. It wasn't working for me. I squinted into the morning sun, looking at the Arizona mountains, and I had to admit that I did not feel at home in the wild. After flying in from Denver just after dawn, I thought I might look like a cowboy arriving from the sky. But that feeling disappeared when I saw a real cowboy in the luggage area of Phoenix airport. He wore a sweat-stained t-shirt, needed a shave, and was lifting a dirty bag off the conveyor belt when he noticed my new cowboy boots. He raised one eyebrow and walked out without looking back.

There should be a suit of clothes that an ex-racing driver can wear without feeling out of place. Something that allows him to feel comfortable wherever he goes, without feeling like everyone else is moving at a slower pace. I loved being a racing driver and driving racing cars. I am addicted to it, and it is all I know how to do. But I don’t do it anymore. I couldn’t even if I wanted to. I wondered what I should do now. A racing driver should have one or two backup identities for when he stops racing. I thought I had some, but when I tried to reach for them, they vanished.

How about being a commentator at the racetrack? There were many former Indy and Formula One drivers wanting to be commentators. Or maybe I could partner with someone to sell classic cars? That idea lasted all winter with phone calls, lunches, lawyers, and meetings with bankers. But it was a bad year for selling old Ferraris, and in the end, I had to step back before I lost everything. Being an 'ex' anything is tough. Who wants to hear about how I almost became World Champion? Nobody wants to hear a story that ends with 'almost.' Even if I had been the champion, you would probably only want to listen for five minutes before getting bored. Last year’s champion is just that—last year.

Not that I want sympathy, which is good because I don’t get any. Why should I? I had a good career, made money, and saved enough. But I miss the thrill of getting into that powerful racing car with seven hundred horsepower. I miss going from zero to one hundred fifty miles an hour in 4.9 seconds. I even miss the danger of almost crashing every race. I miss the exciting people and the reporters who acted like my words mattered. Being somewhat famous has its perks. Businessmen and politicians liked to brag that they knew me. Little boys would sneak under fences to get my autograph. 

Now that I don’t drive anymore, I have a lot of free time. Just last week, the phone rang twice. I have time in the morning and afternoon, and tomorrow looks free too. I looked up at the clear blue sky. No buzzards flying above. Maybe Arizona doesn’t have buzzards. But a couple of small brown birds in a cactus nearby were warning me to leave their nest alone. I never thought the desert had songbirds. It made me realize that a fake cowboy in designer boots still has a lot to learn."""
CPE_1,"**Text: Vancouver**

In the past ten years, many people from around the world have moved to Vancouver, a city in western Canada. In the evenings, residents walk through the city streets, and if you join them, you will likely hear different languages being spoken. People come to Vancouver for its mild weather, beautiful location between the ocean and mountains, clean and safe environment, and good educational and job opportunities. Although some locals may complain about the rapid construction of new buildings, it is clear that the new residents and growing tourism have contributed to a vibrant city life. Vancouver was once called 'Terminal City' because it served as a gateway to other places. Although this name is less common now, Vancouver is still a major gateway.

**Putting Pen to Paper**

Journalists like me often struggle with writing letters. Some say this is because we dislike writing for free, but I think it is more about how we aim for the best impact in our work, which makes writing a letter feel different. A true artist, who may rewrite their work many times, does not face this issue. I believe that understanding the impact of their words is a key sign of a real artist. When Shakespeare wrote his famous lines, he likely did not think about how the use of longer words made them powerful, even though it showed his talent as a writer.

**Supermarket Opening**

In Britain, the opening of a new supermarket used to be a big event. You could expect a celebrity, like a soap star or a member of the royal family, to come and cut the ribbon. Now, new supermarkets seem to open every day, and celebrities are no longer needed. Why pay a famous person when anyone can open it for free? Last week, waiting pensioners didn’t care who opened the new Superbuy store, as long as they were at the front of the line. According to one customer who knew someone working there, the first five men to enter would receive a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women would get a bunch of flowers. This news quickly spread through the crowd, making those at the front feel proud and causing envy among those who arrived later."
CPE_53,"**Text: Citizen Kane**

When the film *Citizen Kane* was released in 1941, it created a lot of excitement, but it was not a financial success. The release was delayed because the distributors were worried about the possible reactions of William Randolph Hearst, who was thought to be the inspiration for the main character. Despite this, the film received very positive reviews. It was television that later brought the film back into the public's attention. *Citizen Kane* is often seen as the film that has motivated many people to become filmmakers. This is surprising because it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles believed that its success came from his lack of knowledge about the rules of filmmaking; he simply went ahead and created the film. He also had a talented team, including cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and special-effects expert Linwood Dunn. When Welles and Mankiewicz decided to create a story about a newspaper tycoon who was similar to Hearst but not exactly like him, Welles realized he had found a great opportunity for himself as both director and actor, and he took it with great enthusiasm.

**Dermot and Carmel**

That morning, Dermot thought Carmel seemed a bit strange. He had mentioned twice that he might be late and that he might stop by the golf club on his way home to talk to someone. Carmel had nodded politely, as if she didn’t really understand. ""Will you be okay? What are you planning to do today?"" he asked. She smiled and replied, ""It's funny you ask. I was just thinking I have nothing to do today, so I might walk downtown and look at the shops. I feel like it would be almost wrong to waste the day."" Dermot smiled back, saying, ""You deserve to enjoy yourself. And if I’m late, I won’t need any food, so don’t worry about it."" ""That’s fine,"" she said.

**Title Race**

""Tea boy? Do you mind? I’m a mobile lukewarm beverage resource facilitator."" Human nature often creates amusing situations. A recent study revealed that job titles are a major source of jealousy and dissatisfaction at work. A survey by a well-known recruitment firm found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees believe that job titles create divisions among coworkers. Surprisingly, 70% of office workers said they would give up a pay raise for a more ""motivational"" or ""professional"" job title. If our desire for status is so strong that it overcomes our basic need for money, we are in a troubling situation. In the early twenty-first century, no one wants to be called subordinate. The job titles being discussed focus on skills (like specialist or coordinator) but are really just fancy words."
CPE_55,"**The Vienna Assignment**

I was in Vienna to take photographs, which was usually why I traveled. Photography was not just my job; it was a big part of my life. The way light fell on different surfaces always inspired me. I believed that a single photograph could capture the essence of a moment, a place, or a person. I often thought that at any moment, I could take the perfect picture, as long as I had film in my camera. My approach was simple: finish one roll, load another, and keep my eyes open. This had been my way of working for a long time.

Once, I had a brief moment of fame when a photo I took of a smoke plume from a burning oil well became popular worldwide. It was mostly luck, but they say you create your own opportunities, both good and bad. After that, I decided to work freelance, which seemed like a smart choice. However, life had other plans, and the mid-nineties were not as successful as I had hoped, especially after my photo made the cover of Time magazine. That’s why I found myself in Vienna instead of somewhere more exciting. But I was still taking photographs, and I was getting paid for it, which I thought was good.

The assignment came about by chance. I had previously taken photos for a coffee-table book called *Four Cities in Four Seasons*, which featured London, Paris, Rome, and Vienna. I had received a nice commission for capturing my city in different seasons. I had my own unique style, showcasing the beauty of Hyde Park in spring and the busy streets of Piccadilly in summer. I knew that some of my best work would be overlooked since it was just a picture book, not something meant to challenge people's views.

After a cold snap over Christmas, I submitted my winter photos of London and learned that the Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, had left his job in Vienna for unknown reasons. Instead of hiring someone new, they offered me his position. The Austrian publishers liked my work, and I was available, unlike the French and Italian photographers. I was eager to go because things at home were not going well. A week in snowy Vienna sounded like a great opportunity.

They arranged for me to stay at the Europa hotel in the heart of the old city. My last visit to Vienna had been a busy weekend with my wife, where we rushed through many palaces and museums. It had been hot and chaotic, and I hadn’t taken many photos. This time, being alone in the cold January weather would be different. I felt it the moment I arrived and saw the beautiful light over the snow-covered roofs of the city. I was excited to take great pictures.

On my first day, I didn’t rush to take photos. Instead, I rode the trams around the Ringstrasse, getting on and off to experience the city’s atmosphere. The weather was cold and still, reflecting the grand history of the city. I hadn’t seen what Schussner had captured in the other seasons, and I didn’t want to. This was going to be my Vienna, and I was ready to discover it.

A photograph captures a moment, but you have to wait for the right moment to come. So, I took my time, observing everything until I felt ready. The next morning, I woke up early. The fresh snow meant that Stephansplatz would be beautifully white and almost empty. I struggled to find a way to capture the cathedral in one shot. Its tall spire reached into the grey sky, while at ground level, it was massive and imposing. I realized I might have to focus on just part of it. In that weather and at that time, it could still be magical.

Photography has always had a sense of magic. Even the early pioneers felt this before they fully understood the chemistry behind it. You can watch a blank sheet of paper turn into a photograph in a dark room. Even when you know how it works, the mystery remains. Perhaps that’s why what happened at Stephansplatz that morning didn’t surprise me in a strange way."
CPE_50,"**Text: Kinetic Art**

Exciting news: London's Hayward Gallery has changed into a place of wonder. This transformation is not due to a big-budget, flashy event, but rather a unique exploration of a lesser-known part of the last 60 years. A new exhibition looks at the history of kinetic art, which is art that involves movement, throughout the twentieth century. It shows that creating artworks that move on their own or explore the idea of movement has been a consistent, though often overlooked, theme in some of the most interesting creative work of this century. 

The exhibition features a wonderful collection of paintings, drawings, documents, and films about kinetic art, curated by Guy Brett, who has dedicated his life to studying this subject. The artworks are mostly presented without much text, allowing visitors to enjoy discovering connections and insights on their own.

**David Hockney**

David Hockney's art attracts many people who might not usually be interested in art. This could be because his work is figurative and easy to understand, or because it focuses on leisure and escape from daily life. Some people might even be drawn to Hockney's charming personality and his clever comments, making him popular for reasons unrelated to his art. However, this does not mean that his art lacks serious purpose. 

Some critics believe Hockney is an overrated minor artist. In response, one could argue that he seems minor only because it is often frowned upon to be so popular today, not because his work lacks depth. Hockney himself is realistic about his limitations and believes it is not important to dismiss his work just because it does not fit a certain idea of greatness. He does not claim to be a great artist and understands that only future generations can truly judge his importance.

**Window-shopping - an Art Exhibition**

In recent years, I have attended many contemporary art exhibitions, some brilliant and others mediocre. What frustrates me are shows that seem to push a specific agenda, suggesting a common viewpoint among certain artists. Sometimes this approach works, revealing new trends in seemingly unrelated works. More often, however, it highlights a questionable angle or a forced concept. 

As a curator, I wanted to create a show that opposed this trend. Along with seven artists, I took over a space in an empty warehouse. 'Window-shopping' was meant to be a collection of individual artworks that connected only by being labeled as art. For example, Sam Cole's knitted cats chased each other on a toy train track, while Matthew Crawley filmed a video camera, opened it, and poked around until it broke, creating flickering images on a monitor. 

These works did not fit into a specific theme and would not usually be shown together, but they complemented each other. I did not make grand statements about contemporary art, but I believe that art is fundamentally an individual activity where artists set their own rules.

**Art History**

People who enjoy paintings sometimes hesitate to analyze them, fearing it will ruin their enjoyment. Some believe that art historians, who focus on theory rather than practice, overlook the joy of viewing art and the special act of creating it. This idea is similar to thinking that knowing a recipe and cooking method takes away from the taste of a dish. 

Understanding the importance of enjoyment does not mean we cannot have a deep knowledge of the art we appreciate. In fact, knowing more about what we are viewing can enhance our pleasure. Additionally, pleasure is complex. How we sense and recognize pleasure is influenced by our history and society. Our preferences for certain characteristics in art are shaped not just by our genes or personalities, but also by the values of the society we live in. 

While we should not underestimate the importance of instinctive responses to art, the belief that intellectual understanding diminishes enjoyment is an outdated idea that once promoted art as an alternative to thought."
CPE_25,"**Metals**  
Stone Age people may have been interested in metals because they wanted to decorate themselves. While sitting by a river, waiting for fish, one of our early ancestors might have found a shiny yellow stone and picked it up. It felt different from regular stones and was very attractive. This could be how gold became important to early humans. Because gold is easy to shape, it quickly became a popular material. Copper might have also been discovered by chance, and once people realized how useful copper tools were, they actively searched for copper ores and ways to extract the metal. This led to the development of metalworking, which improved the lives of our ancestors.

**St Ives**  
We walked down a narrow, cobbled street towards the town, struggling with our heavy bags against the strong wind and trying to avoid the cold waves crashing over the promenade. The streets were empty, and all the cottage shutters along the waterfront were tightly closed. We had seen the weather get worse as we arrived in St Ives on a small train. With the dark skies above, visiting Cornwall in the off-season without a car didn’t seem like a great idea anymore. I had convinced my friend to come with me by promising beautiful walks along the Cornish coast and cozy evenings by the fire.

**Computer Modelling**  
Studying the past is challenging because it is gone. The people who lived in times of peace and hardship are no longer here. The reasons they settled in certain places or formed families and communities have been forgotten. Archaeology gives us some clues, but we cannot test our ideas with experiments on past cultures. We cannot go back in time to see what happened. However, computer modelling allows us to recreate ancient landscapes and environments, filling them with virtual communities that have some needs and abilities like real humans. We can set rules for these communities and simulate social groups. Then, we can change the weather or increase the population and observe how these digital societies and their artificial people respond."

**Vervet Monkeys**  
Cheney and Seyfarth studied vervet monkeys and observed a dominant male in a group. One day, he saw a strange male nearby, who seemed interested in joining the group. If the stranger succeeded, the current male could lose his position. To keep the stranger away, the dominant male cleverly made an alarm call that vervet monkeys use to warn of a leopard. This scared the stranger back into the trees. He repeated this tactic whenever the stranger approached. However, the dominant male made a mistake. After using the alarm call several times, he called out while casually walking across the open ground, which could have revealed his trick.

**What Cats Catch**  
In a survey in the English village of Felmersham, residents recorded what their cats caught over a year. Seventy cats caught over 1,000 prey items. An American professor estimated that the cat population in Britain might kill 100 million birds and small mammals each year based on these numbers. However, this estimate is misleading. Most cats live in towns and catch fewer animals than those in the survey. The important question is whether these numbers are sustainable. The answer seems to be yes. In winter, many people feed birds, and gardens provide nesting sites, keeping bird populations above natural levels. The survey showed that while cats are significant predators, they are not destroying Britain's bird population.

**Buffalo's Day**  
Buffaloes are very important to the marshmen, who care for them deeply. Each morning, the buffaloes, after sleeping on platforms or near the fire with their owners, slowly leave for the reed beds beyond the water. They often groan about their tiredness before the leader finally steps forward and enters the water. Once in the water, they seem to forget their purpose and wallow there, making low sounds of complaint. Their movements away from the house are slow and almost unnoticed, but eventually, they swim, appearing to struggle to keep their noses above the water. They spend the day among the reeds, grazing on green shoots at their eye level.

**Picasso, Pablo**  
In 1940, Picasso painted several still lifes of fish while staying in the fishing port of Royan. One painting shows a fishmonger's slab with a crab and some soles. Despite being on the slab, the fish look alive. The painting is complex, with overlapping transparent shapes and delicate colors, creating a calm underwater scene. However, there is tension as the fish seem to be preparing for a fight with the crab. The sharp shapes in the painting, including a chain around one fish, add a sense of danger and hidden violence, giving the artwork a deeper meaning."
CPE_12,"**Text: Photography**

Over the last 150 years, photography has been used to capture many aspects of human life and activities. In this relatively short time, photography has improved its ability to record moments in time and space, allowing us to see both large and small details. It has given us images from faraway places, distant parts of the solar system, and the complex social issues of modern life. Photography has become one of the most important ways to express what it means to be human.

However, the idea of recording events visually has a much longer history. The earliest forms of visual recording date back to the Upper Paleolithic period, around 35,000 years ago. We cannot be sure why early cave paintings were created. They might have recorded actual hunting events, served as magic to help with hunting, acted as religious symbols, or simply brightened daily life. Nevertheless, visual images are deeply connected to human culture.

Throughout history, people have questioned how accurate visual images are and what role they play in society. The saying ""seeing is believing"" has given special importance to visual images. When photography was invented in the mid-1800s, it seemed to promise a truthful visual record. It was seen as the peak of Western visual representation, with the camera working like the human eye to create fixed images that closely resembled what we see. The chemical process used to fix images allowed for the capture of what we consider natural phenomena.

At the same time, photography was viewed as a sophisticated cultural achievement, producing images that artists had long tried to create through skill and practice. Ironically, because photography seemed so realistic, it was thought that everyone could easily understand photographs. This led to the idea that photography might be a ""universal language."" For instance, in 1933, photographer August Sander suggested that even the most isolated person could understand a photograph of the sky, whether it showed the sun, moon, or stars.

However, as global communication increased in the late twentieth century, we must consider how well photographic images can cross cultural boundaries. Is photography limited by cultural conventions like any other form of communication, such as language? Has our familiarity with photographs led us to overlook the complex ways they convey vivid impressions of reality? Photography is often seen as providing convincing evidence, making it seem transparent and blurring the line between our perception of the world and its photographic representations. It is common for someone to show a photograph and say, ""This is my grandson.""

Since its invention in 1839, photography and the attitudes towards it have changed significantly. This change may be partly due to photography moving into what we might call ""mythic time."" Its original role as a record-keeper has evolved, and photographs, once closely tied to the photographer and subject, have become historical documents. These images often reveal as much, if not more, about the people and society that created them than about the subjects themselves.

I aim to show that the camera is not just a silent recorder of events. Photography does not merely reflect culture; it can also inspire social and political change. For example, it is hard to imagine the cultural shifts of the Italian Renaissance in the fifteenth century without acknowledging how the development of perspective changed visual representation. Similarly, photography has played a significant role in shaping the media culture of our time, while also bringing the harsh realities of the world into our everyday lives."
CPE_26,"**How to Write Poetry**

Telling people how to write poetry can be tricky. While creativity is important, making one mistake can lead to confusion. I believe that for beginners, the best advice is to read a lot, write often, and let your imagination flow freely, as long as it doesn’t lead to chaos. Some people need a stable life to write poetry, while others find inspiration in their struggles. Some writers follow a schedule, while others wait for a moment of inspiration. All approaches are valid, as long as they don’t follow strict rules. The key is to find your own voice and nurture it, allowing it to grow until it can stand on its own.

**The Short Story**

In a short story, it’s important not to overcrowd it with too many characters or long descriptions. Flashbacks should be brief and only used when necessary to clarify a point. One effective way to include a flashback is through a character’s memory, which can help move the story forward at a critical moment, but it should not slow down the action. Dialogue is often more effective than lengthy explanations, as it can show different perspectives quickly and keep the reader engaged. Overwriting can ruin a short story, but being brief doesn’t mean it should feel incomplete. Both conflict and action need to be strong in a short story, but the challenge is to make every word count in a limited space.

**Screenplays**

Writing a screenplay is similar to playing chess. Most players make moves without knowing exactly what will happen next. They might see a few moves ahead, but often play without a clear plan. As players gain experience, they learn that chess is more about long-term strategy than short-term tactics. They start to see the game as a whole, recognizing patterns and strategies, such as openings and endgames. Similarly, the more you write screenplays, the more you understand their complexities.

**Looking at Writing**

Humans naturally learn to speak, as seen in young children, but writing is not instinctive. Charles Darwin noted that while language is a natural human ability, written language is not. All societies have language, and while languages evolve, they do not necessarily improve. Children learn to speak without formal lessons, and when they lack a common language, they create their own. In contrast, writing systems have been developed only a few times in history and often started as simple codes. Until recently, many children did not learn to read or write, and even today, some struggle with it. Children are naturally inclined to speak, but learning to write is a skill that requires effort and instruction. It is essential to understand how writing works and how to help children connect their thoughts with written language."
CPE_8,"Text: ""I have never started a novel with so much uncertainty. If I call it a novel, it is only because I don't know what else to call it. I have a small story to tell, and I do not end with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave my reader hanging. This book is about my memories of a man I only met occasionally, and I do not know much about what happened to him in between our meetings. I could invent details to make my story more complete, but I do not want to do that. I just want to share what I know. To protect the privacy of living people, I have given the characters in this story names I made up, and I have taken care to ensure that no one can recognize them. The man I am writing about is not famous, and he may never be. When his life ends, he might leave no more trace of his existence than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the water's surface. If my book is read, it will be for its own interest. However, it is possible that his way of life and the unique qualities of his character may influence others, so that long after he is gone, people may realize that a remarkable person lived in this time. Then it will be clear who I am writing about, and those who want to know a bit about his early life may find something useful in this book. I believe my book, despite its limitations, will be a helpful source of information for my friend's biographers. I do not claim that the conversations I recorded are exact. I never took notes during our talks, but I remember well what matters to me. Although I have put these conversations in my own words, I believe they accurately reflect what was said. I mentioned earlier that I have invented nothing, but I have taken the liberty that historians take to create dialogues for characters that I did not hear. I did this to make the scenes more lively and believable, as they would be less effective if told plainly. I want to be read, and I think I am justified in making my book engaging. A thoughtful reader will easily see where I have used this technique and can choose to ignore it. 

Another reason I feel nervous about this work is that the people I mainly discuss are from a different culture. It is hard to truly know people, and I believe one can only really know their own countrymen. People are shaped by many factors: the place they were born, the home they grew up in, the games they played, the food they ate, the schools they attended, the sports they followed, and the poets they read. All these experiences shape who they are, and you cannot understand them just by hearing about them; you must live them. You can only know them if you are one of them. Because you cannot fully understand people from a different nation except through observation, it is challenging to give them authenticity in a book. I have never tried to write about anyone but my own countrymen, and if I have done so in short stories, it is because those allow for a more general treatment of characters. You can give the reader broad hints and let them fill in the details. In this book, I do not claim that my characters see themselves as they truly are; they are viewed, like my main character, through my own perspective."""
CPE_4,"**POETRY RECITALS**

At any time in history, the world of literature can seem confusing to those experiencing it. However, later generations often find it easier to see clear patterns and important figures in literature. Currently, there is a complex mix of poetic styles, different types of poetry, and various opinions on how poetry should be presented, criticized, and taught. 

The main discussion in contemporary poetry is about the tension between serious 'literary' poets, who write poems meant to be read on the page, and 'popular' poets, who prefer to perform their work for an audience. This division is not strict. Over the last twenty years, public poetry readings have become more common in many forms. Small literary groups in towns hold readings in community centers or members' homes; schools and colleges invite poets to speak to students; and arts festivals often feature readings by well-known poets.

The impact of these events, where poets often have to perform in public, is varied and uncertain. For 'pop' poets, whose work is designed for live audiences, public performance is beneficial. Their poems are usually simple and can be understood easily in one hearing. However, when these poems are read on the page, their weaknesses in thought and technique may become apparent.

On the other hand, poets who are dedicated to their craft and aim to create deep and meaningful work may not be appreciated by audiences who are hearing their poems for the first time. The risk is that these poets might choose to read only their simplest work to connect quickly with the audience, which may not represent their best writing.

Attending poetry readings cannot replace reading poetry from a book, but it can be enjoyable and educational. Hearing skilled poets read their work, even if they are not great speakers, helps the audience understand the important parts of the poems. It is best if the audience has the text in front of them or knows the poems beforehand.

The main reason for popular poetry readings, which sometimes include music, is to help audiences enjoy poetry and see it as an art form for everyone, not just a select few."
CPE_30,"**Oral History**  
Historians increasingly use oral evidence, but this approach has challenges. It is overly simplistic to think that a person's testimony is a clear reflection of their past experiences. In an interview, both the historian and the informant influence each other. The historian chooses the informant and the topic of discussion. Even if the historian only listens, their presence can change the way the informant remembers and shares their past. The final account is shaped by the historian's social position and their understanding of history, which may also affect how the informant views their own experiences. Thus, historians must acknowledge their role in creating new evidence. The challenges continue even after the interview. The informant's memories are not direct connections to the past; they can be influenced by other sources, such as the media. Memories may also be colored by nostalgia or feelings of loss that developed later in life. While emotions can make the testimony seem convincing, they may reflect later experiences rather than the actual past.

**Animal Science**  
Animal science has two main approaches: physiological and whole animal. Physiologists focus on how the body functions, including how nerves, muscles, and senses work together to create complex behaviors. Those who study the whole animal look at the behavior of animals in their natural state and the factors that influence it. Within this approach, there are psychologists and ethologists. Psychologists often conduct experiments in labs with a limited number of species, like rats and pigeons. Ethologists study natural, unlearned behaviors of animals in the wild. Although these distinctions still exist, there is now a beneficial merging of the two fields. Physiologists often claim that their methods are more fundamental. However, understanding how nerve cells work does not eliminate the need to study behavior at a broader level. Behavior has its own structure and units that must be considered. Trying to explain a bird's nest-building behavior solely through nerve cell activity would be like trying to read a book with a powerful microscope.

**The Social Sciences**  
Students studying social sciences for the first time face a dual challenge. They need to learn both the content of their new subject and the methods used to study it. This means they must understand not only the knowledge and research findings in textbooks but also the methods used to gather and organize that knowledge. These two aspects are closely connected. While we all have experience with social life, social sciences go beyond common sense. Each discipline focuses on specific aspects of social life, uses particular research methods, and has its own concepts. These concepts form the logical foundation of the subject, allowing social scientists to move beyond everyday understanding and differentiate one discipline from another.

**Classical Architecture**  
In the classical world of Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building structures. According to the Roman architect Vitruvius, architecture involves order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, propriety, and distribution. He also provides Greek equivalents for some of these terms, likely based on earlier Greek sources that are now lost. While utility and function are not part of his initial definition, Vitruvius later discusses the best forms and arrangements for different types of buildings. At the outset, the focus is on aesthetics, viewing architecture as an art. The origins of classical architecture are complex, with a long history of simple structures in Greece and Italy that did not meet Vitruvius' artistic standards. Although these early structures may seem basic, they contributed essential elements that influenced later architectural concepts. Despite its elaborate appearance, the classical temple essentially resembles a simple, single-room hut."
CPE_7,"The two sisters kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for a while. She would drive around the gardens and the railway line, even jumping over a small bridge with all four wheels in the air, which was her only mistake. After that, they would pass the gasworks, which smelled of sulphur. Surprisingly, Chen found it funny that his wife was driving without him knowing. ""So you can really drive, Lily? Well done!"" he said. Mui thought it was strange that her brother-in-law was not upset. Instead, he was excited and made plans with Lily for a trip. They decided to go on a Monday at the start of next month, the quietest day of the week, leaving early in the morning and returning by midday to avoid losing customers. In the meantime, Lily would practice driving around the gardens. Despite her doubts, Mui bought a road map and got a ten percent discount, which impressed Chen, although Lily felt a bit insulted by Mui's lack of trust in her navigation skills.

Within an hour of leaving home, they were looking at the English Channel. Lily drove very well. Even Mui, who was in the back seat ready to give directions, had to admit this. On the road, Lily overtook a few slow cars with great skill, making Mui hold back her protests. Chen even applauded her. After passing the gasworks in the seaside town, they drove smoothly along the empty promenade. Lily parked in a small street off the seafront, where there were many empty spaces. She was unsure about the road signs and preferred to pay for parking rather than risk getting a ticket. 

Lily noticed her sister's worried face in the driving mirror and thought it best not to add to her worries. She locked all the van doors carefully. ""Don't worry,"" Chen joked. ""No one will want that old thing."" The sisters were offended. Lily accused Chen of being ungrateful, and Mui scolded him for being too quick to judge by appearances. Surprised, Chen took Man Kee ahead to look at the grey sea. He held his son on the railing, and Man Kee, a warm and responsive child, placed his tiny hand on his father's sleeve. In that moment, Chen decided to raise his son his way, giving him a good education in business, which was Chen's own weak point, so that he could own many restaurants one day.

The gloomy sea made Chen feel thoughtful as he planned Man Kee's future. He saw smoke on the horizon and then, sparkling in the morning sun, a ship appeared. Chen put a coin in a telescope and tried to find the ship. At first, he couldn't see it, but then he finally spotted it—a large, rusty tramp steamer. He lifted Man Kee to the telescope. ""Do you see the ship, Son?"" he asked gently. ""It’s a special ship for people like us. It may be small and old, but we know it will take us back home when we are done here. It will take you to your homeland, which you have never seen."" Chen kissed the top of Man Kee's head. Lily and Mui were behind them. Lily put her arm around Chen's shoulders. ""The little old ship,"" Chen said. ""Let your mother see, Son."" Man Kee didn't want to let go of the telescope, and when he finally did, the view was just a blurry circle of light. By the time Chen found another coin, the ship had disappeared over the horizon, leaving Lily with a view of seagulls flying over the water."
CPE_43,"**THE WELL**

I had read that if you dig a deep enough hole, you can see the stars on a clear day. I convinced you to help me with my idea. You watched, eyes wide, as I pulled up the well bucket, steadied it on the wall, and then climbed in. I asked you to lower me down. I didn’t think about how heavy the bucket would be or that you might not be strong enough to hold it. You held the handle, trying to help as I pushed the bucket off the edge. As soon as it was free, I fell. You screamed and tried to stop it, but then you let go. I fell into the well and hit my head. At that moment, I didn’t realize I had achieved part of my plan. I saw strange lights, like the stars I usually saw in cartoons when a character got hurt. At first, I was dazed, then scared, then relieved, and finally angry at you for letting me fall and worried about what Mother would say.

You called down to check if I was okay. I opened my mouth to shout, but then I heard panic in your voice, and I couldn’t speak. I lay still, just able to see you through my eyelashes. You disappeared, calling for help. I waited a moment, then climbed back up and pulled myself over the edge, landing on the courtyard stones. I heard alarmed voices coming from the castle’s main door. I ran the other way, down to the passage leading to the moat bridge, and hid in the shadows. Mother and Father appeared with you and old Arthur; Mother was screaming and waving her hands. Father shouted for Arthur to pull on the winch handle. You stood back, looking pale and shocked. I was hidden in the shadows, feeling a rush of excitement. Then I noticed the drops of water I had left from the well to where I stood. I looked in horror at the dark spots of dirty water on the dry stones. At my feet, the water had formed a small pool. I looked back into the courtyard, where Father was shining a flashlight down into the well. The drops sparkled in the sunlight. I couldn’t believe no one had seen them. Mother was now screaming loudly, a sound I had never heard before. It shook me deeply. What was I to do? I had gotten back at you, but now things were more serious than I expected. What started as a fun prank had quickly turned into something that would lead to serious punishment, likely for me. I regretted not thinking this through. 

Suddenly, a plan came to me. I gathered my courage and left my hiding place, staggering out and blinking. I called out softly, one hand on my forehead, then yelled louder when no one responded. I stumbled a bit further and then fell dramatically on the stones. Sitting up, comforted by my crying mother, I sighed and said, “Oh dear,” smiling bravely. I claimed that I had found a secret tunnel from the bottom of the well to the moat, and that I crawled and swam through it until I got out and climbed up the bridge. I thought I was almost getting away with it until Father squatted in front of me. He asked me to repeat my story. I hesitated. His eyes narrowed. Thinking I was filling in gaps, I said the secret passage had collapsed after me; there was no point in sending someone down to look for it. I insisted the well was dangerous and that I had barely escaped with my life. 

Looking into my father’s eyes felt like looking into a dark tunnel with no light at the end. It was as if he was seeing me for the first time, and I was seeing how the world looked from an adult’s perspective. My words got stuck in my throat. “Don’t be ridiculous, boy,” he said, with more contempt than I thought possible. He stood up and walked away. Arthur looked down at me, his expression sad and troubled. He seemed to want to shake his head, not because I had a scary adventure and was unfairly disbelieved by my father, but because he could see through my desperate lie. He worried about the character and future of a child who lied so easily. His pity felt like a harsh rebuke, even more painful than my father’s words. It made me realize that this was the mature judgment of my actions, and it affected me deeply."
CPE_51,"**Removal Day**

With her children now grown, Susan, who is a widow, faces the difficult task of leaving her family home. The van, labeled 'Removers of Distinction', was busy taking away everything that made the house special. Fred, the removal man, carefully packed fragile items with his large hands, while his team worked less gently. The house was beautiful, a four-story building overlooking a small harbor. Memories of her children growing up filled the air, like dust that stirs when disturbed. 

When they first bought the house, her son Robert, who was five at the time, had asked, ""Mum, how do you get a house home?"" It was easy to miss the little boy he once was, especially now that he was helping with the move, making sure Susan didn’t forget about the piano. Francesca, their daughter, was also there, insisting that only she could take care of the valuable Steinway piano.

Fred noticed Susan's calm demeanor and commented, ""She doesn’t look like she’s going to cry."" Susan was curious, asking, ""Do people cry?"" Fred replied, ""You’d be surprised. They seem happy while packing, but then they cry in an empty room. They’re fine once they reach the new place; it’s just hard to see everything taken apart.""

Susan could understand that feeling. If it were up to her, she would have warned the movers about the piano before they started. But Robert insisted it was the movers' responsibility to notice any issues. The piano stood alone in the best room of the house, and they planned to move it last.

Sitting on the bottom stair, with all the chairs gone, Susan remembered the day they moved in. Today felt like that day played in reverse—the piano had been the first item brought in, but it got stuck on the stairs. The removal team struggled for nearly two hours, while little Robert watched in fascination and Francesca cried, ""We can’t live in a house without a piano!"" They had to find a way to get it inside, and her late husband, Peter, had solved the problem. 

They left the piano outside while they moved in the other furniture. The next day, a builder removed the first-floor window, and a crane was borrowed to lift the piano through the opening. The children were overjoyed to see it finally inside. However, the process had cost a lot, and it took months before they could afford to have the piano tuned.

Peter had said, ""That’s there for ever."" But forever is a long time. The children became too busy to visit often, and Susan found it harder to move around the house. She thought about the stairs, remembering how the banister rails had never been perfectly fixed. She should have warned the movers about the piano, but it was too late now. 

Fred asked, ""Are you all right?"" as he reminded her that the piano was the last item to move. Susan felt panic rising. Robert and Francesca appeared in the hallway to watch. Fred casually asked, ""No tears then?"" Susan was close to crying. It was strange how moving items made them feel so important. 

Just then, the piano appeared at the top of the stairs, with Fred guiding it down. ""Easy does it!"" he called out as they carefully brought it down and placed it behind the van. Robert was the first to laugh, and soon they were all laughing together, relieved that it was over. As they walked down the path for the last time, the only tears Susan shed were tears of laughter."
CPE_11,"**Text: Online Literary Criticism for Everyone**

**Do-it-yourself literary criticism: Is it just harmless fun?**

From the beginning, one of the main ideas behind the Internet was to allow open access. In theory, anyone could publish their thoughts or share music online. However, in the early days, some technical skills were needed. Still, there was one area that truly became accessible to everyone: literary criticism. By visiting Amazon.com, the first popular online bookstore, anyone could try writing book reviews. 

Amazon's approach to book reviews was simple: anyone could share their opinion and give a book up to five stars. Each book had its own page, and when a reader wrote a review, it appeared automatically. This allowed Amazon to fill its site with free reviews, and potential buyers could see what other readers thought, rather than just relying on publisher descriptions or professional critics.

Other online bookstores, which also had physical stores, offered similar features. However, Amazon was the largest, controlling over 80% of the online market. This meant it had the most customers and received the most reviews, which sometimes led to problems. Thousands of reviews were submitted daily, and Amazon did not disclose the exact number, making it hard to check them all. A team of editors reviewed the site to ensure that the reviews followed the company's rules. For example, one-word reviews or personal attacks on authors were not allowed, nor were reviews that revealed the ending or referenced other reviews. However, since reviewers could remain anonymous, inappropriate reviews were only removed if Amazon's editors noticed them. This created opportunities for mischief. 

For instance, authors could write positive reviews for their own books. One author, Lev Grossman, was upset by the negative reviews of his first novel, so he wrote several anonymous positive reviews to balance things out. His trick worked until he wrote an article admitting to it, and then the fake reviews were removed. Authors could also comment on their books by clicking a link that said, ""I am the Author, and I wish to comment on my book."" Most authors used this feature to encourage readers to buy and enjoy their books. Some even shared their email addresses for direct communication. However, while Amazon checked these comments, it did not verify that they were from the actual authors, except for well-known writers. 

In one case, a lesser-known writer pretended to be famous author John Updike in a comment, claiming to be an ""over-hyped middlebrow author."" Unsurprisingly, this was identified as a fake and removed. The real drama began with reader reviews, not author comments. When James McElroy's book, *We've Got Spirit*, about a small-town cheerleading team, was published, it received good reviews from the mainstream press. However, many people mentioned in the book felt hurt, and they used Amazon to express their anger through negative reviews. These reviews, however, disappeared after a few days. 

Despite this, Amazon saw the large number of people writing and reading reviews as beneficial for business. Reviews were meant to be a ""forum to talk about a book,"" not a chat room, so Amazon paid special attention to bestselling books to ensure that all reviews followed the rules. This meant that silly reviews were more likely to appear on pages for less popular books. For example, *The Story about Ping*, a classic children's book about a duck, inspired humorous reviews because ""ping"" is also a term used in Internet technology. One long review even compared the book's plot to Internet architecture, claiming it provided a ""good high-level overview"" of networking concepts. 

However, such silliness was rare. Most reviewers on Amazon took their contributions seriously, and overall, the reviews gave a good indication of whether a product was worth buying. The writer George Orwell once said that reviewing too many books required inventing feelings about books that one did not actually have. This makes the democratization of the review process a positive development."
CPE_14,"**Text: Art in Modern Times**

In recent years, especially over the last two hundred years, we often think that every artist must challenge the art of their time. Art is celebrated for being unique, revolutionary, and sometimes shocking. We enjoy admiring artists whose work was not valued in the past. However, when it comes to contemporary art, we often hesitate and claim that some artists have gone too far, suggesting that their work is no longer art. The media often reflects this sentiment, and we tend to agree because we expect to be confused by the constant change in art. This expectation makes us overlook the traditional themes and techniques that still exist in modern art. We want artists to be different from us, with special talents that break the rules. In the past, people commissioned artists for specific purposes, and art was part of everyday life. Today, we leave artists to work independently and sometimes become frustrated if they try to connect with us.

**Picture This**

I will describe a situation and then ask an important question about it. An artist selects a piece of text from an art book that discusses the variety of pictures. The text asks, ""What are they all about?"" and concludes, ""There is no end to the different kinds of pictures."" This language may seem childish, but stay with me. The artist then asks someone to prepare a canvas and take it to a sign painter. He instructs the sign painter to write the chosen text on the canvas in simple black letters without any decoration. The sign painter follows these instructions. My important question is: is the final product a painting?

**Underground Encounters**

At the Mercury Gallery in London until June 26, there is an unspoken rule in the art world: once an artist finds success in a particular style, they should stick to it. Collectors expect artists to continue producing similar work, and if they try something new, it is often met with disappointment. I am not sure why this is the case. Gallery owners prefer to take safe risks, and perhaps art buyers feel more secure with familiar styles. However, some artists break this pattern and succeed, like Picasso and Hockney. Eric Rimmington is another artist who is trying something different. His new exhibition replaces the still lifes that made him famous with paintings inspired by the London Underground. Rimmington finds a unique charm in railways. His sketches from the 1980s of King's Cross Station led him to explore the underground world. This has resulted in ""Underground Encounters,"" an exhibition of 40 paintings and drawings that capture the fascinating atmosphere of this hidden world.

**Extract from a Novel**

I have come to this island with a few books. I use the word ""escape"" because the villagers jokingly say that only a sick person would choose such a remote place to recover. So, I have come here to heal myself. Besides an old peasant who comes daily on her mule to clean, I am quite alone. I feel neither happy nor sad; I am suspended in a mix of memories. I mentioned the uselessness of art but did not speak about its comforts. The true comfort of my work lies in the fact that, in the silence of a painter or writer, reality can be reshaped and revealed in a meaningful way. Our everyday actions often hide the deeper meaning of life. For artists, there is joy in using art to confront what has hurt us in life, not to escape from it, but to fulfill our true potential through imagination. Otherwise, why should we cause each other pain?"
CPE_63,"**Family Business**

""Listen, this isn't good!"" said my Dad. We were driving back to London. My father, along with my brother Maurice, had just picked me up from the fancy girls' school I attended. He had also just been to Parent's Day, where I received the Latin prize and the award for the best results in my final exams. After a long talk with my headteacher, we were now heading home for the holidays.

""What isn't?"" I asked, although I had a feeling I knew what he was thinking because he was unusually quiet. Normally, he talked a lot. ""You can't fool me. You'll do what you want now,"" he said. ""With all those certificates, I heard you might get a scholarship to Oxford."" 

""So?"" I replied, trying to act tough. ""Couldn’t that be useful?"" 

""I also heard,"" he continued, and I knew a serious conversation was coming, ""that you want to be a barrister. A barrister!"" My father knew a lot about lawyers and the law. 

""I just mentioned that,"" I said. ""I couldn't think of anything else!"" 

""And apparently,"" he went on, ""you have the right personality. You can quickly understand complex information, you’re good at speaking, and you enjoy performing."" 

""I’m not sure about that,"" I said. ""All I know is what I see on TV."" 

""Regardless,"" he said, gathering himself, ""I feel like your heart isn’t in the family business anymore. You’ll go to Oxford, and after that, I doubt you’ll want to join us."" 

The truth was, like many children in family businesses, I felt trapped by my father's expectations. I saw many career options and wanted to explore them. At the same time, I didn’t want to upset my father. I wasn’t as scared of him as Maurice was—I was the favorite—but I still found him intimidating. 

""It’s too early to tell,"" I said weakly. 

""I’m telling you, you won’t want to join us,"" my father said, who often turned out to be right about these things. ""It’s a shame because you have the talent—the intelligence, the courage, the vision."" 

""There’s still Maurice,"" I said, feeling down. My father scoffed. We both knew Maurice disliked the business. 

""Anyway,"" I continued, ""you could always use me as a consultant."" My mother had passed away when I was young, and my father had raised me and Maurice. I was two years older than Maurice, and since he was motherless, I had taken care of him from an early age. It wasn’t a burden; I loved him. 

Because the business was successful, we lived comfortably—in a large house in London, attended good schools, wore nice clothes, and enjoyed parties, theaters, and operas. My father knew many interesting people—politicians, actors, and businesspeople—and our home was always lively with great conversations. 

""I have an idea,"" my father said. ""You can help us during the holidays until you leave Oxford, and then if you decide not to join us, you can. It will give you some pocket money and really help me."" 

""Okay,"" I said, relieved to avoid making immediate choices and especially to avoid the sadness my father would feel if I disagreed with him. This was how he controlled us. 

So, it happened. In my last term at school and during university breaks, I helped out, never more than twice a year and always with the easier tasks. I became one of the top students, had a small house, a nice car, designer clothes, and a black dress from Paris that I planned to wear for my final exams. 

In my last term, my father visited me and took me to a village for a meal and a chat. With only a few weeks left, my tutor predicted I would earn a First Class degree in Law. I knew that if I focused and organized my thoughts, he might be right. I felt ready and confident. 

But then my father told me that he needed me to do one last important task for the family business, the biggest project they had ever attempted, and he promised it would be worth my while. 

""But Dad,"" I protested, ""I have my final exams coming up, and I need to focus on that. It’s really important that I do well, and I don’t want to think about anything else right now."" 

I could tell my father didn’t understand the pressure I was under (or maybe he was jealous of my life away from him), and he would see my refusal as a betrayal. As he explained the task, I realized more than ever how determined he was—the clarity and skill with which he approached his work, his energy, and his self-control. In his own way, he was a genius, and I respected that in him. It made my own dreams seem less significant. 

""Fine,"" I said. ""I’ll do it."""
CPE_56,"Simon Costello realized that buying the house in Pembroke Square was a mistake within a year of moving in with Lois. Owning a home that requires strict budgeting is often not worth it. At first, it seemed like a smart and desirable choice. He had been winning cases regularly, and Lois had returned to her job at the advertising agency shortly after their twins were born, receiving a salary increase to thirty-five thousand. Lois strongly advocated for the move, and Simon did not resist her arguments, which seemed convincing at the time: their flat was not suitable for a family, they needed more space, a garden, and separate accommodation for an au pair. They could have found these in a suburb or a less trendy part of London, but Lois wanted more than just extra space. Mornington Mansions was not a suitable address for a rising barrister and a successful businesswoman. Even saying the name made her feel it lowered her social and economic status.

Lois decided that one of them should use public transport to save money, and it was clear that Simon would be the one to do so since her office was on the other side of London. The crowded tube ride became a frustrating thirty minutes of resentment and reflection on their problems. He often thought of his grandfather's house in Hampstead, where he had spent time as a boy, remembering the smell of dinner and his grandmother's care for the tired breadwinner returning from work. She had been a supportive lawyer's wife, active in legal causes and content with her role. But that world was gone. Lois had made it clear before they married that her career was just as important as his. This was a modern marriage, and both of their jobs were crucial for their lifestyle, which relied on two incomes.

Now, their fragile situation could be threatened by Venetia, who had come to their office in a furious mood. Something had clearly upset her. The word ""upset"" felt too mild for the intense anger she directed at Simon. He regretted not leaving his room earlier; if he had, their confrontation might not have happened, and she could have had time to think things over. He remembered her angry accusations clearly. She had defended Brian Cartwright that day, who claimed that when Simon was his lawyer four years ago, he knew about jury bribing and did nothing. Simon denied it instinctively, but his response felt unconvincing even to him. He felt guilty, recalling the fear of punishment from his school days. Looking into Venetia's eyes, he saw her disbelief.

He wished he had said, ""Cartwright told me after the trial, but I didn't believe him then, and I don't believe him now. He will say anything to make himself look important."" Instead, he had told a more dangerous lie, and she recognized it. But why was she so angry? What did his past actions have to do with her? Who appointed Venetia as the moral judge of their legal practice? Was her own conscience so clear? Did she have the right to ruin his career? He was uncertain about what she could do, but if this rumor spread, it would be disastrous for him."
CPE_36,"I chose this place to live because I thought I would be anonymous among people who didn’t mind if their rented homes were falling apart or if their gardens were messy. However, I was wrong. The shopkeepers, who are living their real lives, soon start to recognize me. The beautiful roses from next door remind me that gardens were once cared for. Usually, I stay inside to forget about the summer outside, but tonight, I am watching the swifts flying between the trees and roofs. I have trimmed the rosemary and lemon balm to make space for a chair, and my arms are stinging from scratches. It is a small London garden where plants must grow tall or spread out to survive.

“Been doing some clearing, I see,” says my upstairs neighbor, Jaz, leaning out of her window. She has written several unpublished manuscripts, and I sometimes have to pretend to know about them as an English teacher. I have her latest manuscript with me now. “How’s the work going, Jaz?” I ask. “For goodness sake! In no other job do people have to explain themselves so many times a day,” she replies, her voice trailing off before she continues, “I have something to drink in the fridge. I’ll bring it down.” I don’t want Jaz in the garden, and I realize it looks messy and sad. The only way to access the garden is through my flat, and Jaz is knocking on my door. 

“So, you’re on holiday now, you lucky person,” she says as she sits in the chair while I drop a cushion onto what used to be a small lawn. “Cheers,” she says, acting young. “I should have become a teacher—writers don’t have holidays. But you know what they say, those who can, do, and those who can’t, teach.” And then there are those who can do neither. “So, what are your plans for the holidays?” All my worries about the end of the school year come rushing back. Empty days. Hot sidewalks covered in melting gum. The walk to the shops and back. The little park with its fountain, and loneliness sitting beside me on the bench. “Actually, I’m going to Stonebridge tomorrow. I need to ask if you could feed the cats.” My heart races as I say this. “Of course I will,” Jaz replies, knowing she will be around. “Where will you stay? Some fancy bed and breakfast?” “No, I’ll be staying with my oldest friend, Ruby, at the Rising Sun. We’ve known each other since we were eight.” This isn’t true, but I often deal with fiction.

“Going back to your roots. So, what do you think of my work so far?” My silence makes Jaz ask about her manuscript, The Cruelty of Red Vans, which is only half-read on my desk. I like the title and tell her so. I can see how red vans could be cruel, always bringing gifts to other houses and delivering rejected manuscripts to hers. Something makes me speak honestly for once. “Let me give you a little tip,” I say. “What?” she asks, looking offended. “Try writing about nice people for a change, people who want to be good: a little less self-centeredness, a bit more fiction…” “Teachers!” Jaz responds like a rebellious student about to take back a poorly graded paper. “I keep a journal, and I write down something good, no matter how small, about each day.” My words sound as old-fashioned as my dress. “Keep a journal! Nice people! Get a life, Ann.” Oh, I have a life. I have my work, and I go out sometimes, reading on the tube. When we finally go inside, my calm kitchen gives me a moment of comfort, but suddenly I remember my school geography teacher, Miss Tarrantine, who must have been my age now, closing one eye in a strange wink as she said, “I’ve had my moments.” We nearly died laughing."
CPE_6,"**Heritage**

Heritage is important because it connects people and communities to their past. We often feel linked to our personal heritage, knowing about our grandparents and hearing stories about their lives. However, there is also a broader need to understand our history to help us make sense of our individual and national futures. Heritage represents a desire for continuity; knowing about the past can give us confidence about the future. Just as we inherit our genes, we also inherit a culture passed down through generations. There may be parts of our national heritage that we do not like, but it is still a part of us, and it can be comforting to feel connected to something larger. Heritage teaches us a lot and is essential for our well-being, influencing everything from traditions to material culture. Traditionally, we learned about our past through stories and legends from our ancestors. However, in modern Western society, many of these oral traditions have been lost due to the breakdown of communities and families. Now, we often rely on places and buildings to remind us of our history. It is crucial to preserve and restore these connections as a tribute to our ancestors' identities.

**The Fens**

Some time ago, I started writing a novel called *Waterland*, where the landscape of a region in England known as the Fens became very important. After the book was published, people often asked why I, a Londoner with no personal ties to the area, chose to write about it. The simple answer is that I found the Fens interesting because they seemed plain and empty, providing a blank canvas for my story. However, I soon realized that the Fens are not flat or empty at all. They are uniquely English yet also strangely captivating. It is surprising that there is still a part of England that many people find foreign, especially since many other distinct areas have become part of the national culture. The Fens are both empty and full, cultivated yet wild, seemingly simple but deeply mysterious. My own research while writing was not extensive; I have not yet visited places like Wisbech or Prickwillow. As a fiction writer, I prefer to create imagined worlds rather than seek strict evidence. However, trying to ""imagine"" the Fens has its own logic, as shown in Edward Storey's scholarly work, which suggests that the Fens are not just a landscape but also a state of mind.

**Museums**

Museums need to make their collections easy to access. In the past, this meant simply putting items in display cases with long labels that were hard for the average person to understand. Today, accessibility should involve more than that. Displays can be engaging and use creative techniques to attract visitors and evoke emotions. However, museums should be about more than just displays; they should reach out to the widest community possible. For example, some museums provide loan boxes of objects for teachers, and recently, this idea has expanded to include materials for elderly people experiencing memory loss. Museums focus on real artefacts and specimens, not replicas. They exist to provide an authentic experience, showcasing items that have historical significance. This authenticity is what sets them apart from heritage centers, theme parks, books, and CD-ROMs. Museums that embrace this challenge and offer exciting, accessible displays and outreach programs will find that their competitors in ""virtual history"" can actually help create a desire for the real experiences that only museums can provide.

**Architecture and Environment**

The desire to preserve things is not new, but changes in our towns happen so quickly and on such a large scale that they affect most of us. This rapid change can make some people very focused on preservation, while it encourages others to think more deeply about the nature of our towns today and their future. It can be argued that people who have lived through significant events, like world wars, are more inclined to value preservation than previous generations, as anything that represents stability becomes important. If there is a psychological need for preservation, it is important for planners to consider it. Change is not necessarily bad if we learn how to manage it. Physical changes in our towns reflect social changes, including shifts in population, welfare, and demands."
CPE_33,"**Text: Einstein**

If you stop anyone on the street and ask them to name a scientist, they will likely say Albert Einstein. His image is often used to promote products that suggest intelligence, like computers and encyclopedias. Most people know little about Einstein's work, except that he created complex theories called 'relativity', which are famous for being hard to understand and for making strange predictions that seem to go against common sense. Einstein was part of a major shift in scientific thought, a revolution that marked the beginning of modern science in the twentieth century. Physicists and mathematicians were trying to develop a new, more logical way to describe the universe by examining the relationships between matter and natural forces. Einstein made significant contributions by rethinking the basics: time, space, matter, and energy. Earlier theories were based on Isaac Newton's idea of a universe where stars and planets moved in a fixed space and time. Einstein changed this idea, arguing that time and space are not fixed but relative.

**Young Readers**

As children, Lydia and I often distrusted any book that won awards because we thought it would be 'worthy', which we interpreted as 'boring'. Our mother disapproved of our attitude, while our father would give us small coins as rewards for reading better books. He sometimes included a few good books in our Christmas and birthday gifts, marked clearly with 'This Book is NOT Literature'. Although we often dismissed his choices as 'boys' books', he did introduce us to some shorter works of good fiction and, once, to a famous collection of poetry.

**Language**

Jacob Grimm wrote in 1851, ""The origin of human language is truly secret and marvellous."" This mystery has led to many unusual ideas. For example, Charles Caller suggested in 1928 that early humans made sounds like ""meuh"" when they sensed danger. This sound is quite sad. The early human who traveled through dangerous lands filled with frightening animals might have made desperate sounds, and some words have kept a trace of this, like 'malaria', which means ""fever"", or the Latin word 'mors', which means ""death"". Many people avoided discussing the origin of language, thinking it was a topic for odd theories, but recently, the study of how language began and evolved has become very important. Language likely started in East Africa about 100,000 years ago. Initially, speech was mainly used for friendly communication and was a key tool in struggles for power. Sharing information was probably not the main purpose of early language, which goes against the ideas of philosopher John Locke, who described language as a 'great conduit' for sharing knowledge."
CPE_20,"**Text: Writing Reviews**

Frank Kermode discusses the art of writing reviews from a practical perspective. Most reviews are created and shared in ways that limit their lifespan. They often have strict deadlines and length restrictions, and once published, they are only relevant for a short time—usually a day, a week, or at most a month. The temporary nature of reviews often affects how they are viewed, both by the public and by the writers themselves. Many believe that reviewing is a task people only do for financial reasons, or because they cannot spend all their time on a novel or serious book.

However, writing reviews is a skilled and complex task. Writing a concise review of six to eight hundred words for a newspaper is different from crafting a detailed review of six to eight thousand words for an international journal. The fifteen hundred words allowed in weekly magazines present challenges from both short and long formats. Reviewers must consider their audience, which can range from casual readers to those deeply interested in the subject.

Additionally, a reviewer needs to have knowledge about various topics and must write in a way that is clear and enjoyable for intelligent readers. It is common for reviewers to also write other types of work. For example, American novelist John Updike, who is not fond of criticism, still engages in some reviewing while writing his novels. He collects all his reviews, no matter how brief, into books with modest titles.

Some might think that less prominent writers should accept the temporary nature of their reviews, but it is understandable if they wish to have a lasting record of their work, especially if they feel their best writing is hidden in reviews. I share this sentiment about my own writing. My main work has been academic, and my serious books are typically academic in nature, which is what professors are expected to produce.

In the English-speaking world, there is no strict separation between reviewing and literary study, unlike in some other cultures. It is common for the same individuals to engage in both activities. The past criticism of academic reviewers for showing off or wasting time has decreased, as there is now more reviewing available, allowing many people to participate. Additionally, the financial rewards for reviewers are often minimal.

I believe this situation benefits both readers and professors. Readers can trust that reviewers have some expertise, and professors can maintain their sanity through this work. It also serves as a reminder for professors to communicate clearly with non-professors. While they may use complex language among themselves, they need to ensure they are understood by a broader audience.

Ultimately, despite its value, reviewing is often a secondary occupation. It is something that can only be done well if one is also engaged in another primary activity."
CPE_40,"Ralph unlocked the door to his apartment and, as he stepped into the dark, quiet hallway, he felt a brief sense of ownership that still surprised him after three years. When he first bought the flat, he would come home excited and curious, wondering what had happened while he was away. The flat felt like a welcoming space where he could focus without distractions. He thought he should worry about possible intruders or broken pipes, but his flat always seemed to wait for him, either looking independent or neglected, depending on how tidy he had left it.

Over time, he began to see it as an extension of himself, a place where his thoughts and feelings spilled out. He grew frustrated with its inability to change. There were always a few letters piled up by the door and the answering machine blinking with messages when he returned. He was thankful that his windows were intact and that nothing had been stolen, but he often wondered what the flat would look like if something had happened.

From his dull office on the third floor, Ralph looked forward to his quiet evenings at home. After leaving the busy office, he felt a sense of himself returning during his bus ride, but he still struggled with the need for solitude, which he often miscalculated in social situations. At his desk, he longed for isolation and time alone with his belongings, but once he escaped, he felt drained and waited in vain for a sense of identity to return. Instead, he faced a deep emptiness, making him suspect that the unfulfilling work had changed him, moving him away from who he thought he was.

He would often read or listen to music as night fell, but he began to question for whom or what he was doing these things. His sense of direction had faded, and thoughts would come and go without finding a connection. He remembered a time when he felt more in control, when he might have recognized his own worth and escaped his situation. However, he had been so eager to find something that he followed the first opportunity that came his way, as if it was meant to be.

After university, he tried to create a plan for a better life, but he was not surprised to find that his true ambition was simply to survive. He applied for jobs he had heard about from friends, attaching himself to their futures while struggling to believe he could find a role that would also bring him happiness. He attended one interview with gratitude, not thinking to evaluate the job itself—a vague editorial position at a local free newspaper. After a pleasant conversation with Neil, his boss, he was relieved and did not consider the long-term implications of the job. Neil offered him the position on the spot, telling him he was the only graduate who had applied, which Ralph took as a compliment at the time."
CPE_45,"**Goat Racing**

I was about to see goat racing on Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. I pushed my way through ice-cream vans, large crowds, food stalls, and loud music. Although everyone was moving towards the racecourse, I tried to find a good spot to watch. An area was blocked off to create a course for the goats. It wasn’t as fancy as regular racecourses, but the idea was similar: spectators lined both sides of a stretch of ground where the goats would run. Keeping a few selected goats in line was not easy, especially since goats are known for eating almost anything they find.

**Canoe Trip**

As the day ended, I began to worry about the night ahead. The canoe was too wet to sleep in, there were no places to stop, and we hadn’t seen any villages or huts since early morning. In the dim moonlight, we could barely see the cliffs. Our torch batteries were dying, so we replaced them, but the new ones didn’t work. Clearly, we wouldn’t find a camping spot. A few miles later, Lesley shouted that she saw a distant flickering light, and we felt hopeful. However, the light was just the moon reflecting on the waves. Soon, we heard the loud sound of rushing water, but we couldn’t see what was happening. Time seemed to stop as we continued on.

**How to be Presentation Perfect**

I am not naturally good at making presentations, but as managing director, I often need to present to my colleagues and major shareholders. How can I improve my presentation skills and confidence? You are not alone. Giving a presentation requires different skills than running a company, but many senior executives are expected to be good at it. To convince your audience, you must first believe in what you are saying. Show your belief through the passion and enthusiasm you bring to your presentation. This means you need to prepare well. Test your ideas in advance and ask colleagues to help identify the tough questions your audience might ask. You should also create a positive atmosphere from the beginning. Start with something everyone can relate to and gradually lead to the conclusion you want to reach."
CPE_64,"**Simplified Text:**

Some activities cannot be rushed; they take the time they need. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you are impatient with mayonnaise and add the oil too quickly, it will spoil. If you pull on a tangled fishing line in frustration, the knot will only get tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some functions happen very quickly, while others take seconds, minutes, hours, days, or even years. We can speed up some tasks, like solving crossword puzzles or doing math, but others cannot be rushed. If we try to hurry them, they may fail, just like the mayonnaise or the fishing line.

The idea of ""Think fast; we need results"" can sometimes be as unhelpful as trying to shorten a night's sleep. We learn, think, and understand in various ways, and these ways work at different speeds and are suitable for different tasks. There are three main processing speeds of the mind. 

The first is faster than thought. Some situations require an immediate reaction. For example, when my motorbike skidded on a wet road, my body and brain quickly coordinated movements to keep me safe, and only afterward did my conscious mind catch up. A concert pianist or an Olympic fencer also does not have time to think about their next move. This quick response can be called our ""wits.""

The second speed involves actual thinking. This is when we analyze situations, weigh options, and solve problems. A mechanic figuring out why an engine won’t start, a scientist interpreting an experiment, or a student working on an assignment are all using this logical thinking, often referred to as ""intellect."" People who excel at these tasks are often called ""bright"" or ""clever.""

The third speed is slower and less direct. It is more relaxed and can be playful or dreamy. In this mode, we reflect or meditate. For instance, sitting on a rock by the sea, listening to the waves, or being on the edge of sleep puts us in a different mental state than when we are planning a meal or writing a letter. This slower way of thinking is just as valuable as the faster ones. Allowing our minds to wander is essential, especially when life gets busy. We need both the ""tortoise mind"" and the ""hare brain.""

Some everyday problems are better solved with a slow mind. Certain mysteries can only be understood with a relaxed attitude. Recent studies show that patient, less deliberate thinking is especially good for complex or unclear situations. Deliberate thinking works well for straightforward problems. For example, deciding where to go on holiday may have clear options. But when we are unsure about what to consider or which questions to ask, we need the tortoise mind. 

If the issue is how to manage a difficult team at work or whether to change careers, it may be wiser to sit and think rather than rush for answers. This type of intelligence is linked to creativity and wisdom. Poets have long understood the limits of conscious thinking and have tried to develop these slower ways of knowing. Philosophers have discussed the parts of the mind that go beyond conscious thought. Recently, scientists have begun to study these slower, less deliberate ways of knowing. The field of cognitive science is showing that the unconscious mind can successfully handle many complex tasks if given enough time. It can recognize patterns that our conscious mind might miss, understand complicated situations, and solve difficult problems more effectively than our active thinking."
CPE_29,"**Text: Surviving in a Foreign Land**

I have been welcomed warmly. This place is a friendly and well-equipped base camp in a very isolated area. At any time, there are about forty people here—scientists, students, weather experts, and satellite trackers—forming a close community where everyone helps each other. My basic French is just enough to communicate, but not to have casual conversations. I miss the subtle meanings in conversations, and my phrasebook is not helpful during breakfast. While this is not a practical problem, I initially struggled with my self-confidence. I found myself feeling anxious about mealtimes. I would hesitate, unsure of which table to choose, and I felt nervous when I spoke, recalling the anxiety I felt during my first weeks of school. I still smile awkwardly or feel panicked when people talk to me. I think this occasional sadness comes not from missing company or communication, but from losing the social confidence that my ability to speak well has always given me.

**Elliot**

When I first met Elliot, I was just a young author, and he did not pay much attention to me. However, he always remembered faces. When I saw him occasionally, he would shake my hand politely but did not seem interested in getting to know me better. If I saw him at the opera with someone important, he would often ignore me. Then, I had a surprising success as a playwright, and I noticed that Elliot started to look at me more warmly. One day, he sent me a note inviting me to lunch, and I thought he was testing me. After that, as my success brought me many new friends, I began to see him more often.

**Alfred Hitchcock**

The film director Alfred Hitchcock always claimed that he did not care about the story of his films or the acting, but he did care about the visuals and the sound. For Hitchcock, it was not a message or a great performance that moved the audience; he believed that people respond to the pure experience of film, regardless of their cultural background. Therefore, if a film is made well in terms of emotional impact, the audience in Japan should react the same way as the audience in India. Hitchcock was always precise and rational in his self-assessment. He was a man of reason and a brilliant craftsman who enjoyed hearing the audience react. He did not focus on speculation or complex ideas, and his view of his characters was straightforward. He concentrated on film itself and the clear, measurable beauty of what film can do to an audience."
CPE_57,"**Amateur Astronomy**

Astronomy has changed a lot in the last fifty years. Until about thirty years ago, there were not many charts and catalogues available. Telescopes were limited, and there were few practical astronomy books. Today, there is a wide variety of telescopes and equipment available for everyone. Electronic calculators and computers have transformed how we create almanacs and charts, analyze observations, and publish results. This could be seen as the golden age of amateur astronomy. However, some things have been lost. Now, you might have to travel 80 kilometers to find a dark sky, unlike the skies in urban areas fifty years ago. Daytime skies are often filled with airplane trails that can last for hours and spread out, making it hard to observe the sun and stars at night.

**Too Much Choice**

Society is facing a problem of ""overchoice."" There are too many options and opportunities available. In today’s economy, the desire for new products and services has become an addiction, and technology speeds up this change. New products appear quickly, and just as one is released, another is on the way. This constant change can be overwhelming and tiring, leading to a feeling of disconnection from life. While choice is celebrated in the new economy, having more choices can lead to more stress, less time, and greater complexity. As a result, people are looking for ""simplexity""—the simple things that bring meaning to our complicated lives. However, simplifying life is challenging in a time of excess. There are more basic brands of products than we could ever need, along with countless software updates and plans that are hard to keep track of.

**McAndrews Hotel**

Every summer, my family spends two weeks at McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. This tradition started with my grandmother and has become very important to us. Nothing can disrupt this ritual. We are a specific type of guest at McAndrews: perhaps old-fashioned or even snobbish. I dislike the rudeness of shop assistants, which some people see as equality today. I also dislike overly friendly waiters who seem to struggle to keep their hands to themselves. I know the names of many other guests, as they have been coming here since childhood like me. However, I appreciate that when I see them in the hotel, we only exchange polite greetings, allowing for personal space and dignity, which is rare in today’s commercial world."
CPE_9,"**Text: Othello**

The move of a remarkable production of Shakespeare's play Othello from Stratford to London gives me a chance to correct an unfair review I wrote when the show first opened last spring. At that time, I criticized Ray Fearon for being too young for the title role and I was wrong to downplay his acting. I still believe that changing the age difference between Othello and Desdemona distorts the tragedy, but I take back my negative comments about Mr. Fearon's outstanding performance. The entire cast is excellent. Memorable scenes include the one where Cassio's competitive games with other young officers become dangerously intense, and the moment when Iago starts to lose control and struggles to regain it. I challenge anyone not to be moved to tears during the scene where Emilia helps Desdemona prepare for bed. The pace and tension throughout the play are fantastic. Do not miss this production.

**Lake Vostok**

In the center of Antarctica, there is complete stillness. On the edges of the continent, there are many penguins, seals, and birds. However, in the vast white interior, life does not exist. Except for a large hidden body of freshwater called Lake Vostok, which lies beneath nearly 4 kilometers of ice, directly under the coldest place on Earth. The water has been cut off from air and sunlight for up to 25 million years. Biologists are eager to explore its mysterious depths and find out what unusual organisms may be there. Geologists and glaciologists are also very interested. For two years, researchers around the world have been planning ways to uncover the lake's secrets, and if they succeed, we will soon enter the decade of Lake Vostok.

**Scientists**

Last week, I heard something interesting on the radio. A group of scientists is debating what motivates them to be scientists; the phrase ""because it's there"" comes to mind. We all know it is the long-standing quest for knowledge, the wish to understand everything from atoms to black holes. But these scientists want to know why we have this desire for knowledge in the first place and why science cannot explain this desire. I believe it is more important to determine whether what we scientists are doing is right, rather than getting caught up in discussions about the purpose of it all. I think the key issue is not why we pursue science, but to understand that science is a tool, and we should decide how, where, when, and why to use it."

**Food**  
Our relationship with food is very basic and fulfilling. Many people who enjoy cooking buy cookbooks like this one, but often we think that unless it’s a special occasion or a complicated dish, it’s not worth making. This is not true. By simply adding some chopped carrots, a leek, celery, and herbs to water, you can create a delicious soup. This is much more satisfying than buying a pre-made one. Instead of purchasing a sweet chocolate mousse filled with preservatives, you can quickly make a tasty dessert that both adults and children will enjoy. Cooking is also a way to show care and love by sharing your own creation, no matter how simple. Sharing food symbolizes our basic human needs, which is why we celebrate events like birthdays and anniversaries around tables. No one would choose to have takeout for a wedding or anniversary party, nor would many want to discuss a business deal over canned soup.

**In the Elevator**  
This morning, Alistair tried to tidy up his office, but papers were still everywhere. Tax forms were overflowing from drawers and boxes, waiting for a day when he felt like organizing them. He also had a lot of paperwork from owning an apartment building. The many books and journals were close to the new bookshelves. As the elevator took him to his floor, he knew Mallory would arrive on time for their meeting. She would knock on his office door exactly on the hour. She was very punctual and neat. How would she react to the mess? She might think someone had broken in. He could walk in behind her and pretend to be shocked. Mrs. Wilson, his cleaning lady, had come while he was trying to clear some space on the floor. When he peeked out of his office as she was unlocking his apartment, he smiled at her, hoping for a good response. But her expression was cold. She seemed to think there was no way she would go in there, as she disappeared into her own space, which she was responsible for. He knew Mrs. Wilson saw him as someone from another world, not from her familiar Brooklyn streets.

**KAREN**  
Karen had a simple wish: not to be like her mother. This desire led her to create her own story, a story of difference and strength. In her tale, there were important moments, like when she was twelve and her brother accidentally hit her in the eye with a golf club. At that moment, she thought she would go blind. But the bone protected her, as the doctor later confirmed. The club had missed her eye, and she only needed a few stitches that healed into a reminder of her past pain. When she opened her eyes in the doctor’s office, she saw her mother, who was predictably talking about miracles and small blessings. In that moment, she realized she was saved for a reason.

**Miss Fogerty**  
Miss Fogerty was both excited and sad as she walked briskly across the wet grass of the village green. It was thrilling to be the first to learn something important, especially in a small community where her life was usually quiet. However, she felt deep sorrow for Dr. Bailey’s condition. He had been her doctor for many years, and she appreciated his care during her frequent laryngitis episodes, which were her only health issues. Miss Fogerty valued his ability to make patients feel like there was always enough time to talk about their worries. This quality made him very beloved in the village. He was always willing to share his time, knowledge, and humor, and in return, he received great loyalty and affection from the community."
CPE_59,"**Joanna's Lessons**

Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist. So, why has she decided to write books for young children learning the piano? Even someone who cannot hear music well would be moved by her performances. Watching her play the piano, especially when she performs complex pieces, is impressive. However, during a recent concert for children, one small boy surprised her. After watching her play various styles of music, he asked, ""Can you play Match of the Day?"" This request made Joanna laugh. She realized that, in his eyes, she had to play that piece to prove she was a real pianist. Of course, she played it and enjoyed the moment.

Joanna is unique among top concert pianists because she cares about how young children learn to play. She has just published her own beginner piano book for children called *Joanna MacGregor's Piano World*, despite her busy schedule. This summer, she is performing at many festivals and collaborating with young composers and artists. She also runs her own recording label, Sound Circus, and loves to suggest new projects whenever she meets other artists.

So, why take on the extra work of writing a book? Joanna explains that the first lessons in music are very important. Many music teachers focus on talented children, but she believes that most people's interest in music is more ordinary. She finds this everyday interest much more fascinating. 

In writing her first three books, Joanna draws on her own experiences. From ages 18 to 25, before she became a concert pianist, she taught many beginners. Growing up, she was surrounded by children of all backgrounds who wanted to play different types of music. She believes that everyone should have the chance to learn the piano, just like learning to swim or speaking a little French. Some children learn quickly, while others take their time and may give up. This can happen at any stage. Some find the beginning too hard, while others feel pressured to perform like the talented children they see on television.

Joanna worries that some parents use music, like sports, to push their children to achieve rather than to enjoy it. She thinks that children often quit because they feel they cannot meet their parents' expectations. When asked if she thinks existing piano books are not good enough, she is careful not to criticize others. She acknowledges that her colorful books are not the only ones designed to make learning enjoyable. 

To engage young beginners, she includes stories in her books and CDs. The challenge is to make learning fun. From the first lesson, there are accompaniments in different styles for teachers or parents to play along with the child. For those whose parents do not play the piano, the accompaniments are available on the CDs. Joanna insists that learning should be fun. She encourages children to improvise and explore the piano freely.

As children progress, they need to learn to read music instead of just playing by ear. Joanna understands this struggle because she relied on her ear when she was young. However, she believes that practice is the most important factor in learning. She knows it can be hard to motivate children to play a piece multiple times. Joanna admits that she did not practice seriously until she attended the Royal Academy of Music, where she developed a challenging repertoire that required dedication. Now, she enjoys practicing and considers it the most important part of her musical life, even more than performing.

Joanna empathizes with those who find practice difficult. She believes that people do not talk about this enough. The key to practice, whether for twenty minutes or five hours, is to have a clear goal. Other tips include rewarding yourself by playing through a piece, even if there are mistakes, and mixing difficult pieces with easier ones."
CPE_54,"**Text: Writing by Hand and on Screen**

Dr. Johnson believed that ""what is written without effort is usually read without pleasure."" This means that good writing often requires hard work. When I look back at my handwritten school essays, I notice they had very few corrections. Today, I would rewrite them many times. I think this is because writing by hand was physically challenging. The slow pace of writing helped me think carefully. When using a computer, it is easy to be careless. Many writers find that the time spent fixing mistakes in digital drafts is about the same as the time spent on handwritten work. 

Also, emails, unlike handwritten letters, often lack emotional depth. However, they have revived the art of the love letter, with millions of these messages now being sent, replacing casual conversations. At least these emails are written in a form of English and grammar. But words on a screen can feel dull. Writers may not fully understand the impact of their words and often exaggerate their meaning. Words typed quickly can lack the care and personality of handwriting.

**The CD Experience**

I put down my cup and looked at the CD. The case was disappointing, but the shiny disc inside looked interesting. ""Wonderful little things, aren't they?"" Mr. Warriston said as he entered the room. I agreed, carefully handing the disc to him. ""It's amazing they can fit seventy minutes of music on these,"" he continued, turning on the hi-fi. Lights lit up, and he pressed a button to open a small drawer. He placed the disc inside, pressed the button again, and the drawer closed. ""Some people say they sound sterile, but I think they..."" 

""Do you have to turn them over, like records?"" I asked. 

""What? No,"" Mr. Warriston replied, surprised. ""You only play one side."" 

""Why?"" I asked. He looked puzzled and then thoughtful. ""You know, I have no idea. I don't see why you couldn't make both sides playable and double the capacity..."" He stared at the machine. ""You could have two lasers, or just turn it over by hand... hmm."" He smiled at me. ""Yes, good point."" He gestured to my wooden chair. ""Anyway, come on, let's get you sitting in the best spot for the stereo effect, okay?"" I smiled, happy to have asked a technical question that Mr. Warriston couldn't answer.

**Books vs. Electronic Text**

Malcolm Bradbury made a good point when he said that if matches had been invented after cigarette lighters, we would have admired the improvement. Many people claim that electronic text is as significant as the invention of printing and that it is almost complete. However, they overlook the fact that changes in how we think take generations. This thinking is often egocentric, believing that our generation is at a crucial moment in history. 

For example, a book from 1979 predicted that ""the 1980s will see the book as we know it begin to fade away."" So far, this has not happened. Reading long texts on a screen is often frustrating, so most people avoid it. Additionally, the way information is organized on computers encourages people to skim rather than read deeply. Some advocates of technology argue that this leads to new forms of storytelling. However, non-linear reading is not new; many books, like religious texts and poetry collections, have never been read from start to finish. What is different now is that computers do not encourage the deep thinking that comes from reading a complete text.

**The Office**

Charles walked into the office and saw a perfectly organized space. The carpet was clear of papers, and the dark wooden desk looked just as he remembered from the Sotheby's auction five weeks ago. Neat file holders were being placed in their drawers, and twelve years of trade journals filled one wall's shelves. Kathleen struggled to close the filing cabinet and then turned to him. ""You have to use computers, Charles. This is just too much."" 

""Hello, Kathleen. Oh, this is amazing,"" he said, admiring the room's antique furniture. He was not thinking about computers or any mechanical devices, not even a pencil sharpener. ""Simply amazing,"" he said, avoiding the topic of computers. Over the two years he had known her, they had discussed this many times. She could never understand why he resisted technology, especially since he was skilled with computers and had published an important paper on computer-related talent. She had inspired that paper. Through the keyboard, she could manipulate any software and create something new that could ""sit up and bark at the moon"" if she wanted."
CPE_32,"Text: ""You don’t take sugar, do you?"" shouted his secretary, not really asking but stating a fact, as she had been making Lancelot coffee for many months. She often forgot details like this because he usually wasn’t supposed to be there. However, he had started coming to work all the time, realizing that staying away only caused more problems. He thought about how he had gone from being a respected advisor, meeting authors and playwrights over lunch, to being overwhelmed with tasks and struggling to find parking in the mornings.

""This came,"" she yelled, waving a manila folder before placing it in front of him. ""From that guy in Los Angeles. You wanted to see it."" A label on the folder read: ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert,"" and below it, ""An Expanded Synopsis."" Lancelot felt uneasy about the word ""synopsis."" He preferred to see a label that said ""A First Draft."" He had already seen a synopsis of this book and didn’t want to see another one, even if it was revised. Ian Cuthbert had received a large advance for this book when Lancelot had bought the company. Ian was one of several old friends Lancelot had mistakenly commissioned books from. Ian was a clear example of how someone with a difficult personality often becomes even harder to manage when given a chance.

Lancelot skipped the introduction he had read many times and looked at the synopsis. He recognized almost every phrase. He closed the folder and pushed it aside. Clearly, at this rate, Ian's manuscript would never arrive. The synopsis lacked the brilliance Ian was known for, and beneath its playful tone, it felt empty of real ideas. Lancelot remembered stories about a famous author whose last book was published incomplete after his death, written chapter by chapter for payment. In that case, the payments were small parts of an advance that had never been given. Ian had received a huge advance, which went against the usual business rule that authors must deliver a manuscript to get paid later.

Lancelot, who studied modern languages at Oxford, recalled when Ian Cuthbert was seen as a promising talent in a Cambridge full of potential. Ian's peers aimed to take over British theatre, and they succeeded quickly. But Ian seemed lazy compared to them. He wore his overcoat like a cape and spoke about a famous French writer as if he had been there. Yet, for some reason, Ian's creative talent remained hidden. While less talented people succeeded, Ian withdrew further. At the peak of his influence, he was already known to be difficult to work with. Officially appointed to edit a major arts magazine, he was like a general stuck on the beach with too many resources but no results. The magazine used up the budget for many issues without being published. Similarly, his renewed contract with a fashion magazine led to stories about his high salary, which was increased in hopes of getting him to produce more, and then even more to get him to produce anything at all.

At editorial meetings, where there were always famous photographers present, Ian would criticize others' ideas harshly. Ten years later, he could hardly be counted on to show up for his own funeral. Lancelot was beginning to accept that ""A World History of the Short"" had been a mistake from the start."
CPE_65,"**Text: England's Breakfast Revolution**

Health experts agree that a good breakfast is very important. However, in history, breakfast is a relatively new concept in England. There are few mentions of breakfast in medieval literature. Some travelers did eat a meal at dawn before long journeys, and sick people sometimes had breakfast for health reasons, but most people did not eat breakfast unless they were kings or nobles.

In the sixteenth century, breakfast started to become common for everyone, not just the wealthy. Some writers believe this change happened because food became more available. However, they may not have considered other important social changes. For instance, new work patterns meant that more people had jobs with set hours, often starting very early in the morning. As a result, eating a meal in the morning became necessary and was no longer just for the rich."
CPE_61,"**Photography**  
When a photographer takes a picture, they choose visual information based on their technical skills, personal views, and experiences, as well as social and cultural norms. Throughout this book, we will explore how these factors influence the style, content, and expression of a photograph, and how viewers perceive and react to these images. For instance, a casual newspaper reader may have an implicit understanding of the photographs printed on the page. However, instead of accepting the photograph as it is, we might ask whether it truly represents the scene as it appeared at that moment. Alternatively, does it express the photographer's perspective? Is the exact moment captured particularly significant, or should the photograph be seen as a symbol representing a situation in the world?

**More than a Game**  
For me, sport has always been more than just a game. The most successful athletes have complete self-belief. To succeed in sports, you need to focus intensely and set aside everything else. The world of sports is tough, and no one will do the hard work for you. It’s a matter of survival. Sport has taught me discipline and determination, but it also shows the value of teamwork. My sport allows me to excel individually, yet it is still a team effort, and I must balance both aspects. This is similar to life – you can achieve as an individual, but you must remember the people around you. Sport has given me a lot, not just financially. It has opened doors and broadened my perspective, allowing me to see things around the world that many will never experience. However, you also have to sacrifice a lot for these rewards.

**Tuning In**  
Some experiences are so vivid that they create clear memories. For me, such a moment happened one night in California many years ago when I lay awake, listening to the beautiful song of a mockingbird from an unseen spot in one of the tall trees in the neighborhood. I don’t have insomnia; it was the bird’s exquisite singing that kept me awake. As I listened to its complex melodies, I found myself in an unexpected artistic experience. To appreciate the bird's patterns, I drew on my knowledge of jazz and Indian classical music. The bird made me feel as if I was enjoying an incredible improvisational performance. I reacted with groans and cheers as one surprising musical variation followed another through the open window until I finally fell asleep."

""People have always had strong feelings about birds, whether it's love, fear, or admiration. But what does this reveal about us? Paul Evans explores this idea. 

In a greenhouse, a little brown bird, a wren, is bumping against the glass. This bird is often seen as a symbol of important messages or omens. Is it trying to tell me something from a world beyond my understanding, or is it just a bird trapped inside? Depending on how you look at it, both ideas could be valid. 

Wrens have been part of British culture for a long time. In medieval times, people believed that the direction in which wrens flew could predict their luck. Today, images of wrens can still be found in many British homes. Although some old beliefs may have faded, the wren still holds a special place in our hearts. A place without wrens feels empty and lacking. 

This connection to birds is rooted in folklore, which dates back to when people were more connected to nature for survival. As people relied on the natural world, they developed a way to communicate the importance of other creatures. However, cultural changes can alter how we view these animals. 

Take the red kite, for example. In the early 1500s, visitors to London were amazed to see red kites swooping down to take food from children. These birds were appreciated as helpful scavengers. But soon, they were seen as pests and nearly disappeared from most areas, except for Wales. Over time, red kites became symbols of conservation efforts in Britain, and they are now protected and reintroduced to help them thrive again. 

Our relationship with birds goes back to our early human history. The first birdwatchers likely paid close attention to birds because they signaled danger, bad weather, or food sources. Birds also connected them to their dreams. When we wonder why birds matter to us, we are also exploring what it means to be human. The ability to fly, sing, and be free captivates us and reflects our own identity in relation to nature. 

Some may think these feelings are outdated, remnants of our past. But like certain body parts that we no longer need, these feelings are still part of us, and losing them would be painful. This is likely why birds have become symbols of environmental change, serving as indicators of ecological health. In Britain, conservationists highlight the endangerment of 30 bird species, which is troubling not only because we are losing these unique creatures but also because it represents a significant cultural loss. 

Birds carry deep cultural meanings. For instance, the skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing represent spiritual love, romantic love, and magic. Anyone familiar with the poetry of Shelley, Shakespeare, or Robert Graves will feel a sense of loss for these once-common birds. However, the disappearance of other birds that are not part of literature or folklore often goes unnoticed. 

Folklore is vital. The stories and legends that endure over time create a stronger connection to their subjects than scientific terms do. This connection evokes feelings and attitudes that are often hidden beneath the complexities of modern life. Whether we watch wildlife documentaries or observe birds in our gardens, the joy we experience cannot be fully explained by science. Birds engage us in ways that are difficult to understand or express, and the stories we share about them help us interpret their messages. 

The wren in the greenhouse creates a link between the present and a distant past, holding onto its song and moving into the future—a mystery that keeps me intrigued."""
CPE_28,"**Text: Maps**

The purpose of a map is to visually show the relationships between points and features on the Earth's surface. These relationships are based on distance and direction. In ancient times, distance was often described in terms of time, such as ""a few hours' walk"" or ""a day's journey by river."" These descriptions provided more information about how easy it was to travel through local areas rather than the actual distance. Direction was also important, but for most travelers, the main questions were ""Where do I go from here?"" and ""How far away is it?"" Therefore, precise direction was not always crucial. For a long time, written directions were as popular as maps. Even today, some maps, like those showing train routes, do not always represent true directions. 

Landmarks along a route were initially marked by signs, which could be realistic or symbolic, and their size indicated their importance. The conventions used in maps varied based on their purpose and location, so understanding these conventions is essential when studying early maps. The history of map-making, or cartography, is mainly about improving the accuracy of distance and direction and expanding the content of maps. 

To achieve this, cartography has incorporated knowledge from other sciences. For instance, instead of determining direction by observing shadows or stars, people began using the magnetic compass and developed tools to measure angles accurately. The application of astronomy and exploration helped map the known world. Astronomers later discovered that the Earth is not a perfect sphere but slightly flattened at the poles, leading to further improvements in mapping large areas.

Over time, the needs of map users changed. Travelers and merchants were no longer the only users of maps. Soldiers, especially after the introduction of artillery, required accurate representations of the land's features. This need led to the invention of contour lines. Other users, like archaeologists, historians, and modern geographers, also had specific requirements. To meet these needs, today’s cartographers have developed methods to map various distributions, such as geological layers and land use.

The current recognition of the map's value in many scientific fields has sparked a modern revival of cartography. However, it is important to note that the development of cartography has not been a smooth process. There have been times of decline or stagnation, interrupted by periods of rapid progress, where old ideas coexisted with new ones. Cartographers have often understood the theoretical basis for improvement but had to wait for better tools to implement their ideas. Since copying old maps is the easiest way to create new ones, and because map publishers have sometimes resisted change, maps should not be accepted blindly as evidence of current knowledge and techniques.

The many thousands of maps we have today are the result of significant human effort and thought. They provide an invaluable record for those studying human history. This aspect makes the study of historical cartography both fascinating and educational."
CPE_35,"**Simplified Text:**

I was taken into a young man's living room, which was a calm and cultured space surrounded by a messy collection of rooms where the less ambitious family members lived. Moving from the kitchen to his room felt like going from economy to business class. This young man, Andrew Lloyd Webber, had the largest collection of records I had ever seen, the first stereo record player I had encountered, and he had even bought Georgian wine glasses, pictures, and furniture. He had received a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford, to study history, and he had nine months before starting, during which he wanted to become England's version of the composer Richard Rodgers. My own dreams were just as unrealistic; I wanted to be a pop star for the usual reasons: women, money, and fame. However, my dreams were not as crucial to me as Andrew's were to him. When Andrew suggested that I try to become a famous lyricist like Oscar Hammerstein, I was open to the idea. This was partly because, within ten minutes of meeting him, he played me three of his own tunes, and I could tell he was very talented. As he played selections from the many shows he had created at school, I was reminded of the best show albums from my parents' collection. He needed a new lyricist, and I had little to offer him except praise for his music and a single I had written with an unknown pop group that had not done well. We agreed to meet again and write something together. I was still more interested in pop music than in musical theatre, but I realized I had met someone with rare talent and determination, and I would be foolish to miss the chance to work with him. Even if we did not succeed in becoming top composers, we could try to compete with the Beatles and Rolling Stones later in the summer. 

The next day, back at my desk in the office where I was training to be a lawyer, the excitement I had felt about a life in show business with Andrew had faded a bit. I would still look for ads in Melody Maker for groups needing a singer and write more simple songs, but it was likely that I would finish my exams and become a respectable lawyer by twenty-five. My father believed I would outgrow pop music by twenty-one, which worried me because that meant I only had a few months left to enjoy it. However, I felt I had nothing to lose by seeing Andrew again. It would be fun to go to a musical with him and write lyrics for musicals instead of pop songs. Andrew was an interesting person who talked about good food and Victorian architecture and supported the Leyton Orient football team. I was not sure about the musical idea he had been working on for a year, but in 1965, I was rarely sure about anything. His talent was clear, and he claimed to have many contacts. I soon found myself back in his living room. The idea was about Dr. Thomas Barnardo, a nineteenth-century philanthropist who started orphanages. His story was important, but it did not excite me. The hero seemed too perfect in Andrew's version, and the idea felt unoriginal, too similar to Lionel Bart's hit show, Oliver. However, Andrew's strong belief in his music was contagious and somewhat justified. What did I know about musicals? As David Land, who would later be my agent for over twenty-five years, often said, if there is a demand for one hamburger place, there is room for two. We could be the second hamburger place. I began working with great enthusiasm, especially on the funny songs. Andrew explained the plot, played me the tunes, and often gave me the titles, many of which had likely been thought up by his school friend. I even skipped a day at the law office, pretending to be sick, to write my first set of theatrical lyrics. I did not realize it then, but I had changed my career."
CPE_5,"**Text:**

**Language**  
You and I are part of a species with a unique ability: we can influence each other's thoughts with great accuracy. Language is so deeply connected to human life that it is hard to imagine living without it. If you see two or more people together anywhere in the world, they will likely start talking to each other. When there is no one to talk to, people often speak to themselves, their pets, or even their plants. I like to think of language as an 'instinct.' This means that people know how to communicate in a way similar to how spiders know how to spin webs. Web-spinning was not created by a brilliant spider and does not require special education or skills in building.

**Climate and Weather**  
Climate and weather, which are mainly influenced by the air around us, greatly impact the lives and locations of animals and plants. Climate can strongly shape the appearance of landscapes. For instance, warm and wet conditions throughout the year allow tropical jungles to thrive, which are rich in diverse species. In contrast, cold and windy areas can only support a limited variety of life. The daily weather patterns that contribute to the overall climate are caused by large air masses rising and mixing, as the atmosphere is always in motion. Some of this movement is due to the fact that the layer of gases sits on a spinning planet. Because air is light, it does not move at the same speed as the Earth and tends to lag behind. However, a more significant cause of air movement is the sun.

**Coffee**  
As a bar-person, my job included serving drinks, but more importantly, I was responsible for making coffee. In Lygon Street, Melbourne, a restaurant's success can depend on its coffee quality. I underwent several days of intense training in coffee-making, learning more than I ever wanted to know about cleaning and maintaining the restaurant's shiny espresso machine. I also learned the key principles for making the perfect rich, frothy cappuccino. By the end of the first week, I realized that making a good cup of coffee was not as simple as it seemed, and I feared I would be sent back to cleaning ashtrays. Fortunately, my boss was patient. ""Making coffee is both an art and a science,"" he said, ""and you need time to develop the skill."""
CPE_41,"**Text: Art on TV**

Why does television often struggle with programs about visual arts? Painting and sculpture are perfect for the camera, which can show an entire artwork and zoom in on details. However, there are few TV series that truly capture the joy and complexity of viewing art. A clear example of this issue is Robert Hughes's eight-part series on American art, titled *American Visions*. Hughes is a respected critic with a strong presence, and he has nearly eight hours to introduce British viewers to an art movement that is often overlooked in British galleries. I expected the series to highlight great artworks, but instead, it focused on how American history and culture are reflected in its art and architecture.

**Dealing in Metals**

For 20 years, I worked as an international metals dealer and gained a reputation as a speculator. The metals market is less regulated than others. With some luck, a willingness to take risks, and a good understanding of the market, it is possible to earn a lot of money. Risk-taking is essential in this industry, which fits well with a free-market global economy. However, free-trade economists who believed that the market would keep the prices of scarce metals stable have discovered the opposite is true. More minerals are being extracted, and the cost of raw materials is falling. When considering inflation, the prices of most metals are now about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to investigate claims against a multinational company that benefits from these low-cost raw materials.

Abaco and its offshore cays are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas, stretching from Florida to Cuba. Each island has its own character and attractions. To explore the islands and cays of Abaco, a boat is essential. If a boat is not included with your accommodation, don’t worry. There are many ferries and water taxis available. You can also rent boats if you prefer to explore on your own. Sailing is the most popular way to get around here. Abaco is known as 'The Sailing Capital of the World' for good reason. The calm, protected waters are also perfect for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The cays and their beaches stretch for 200 miles like a string of pearls. At night, the lights of the restaurants and cafes in Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay shine brightly."
CPE_69,"**Text: Build Your Own Bamboo Bike at the UK’s First Workshop**

Join a course at the Bamboo Bike Club, led by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan, where you can create your own custom bike frame and enjoy a fun weekend of bike-building. It’s Saturday morning in Hackney Wick, east London, and the Bamboo Bike Club is busy with activity. This is the only place in Britain where you can learn to build bamboo bikes.

Bamboo is becoming a popular material for bike construction. Companies like Calfee Design from California and Bamboo Bikes from Yorkshire have brought back this method, which dates back to 1894. However, many cyclists find ready-made bamboo frames too expensive, costing around $2,995 or £1,868. This high price motivated James and Ian to spend years working in a shed in Brecon, Wales, to create a more affordable bamboo bike business. They wanted to share the joy of making something unique and sustainable, rather than just selling bike frames.

Now, the Bamboo Bike Club offers monthly courses at a reasonable price, which includes a computer-designed custom bike frame and a fun weekend of building. As someone who struggles with DIY projects, I was curious about the quality of the bikes. On the first day, James and Ian teach us how to choose strong bamboo and create sturdy joints. We start by assembling the front triangle with 40 mm diameter bamboo, followed by the thinner seat and chain assembly. Alloy tubes are added for parts that need extra strength, like the handlebars and wheel forks.

James and Ian are very supportive, helping us with every cut and joint. Many participants are engineers, but Ian assures everyone that mistakes are normal. If you mess up, just try again with a new piece of bamboo. Each bamboo length is checked for quality, allowing us to choose the look of our frames: plain bamboo, black, or mottled.

On Sunday, we focus on building the lugs, which are the joints of the bike. We wrap them with hemp bindings and glue them with epoxy resin to create a strong bond. After adding a waterproof coating, the bike is ready for wheels, brakes, gears, and personal touches. James and Ian claim that their bamboo bikes are just as strong as metal ones. Ian has been riding his bike for over a year, and James has tested his bike off-road for three months without breaking it.

While bamboo bikes may not look as polished as professional ones, they are unique. I believe that bikes made from bamboo should be enjoyed for leisurely rides rather than racing. I choose a 'Classic English' frame for a comfortable ride. When I test James’s bike, I find it light, stiff, and smooth, thanks to bamboo’s ability to absorb vibrations.

James says, “Some people love the building process, but for me, the real joy comes when the bike is on the road. They are so light and fun to ride.” And the best part? The price is less than £500."

**Self-Help Books**  
Diane Reverend was an editor at Random House in New York when she first saw a manuscript by an unknown psychologist, Dr. John Gray. ""I knew it would be a bestseller,"" she says, and she was right. Dr. Gray is now very wealthy, and Diane has her own company. Dr. Gray's book about improving communication between men and women has become a symbol of a growing self-help industry that claims to meet many American desires for self-improvement. This industry also creates new desires and supports the New York publishing world. In Britain, people are discovering that this genre can produce many books that are questionable in quality, but there are even worse examples. For every self-help book published, thousands are rejected for being too similar or too specific. This is a good thing. As new editors search for the next big hit, the quality of writing is often overlooked. What matters most is how marketable the book is. ""How promotable is the author? What's the 'hook'? Is it universal enough?"" Diane lists the important questions, then admits, ""If someone comes to me with a catchy title, that's a big part of the success.""

**Autobiographies**  
There should be an understanding between an autobiographer and the reader that the truth is being shared. However, this understanding is often not fully respected. Writers may choose to leave out certain actions or thoughts because they feel ashamed or think they are not important. There are also more complex reasons for breaking this understanding. An autobiographer might believe that telling a more interesting story, even if it is not entirely true, serves the purpose of revealing the truth about themselves better than sticking strictly to the facts. Alternatively, they may decide from the start not to follow this understanding. They might label their book an autobiography to gain the reader's trust, which can help them tell their story, even if it is mostly fictional. This can happen without any intention to deceive.

**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**  
Scholars of detective stories say that this genre reflects the conflicts of society in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The detective story often symbolizes deeper human desires like lust or greed, and its resolution represents the return of order to society. In Hammett's stories, society is shown to be corrupt and false. The detective and the criminal are two sides of the same character. The detective understands the criminal and feels a strange connection with them. He is seen as too honest by criminals and too shady by the law. The detective's mission is influenced by his awareness of this duality, which can either soften his approach or make him more eager to punish.

**Science Writing**  
Stephen Jay Gould is considered one of the best scientific essayists today. To discuss his writing, I met him at the Grand Hotel while he was promoting his new book. Neither of us felt comfortable in such a fancy place. Gould said he couldn't write well in such an environment because understanding the culture is essential for a successful writer. Science is its own world, and only those who are part of it can effectively communicate it. If you don't understand the community and its rules, you will struggle. One of Gould's key beliefs is to never talk down to the reader. ""Make no concessions,"" he advises. ""You can simplify the language, but never change the core argument. If readers feel patronized, your writing will fail."""
CPE_17,"**Air-conditioning**  
At Cannons Gym, a popular spot for City of London workers during lunch, the air is quite cold. To cope with this summer's high temperatures, the gym has used a lot of air-conditioning. At times when it is not busy, the gym feels very cold, almost like the Arctic. This shows how we often misuse air-conditioning in today's world. It has become a common part of our lives, symbolizing our ability to control the climate. However, many buildings with air-conditioning could use other cooling methods. They could use natural light and ventilation, and have thicker walls that keep heat out during the day and release it at night. These ideas may seem simple, but they can be very effective and would greatly reduce the need for air-conditioning.

**Sundials**  
It is interesting that as we enter a new millennium, there is a growing interest in sundials, which are tools that measure time based on the sun's position. A hundred years ago, sundials were essential for keeping accurate time. As clocks and watches improved, sundials became less important and were seen mainly as garden decorations. Now, they are being appreciated again. David Harber, a maker of sundials, believes their charm comes from their connection to the planets. He says there is a special moment when a sundial starts to work after he delivers it. They are calm and beautiful objects that remind us of our place in the universe.

**Paint Your Own China**  
My idea of china-painting came from a visit to an arts and crafts exhibition long ago, where serious-looking older women showed how to paint delicate flowers on teacups with skillful brushstrokes. It was fascinating to watch, as each stroke created a perfect petal or leaf. Their hands were steady, and the paint never smudged. I thought these women must have practiced for years or had a special talent. With this in mind, I wondered what kind of people would join a china-painting class. Would beginners have a natural talent? However, the atmosphere in the class was very welcoming. Everyone was there to enjoy themselves, and even the teacher did not want to paint with the same speed and precision I had seen before."
CPE_47,"**Text: The Wrong Country**

Uncle chose a package holiday for Keith and Dawne at a good price: a flight from Gatwick Airport, twelve nights in Venice, the beautiful city, at the Pensione Concordia. When they went to the travel agency to book, the clerk told them that the other travelers were a school group from the south coast, all learning Italian. However, something went wrong. Either at the travel agency, the check-in desk, or in a computer, a small mistake happened. Dawne and Keith ended up in a hotel called the Edelweiss, in Room 212, somewhere in Switzerland.

At Gatwick, they gave their tickets to a girl in a yellow-and-red uniform. She checked their tickets and said everything was fine. An hour later, they were surprised to hear older people on the plane speaking with accents from the North of England. Keith thought there might have been a cancellation or that the Italian class was on another plane. They ordered drinks, and then more drinks. 

When they landed, a stout woman with glasses said, ""The coach will take us on. Stay together now."" There was no mention of an overnight stop in the brochure, but when the coach arrived at its destination, Keith realized that this was clearly an unexpected stop. It was close to midnight, and tired from traveling, they did not question the beds they were offered. However, the next morning, when they learned they would be staying there for their holiday, they became worried.

""We have the lake and the water birds,"" the receptionist explained with a smile. ""And we can take the steamer to Interlaken."" 

Keith calmly told the man, ""There has been a mistake. We were supposed to be in Venice, at the Pensione Concordia."" 

""I do not know that name, sir. This is Switzerland,"" the receptionist replied. 

""A coach is supposed to take us on. An official said so on the plane,"" Keith insisted. 

""Your group is booked for twelve nights at the Edelweiss Hotel. If you have changed your minds—"" 

""We haven't changed our minds. There has been a mistake,"" Keith repeated. The receptionist shook his head, saying he did not know about any mistake. 

Dawne then said, ""The man who made the booking was bald, with glasses and a moustache."" She mentioned the name of the travel agency in London. 

""Is there a problem?"" a woman said cheerfully to Keith. She was the stout woman he had seen at Gatwick. 

""My name is Franks,"" she said. ""I'm married to the man with the bad leg."" 

""Are you in charge, Mrs. Franks?"" Dawne asked. ""We are in the wrong hotel."" 

Again, Dawne described the bald clerk and the travel agency. Keith interrupted, ""It seems we got into the wrong group. We reported to the Your-Kind-of-Holiday girl and left it to her."" 

""We should have known when they weren't from Dover,"" Dawne added, mentioning that they heard the older people talking about Darlington. 

Keith was impatient and wished she would let him speak. ""We noticed you at Gatwick,"" he said. ""We knew you were in charge."" 

""I counted you, although you probably didn't see me,"" Mrs. Franks replied. ""Let me explain. Your-Kind-of-Holiday sends clients to many places, with different holidays at different prices. There are villa holidays for adventurous people under thirty-five, and treks to Turkey and the Himalayas."" 

""What I am trying to say is that all tickets and labels look similar, yellow with two red bands,"" Mrs. Franks laughed. ""If you just followed others with the yellow-and-red label, you might think you could end up anywhere!"" 

""But we are not supposed to be in Switzerland,"" Keith insisted. 

""Let’s see,"" Mrs. Franks said unexpectedly, and then she walked away, leaving them standing there. The receptionist was no longer at the desk, and they could hear typing. 

""She seems quite nice,"" Dawne whispered. Keith was not listening. He tried to remember everything that had happened: giving the tickets to the girl, waiting, and then the girl leading them to the plane. 

""Nice to have some young people along,"" an elderly man said, interrupting Keith's thoughts. ""Nottage is the name."" His wife was with him, and they both looked very old. She said they had the best sleep they had in years, thanks to the lakeside air. 

""That's nice,"" Dawne replied. Keith walked out of the reception area, and Dawne followed him. Outside the hotel, they did not mention the irony of their situation. On their first holiday since their honeymoon, they found themselves in a package tour with elderly people, when the whole point of the holiday was to escape the demands of the elderly. Uncle had said so himself when they tried to persuade him to join them."
CPE_48,"**Text: 'HE WAS A PEOPLE PERSON'**

American business leaders are looking to the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a model for good management. Eluned Price reports.

Most people in Britain know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and have a general idea of his achievements. However, America has only recently discovered him. The Wall Street Journal described Shackleton as ""an Antarctic explorer whose feats went largely unnoticed for most of the 20th century,"" which is an exaggeration. Now, Americans are enthusiastically learning about him. Biographies and stories about the voyage of the Endurance are being published quickly, and the American Museum of Natural History is organizing a major exhibition. Columbia Tristar is also making a film about Shackleton's life.

Some American managers have adopted Shackleton as a role model. They share stories of his actions with admiration and draw lessons in leadership and communication from his experiences. They even refer to each other as ""speaking Shackleton."" Shackleton, known for his determination and resourcefulness, has become a symbol for modern management consultants.

Jim MacGregor, the managing partner of Abernathy MacGregor Frank in New York, has looked up to Shackleton for years. His firm focuses on communication during mergers, acquisitions, and corporate crises. For example, they handle situations like ""this firm's plant exploded"" or ""half the workforce must be laid off."" While it may be hard to see how Shackleton's experience of surviving in extreme conditions relates to managing a financial crisis, MacGregor believes Shackleton is a great model for management because of his leadership qualities. Shackleton had clear values and was at his best when he and his team had a lot at stake, including their lives.

One of Shackleton's most interesting decisions was to turn back when he was only 97 miles from the South Pole. This choice showed his credibility for future decisions, as the safety of his men was his top priority. In a crisis, people want to know who is in charge. While many managers today may avoid responsibility, Shackleton was willing to take charge and accept the consequences.

His 1914 expedition became legendary. His ship, the Endurance, was trapped in ice for nine months before it was finally crushed. When the ship sank, Shackleton told his men, ""We should all eventually reach safety if you do your best and trust me."" From the accounts and diaries kept during the expedition, it is clear that Shackleton was always in control. 

MacGregor notes that Shackleton thought carefully, planned for every situation, kept his men informed, and valued their opinions. He was flexible and willing to change plans when necessary. ""We've developed effective principles based on Shackleton's example. Clients can relate to his story without feeling criticized,"" he says.

Shackleton believed that an explorer needs optimism, endurance, and patience. ""One of the hardest things to do in tough situations is to wait, especially in America, where there is a strong desire to fix things quickly,"" MacGregor explains. ""If you invest in bonds and make a wrong guess about interest rates, it's better to hold on and wait for your money to come back rather than sell and take a big loss. Similarly, don't hesitate to change your plans if they aren't working. If a new product isn't selling, don't keep pushing it.""

Shackleton led by example. On the return journey from the Endurance, he noticed Hurley, the expedition photographer, without gloves. He insisted that Hurley wear his gloves, threatening to throw them overboard if he didn't. Another crew member recalled Shackleton doing something similar with a biscuit during a previous expedition when they were near starvation: ""He said he would leave it in the snow. Millions of pounds couldn't have bought that biscuit.""

As Caroline Alexander, author of *Endurance*, the human account of that expedition, states: ""The public's interest in heroic efforts is growing. Shackleton highlights the lack of heroism in today's world. He stands out as a true embodiment of the ideals we long for today."""
CAE_15,"**Simplified Text: 'Finding Food in Madagascar'**

In the forests of Madagascar, there is a unique primate called the aye-aye. Its feeding habits are similar to those of a woodpecker. Both the aye-aye and the woodpecker search for insect larvae by digging into wood. The woodpecker uses its beak to chisel into the wood and its long tongue to pull out the insects. In contrast, the aye-aye uses its sharp front teeth to gnaw into the wood and its long, thin third finger to reach inside and scoop out the insects.

Although the aye-aye's unusual feeding method was first described over a hundred years ago, scientists have only recently learned how it finds the insects hidden in the wood. Dr. Carl Erickson from Duke University studied the hunting skills of two male aye-ayes named Nosferatu and Poe, a female named Samantha, and her baby, Annabelle. He wanted to see if they could find insects by looking for signs, like holes in the wood where insects might have entered to lay eggs.

Dr. Erickson gave the aye-ayes logs with narrow holes. Some holes led to food, while others were empty. The aye-ayes quickly went for the logs with food, showing that they did not need to rely on visual signs. It was possible that they were using their sense of smell or hearing to locate the mealworms. However, further tests showed that they did not need these senses either. They could find food even when the smell was blocked and when the mealworms were dead and silent.

So, how did the aye-ayes find the insects? Dr. Erickson found that they would gnaw into both empty spaces and those with food. It seems they can sense the cavities in the wood. When looking for food, an aye-aye taps the wood with its middle finger and moves its large ears forward to listen closely. Dr. Erickson believes that the aye-aye is using a method similar to echo-location, listening for sounds that indicate a hollow space below. They might also hear the movement of insects when they tap on the wood.

The idea that the aye-aye fills the role of woodpeckers in Madagascar's forests is interesting. However, there are also birds like the Sickle-billed and Nuthatch Vangas that search for insects in wood, so the woodpecker role may not be empty. The aye-aye can be seen as a mix of a woodpecker and an echo-locating bat, but it also acts like a squirrel. Its front teeth grow continuously, just like a squirrel's, and it has been seen in the wild gnawing through nut shells and using its long finger to get the nut meat inside."
CAE_19,"**Text: Ordinary People, Ordinary Lives**

Many of us have photos of our grandparents, but how many of us truly understand their lives and who they were when they were young? The few diaries we have are often incomplete, and family stories are sometimes only half-remembered. What will our grandchildren know about us? We often plan to write down our stories but never find the time. We might leave behind videos instead of photos, but these will still only show a flat image.

Hannah Renier has found a solution: she writes autobiographies for other people, creating a hardcover book of at least 20,000 words, with illustrations if needed. Her focus is not on famous individuals, but on ordinary lives. The idea came to her when she spoke with her family and realized how much of her past was fading away. ""When I started, I didn't take it as seriously as I do now, after meeting people who have interesting stories to tell,"" she explains. ""They often say they are doing it for their children or for future generations, but they also enjoy the process.""

The promise of confidentiality helps her subjects feel free to share their true feelings. A 62-year-old man, who has experienced both success and failure, said, ""I felt confident to be honest. I was surprised by what I revealed. There were painful memories, like my divorce, that still affect me."" He wrote his story for his family, hoping they could learn from it, but he hasn’t let his adult children read it yet. ""There are things that might hurt them, and I prefer they read it after I’m gone,"" he said.

He also noticed patterns from his childhood that led him to repeat mistakes in his life. Ms. Renier has seen this in others as well. ""Many people are influenced by their parents,"" she says. ""The messages they received as children can affect them for their entire lives. They often find themselves repeating the same behaviors, whether by marrying people their parents liked or rebelling against them.""

Many people express regrets about unresolved issues with their parents, even decades later. ""If someone had problems in their youth, they often carry those into middle age,"" she notes. Some people live their lives trying to gain approval from parents who were never satisfied, and when that fails, they may feel the need to express their frustrations.

As a recorder rather than an interrogator, Ms. Renier maintains a respectful distance. ""This is not for public sharing, and I’m not here to pry. Sometimes people share something and then question if it should be included. I usually keep it in, but they can remove things later if they wish. Generally, people want to be honest, flaws and all.""

""This is not vanity publishing; it’s not about people saying, 'Look at my interesting life.' Life is moving faster than ever, and we are losing touch with our past. This work helps people connect with their roots. We need a link to our ancestors, especially since families are not as close-knit as they used to be. People seek a sense of immortality.""

Each book involves up to 30 hours of recorded interviews, which Ms. Renier uses to write the life story, organizing the events and adding her interpretation. Modern technology allows her to create everything except the binding, which features gold lettering. Clients can choose the color of the cover and the title. The final product is well-organized and written, reflecting the quality of the subject's life. Each book costs nearly £3,000, with additional copies priced at £25 each. Although she receives about ten inquiries a week, the high cost deters many potential clients. ""I thought it would be a more affordable service,"" she admits. ""But the people I work with tend to be well-off, often readers of magazines like Harpers & Queen, which is where I advertise. They are the kind of people who would have had their portraits painted for future generations."""

The Museum of Classical Archaeology is one of the few places in the world that has a collection of casts of Greek and Roman sculptures, with over six hundred pieces. It is important to note that none of the sculptures are original; they are all accurate replicas made from the originals, mostly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Museum is located in a specially designed gallery with great natural light. The benefits of plaster casts are numerous: sculptures that were originally displayed together but are now in different museums across Europe can be seen together as they were meant to be. Almost all the most famous works of Greek and Roman sculpture can be viewed in just one afternoon.

The collection includes over 400,000 air photographs taken by university staff over the last 45 years. The University has its own aircraft based at Cambridge Airport and conducts photographic work across Great Britain. These photographs are of great interest as they provide a detailed, year-by-year record of the landscape, showing both the natural environment and the impact of human activity from prehistoric times to today. There is a small display in the entrance hall, and the knowledgeable library staff are available to answer any questions. The photographs cannot be borrowed, but copies can usually be purchased. These are made to order and typically take about a month.

**E. Cambridge Medieval Brass Rubbing Centre**  
The Cambridge Brass Rubbing Centre, the second oldest and longest-running center of its kind in the world, is one of the most unique tourist attractions in the region. Visitors can enjoy creating wall hangings by rubbing one of over a hundred different brass plates from the tombs of medieval knights and ladies. By making resin copies, known as facsimiles, the center preserves the originals while making brass rubbing accessible to everyone. The brass plates, which served as an alternative memorial to tomb statues, spread from Germany across medieval Europe and Scandinavia. Many beautiful brasses were destroyed during various revolutions, but most of the remaining examples are found in Britain, with the widest range available at the Cambridge Centre."

**A. The Theatre Director**  
I have had a unique personal life, but I feel fortunate to have spent 35 years with young children, and I truly cherish every moment. This morning, I enjoyed feeding my baby, which I believe is a key part of being a father. I feel very lucky with my children; we share many interests like opera, theatre, books, and music. This has created a strong bond, especially now that they are mostly grown up and I see them more as a friend than just a father. I do not believe in physical punishment. Although I have sometimes reacted in anger, I do not support it. I may not have been the most attentive father, but I have always tried to be available. I am here for them whenever they need me, but I believe it is important that they reach out to me first. If I start asking them why they haven’t contacted me, it creates unnecessary guilt. My parents did that to me, and I would never do that to my children.

**B. The Advertising Executive**  
I was quite young, around 25, when my children were born, and I found the responsibilities challenging. It made me feel older quickly, but it also kept me young, which I appreciate. As they became teenagers, they introduced me to music, youth culture, and fashion, which helped me stay connected in my work. I missed some important moments, like their first concerts and sports days, which makes me sad. However, now I enjoy taking them on holidays to the south of France. They get along well with many of our friends and join us at parties and advertising events without feeling out of place. I think it helps that my job is seen as exciting and glamorous.

**C. The Politician**  
My first child was born just as I was about to be elected to the Greater London Council, and I had more children soon after. My wife and I promised to make time for them, but as my political career grew, finding time became difficult. I only accept weekend meetings and public events if my children can come with me. This way, they can see what I do when I am not with them, and they don’t feel like I am disappearing. I have noticed that more politicians are bringing their children to work, which shows we are becoming more aware of the importance of including our children in our lives.

**D. The Writer**  
My first marriage ended when my daughters, Kate and Bonnie, were young, which made me think deeply about fatherhood. I worked hard to stay connected with them. My ex-wife and I even tried living next to each other for a while, so they could visit easily, but I think it confused them. Kate has said in interviews that I was always there for her, but I wonder if I was a good father. I was present, but like many parents from the Seventies, I may have treated them like adults too soon. Kate recently mentioned that we were too lenient. I believe I could have set more rules and structure. Instead, I took a very relaxed approach, which I now regret. I still worry about my older daughters just as much as I do about my youngest. In that sense, your children never really leave you.

**E. The TV Presenter**  
I was ready for children. At 30, I had met my wife, and we had a nice home, so we thought, ""Why not have a child instead of just buying new furniture?"" Having my daughter, Betty, has helped me understand who I am. Creating a child feels very special, and it is. However, it also makes you just one of many parents. It can be frustrating at times, but any irritation disappears with just one look at her. A baby's smile is incredibly powerful; it can melt anyone's heart."

CAE_46,"**Text: Science Defying Gravity**

Journalist Tom Mumford joins students who are using weightlessness to test their theories. From the outside, the aircraft looked like any other. The pilot informed the young passengers that it was a Boeing KC-135 refuelling tanker, built in 1964 and based on the Boeing 707. However, the 13 students from Europe and America who boarded were about to experience an extraordinary flight. Inside, the aircraft resembled a long white tunnel with few windows, illuminated by lights along the padded walls. Most seats had been removed, leaving only a few at the back where the nervous students sat.

For a year, these students had competed to take part in this flight, which was organized by the European Space Agency. They had to propose creative experiments to be conducted in weightless conditions. Those with the best ideas earned a spot on this unique flight, which could be described as an incredible roller-coaster ride. For the next two hours, the Boeing would fly like a giant bird, soaring upwards before diving back down. The goal was to create a brief moment of weightlessness at the top of each curve. 

As the pilot cut the engines at 3,000 meters, the aircraft climbed higher due to its own momentum before gravity took over and it fell back to Earth. In the few silent seconds between rising and falling, the aircraft and everything inside it became weightless, allowing the students to feel as if they were closer to the moon than the Earth.

The flight took off smoothly, but any thoughts of a regular passenger flight vanished when the pilot put the Boeing into a steep climb for about 20 seconds. The engines roared, blood rushed from our heads, and bodies were thrown around the cabin. Then, the engines stopped, and we instantly transitioned to weightlessness. For 20 seconds, we floated in silence, as if the floor had turned into a trampoline. One small step sent us soaring towards the ceiling. We floated without direction; up or down lost all meaning. Only gravity kept us grounded and allowed us to understand movement.

After ten seconds of freefall, the pilot pulled the aircraft out of its dive. The return of gravity was sudden, causing some students to land hard. After completing the first curve, some students felt uneasy about the 29 more to come. Thirty curves provided ten minutes of ""space time"" for experiments. The Dutch students studied the movements of Leonardo, their robotic cat, to learn how cats always land on their feet. At the right moment, they released their device, which floated upside down, and one student managed to turn it right-side up using a remote control. 

The next curve almost ended badly when another student landed on top of the robotic cat during a less controlled return to gravity. Meanwhile, a German team from the University of Aachen studied how the quality of metal joints is affected by the lack of gravity, aiming to improve future space station construction. Another group from Utah State University explored creating solar sails from thin liquid films hardened by ultraviolet sunlight. They hoped that once perfected, satellites could use solar sails to harness the sun's energy, similar to how a yacht uses wind.

After two hours of flying between heaven and Earth, breakfast felt unstable, but the main feeling was excitement, not nausea. This exhilarating experience would stay with us for a long time. ""It was unforgettable,"" said one student. ""I already wanted to be an astronaut, but now I want it even more."""

**With the Trees, I Planted My Stake in New Zealand**  
**JONATHON PORRITT TALKS TO DANNY DANZIGER**  
Jonathon Porritt is the author of *Seeing Green - The Politics of Ecology*.

I had a strange time in my life when I didn’t experience any summers. I went to New Zealand every summer, which was actually winter there, so I had nine winters in a row. I enjoyed it because I like winter. My parents had the idea to buy a small piece of land for my brother, sister, and me to take care of. My mother said, “If you can take the time to plant trees, then you can have it.” The idea was that we would always have a connection to New Zealand, which is special because my father grew up there. They found a piece of land about 20 miles north of Auckland in a place called Rangitoupuni. The land was not very good, but it was suitable for planting trees. I have always been interested in land. I spent a year in Australia working on sheep farms and doing various farming jobs, so the idea of planting trees excited me, and I was eager to start. My family became enthusiastic as we went along. I began planting in 1968, and by the end of 1972, the three of us had planted the entire 70 acres.

In New Zealand in 1968, it was one of those very rainy winters. It rained a lot, almost every day we were planting. It seems strange to remember it as a happy time since I was often wet and cold. Every morning was a challenge: getting ready for planting. I would come out of the Land Rover warm and dry, but then face the rain, with my jacket still damp from the day before, my boots soaked, and my hands struggling with slippery laces. “The brain starts to take over and allows for many strange thoughts and reflections about life.” In that first year, I had a skilled tree-planter working with me, which was helpful since I had never planted trees seriously before. You wear a planting bag around your neck, filling it with as many trees as possible. When the bag is full, it’s heavy, and it only gets easier as it gets lighter.

The hardest part of the job was getting the lines straight. You decide how far apart to plant the trees, then set up three poles in a straight line. These poles guide your planting. Once you are in line, you plant all the way down, turn around, and come back. I enjoy hard physical work, and it helped me get fit. After a while, you can plant trees almost automatically. You get into a rhythm and use the fewest spade strokes needed to dig a hole. This rhythm is important in many farming jobs; you train your body to perform a series of standard moves, making the work much easier. You develop a regular process: taking a tree from the bag, digging a hole, placing it in the ground, stamping it down, and moving on. Mentally, it’s interesting. My mind starts to wander, allowing many thoughts and ideas about life to come to me. A lot of my thinking about nature and our place in it began during those days.

I have returned to New Zealand four times since then and watched the trees grow, which has been very satisfying. I feel a connection to what happens to them. I always worry when I read news about strong winds or droughts in New Zealand. Such news makes me anxious. However, everything turned out well, and those trees are now 20 years old and healthy. I should add that I took a break from teaching and went back in 1984 for three months, completely alone. I wrote my first book there, *Seeing Green*. There is a simple cabin on the tree farm with just a bed, a table, and a chair. In the mornings, I would write; in the afternoons, I would prune the trees, and in the evenings, I would do research. My connection to that area is still very strong. It is the place I feel most connected to in terms of the bond between people and the earth; it is a powerful connection."
CAE_10,"**Text: 'RAISING BADGERS'**

""What now?"" was my first thought when one of my helpers brought a cardboard box to me. My husband Derek and I have run an open farm in Somerset for six years, known for caring for orphaned animals. But the noise from the box—a mix of a cackle and a bark—was unfamiliar. Curious, I looked inside and saw three small grey badger cubs, each about eight inches long. Their soft coats (which later showed fleas) and milky eyes looked up at me from their tiny black-and-white striped heads. I had never seen badger cubs before. Most are born between mid-January and mid-March and spend their early lives underground. If they become orphaned, they often die from starvation without being found. These three were brought to me by construction workers who accidentally disturbed their home while laying drain pipes. Their mother was found dead, with her babies still nursing. I could see they were healthy but cold and whimpering. After removing the fleas, I took them into the farmhouse kitchen and placed them beside the stove for warmth. There were two females, Primrose and Bluebell, and a male, Willow. At first, I used a syringe to feed them, but I had to wipe each cub with a warm cloth first to mimic the mother’s licking. This helped them to relieve themselves. For the first few days, they were fed every four hours. Within a week, they learned to drink from a bottle and started moving around, though a bit unsteadily. With each other for company and a heated pad as a substitute for their mother, they seemed happy.

However, three weeks later, I noticed that Willow looked tired, even though he was eating normally. This was a warning sign. I should have acted quickly, but I didn’t realize its importance. The next morning, I found him dead. The vet's examination showed that Willow had died from a lung infection. When bottle-feeding any animal, it’s important not to let them drink too quickly, as liquid can enter the lungs. In Willow's case, this caused an infection that would have been hard to treat, even with antibiotics, because he was so small. Feeling sad about my loss, I continued to care for the other two cubs. But then, six days later, a local farmer, who had heard about our cubs, came to see me. He had found a single male cub abandoned by its mother behind some silage bags. He knew she wouldn’t return; the area had been disturbed too much, and the cub was cold and hungry. So, Willow II joined us. At six weeks old, he was about two weeks younger than the females. Over the next few days, I learned why his mother had left him. He was very difficult to feed. I had to keep moving the bottle's teat around and squeezing it to get him to drink. After ten minutes, he would finally latch on as if he hadn’t eaten all day. By the end of April, the females were eating creamed rice and anything else I offered. Willow II was happy to stop using the bottle but struggled to eat without making a mess. Eventually, I gave him a sausage, which he slowly chewed, played with, and finally ate. After a week of sausages, he was ready to try other foods. By nearly five months old, they were all eating cereals for breakfast, a meat and vegetable meal for lunch, and fruit, nuts, cheese, hard-boiled eggs, and sunflower seeds in the evening. Normally, badgers eat 60% earthworms, along with beetles, baby rabbits, mice, and even plant roots. My badgers were better off than others that year; the summer was very hot, making it hard to find earthworms.

By August, my badgers had started to become nocturnal, going for walks at dusk or late at night. We often walked through the cider orchard, where the tall grass made it easy for them to chase each other. They would get excited, fluff up their fur, and chase their tails. As ""human badgers,"" we joined in their fun. I learned to avoid their playful nips, but Derek, who joined us less often, sometimes got caught and had colorful reactions to it. During two of these late-night walks, I saw other badgers in our field. They were likely searching for food because they had to expand their territory. Badgers are very territorial and can be aggressive towards others that enter their area. We were warned that they might come into our badger pen and harm the cubs, so we put sheet metal over the gate to keep it secure.

The local press took pictures of me walking the badgers, and the response was so positive that we started a campaign to build a sett for the badgers on our farm. With help from others, we designed a new home for them. Daniel, one of our sons, drew the plans, and we built a sett with tunnels, an enclosure, and a badger gate that faced their usual walking path. It had three chambers, one larger than the others, with a glass side so people could see inside from a darkened area. As the sett took shape, the badgers explored it before their walks. Eventually, they became more interested in the tunnels and bedding than in walking. The building costs were higher than we expected, but a local bus company called Badgerline sponsored part of the project, and local businesses donated materials. Everyone wanted to help give the badgers a home.

One evening, they finally moved in. After watching them for a while, we left them to settle. Half an hour later, I quietly returned to check on them and saw three badgers curled up in their chambers, sound asleep. These days, I don’t walk with them as often, especially since they don’t fully wake up until midnight. We see Primrose only occasionally, as she has joined a nearby sett, but Bluebell and Willow II still come to greet me before they dash off into the night. This is their territory now, a place they know well and a home they have happily accepted."
CAE_67,"**Text: In Search of True North - The Man Behind Halley's Comet**

Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, wants to follow in the footsteps of Sir Edmund Halley, who studied compass variations. Anjana Ahuja reports.

Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is famous for the comet named after him. However, one of his most important achievements, according to his peers, was mapping the 'variations of the compass' during his sea voyages on the warship Paramore. These variations, now called 'declination', refer to the angle between magnetic north and true geographical north. Understanding this angle was crucial for sailors to correct their compasses and navigate accurately.

Halley, one of only two men in England at that time paid to do scientific research, set out for the Cape Verde Islands to chart declination in the North and South Atlantic. His first trip was cut short due to crew problems, but he later sailed again. This second voyage took him to Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, Newfoundland, and back to England. From these travels, Halley published a 'New and Correct Chart showing the Variations of the Compass in the Western and Southern Oceans' in 1701. More advanced maps based on his work helped sailors for over a century until changes in the Earth's magnetic field made them less accurate.

Dr. Clark, a passionate sailor, plans to celebrate the 300th anniversary of Halley's journey by retracing the Paramore's route. He needs to raise £70,000 before starting, with support from Sir Vivian Fuchs, who led the first expedition across Antarctica. Dr. Clark became interested in Halley during a two-year stay at Halley Station in Antarctica, where he read about the scientist's life. ""Halley led a remarkable life,"" Dr. Clark says. ""He was a respected scientist and led expeditions. He was not only an astronomer but also researched geophysics. While he was Astronomer Royal, he mapped stars and pursued other interests.""

During this time, Halley invented a diving bell and advised Sir Isaac Newton on his work, Principia Mathematica, which is fundamental to classical physics. Dr. Clark believes that recreating Halley's voyage will give him the recognition he deserves. His planned expedition, called 'In the Wake of the Paramore', will also have scientific value. It will involve taking measurements similar to Halley's but with much more accurate instruments. These measurements are necessary because the Earth's magnetic field is constantly changing. The data collected will help improve the current mathematical model of the Earth's magnetic field, known as the international geomagnetic reference field.

""It is common to measure the size but not the direction of the magnetic field. You need to know true north to measure the direction,"" Dr. Clark explains. ""On our expedition, we can use global positioning satellites to find that."" The British Geological Survey and the United States Navy will provide instruments. A Danish satellite will also be taking similar measurements globally. Dr. Clark hopes his measurements will fill in any gaps in the satellite's coverage of the Atlantic Ocean, and having ground-based measurements will be useful for comparison.

Halley's Atlantic journey was significant; it was the first scientific expedition at sea, and he was the first civilian appointed as a naval captain to pursue his interest in declination. Does Dr. Clark have the qualifications to succeed in his journey? He has spent two years in Antarctica and worked in the geomagnetic group at the British Geological Survey. He has already sailed the 13,000 kilometers from Rio de Janeiro to England. He plans to complete the expedition in four stages with different crews.

Does he share Halley's obsessive nature? ""I am willing to give up my life for eight months to do this, so some might think I'm obsessed. But I wouldn't want to sail across the Atlantic again without a good reason. Halley and his fascinating life have given me a real sense of purpose."""
CAE_27,"**Text: POWER DRESSING**

Every summer, the peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show off their beautiful tail feathers to the critical eyes of the peahens. This behavior raises a question that puzzled Charles Darwin: how could birds develop such extravagant features in a world where survival is often a struggle? How do they manage to thrive with such a burden?

Zoologist Marion Petrie and her team from the Open University are studying the peacocks at Whipsnade to explore this question, a century after Darwin's death. Darwin believed that living beings evolved through natural selection, where the strongest and most suited individuals survive and reproduce. However, he found it hard to explain why peacocks had such large tails, which seemed to be a disadvantage. He introduced the idea of ""sexual selection,"" suggesting that females are attracted to beauty for its own sake.

Darwin's friend, Alfred Russel Wallace, had a different view. He believed that if peahens preferred males with the most impressive tails, it must mean those males had other qualities that helped them survive, even if those qualities were not obvious to humans. According to Wallace, the tail was not just for show; it indicated something important about the male's fitness.

Today, researchers still debate these ideas. Studying the natural behavior of peafowl is challenging, but the 200 birds at Whipsnade, which live in a semi-wild environment and are accustomed to humans, provide a unique opportunity for research. Petrie and her team are investigating two main questions: Do peahens really prefer males with the most impressive tails? And do these males have any real advantages, or is it all just for show?

Observations suggest that peahens do prefer the males with the most eye-spots on their tails, which are linked to tail length. Males with more eye-spots attract more mates. However, it is still unclear if these attractive males are better in other ways. William Hamilton from Oxford University proposed that showy male birds might be less likely to have parasites, and their bright feathers could signal their health. While there is evidence for this in other species, Petrie and her team have not yet been able to test this idea with the peacocks at Whipsnade.

This year, Petrie is comparing the offspring of attractive males with those of less attractive ones. Are the children of the attractive males healthier and growing faster? If they are, it would support Wallace's idea that female choice is based on practical benefits.

There is also an interesting theory from mathematician and biologist R A Fisher, known as ""Fisher's Runaway."" He suggested that if a female chooses a male with a slightly better tail, her sons will inherit that trait, and her daughters will inherit her preference for long tails. Over generations, this could lead to males with increasingly long tails, validating Darwin's idea that females might eventually select for beauty alone.

In summary, the study of peacocks continues to reveal complex interactions between beauty, survival, and mate selection."
CAE_66,"**THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS**

Tom Cunliffe believes that the best boat design should blend traditional and modern elements. He applied this idea in his own boat, 'The Westerman'. This week, the Summer Boat Show in London showcases many impressive yachts filled with new technology. Most of these boats are descendants of a major design change that happened 25 years ago. In contrast, my boat rests quietly in a tidal creek on the south coast. Although it was designed last year, it looks like it is 100 years old, which might make you think its owner is a romantic. Perhaps I am, but I’m not sure. 

This boat benefits from the charm of classic design, but modern technology has made the process easier. However, it is important to note that while technology is essential in today’s boat design and building, it often separates sailors from the true challenges of life at sea. These challenges are often what they wanted to experience by going sailing in the first place. I am not saying that sailors should go back to facing every difficulty. I believe it is important for my boats to have a coal stove for warmth and comfortable sleeping areas. But why go sailing if every sail operates automatically? Dealing with a flapping sail is part of being a sailor. 

Why should we give up common sense and move our steering positions from the safe back of the boat to a less secure spot near the front? Unfortunately, this change creates a cabin that resembles an ocean liner, with a bed larger than one at home. For me, a boat should always be a boat, not a house on the water. When I bought my previous boat, Hirta, to sail around Britain for a TV race series, the previous owner noted that it had all the comforts but no luxuries. Over my time with Hirta, I learned how true that was. She had heavy sails, no running water, little electricity, no fridge, no central heating, no winches, and no electronics, especially for navigation. Yet, she was the kindest and easiest boat I have ever sailed.

However, classic boats require a lot of maintenance, which can be difficult. After injuring my back, I realized I had to stop sailing Hirta. I looked for a younger boat but found none that met my needs, so I decided to build a new boat from scratch. The Westerman has never let me down. Although designer Nigel Irens and his assistant Ed Burnett are skilled with computer design, Irens first sketched this boat on a paper napkin before using a computer. After creating a set of lines, he carved a model, just like boat builders did in the past. We then reviewed the initial design and made adjustments using the computer. The next version was almost perfect, and by the final version, the design was just right.

The finished boat has crossed the North Atlantic and won four out of her first six races. She has a timeless look, moves beautifully at sea, and her interior, made from reclaimed pitch pine, creates a peaceful atmosphere. This may be because she was designed solely as a sailing boat, without considering any furniture we might add. This traditional approach works well. In her calm presence, she proves that you don’t need to follow modern trends to find happiness, and sometimes it is wise to learn from history. Built with wood treated with a special glue, she is completely waterproof. Therefore, she has all the advantages of a fiberglass boat while still looking, feeling, and sailing like a true sailing craft."

Health farms and country house hotels with spa facilities are becoming increasingly popular. We asked five journalists to explore some of these places.

**A. HENLOW GRANGE**  
I was excited to spend six days at Henlow Grange because I was tired and needed to unwind. My room in the large 18th-century house was extremely comfortable, and I felt relaxed right away. On the first day, I did nothing but sleep. Starting on the second day, I began attending body conditioning classes, including stretch and tone, yoga, and body alignment. The instructors were very skilled. As the week went on, I noticed how flexible I was becoming. They offer a wide range of treatments, such as aromatherapy (which helped me relax), seaweed baths, manicures, and pedicures. The facial treatment, lasting an hour, truly made me feel rejuvenated. The staff in the treatment rooms were friendly, kind, and professional. The atmosphere was full of energy and enthusiasm. Henlow plans to renovate this year, adding a half-size Olympic swimming pool and a Light Diet Room. Bicycles are available for riding around the grounds. If you prefer a quieter time and the weather is nice, you can read a magazine or take a peaceful walk in the garden. During my stay, my mood and appetite improved. I left feeling wonderful and energetic, which lasted a long time. I will definitely return. This is the perfect getaway for a stressed working woman. Save Room 5 for me!

**B. SHRUBLAND HALL**  
The calm and relaxing atmosphere of this stately home was clear as soon as I entered the reception area. The Hall features a beautifully decorated library, a lovely conservatory, and plenty of space, allowing you to avoid conversation if you wish. Upon arrival, everyone receives a medical check, including an examination of weight and blood pressure. We were all referred to as patients, which felt a bit strange since I am healthy. However, I appreciated that a shoulder issue found during the examination was quickly communicated to the fitness instructor, and we worked on it in group workshops and individual sessions. Each patient follows a specific diet. I lost weight without fasting, but I was still hungry enough to get a bad headache on the second day. My daily menu included grapefruit and honey for breakfast, salads for lunch, and a mix of exotic fruit, yogurt, and hot broth for dinner. If you are not on a light diet, you can eat in the main dining hall, where the food is tasty and well-presented. You receive a massage or water therapy every other day, and all extra treatments are reasonably priced.

**C. CAREYS MANOR**  
Careys is not a health farm and does not claim to be one. It is a charming old manor with cozy log fires and a spacious lounge. If you are counting calories, you might want to skip the gourmet food, which includes rich sauces and delicious creamy desserts made by the French chef. Fortunately, the hotel has a fully-equipped gym and a soft-water pool, allowing me to work off some of the tempting dishes. (You can choose a 'health-conscious' diet if you want to lose weight.) There is a spa bath, steam room, Swiss shower, sauna, and treatment rooms. A major attraction is the sports injury clinic, where I received expert advice on an old shoulder injury. The physiotherapist suggested good posture, remedial exercises, and massage. Careys is both comfortable and luxurious, relaxed and elegant. If you want to explore, there is beautiful countryside nearby.

**D. CLIVEDEN**  
Cliveden is a grand country home and a five-star hotel that treats its guests like royalty. It offers health and beauty treatments, a well-equipped gym, saunas, a swimming pool, tennis, horse riding, and much more. The estate features stunning woodland walks and gardens covering 376 acres. There is also Waldo's, a highly-acclaimed restaurant with mouth-watering dishes. It took me half an hour to read the dinner menu because the choices were overwhelming. The meal was fantastic, especially the sticky-toffee pudding with banana ice cream. I went to bed feeling very happy! The next morning, I spent a few hours in the gym using exercise equipment to burn off some calories before my next meal. In the Pavilion, I enjoyed a facial with gentle heat and essential oils, followed by an aromatherapy massage. I thought about the other reports my fellow journalists would write about fitness assessments, workouts, and beauty treatments. Cliveden offers all these options if you want to use them before indulging at Waldo's.

**E. SPRINGS HYDRO**  
The best and worst thing about Springs Hydro is the carrot cake. The best because it is the most delicious I have ever tasted. The worst because it contains 360 calories, which can be a setback if you are trying to lose weight. You have been warned! The second best thing is the amazing aromatherapy massage. I chose a relaxing oil blend and fell asleep twice during the treatment, then returned to my room for the best night's sleep I have had in years. The facilities are modern and well-organized, with luxurious bedrooms. There are many therapists and beauty rooms, making it easy to schedule appointments. A variety of treatments are available, from manicures and pedicures to deep-cleansing facials and body treatments. The guests are a diverse group, including football teams, mothers and daughters, best friends, and singles. Ideally, I would take a break here about once a month.

CAE_22,"**NATURAL TALENTS**

In the seven million years since humans separated from chimpanzees, we have not developed significant differences; genetically, we are still over 98% similar to chimps. This suggests that the traits that make us human are a recent development in our evolutionary history. Our ability to create art and other unique human characteristics likely come from just a small number of our genes. This is a heavy responsibility for such a limited set of genes. 

Recent studies of animal behavior have shown that many traits once thought to be unique to humans are now seen as differences in degree rather than kind. For instance, both humans and wild chimpanzees use tools—chimpanzees use sticks to eat and as weapons, while sea otters use rocks to open clams. Monkeys also have a basic form of language, using different sounds to warn of predators like leopards, eagles, and snakes. This means that aside from art, there are few absolute differences between humans and animals.

However, if human art comes from a unique genetic trait, it is curious that our ancestors did not create art for almost 6.9 million years after separating from chimps. The earliest forms of art may have been wood carvings or body painting, but these materials do not last over time. The first clear evidence of human art appears around 35,000 years ago with cave paintings, statues, necklaces, and musical instruments.

If we argue that our recent artistic explosion sets us apart, we must consider how our art differs from that of animals. Three common claims are made: human art is non-utilitarian, it is created for aesthetic pleasure, and it is learned rather than instinctive. 

First, as Oscar Wilde said, ""All art is quite useless."" A biologist might interpret this to mean that human art does not help us survive or reproduce, unlike many animal behaviors. While some human art communicates ideas to others, this is not the same as passing on genes. In contrast, birdsong serves clear purposes, such as defending territory or attracting mates, which helps them pass on their genes. By this measure, human art does seem different.

The second claim is that human art is motivated by aesthetic pleasure. We cannot ask birds if they enjoy their songs, but they mainly sing during mating season, suggesting they do not sing just for beauty. Again, this makes human art seem unique.

The third claim is that human art is learned rather than instinctive. Different human groups have distinct art styles that are learned. For example, songs in Tokyo and Paris are easily distinguishable. However, these differences are not genetic. People from different cultures can learn each other's songs. In contrast, some birds are born with the ability to sing their species' specific songs, even if they have never heard them before.

The role of learning in human art is evident in how quickly our art styles change. Roman writers described geese honking 2,000 years ago, and they still do today. However, human art evolves rapidly; even casual museum visitors can tell that a twentieth-century painting is more recent than the Mona Lisa. Art experts can often identify the time and artist of a painting they have not seen before. Yet, even experts might confuse two mid-twentieth-century artists named Congo and Betsy, who were actually chimpanzees. Congo created up to 33 paintings in one day, seemingly for his own enjoyment, and became upset when his pencil was taken away. Congo and Betsy had a show of their paintings in 1957 at London's Institute of Contemporary Art, and many of their works sold—something many human artists cannot claim.

These paintings by our closest relatives blur the lines between human art and animal behavior. Like human art, the chimpanzee paintings served no practical purpose; they were created for the satisfaction of the painter. One might argue that human art is different because most human artists intend to communicate with others, while the apes did not care to share their work. However, this argument is not entirely convincing, as some famous human art was also created for personal satisfaction rather than communication."
CAE_39,"**Text: An Amazing Adventure**

The Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last unexplored places on Earth. It is also one of the most dangerous. Charles Blackmore crossed it and lived to tell the story. There are very few big adventures left and very few heroes. Children's stories used to be full of brave explorers with sunburnt skin and eyes squinting to see far away on their journeys into the unknown. Nowadays, you rarely find such characters in stories, or even in real life. That was my belief until I met Charles Blackmore.

Blackmore's great adventure was leading a team across the Taklamakan Desert, which is known for its dangers. Its name means ""once entered, you never come out,"" and local people call it the Desert of Death. He shared the dangers and excitement of that incredible journey in the comfort of his family home. His team included four Britons (one was the medical officer), an American photographer, four Chinese experts, 30 camels, and six camel handlers. It later became clear that the camel handlers had never worked with camels before; they were long-distance truck drivers. This misunderstanding could have endangered everyone’s lives and the success of the expedition.

This diverse group set out to cross 1,200 kilometers of one of the world's harshest deserts, and Charles Blackmore wrote a captivating account of their journey. At that time, he was about to leave the Army after 14 happy years. He started the expedition for fun, to fill a gap in his life, and to discover who he really was outside the Army. ""I had always thought I would spend my whole life in the Army. I had been offered a promotion, but suddenly I wanted to see who Charles Blackmore really was. It was a big risk. My wife, Tina, was very worried that I wouldn’t return since nobody had ever completed that route; we went into it without knowing what to expect. In the end, it took 59 days to cross from west to east, and the desert was surprisingly good to us.""

Anyone reading his remarkable account will be surprised by the word ""good."" The team faced terrible challenges: dysentery, extreme temperatures, severe thirst, and losing part of their precious water supply. ""But,"" Blackmore explains, ""when we were at our limits and the camels had gone without water for seven days, we found some. We didn’t experience the desert's famous sandstorms, and we never faced the freezing cold that could have stopped us completely. That doesn’t mean we weren’t constantly fighting against difficulties. The fine sand got into everything, especially blisters and wounds. Climbing the high dunes was torture for us and for the heavily loaded camels, which often rolled over onto us.""

""What pushed me on more than anything was the need to survive. We had no backup plan. Our budget and time didn’t allow for one. No aircraft ever flew over us. Once we entered the sandhills, we were completely on our own. I knew I had the mental strength for the trip, but I was very scared about my physical ability. I remember the first day — we sat at the edge of the desert, and it was so hot that it was hard to breathe. I thought, 'We have to start now!' At that moment, I was very scared.""

If it was tough at the beginning, how did they feel at the end? ""After walking for 1,000 kilometers, you’re not going to give up. You’ve endured so much; you have come so far. We were very thin but also very strong despite our exhaustion. My body was fit, and my legs felt powerful. I could walk over anything.""

Midway through the book, Blackmore describes lying in the desert, looking up at a full moon and thinking of his family. How aware was he of how hard it must have been for them? ""Inside me, there’s someone trying to find peace. When I have doubts about myself now, I think back to the image of the desert and remember that we managed to complete that journey. I feel prouder of that expedition than of anything else I’ve done. Yet, when I think of my life’s achievements, I think of my family and the happiness we share — by that measure, the desert doesn’t compare.""

Has Charles Blackmore found peace? ""I long for the challenge — for the open spaces — the excitement of it all. We were motivated by a sense of purpose. Now, I find it hard to fit into the sameness of modern life."""

Life was becoming overwhelming for Susan Harr, so she decided to unplug her gadgets and rediscover the joys of doing things by hand. Many people love technology because it provides us with amazing devices that make life easier and give us more free time. However, this constant reliance on technology has led us to believe that it is essential and beneficial. 

For example, using my fingers to create something by hand does not consume energy like our technology does, and it does not harm the environment. Recently, I had a frustrating experience with my broken word processor, which cost me a lot of money to fix. This made me question whether gadgets are really worth the cost and hassle. Are we as dependent on technology as we think? 

Slowly, I have started to let go of some household gadgets as they break down. This makes me wonder what kind of ""time"" technology actually gives us. Does it just allow us to take on more activities that require even more gadgets? If that’s the case, then the marketing experts are tricking us. When my gadget started making strange noises, even after being unplugged, I decided to leave it outside, where it now sits quietly like a forgotten machine. 

I enjoy not being tied to a noisy device and can take my time with my sewing. I have always been a bit nervous around electric machines that move quickly near my fingers. The best part is that I can easily carry my sewing supplies with me wherever I go. 

Of course, there are some gadgets I appreciate. After a year without a washing machine, I realized how valuable it is. However, losing some gadgets has brought me unexpected joy. I felt we were spending too much time in front of the television, so I returned our rented color TV and we now use a small black-and-white one. This change has made us focus more on what we really want to watch and spend more time walking the dog, reading, talking, or enjoying other hobbies. 

One of my hobbies is sewing, and I no longer use my old Singer sewing machine, which has become a plant table. Since I cannot afford to replace it, I have started sewing by hand. We often think we cannot live without our gadgets, but it is important to question this belief. 

I feel sorry for those who had to endure hard, boring work without the help of machines. Computers now do many tasks for us quickly and even entertain us. However, the time I spend sewing is enjoyable, and I can listen to the radio or talk with family and friends while I work. If the task is simple, I can also watch the shows I want on TV, which makes me feel less guilty about watching. 

Sewing by the fire with a cup of tea is a lovely experience. I used to think it was terrible for women to spend hours sewing by hand, but I have come to appreciate the calming nature of crafting. There is great satisfaction in seeing my work become neater and more confident. I find that I can complete tasks quickly, and my life slows down to match the pace of my hands. 

I also enjoy washing dishes by hand, allowing my mind to wander while I do it. This reflection has led me to reconsider what we really need in our home. Do we truly need a freezer, a microwave, or an electric lawnmower? In fact, we could save a lot of money by doing without electric lights!"

Charles Hurst is a cabinet-maker who creates beautifully crafted furniture. Joanna Watt meets him in his workshop, which is located under a railway arch in East London. When I arrive, he greets me quickly with a handshake and says, ""Well, fire away then!"" It’s hard to tell if he is really in a hurry or just acting tough. Looking around the workshop, it is clear that Hurst is busy. The space is filled with unfinished furniture and wooden planks in many natural colors.

Hurst has been a cabinet-maker for ten years and has a great reputation. His order book is always full for months ahead, even though he does not advertise himself. People know that if they want a good cupboard, table, bookcase, or kitchen units, Hurst is the right person to contact. While it is not hard to find a furniture-maker, it is more difficult to find one who focuses on making high-quality furniture with clean, simple designs. Hurst says, ""There are few real cabinet-makers now. Many call themselves furniture-makers.""

As a craftsman with high standards, Hurst is often disappointed by modern furniture. He expresses his frustration about poor-quality, mass-produced items and craftsmen who make low-quality pieces. His pursuit of perfection is a big part of his success, along with his talent. Hurst is confident about his skills. He states, ""I have a huge natural ability. I have always been good at making things."" Near the end of our conversation, he becomes more modest, which makes me question how serious he was about his earlier confidence.

Hurst is self-taught. When I ask how he learned his craft, he replies, ""I asked the right questions and picked it all up."" Most of his work comes from private clients, and some return to him multiple times. He enjoys doing complete projects for their homes. However, he admits that not all client relationships are easy. He finds it frustrating when clients do not know what they want until it is too late. He prefers clients who are clear about their needs.

Although Hurst has every reason to be proud, he also gives credit to others when it is deserved. He humbly says, ""There are people far better than me. I can admire other people."" He mentions that he was not trained at Parnham, a top furniture design college. At the same time, he criticizes craftsmen who try to be artists and take too long to make one piece. He also does not like degree shows where students showcase their work while trying to make fashion statements, which he finds pretentious. He believes furniture should be practical and useful.

Hurst may be confident and direct, but he is not pretentious. As I leave, he reminds me, ""After all, I am only making furniture."""
CAE_49,"**Three Theories About Sleep**

People spend about one-third of their lives sleeping. This suggests that sleep is very important. However, scientists do not fully agree on why we need to sleep. There are three main theories.

The first and most popular theory says that sleep is mainly for our physical health. It suggests that while we sleep, our bodies work to repair any damage from the day and help us recover our energy.

The second theory focuses on the benefits of sleep for learning. It argues that sleep helps us process the information we learn during the day. According to this theory, without sleep, we would not be able to learn effectively.

The third theory is about energy. It claims that we need to sleep to recharge our energy, so we are ready for the next day."
CAE_31,"**ECCENTRICS**

An eccentric is someone whose behavior is unusual and does not follow the accepted norms of society. This raises the question, ""What is normal?"" Most of us have our own quirks and odd habits. For example, someone might enjoy entering newspaper competitions, collecting beer mats, or writing letters to the editor about various topics. Eccentricity is a way of expressing our individuality. 

Inside us, there is often a struggle between two opposing forces: individualism and conformity. Individualism is the desire to be unique, while conformity is the desire to fit in with others. For many, the need to be accepted and liked by others is stronger than the desire to stand out. 

People with unusual hobbies or strong opinions often come together. They form clubs and hold meetings to share their interests, which others might see as strange. The key point is that they seek out others who share their passions. Even a small group can provide comfort. 

Most of us feel a tension between wanting to fit in and wanting to be ourselves. While we may follow the crowd, we often resist the idea that we are doing so. For instance, someone might say, ""I speak my mind,"" or ""I don’t care about social rules."" 

At any moment, we can choose to embrace our individuality. Many successful people have done this. Bob Dylan, the American singer, once said, ""When you truly believe in what you are doing and pursue it with passion, you will surprise many people."" However, this assertion of individuality is not the same as eccentricity, especially in the beginning. 

When a pop singer wears strange clothes for attention, or a socialite makes shocking comments to be noticed, that is not eccentricity. But if they continue these behaviors until they become a part of who they are, then they may be considered eccentric. The key aspect of eccentricity is its naturalness. 

Eccentrics do not try to be odd; they simply are. They are not focused on what others think; they act according to their true selves. This sets eccentrics apart from enthusiasts, pranksters, criminals, exhibitionists, and recluses, who are all aware of society. Eccentrics, on the other hand, live their lives freely, regardless of societal expectations."

We asked four well-known naturalists to share the wildlife book that has influenced them the most.

**A. Geoffrey Lean**  
Choosing the author was easy for me. As an environmental journalist, I have had the opportunity to meet some of the great thinkers in this field. Among them, Barbara Ward stands out. She has been central to environmental issues in Europe after the war. She combined her experiences from various environmental movements into a powerful philosophy. As a young journalist, I found that she helped me understand these complex topics better than anyone else. Choosing her book was more difficult. It could have been *Only One Earth* or *Progress for a Small Planet*, but I believe *The Home of Man* is her most significant work. It discusses the rapid growth of cities while addressing the larger themes she dedicated her life to. It is a passionate call for what we now refer to as ""sustainable human development."" I have not found another book that matches its impact.

**B. Linda Bennett**  
When I read *Signals for Survival* by Niko Tinbergen, I can hear the calls of herring gulls and remember the smell of guano in the sun. This book beautifully explains the fascinating world of animal communication through words and pictures. After reading it, watching a gull colony transforms from chaos to a well-organized social structure. You can identify partners and family groups. Niko Tinbergen was a respected behaviorist who aimed to make his research accessible to everyone. His collaboration with talented wildlife artist Eric Ennion resulted in a book that appeals to anyone who loves nature. Ennion's art, created from years of observing birds, vividly shows how one gull can be aggressive while another is submissive. This is the work of a true naturalist.

**C. Lee Durrell**  
Without a doubt, *My Family and Other Animals* by Gerald Durrell has had the greatest impact on my life. Not only did it lead me to a wonderful husband and a fulfilling career in conservation, but it also deepened my love for the natural world. I was studying animal sounds in Madagascar when I first read this book. After two years of challenges, opening *My Family and Other Animals* at the end of a long day made everything brighter. It beautifully connects animals, people, joy, and beauty—a small reflection of a world worth protecting. Many believe humans are the worst because of the harm we have caused to other species. However, I remember Gerald as a boy in the book, viewing all living beings as a family, intertwined and inseparable. This is a vital idea for us all to understand.

**D. Bruce Pearson**  
I discovered *The Shell Bird Book* by James Fisher in my school library shortly after it was published in 1966. I was immediately attracted to it, especially the 48 color illustrations of birds by Eric Ennion, which were described as being created with ""particular skill and charm."" These images captivated me. I already owned other bird books and had spent holidays learning to identify birds. They inspired me to start sketching what I saw to help with identification. However, *The Shell Bird Book* offered much more. Along with the beautiful illustrations, it included chapters on bird migration, the history of birds in Britain, and even a section on birds in music, literature, and art. The wide range of information and stunning images encouraged me to appreciate birds and nature more broadly. The book showed me that my emotional and creative connection to nature is just as important as a scientific understanding. Since art was my stronger subject compared to math or physics, I began to see new possibilities for my future."
CAE_37,"**DO REVIEWS SELL BOOKS?**

We asked five leading British publishers about how book reviews affect a book's success. Here is what they said.

**Publisher A**  
Reviews are very important for publishers; they are the first thing we look at in newspapers. A study by the Book Marketing Council showed that many people said they bought a book because of reviews, more than any other reason like ads or recommendations from friends. Authors feel differently about reviews. Both authors and publishers are upset when there are no reviews, but publishers are usually more accepting of bad reviews. They believe that any mention in the press can help sales, as readers want to form their own opinions. Publishers enjoy reviews that match their own views of a book since they are often the first to read it.

**Publisher B**  
Publishers and newspapers both care about book reviews, but they have different needs. Newspapers want to entertain their readers, while publishers want their books to be reviewed, ideally in a positive way. Book reviews today are more varied and accessible than they were 40 years ago. However, there is still a tendency to overlook paperbacks, which many people read. Weekly summaries of books are often not enough, and even original paperbacks rarely get serious attention. Still, publishers need reviews, as they are a cost-effective way to promote a book and its author. A good review from a respected source can significantly boost sales, especially if there are multiple reviews.

**Publisher C**  
Reviews are essential for literary publishing; without them, we would struggle. Our books are usually not by well-known authors, and we rarely advertise, so we rely on literary editors to give our books space. Positive reviews are much more valuable than ads because they are seen as unbiased. Publishers often say they care more about the size of the review than its content. The impact of reviews on sales is complex. Good reviews can launch a book and a career, but they need to be supported by other factors like recommendations from readers, strong responses from booksellers, and smart marketing.

**Publisher D**  
I wish I understood the relationship between publishing and reviewing in Britain! In the U.S., a single review in the New York Times can make or break a book. Here, booksellers often ignore reviews. Sometimes, it takes many years of great reviews for a good writer to gain readers. Interestingly, some poorly received books or those without reviews can still sell very well. The situation is unpredictable, although non-fiction reviews often focus more on the reviewer’s knowledge than on the book itself.

**Publisher E**  
All publishers and writers hope for long, positive reviews. But do they actually sell books? I once published a biography that received excellent reviews, but it failed to sell because people felt they could just read the reviews instead of buying the book. Does the reviewer's name matter? Thirty years ago, if certain reviewers praised a book, people paid attention. Today, it can also be the choice of an unexpected reviewer or the creativity of the review itself that encourages buyers to visit the bookstore."
CAE_2,"**Text: WEATHERVANE MAKER**

The craft of making weathervanes is very old, dating back to ancient Egypt. Today, this skill is still practiced in the workshop of Graham Smith. He is one of the few people in the country who makes weathervanes by hand. Graham creates unique designs based on what his customers want. ""This way, I can make a special item just for them,"" he says. Many of his customers are women looking for gifts for their husbands. They want something unique that reflects the man's interests.

Graham's work is different from the traditional cockerel design, which is the most common type of weathervane. The first weathervane he made was not a cockerel, but a witch on a broomstick. His friends liked it and asked him to make weathervanes for them. ""I realized that there are endless possibilities for designs,"" he explains. Graham decided to focus on making weathervanes as a business. He had trained as a precision engineer and worked in that field for 15 years before he and his wife, Liz, decided to change their roles. She went to work as an architectural assistant, and he stayed home to care for their children and grow his business. This was five years ago, and he has no regrets about this change. ""My previous job was not creative, but this work is exciting and artistic,"" he says. ""I really enjoy designing.""

Graham has now created over 100 original designs. He pays close attention to detail and always gets the customer's approval on the design before he starts cutting it by hand. He also keeps many traditional designs available, as they are still popular. ""People seem to like handmade items,"" Graham says. ""They appreciate having something a little different.""

Graham does not plan to expand his business because he wants to keep it as a rural craft. ""I have found my place in the market. People love the uniqueness, and I feel satisfied when a simple shape becomes something almost lifelike,"" he says. ""For centuries, weathervanes have helped communities understand the weather by showing changes in wind direction."" He adds that with more people moving to the countryside, many want to add a special touch to their homes, which has helped crafts like his.

Graham is now busier than ever, sending flat-packed weathervanes to customers around the world, especially in America and Denmark. ""The price depends on how detailed the design is,"" he explains. His latest request was for a curly-coated dog. No matter the occasion, Graham can create a unique gift."
CAE_68,"**Text: Beginner Takes All**

Before it was even published, *The Horse Whisperer* was the most talked-about book of the year. This first novel by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans made him a lot of money. Here, he shares his inspiration and success.

The beginning of the year was tough for Nicholas Evans, who was a screenwriter, producer, and hoping to be a director. Things started badly when a film project he had been working on, *Life and Limb*, fell apart suddenly. He felt disappointed and worried because it had been two years since he had earned any money, and the promise of that film was his only hope against a very unhappy bank manager.

A sensible person in Evans' situation would have found a job. He could have returned to being a television executive or started a television project he had paused. Instead, he made a decision that many, including himself, would think was crazy. He bought a ticket to America and spent three months researching his first novel. Although he acted on impulse, the idea for the story had been in his mind for a while, inspired by a farrier he met in Dartmoor while visiting a friend. The farrier told him about a gentle horse that suddenly became aggressive for no reason. Its owners were desperate until they heard about a gypsy who could calm the horse just by talking to it. These people were called ""horse whisperers."" 

Evans was fascinated. He started researching the topic, initially planning to write a screenplay since he was a filmmaker. However, after feeling disillusioned with the film industry following the failure of *Life and Limb*, he decided to write the story as a book. Throughout the spring, he traveled across the US, visiting ranches and learning about horses and the people who work with them. ""It was a strange time,"" he recalls. ""I was watching people, but I felt very alone and thought my life was falling apart. I had tried for ten years to succeed as a filmmaker, and now I was in debt, worried about how to support my children, and wondering if it was all a mistake.""

By the end of August, after returning home and writing the first half of the book, he felt the pressure from the bank manager. He needed to know if it was worth continuing. He bravely showed the manuscript to a friend who was a literary agent. The agent read it and said it was ""fine."" When asked for an estimate, he suggested Evans might receive $30,000 as an advance for the book. Evans had a specific amount in mind to pay off some of his debts, and it was more than that. He had spent seven months on *The Horse Whisperer*, with at least two more months of work ahead. $30,000 was a challenging figure. He was also advised to write a 12-page summary of the rest of the book.

In October, along with the first two hundred pages of the novel, this summary was sent to seven UK publishers just before they left for the famous Frankfurt Book Fair. Within days, his agent called to say he had turned down the first offer of $75,000. ""What?"" Evans replied. The agent said, ""It's okay, I just feel something good is happening.""

What happened next is now part of publishing history. Within a week of competitive bidding, the novel was sold to Transworld Publications in the UK for £550,000 and to Delacorte in the US for $3.15 million, both record amounts for a first novel. ""We couldn't believe it; we were shocked. We had never sent the manuscript to New York, and we still don't know how it got there,"" Evans said. They also did not send it to Hollywood, but soon major studios were competing for it. ""My UK agent wisely involved an agent in the US, and when he called to say, 'I think we can get $3 million outright,' we laughed in disbelief."" 

As they all agreed to this amount, they decided to present their case to Evans. One night in October, he sat in his study while four famous filmmakers called one after another, asking to pay $3 million for an unfinished novel. Evans shared this story with me over coffee on his wooden porch overlooking his garden. He mentioned that he had turned down an offer to write the screenplay for *The Horse Whisperer*. ""It's been like a fairy tale so far. I don't want to ruin it. Writing at that level is very challenging, and I don't want to become just an employee of these people I like who have paid me so much. I would hate to write a draft or two and then have them say, 'Thanks, Nick, but now we’ll bring in someone else.'""

He said he would be involved but from a distance. The success of his novel led to new support for *Life and Limb*, but he was unsure if he wanted to make it anymore. ""I think it would be foolish not to write another novel,"" he said."

Bobby Fischer faces challenges as he tries to return to the world of chess. Chess has become more of a young person's game. After being away for 20 years, Fischer is back and playing against his old rival, Boris Spassky. Fischer won the first game, showcasing his skill, but he is not the same player he was in 1972. Now at 49 years old, he is out of practice and not in great shape. Spassky is even older. 

The game of chess has changed significantly in the last two decades. Fischer helped make chess popular, leading to a new era of professionalism. Today, winning is the main goal for chess players. In international chess, a player’s mental strength and endurance are just as important as their intelligence. The pressure in chess has always been high, with a chess clock ensuring players make their moves in a set time. If they fail to do so, they lose immediately. Now, games can last longer, and many are played without breaks, increasing the pressure on players. 

In the last 30 years, each new world champion has been younger than the last. Currently, eight of the ten highest-ranked players are under 30. The way chess is played has also evolved. Much of modern chess preparation happens off the board. Players must prepare thoroughly before matches, especially with the rise of computer databases that can store millions of chess games. These tools allow players to analyze their opponents' past games and find weaknesses. 

In recent matches, players have used teams of assistants to analyze their games continuously. The opening moves of a chess game are now studied in great detail, and being well-prepared can be crucial. Today, there are more top players than ever before, with many grandmasters competing for modest prizes worldwide. Success in chess requires both mental and physical effort, as a single game can last up to eight hours. 

During a game, players must maintain focus, as losing concentration can lead to failure. The presence of the chess clock adds to the stress, especially during the final moments of a game when players have only seconds to make their moves. In these intense situations, players must act quickly and decisively, resembling athletes in their coordination. 

At the highest level, losing is very painful, while winning brings great satisfaction and relief from stress. However, one victory is not enough to win a tournament. Chess tournaments usually last 9 to 11 days, with games played every day, and there are competitions throughout the year. World championship matches can be even more demanding. For example, the 1984 match between Anatoli Karpov and Gary Kasparov in Moscow had to be stopped after several months due to exhaustion, with Karpov losing about 10 kg.

Can Bobby Fischer overcome these challenges? He once said, ""All I want to do, ever, is play chess."" This statement makes his long absence from the game seem puzzling. However, it also adds to his legacy. If he has returned for financial reasons, he is likely to succeed, as both he and Spassky will earn millions from their match. But if Fischer believes he can prove he is still the best player, the outcome could be very disappointing for him."

Imogen Edwards-Jones interviews some of the new British talent, from poets to pop stars, who are rising to fame.

**A** Nick Grosso, in his early 30s, has written three well-received plays. He is now turning his first play, *Peaches*, into a movie script. ""It's low budget, but we don't know how low,"" he says. ""It won't be over £30 million, but it could be as little as £30."" Remarkably, before writing *Peaches*, Nick had never attended or read a play. ""When I wrote the play, I never thought it would be performed,"" he shares. ""It's set in a car. I probably wouldn't do that now because I understand the challenges involved. I knew nothing back then."" He left school at 16 but returned a year later. After completing his A-levels, he joined the Young People's Theatre. ""I realized I wanted to write for actors. I wanted my writing to be heard, not just read, because of its rhythm and rhyme,"" he explains. ""Suddenly, I was with people who thought like me. It was the first time I enjoyed being in an educational setting. It was very inspiring.""

**B** Comedian Simon Pegg, 28, has made significant progress in his career since studying drama at Bristol University. He is currently writing a TV comedy series and has just completed a demanding tour with comedy star Steve Coogan. He has always worked hard. Even during his time at Bristol, he was performing in comedy clubs. ""University was very theoretical,"" Simon recalls. ""It made me realize I didn't want to be a traditional actor; I was always more interested in comedy. People think comedy is the hardest job, but it really isn't. If you have courage and good material, it's wonderful to make people laugh."" He has performed with the comedy group Funny Business, but his collaboration with Steve Coogan has been the most successful. ""He saw my show, and since I was a big fan of his, he probably noticed I was imitating him,"" Simon admits.

**C** Ciaran McMenamin, 24, gained public attention as the lead in the series *The Young Person's Guide To Becoming A Rock Star*. The response was very positive, and his career has quickly taken off. ""It's been a great opportunity for me,"" he smiles. ""Now I can choose what I want to do, which is what I've always wanted."" This is a rare and comfortable position, especially since he has just graduated. Looking back at his early career, it's clear that such recognition was likely. Encouraged by his mother, he moved from leading roles in school to the Ulster Youth Theatre, where he spent four years. ""I was basically using acting as an excuse to avoid homework,"" Ciaran laughs. ""But then I decided I wanted to pursue it seriously because I had a talent and passion for it."" Now, he is waiting for the praise to come in, but when asked about fame, he becomes thoughtful. ""When you're 18, you think you'll love the photos and interviews, but you soon realize that's not why you act. It's about earning respect for doing good work.""

**D** Neil Taylor, 25, is the lead singer of the pop band Matrix, which has just signed a three-album deal with Domino Records. Neil and his bandmate Rick Brown are expected to be successful when their single, *Chimera*, is released soon. ""The record company's idea of good sales is very different from mine,"" he says. ""They want a hit, but I just want to be happy if two people buy it."" Unlike many new pop stars, Neil has worked hard for his success. He left school at 16 and has been trying to enter the music industry ever since. ""It's funny how things happen,"" he says. ""I had been performing at student gigs for eight years and was starting to feel discouraged. I was about to give up when I met Rick Brown, who had connections at Domino, and we formed Matrix. It couldn't have come at a better time. There were moments when I felt very down, and I had been in some terrible bands. But hopefully, it will all be worth it.""

**E** Poet and author Stephen Richards is 27 years old and has received more awards and honors than many people twice his age. He is well-known in the poetry community, where he has been touring and giving readings several times a week for the past six years. His first novel, *Hidden*, will be published in March. ""It's a story about obsessive love. It was a strong idea that I couldn't express as a poem."" Stephen loved creative writing in school but became disillusioned with education later. ""I chose not to go to university, but I realized I needed to after I got bored stuffing envelopes at a theater."" After university, he published his first work, a children's book, in 1992. ""I don't think my parents expected me to be a writer; they thought I would just be a reader because that's all I did as a child."" With his poetry receiving much praise, his transition to novels is indeed bold. ""My poetry has a structure, and there's less chance of making a big mistake,"" he explains. ""A novel can be any length, so there are more opportunities for bad writing. My main goal is to avoid falling into a routine where I produce work without caring about its quality."""

A. Isabel, the main character in this quirky novel, believes she looks good in jeans but rarely wears them because she doesn't want to associate with the wrong people. At 31, she is an art student who loves historical romances and is searching for Mr. Right, worried that her knobbly knees might ruin her chances. However, her hope helps her and others in the story. The author writes with great energy, using a style similar to early silent films, with chapter titles like ""Our Hero Feels Inspired.""

B. This story celebrates the rise and near-fall of a local radio station in America. It is told from the perspective of a clever, shy child named Francis With. He works for WLT (With Lettuce and Tomato) Radio, a station created by Roy and Ray Soderbjerg to promote their sandwich shop. The station broadcasts a mix of singers, preachers, soap-opera stars, and announcers. The small-town American setting allows the author to use dry humor and simple writing, taking readers back to the gentler times of the 1940s and 1950s, filled with dime stores, old cars, and radios.

C. In the author's world, it is normal for a second husband to talk with his wife's first husband. When professor Richard Vaisey falls for a beautiful Russian poet, he shares his feelings with his wife's ex-husband. The poet writes poor poetry, which bothers Richard, and she is also seeking his help for her wrongly imprisoned brother. However, the way the author unravels these issues is even more interesting. He moves the story forward with a strong sense of humor and carefully examines relationships, making it an enjoyable and clever read.

D. In 1960s London, two sets of best friends—two women and two men—are connected for 25 years through life and death. At the beginning of this long novel, James Hudson, a mysterious American businessman, is starting a newspaper, which his friend Richard Blake is editing. The newspaper launch is important, but so is the fact that they both loved a woman who was killed years ago. The story includes murder, ambition, love, and jealousy, all written well. This book allows readers to deeply connect with the characters.

E. This touching and funny story, written by a top American author, follows Ian Bedloe, who feels guilty about a past mistake. To make up for it, he becomes a 'father' to his brother's three orphaned children. At 40, he is slowly becoming an eccentric bachelor. The story explores many emotions and highlights the special bond Ian forms with the youngest child, Daphne. It is a warm book that perfectly balances sadness and humor."
CAE_53,"**Volunteer Tourism**

Four academic writers discuss international voluntary work. 

A. It is difficult to say that volunteer work significantly contributes to development. While volunteer tourists can help build homes or schools, they often pay a large fee to participate. This money, if given directly to a local community, could pay for more labor than the individual volunteer could provide. This is particularly true for gap year volunteers, who usually lack the necessary skills or experience. Therefore, many studies raise the question of whether gap year volunteering is mainly driven by a desire to help others or if young people are more interested in gaining experience that will benefit their careers. However, these projects may help develop individuals who will act ethically in their future careers.

B. Volunteering can lead to better international understanding, improved conflict resolution skills, and increased participation in global issues through civic organizations. It can also create international social networks among ordinary people. In this way, the overall impact can be greater than the individual contributions, benefiting both volunteers and host communities, and contributing to the global good. However, if volunteering is mostly done by wealthy individuals, it may provide them with a broader perspective and career advantages, but it will not significantly help those who lack access to such opportunities. Volunteers may continue to benefit personally while using host organizations and communities for their own advancement.

C. At its worst, international volunteering can be seen as a form of imperialism or self-serving charity, where wealthy Westerners seek personal development. At its best, it can provide benefits to both volunteers and the organizations they work with, allowing for the exchange of skills, knowledge, and cultural experiences in developing communities. Most importantly, volunteering can raise awareness and foster a lifelong commitment to addressing issues of inequality, poverty, and unsustainable development.

D. Volunteer tourism aligns with the growing trend of personal strategies to help others. These limited strategies, focused on making a small difference, can seem positive in a time when political action is less popular. The personal aspect appears beneficial as it avoids large government and business involvement. However, it also neglects the need for democratic governance and reduces development to individual acts of charity, often failing to address the deeper issues faced by poor rural communities. While skepticism about volunteering is often misplaced, the act of volunteer tourism can sometimes be seen as simple charity. However, when it is promoted as sustainable development and when gap-year companies market their services as part of development efforts, it can dilute the true meaning of development. The politics of volunteer tourism can reflect a retreat from understanding global inequalities and the poverty experienced by many in developing countries."
CAE_55,"**Sound the Alarm**

Stuart Harris reports that many people listen to the radio in the morning and need something to help them get out of bed. This is why clock radios are popular. But how do you choose a good one? A panel, including myself, inventor Tom Granger, and broadcaster Paul Bridges, tested five models currently available.

One model has a 'dual alarm function' that I initially thought would let you wake up to a buzzer, snooze for a bit, and then get up. However, the instruction booklet suggests using this feature to set two different wake-up times: one for weekdays and one for weekends. But who really plans their life like that? This model costs about the same as another we tested, but it includes a cassette player, which is a nice bonus—you can listen to your favorite tapes as you fall asleep and wake up to music instead of news. We all agreed that the radio quality was excellent, but the size was an issue; it was as big as a rugby ball. Paul Bridges mentioned that any clock radio he buys must leave enough space on his bedside table for his keys, wallet, glasses, and phone. He also said he always books a wake-up call just in case the alarm fails.

This model was voted the best in terms of appearance and overall performance. Paul Bridges said he was ""in love with it,"" even though the clock he tested kept getting stuck at 16:00. I found the digital display attractive, with its grey numbers on a soft green background. The wide snooze button is easy to tap even with your eyes closed. However, the smooth buttons, which felt nice to touch, distracted me when I finally looked at the instruction booklet. The clock has a backup battery, so you don’t have to reset it if the power goes out, which we all liked. However, we found it complicated to set up, but mastering it made us feel sophisticated.

Tom Granger criticized this model for its built-in lamp, calling it ""unbelievably tacky."" He had to read the instructions twice to get it to work because the clock kept jumping from 12:00 to 02:00. The lamp was difficult to position and not bright enough to read by, as it only lit up the clock, which was already illuminated. Paul Bridges found the lamp amusing but agreed that tuning the radio was challenging. The buzzer sounded like an alarm on a submarine, making me want to throw it across the room. Interestingly, this model is the third most popular on the market. Aimed at young people, its bright colors appealed to the child in both Tom Granger and me. Tom said he would choose this one because it stands out more than the others. In fact, its traditional controls were the only ones we could set up without reading the instructions. Unfortunately, the alarm has a funny 20-minute error margin; the manual states, ""the alarm may sound about 10 minutes earlier or later than the set time."" Paul Bridges laughed at this, calling the model ""terribly fiddly"" and ""completely useless.""

The simplest and cheapest model we tested scored points with Tom Granger because it was ""very standard and took up little space,"" and it had old-fashioned dial tuning. He said, ""It's more intuitive to set up. With modern push-button tuning, you’re never sure if you pressed all the buttons correctly, so you can’t be confident it will work."" He acknowledged that manufacturers had to improve radio quality due to the rise of button-tuning. I found the tuning a bit rough, as did Paul Bridges, but we agreed that the radio quality was good. The buzzer on this model worked well; it got me out of bed in just two beeps!"
CAE_50,"**Hedgehogs**

A hedgehog is a small mammal known for the sharp spines that cover its body. Hedgehogs live in many parts of the world, but none are native to America or Australia. All hedgehog species can roll into a tight ball when threatened, with their spines pointing outward for protection. The effectiveness of this defense depends on how many spines the hedgehog has. Some desert hedgehogs have adapted to their environment and have fewer spines, making them more likely to run away from danger instead of rolling up, using their ball-rolling ability only as a last option.

Hedgehogs are mainly active at night and sleep during the day, often hiding under bushes or in holes in the ground. While all hedgehogs can hibernate, not all of them do; some will stay awake all year if the conditions are right."
CAE_25,"**Great Sportswomen on a Winning Streak**

Excelling in any sport is challenging, even for men, but women often face even greater difficulties. Training and competing leave little time for a normal life, requiring many sacrifices. Despite these challenges, women are overcoming prejudice and setting new records. Here, we highlight some remarkable British sportswomen who are achieving their goals.

**A. Jill, 27, Skier**  
""It's an amazing feeling to fly through the air and land safely, but it can be frightening. Sometimes I don’t feel well, or the weather is bad, but I push through. Having a career outside of skiing is tough because we train for ten months each year. I have to give up a lot of my social life and friends, but it was my choice. There are six men and three women on the British team. We all compete on the same courses and are treated equally—it's a young sport.""

**B. Caroline, 22, Cyclist**  
""Two years ago, I borrowed a bike to join a charity race and surprisingly won because I cycled faster than everyone else, even though I had never cycled before! I earn a good salary as a professional cyclist, and there are many opportunities for endorsements. However, I worry that people might think I succeeded because of my looks rather than my skills. So, I focus on cycling instead of making money. I train for at least four hours every day, plus I do stretching, swimming, and running. My boyfriend is also a cyclist, so he understands the commitment needed.""

**C. Annabel, 26, Rower**  
""Rowing is difficult for girls to start because very few schools offer it. Most girls begin at 19 or 20, which makes it harder to compete internationally. Additionally, coaches often change frequently, leading to instability in the women's team. Despite these challenges, I enjoy it and love staying fit, plus there’s a good social aspect.""

**D. Ffyona, 24, Long-Distance Walker**  
""When I was 13, I dreamed of walking around the world, not realizing how vast it was! I found Britain too safe and restrictive. I was very determined and disliked being controlled. Each walk has been unique. The walk across Australia was the hardest experience due to the pain. I walked 50 miles a day with only three hours of sleep in extreme heat, suffering from many blisters. But I set a record! I had to, as my sponsorship money was running out after 95 days. Some men believe women are more likely to fail, so they see sponsoring us as a risk.""

**E. Lisa, 26, Saloon Car Racer**  
""Some men have big egos when driving, which is noticeable on the roads. When I perform well, they often ignore me. Being a woman has its challenges. When I approach a corner, men think they must beat me, so I’ve had my share of accidents! You need to be competitive and aggressive. It’s hard to earn money, and what I do make goes back into the sport. Women have been racing since the 1920s and have often been seen as unusual. It’s great that more women are joining racing every year. For me, the thrill of saloon car racing is striving for perfection and aiming for the perfect lap.""

**F. Alison, 28, Triathlete**  
""I wake up at 5:30 three mornings a week to swim. I need Tuesday and Thursday mornings to catch up on sleep. In the evenings, I cycle or run. Yes, I sometimes fall asleep at my desk! There’s a lot of nervousness before races, and I really push myself—if I don’t, I feel bad. I’ve often wondered why I do this. The answers are: a) I feel happier when I stay fit, b) I would be lazy if I didn’t push myself, and c) racing is very social. Men and women usually compete together, but when events are covered in the media, 90% of the focus is on the men's events, with only 10% mentioning the women's results. The prize money is also less for women. However, we have now established an International Triathlon Women's Commission to address these issues."""

The day I met Picasso, Richard Cork remembers how, as a student at 78 years old, he encountered one of the greatest artists of the century. Even from a distance, while he was eating lunch at an outdoor restaurant in Cannes, Picasso was easy to recognize. At that time, I was an 18-year-old student traveling around Europe and Morocco in an old, unreliable van. I had run out of money and found a job painting boats by the waterfront. However, I spent a lot of time drawing and was lucky to have a sketchbook with me when I met the famous artist.

Picasso was known to be a private person who usually worked alone in the hills. So, I was very surprised to see him sitting at a table with his wife, Jacqueline, and three friends. Without my friend's encouragement, I would never have approached him to ask for his signature. I was nervous as I introduced myself and offered my sketchbook, but to my surprise, he agreed. He wrote his name at the top of the page and then added a lively drawing below. Even when Picasso's art was abstract, it often connected to real things. The lines he drew might represent a cloud, the sea, or the shape of Cannes harbor, which he could see from where he was sitting.

I thanked him and started a hesitant conversation. Since Picasso's English was not very good and my French was even worse, an American woman at the table helped translate. She kept calling him ""the Maestro,"" which made it hard for me to speak freely. Still, I managed to tell Picasso about my strong interest in art and my admiration for his work. After a while, I went back to the boat and proudly showed my friend what I had. But he noticed that the lunch was still going on. ""Is that all?"" he asked, looking at the signature. ""Why don’t you go back and take advantage of this opportunity? You might not get another chance like this, and he probably wouldn’t mind if you drew his portrait.""

With my sketchbook in hand, I returned to Picasso's table. I thought it was best not to ask if I could draw him, as he might say no and ruin the moment. So, I just stood by the table, set my pad against a screen, took out a crayon, and began to draw. When Picasso saw me, he smiled mischievously and made it hard for me to draw. He acted out funny and strange expressions—rolling his eyes, sticking out his tongue, and making silly shapes with his hands. It was like he was a playful clown. I felt like giving up, but his playful spirit seemed to challenge me to keep going. Despite his antics, I thought he was testing my determination.

Eventually, Picasso relaxed and allowed me to study him without distractions. I noticed how strong and alert he looked, wearing a blue-and-white striped shirt. He seemed more like a fit 60-year-old than a man about to turn 84. His dark eyes were youthful and intense, and I tried to capture that in my drawing. They were captivating, and he didn’t blink as he looked around. Even though he was surrounded by friends, he seemed distant and alone. His playful behavior hid a serious side. He let his friends talk while he sat quietly, focused on his own thoughts.

When the American woman told me that Picasso wanted to see my drawing, I felt embarrassed and said it wasn’t good enough. But Picasso insisted, and when I showed him my sketchbook, he nodded approvingly. To my surprise, he then said it was his turn to draw. I quickly gave him my crayon, and he made a few quick, confident strokes on the paper. In seconds, he drew a face that was very different from my careful attempt. He had moved one of my eyes onto my nose and captured my smile with a single lively line. I looked like a character from one of his playful artworks. Maybe he saw me as someone from another world, amazed to meet an artist he admired.

I thanked Picasso and asked if he would sign my drawing. After talking with the American woman, she explained that he said I already had his signature. So, there were limits to his generosity! Still, I look back and feel grateful. Meeting Picasso and receiving his attention meant a lot to me."
CAE_12,"**Text: Shopping Strategies**

Have you ever gone into a store and ended up buying more than you planned? This text explains the techniques that shops use to encourage you to spend more money.

**A. Freshness Appeal**  
Supermarkets understand that customers value fresh food. To create this impression, they often place fruits and vegetables at the entrance or display house plants. They might also have a bakery that fills the store with the smell of fresh bread. The colors in the store, like green, are chosen because they remind people of fresh produce. However, most items sold in supermarkets, like frozen foods and cleaning products, do not match this fresh image.

**B. Strategic Product Placement**  
The placement of products in a store is crucial for sales, especially in supermarkets. With advanced stock management systems, supermarkets can identify which areas attract the most shoppers. They place high-profit items in these areas, while also using eye-level shelves to promote certain brands. Special bins with discounts attract bargain hunters, and complementary items, like desserts next to ice cream, encourage additional purchases.

**C. Spreading Essentials**  
Supermarkets often place low-cost essentials like bread and sugar far from the entrance. This forces shoppers to walk past more expensive items, increasing the chances of impulse buys. Chain stores also position their popular products away from the entrance, hoping loyal customers will search for them and encounter other tempting items along the way.

**D. Less is More**  
In recent years, chain stores have changed how they display products. For example, the Next chain has moved away from a crowded display style to a more boutique-like approach, showcasing limited fashion items. This creates an impression of exclusivity, even though their clothing is still mass-produced. Their success is due to both effective store design and appealing clothing.

**E. Total Costs Matter**  
Food shoppers often focus more on the total cost of their shopping rather than the price of individual items. Supermarkets mix low-cost staples with higher-priced items to attract customers. They may even sell some staples at a loss to draw in shoppers, a strategy known as ""loss leaders."" They achieve low prices by buying in bulk and negotiating discounts with manufacturers.

**F. The Price Tag**  
Customers tend to buy fewer items in chain stores and pay more attention to individual prices. For example, pricing a blouse at £14.99 instead of £15 can influence buying decisions. This pricing strategy also helps reduce theft, as employees must ring up sales to give change.

**G. Effective Lighting**  
Both supermarkets and chain stores carefully consider lighting. Chain stores aim for lighting that resembles natural daylight, helping customers see the true colors of clothing. Supermarkets use special lighting and mirrors to highlight fresh produce.

**H. Store Layout**  
Many chain stores use different carpet patterns to guide shoppers through the store. These paths, known as the ""Yellow Brick Road,"" encourage customers to explore. Some stores, like Marks and Spencer, use attractive flooring to lead shoppers into sales areas.

**I. In-Store Advertising**  
As you enter a supermarket, large colorful images of delicious food catch your eye, especially if you are hungry. In the U.S., some supermarkets are testing ""video trolleys"" that display advertisements as you shop. These trolleys use sensors to show relevant ads, aiming to increase impulse purchases by about 30%."
CAE_26,"**Text: Sea, Ice & Rock**

Chris Bonnington, aged 58, is famous for reaching the top of Everest in 1985. He has also created new climbing routes in Britain and the Alps and has written many books, such as *Quest for Adventure* and *Everest the Hard Way*. Robin Knox-Johnston, who is 53, started his career at sea in the Merchant Navy. In 1968-1969, he became the first person to sail around the world alone in his yacht, Sunhaili. He also set a record for crossing the Atlantic Ocean, taking just 10 days to sail from New York to the Lizard in England. 

Chris and Robin worked together to sail and climb in Greenland, documenting their journey in their new book, *Sea, Ice and Rock*. In 1979, while I was working on *Quest for Adventure*, I called Robin for an interview. He invited me to join him for a sail, where I could teach him some climbing techniques, and he could teach me the basics of sailing. It was my first experience on a yacht. We sailed for a while and then anchored. Robin's wife and daughter stayed on the boat while we paddled to shore to practice climbing. The route was challenging, but I was impressed by how steady Robin was in difficult conditions. 

When we reached a large drop, I asked Robin if he had ever climbed before. He hadn’t, so I showed him how to do it. After I finished, Robin politely asked if he could descend using the ropes from his boat. He was used to using his arms, while I wanted him to use his legs. I was a bit worried, but he managed to lower himself down safely. During that trip to Skye, Robin and I formed a strong friendship. His suggestion that we combine our skills for a trip to Greenland was a natural progression from our Skye adventure. 

I was very impressed by Robin as a leader. Normally, the captain makes all the decisions, but Robin always consulted the crew first. Most of the time, no one dared to give him advice, but it felt good to be part of the decision-making. To be honest, I found sailing quite challenging and boring. The moments of crisis were easier to handle because they got my adrenaline pumping. However, I struggled with spending days in the middle of the sea. I prefer being on land and am not very handy. In contrast, Robin is a natural sailor and enjoyed fixing the engine or repairing the toilet. I realized that Robin didn’t really need my help, which sometimes made me feel useless.

The crew was also cramped, with six people on a 32-foot yacht designed for four. On a mountain expedition, you can get some space from each other. When we arrived in Greenland and it was my turn to lead the expedition, I found it hard to take responsibility for Robin’s safety. There were many times when, if Robin had fallen, he could have pulled me down with him. I had to be very careful. I underestimated how difficult climbing the Cathedral, Greenland's highest mountain, would be. Robin is not a natural climber, which made his efforts even more impressive. 

The first time we tried to reach the top, we were active for 24 hours. On the way down, we were so tired that we almost fell asleep on steep slopes, 1,500 feet above the ground. Robin faced many challenges, but he completely trusted me and just followed my lead. When it became too difficult and I realized we had to turn back, he accepted my decision. I also knew that Robin was worried about the boat: whether it could get through the ice and if it was still intact. However, he was supportive of trying to climb the mountain again.

The only time we had a serious issue was on the yacht on the way home. We were taking turns to keep watch. I was supposed to wake up at 4 am for my shift, but Robin decided not to wake me, thinking he could handle it alone. The night before, I had almost fallen asleep. I felt that he didn’t trust me, which made me feel insecure, and I expressed this to him. Robin quickly reassured me that I had misunderstood the situation. While we enjoyed the trip to Skye, we truly got to know each other by the end of the Greenland expedition. I discovered that beneath his tough exterior, Robin was a kind-hearted and sensitive person."
CAE_8,"**A History of the Apple**

Apples have been part of human life for thousands of years, existing in many different colors, shapes, and sizes. However, in the late twentieth century, we risk losing this rich heritage.

**Prehistoric Times (8,000 BC)**  
Humans have eaten apples since prehistoric times. In neolithic Britain, they would spit out apple seeds. Around 10,000 years ago, they left apple remains that turned to carbon near their homes by lakes in Switzerland and Italy. In Switzerland and near the Caucasus mountains, ancient people even stored dried apple halves for winter. These apples were wild crab apples, small and shriveled, which were known in Ancient Britain as 'windings.' They were very different from the apples we eat today.

**Norman Influence (1000 AD)**  
The French learned advanced fruit-growing techniques from the Romans, which were further developed in monasteries. This knowledge included cider-making and was brought to Britain during Roman times. One dessert apple, called Decio, was thought to have been introduced by the Roman general, Etio. However, many Roman apple varieties did not thrive in the British climate, and Norman varieties quickly became more popular. British monks continued to experiment and create new apple varieties, which are the ancestors of most Western apples today.

**Medieval Favorites (1200)**  
During the thirteenth century, several apple types became common in Britain. The Old English Pearmain, noted in 1204 for its pear-like shape, was the main dessert apple until the eighteenth century. The Costard was a popular cooking apple sold in Oxford markets from 1296 until the late seventeenth century, and it gave rise to the term 'costermonger,' meaning a street seller of fruits and vegetables. However, the country faced challenges like droughts, the Black Death, and the Wars of the Roses, leading to fewer apples being produced and more being imported. This situation continued until the sixteenth century when King Henry VIII sent his chief fruit expert, Richard Harris, to France to learn about apple growing. Harris returned with many grafts, including the famous Pippins, and established the first modern-style orchard in Teynham, Kent.

**Settler Treasures (1750)**  
By the seventeenth century, apples were so popular in Britain that the first settlers who traveled to Canada, Australia, the US, South Africa, and New Zealand took apples and seeds with them, considering them valuable possessions. Captain Bligh of the Bounty brought the first apples to Australia, Jan van Riebeeck took them to South Africa, and the Pilgrim Fathers carried them to America. In North America, the well-known apple planter was John Chapman, also known as 'Johnny Appleseed.' Born in 1774, he planted apple nurseries from Pennsylvania to Indiana. Native Americans viewed him as a medicine man, and his love for apple trees, unique clothing, and religious beliefs led to many folktales about him, including one that said he was so kind to animals that he even slept with bears.

**Modern Delicious (1850)**  
Around this time in Iowa, a Quaker farmer named Jesse Hiatt found a new apple tree growing from the roots of a dead tree. He named this apple 'Hawkey.' After he presented it at a fruit show, a judge tasted it and exclaimed, ""Delicious!"" In 1895, this apple was introduced to the market as 'Delicious' and became one of the most widely grown apples in the world.

**Granny Smith (1850)**  
Another famous modern apple was discovered in Australia by Maria Anne Smith. She was the daughter of convicts but chose to live independently, rejecting her parents' criminal past and the colonial system. Working as a midwife in Eastwood, New South Wales, she became known as 'Granny Smith' for managing the family farm and orchard. In 1868, she found a small tree growing among discarded fruit. She transplanted it, and soon she was harvesting the first major crop of green apples, which became famous worldwide. When asked about the tree's origin, she said, ""Well, it's just like God to make something useful out of what we think is rubbish,"" referring to both the apple and her own background.

**Uniformity Issues (1950)**  
Today, apples are grown globally, from Himachal Pradesh in northern India to luxury orchards in Africa. However, most apples are commercially grown and come from only a few varieties, often chosen for their red skin or ability to travel well, rather than for their taste. This trend of uniformity is dulling our taste and reducing genetic diversity. While amateur gardeners in the UK have preserved many old apple varieties, the US has lost most of its apple types from a century ago. Fortunately, consumers are beginning to demand more variety. We cannot rely solely on amateur gardeners to save apple diversity or any other food. We must advocate for a world that values and protects natural diversity for everyone's benefit."

**Small Groups**

Our groups are small, averaging 16 people, and are led by experienced guides. This allows you to truly discover the places we visit. Being part of a small group means you can connect more with the local culture and people, making for a rewarding experience.

**Different Modes of Travel**

We use various forms of transport during our trips, often combining several on the same journey. You might travel by coach, local bus, train, minibus, boat, canoe, camel, light plane, or even on foot. Each trip reflects the character of the local environment.

**Who Travels with Explore?**

Our travelers are interesting individuals who are ready to embrace new experiences. Most come from the UK, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the USA. Our trips are designed for anyone in good health who is reasonably fit and adaptable. Most participants are between 25 and 55 years old, with about half being couples and the rest solo travelers.

**Activities and Interests**

Each trip with Explore Worldwide is unique, so we categorize our adventures into eight different themes, highlighting key activities and interests. Each category showcases special features of a tour, but many other elements contribute to the overall success of the trips, such as unique locations, cultural encounters, and personal experiences.

**Cultural/Adventure**

Most of our trips have a strong cultural aspect, with some focusing primarily on local cultures and historical sites. Destinations of cultural interest include Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Yemen, Turkey, Greece, India, Bhutan, Thailand, China, Peru, Bolivia, Guatemala, and Belize. Many trips include short walks to visit lesser-known sites.

**Wildlife and Natural History**

Our wildlife safaris take you to some of the best game parks in the world, allowing thrilling encounters with animals in their natural habitats. In Africa, you might have the chance to explore the wild on foot, tracking animals like the rare silver-back mountain gorilla or going on bush walks with local guides. Most safaris involve camping, but some offer hotel accommodations.

**Ethnic Encounters**

A highlight of our adventures is meeting ethnic or tribal peoples, such as the Tuareg of the Sahara or the Maya of Mexico. Many of these groups have traditional lifestyles that are under threat. We travel in small groups to promote understanding and respect for different cultures while minimizing our impact on their environments.

**Easy/Moderate Hiking**

Many trips include easy walking through beautiful countryside, often staying in rented accommodations or hotels. Some involve village-to-village hiking, where you may stay overnight in local homes or simple huts. Destinations for these hikes include Spain, Greece, Morocco, and Thailand. On longer hikes, your main luggage is transported separately, so you only carry a small daypack.

**Major Treks**

We offer a few challenging treks for experienced hikers, sometimes at high altitudes. These trips may involve staying with local people or camping in stunning mountain ranges like the Himalayas or the Andes. Support vehicles and porters are usually provided, so you won’t need to carry heavy gear.

**Wilderness Experience**

Exploring remote wilderness areas is an exciting adventure. These places, like the Amazon Rainforest or the Sahara Desert, offer unique experiences for adventurous travelers.

**Sailtreks/Seatreks**

These relaxing holidays involve traveling by local boats, such as feluccas in Egypt or gulets in Turkey. We also explore the Galapagos Islands on a small motor yacht.

Our river trips in India, Africa, and the Amazon provide a unique view of the local landscapes and wildlife."
CAE_30,"Text: Richard Nerurkar, a top 10,000-metre runner from Britain, visits a high-altitude training camp in Kenya. Located ten miles south of the equator, a sunny mountain track leads from a quiet road in Nairobi. This track begins the journey up Mount Kenya, the country’s highest peak. For the past three years, I have used Nanyuk as my base for winter altitude training in Kenya's Central Highlands. However, I had never trained with Kenyan runners before. On my fourth winter training trip to Kenya, I decided to change that. I participated in my first race in Kenya and stayed at the national team training camp, where the best runners prepare for the World Cross-Country Team Championships. I received this opportunity after finishing fifth in the World Championship 10,000 meters race, behind three Kenyans and a Moroccan. Training at high altitude increases the number of red blood cells, which helps improve oxygen delivery in the body. This has contributed to the success of many Kenyan runners.

My first race in Africa was also significant because it was the first international cross-country race held on the continent, taking place in Nairobi. It was a humbling experience, as 41 runners finished ahead of me, with only three not being Kenyan. Despite this, I felt I had performed well. However, I believe that Kenyan success is not solely due to altitude. Kenyan runners have a straightforward approach to the sport. Their running style appears effortless, their diet is simple, and they enjoy competing. One important aspect of their success is their training methods, which I learned about during my time at the training camp.

The national team camp is located at St Mark's College, 6,200 feet up the southern slope of Mt Kenya, surrounded by beautiful fields and tropical plants. The facilities are basic, with athletes living among regular students in shared dormitories. Their daily routine includes three workouts: a relaxed morning run, interval training mid-morning, and a steady run in the late afternoon. The day starts at six in the morning, with a briefing from the coaches. We were reminded to take it easy during the morning run, as a harder workout was planned for later. Each day, we covered about 40 kilometers, except on Sundays when we only ran 20 kilometers, which was a welcome break.

Life at the camp was simple. A splash of water on the face and brushing teeth were enough for morning preparations. Breakfast included tea, bread, and boiled eggs in a small dining area. Lunch and dinner were similar, featuring ugali (a maize dish), stew, cabbage or spinach, and tea. After running, we would drive to bathe in streams fed by Mt Kenya's glaciers. By the end of my stay, I gained a deeper appreciation for Kenyan success. It cannot be explained by genetics, upbringing, or altitude alone. I began to think that the simplicity of life in the mountains, the intense training, and the passion for success might be the true reasons behind Kenya's dominance in distance running."
CAE_7,"**Text: The Challenges of Mass Marketing**

As many people know, advertising is struggling. This issue is not only due to the recession; advertising began to decline in early 1989, before the recession really affected the economy. The problems with advertising are deeper and are happening all over the world. The sad truth is that advertising has not kept up with changes in the economy. Advertisers often think about mass markets and mass media, but as brands and media have increased, target markets have become more divided. Even campaigns for well-known brands should focus on smaller audiences, but they usually do not.

Consider your own shopping habits. When you go to a supermarket, you might buy 30, 40, or even 50 items. Most of these items are not from advertised brands, and you may buy several of the same brand. In total, you probably only buy a few advertised brands from the thousands available in the store. Over a year, you are unlikely to buy more than a few hundred different brands. For durable goods, you might buy about a dozen a year, and for cars, you may only buy one every three years. Even when you include all types of products and services, it is likely that you do not purchase more than 400 different brands in a year. 

In contrast, there are about 32,500 branded goods and services that are advertised. If we focus on the 9,500 brands that are individually listed and analyzed, the average person only buys about 400 of these brands, which is only about 4 percent. This challenges the common belief that half of advertising is wasted, as it suggests that 96 percent of advertising may not lead to purchases, but we cannot know which part is wasted.

When you watch TV, try to count how many commercials are for brands you buy or might buy in the future. Most people find that only about 6 percent of the commercials are relevant to them, meaning that 94 percent may be wasted. Many people believe they are not influenced by advertising, but the reality is that most people do not buy most of the brands they see advertised. 

Waste is a natural part of advertising. The idea that every person who sees an advertisement will rush to buy the product is unrealistic. People only remember a small number of ads and ignore the rest, so some waste is unavoidable. However, this does not mean that advertising is not effective. Many advertisements have shown that it can work. Advertisers need to reach a large audience to connect with the smaller group that will respond, as they cannot predict who will be interested in their products.

Even with careful targeting, advertisers cannot know exactly who will respond to their ads. For example, even the best direct mail campaigns do not achieve a 100 percent response rate. This is a key difference between media advertising and personal selling. A salesperson might succeed with every potential client they meet, but this is not possible with media advertising. If advertisers knew exactly who would respond, they would communicate with them directly instead of using mass media.

Any advertiser who can attract one million new customers, which is about 2 percent of the adult population, is considered successful. For popular products, gaining a million extra customers would be a great achievement. Therefore, any advertising campaign that can reach 2 percent of the population would be seen as very successful, even though this is a small part of the total population. While mass media can be an effective way to reach people, if advertising is to improve, it must focus more on specific audiences than ever before."
CAE_43,"**Simplified Text:**

**Solar Survivor: Charles Clover Visits Britain's Greenest Home**

Charles Clover explores one of the most environmentally-friendly homes in Britain, located in Southwell, Nottinghamshire. This area has some interesting features. First, it is home to Southwell Minster, a little-known ancient cathedral. Writers who care about the environment admire the 'green' men figures carved by medieval craftsmen in the cathedral's thirteenth-century chapter house. 

The second surprise is the 'autonomous house,' built by Robert and Brenda Vale. This house is designed to be very eco-friendly. The Vales collect rainwater for drinking and washing, recycle their sewage into compost for their garden, and use waste heat from their electrical appliances and their own body heat to warm the house. This includes heat from their three teenage children and their two cats, Edison and Faraday. 

The house looks traditional, with a roof made of clay tiles, and is located 300 yards from the Minster. It was designed to match the orange brick of the town's nineteenth-century buildings and received approval from planners, even though it is in a conservation area. When you ring the solar-powered doorbell, you will notice complete silence. The house is very well insulated, with special triple-glazed windows that keep out noise. 

Inside, after taking off your shoes (as Robert requests), you will find a peaceful atmosphere. On a sunny summer day, the windows are closed, and the conservatory warms the air before it circulates through the house. Robert opens clever ventilation shafts and windows to create airflow, as the house is designed to be draught-proof. Even the cats have their own small air-locked door.

The Vales, who teach architecture at Nottingham University, have cared about the environment for many years. They wrote a book on green architecture in the 1970s called *The Autonomous House*. They aimed to create a building that produced no carbon dioxide. They then decided to eliminate the need for mains water as well. They designed composting toilets, installed rainwater tanks in the cellar, and used copper gutters to keep drinking water clean, filtering it before use. Water from washing goes into the garden, and they do not use a dishwasher because they believe it is wrong to use strong detergents.

Robert explains, ""We wanted to show that it is possible to design a house that is much better for the environment without living in darkness. It does not have to be medieval."" The only medieval feature is the hall, which includes the fireplace and staircase, stretching the full height of the house. 

The Vales do not pay water bills, and last winter, their house used only nine units of electricity a day, costing about 70p. This is much less than what other four-bedroom houses use for heating. Soon, they will install solar water heating panels and equipment in the garden, which will allow the house to generate more electricity than it needs. One day, they hope to have enough electricity to charge an electric car.

The only source of heat in the house is a small wood-burning stove in the hall, which the Vales say they only use during the coldest winter days. When I visited in February, Robert was reading and said it was too warm to light the fire. The temperature on the first floor was 18°C, which is lower than what is usually expected, but he found it comfortable because there were no draughts and everything felt warm to the touch. 

Robert points out that a woman living in the early 1900s felt comfortable at 12.5°C because of her warm clothing. He suggests that people living in older homes should adapt to how people lived back then, but this idea may not be popular. 

The secret to the house's success is its simple design, which means there is little that can go wrong. Most materials were bought from a local builder's merchant and installed by local craftsmen, making the house affordable to build. It cost the same per square meter as low-cost rental housing. Unsurprisingly, commercial building companies are not keen on this idea."
CAE_51,"Text: 'The Camera Never Lies

Arthur Conan Doyle, the writer of the Sherlock Holmes stories, considered himself a rational person and even a scientist. However, in 1920, he saw photographs of fairies taken in a garden and believed they were real evidence of these tiny creatures. He published these photos with an article where he accepted fairies as supernatural beings. It was not until 1939 that the two women who took the photos confessed they were fake. They had simply cut out pictures of fairies from a book and placed them among flowers. The photos are undeniably beautiful, but the simplicity of the trick challenges a basic idea of photography: that the camera cannot lie. In reality, it can, and it always has. Today, we often use computer software to edit our digital images, and it is a myth that photography ever had a time when it was completely honest. From the beginning, when cameras started capturing reality, that reality was being changed.'"
CAE_11,"**Text: Blacksmiths**

Throughout history, iron has captured human imagination, and blacksmiths, who work with it, have often been seen as more than just skilled workers. Before the Industrial Revolution, blacksmiths held a status similar to that of doctors and astrologers because they were the only ones who made weapons, armor, and farming tools. They were also celebrated as artists. In the 18th century, blacksmiths created beautiful ironwork for St. Paul's Cathedral, and the elegant metalwork in French and Belgian Art Nouveau architecture was crafted by talented blacksmiths.

However, by the late 1960s, the number of blacksmiths in Britain had greatly decreased because heavy industry no longer needed their skills, and modern architects rarely used the graceful wrought iron designs. In the last ten years, there has been a revival of interest in decorative architecture and a more open-minded approach to interior design. Still, much of the work produced seems clichéd, with manufacturers of gates and balconies promoting their products as ""classical"" or ""Victorian-style."" You can hardly enter a trendy design store without seeing rusty candlesticks with unnecessary decorations.

Fortunately, there are alternatives, and a series of events in the coming weeks aims to promote the blacksmithing craft. The first event, an exhibition of forged ironwork by members of the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA), opened last week at the Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey. Alan Dawson, the secretary of BABA, states, ""We could be at the start of a new Iron Age, as both the public and blacksmiths are seeing things differently."" Power tools have made it easier for blacksmiths to work with metal, allowing them to bend, split, twist, and weld with less effort. Dawson adds, ""These artists now have a material that lets them express themselves.""

About 250 pieces have been created for the exhibition, including bookends and a spiral staircase. Prices start at £90 and can go up to several thousand pounds. Most of the money will go to the individual makers, but a portion of each sale will be kept by the Association to promote good ironwork. Dawson's contributions include an eight-foot gate and a lamp with a mouth-blown glass shade. He explains, ""My style comes from letting steel bend and flow into shape when it's hot. It's like drawing with metal in space.""

Many artists are fascinated by iron. Unlike most metals, which are soft when cold, iron and steel are tougher and more challenging to work with. Susan May, a trained jeweler, describes it as ""magical"" because it is very soft when hot but becomes hard and unyielding when it cools. Ann Catrin Evans creates mild steel door knockers and handles inspired by the dark castles often seen in horror films. One of her designs looks like a ball and chain, while another resembles a Celtic cross. She says, ""I love that steel is cold and hard, and it feels like it will last forever.""

No other metal has given people as much visual pleasure or a greater sense of security. It is likely that iron will continue to be used decoratively for the next thousand years, as long as we can avoid seeing any more rusty candlesticks."
CAE_14,"**Text: 'THE DAY I GAVE UP SMOKING'**

I thought everyone would be happy when I stopped smoking, but one of my colleagues was very angry. ""What do you mean?"" she shouted. ""If it was that easy, why didn't you stop years ago?"" I found it hard to explain how I went from being a heavy smoker to not smoking at all in just a few hours. It was a bit annoying, even for me. The stop-smoking session I attended was a mix of group therapy and hypnotherapy, and it happened two months and three weeks ago. I hadn’t planned to quit, and I didn’t really want to. I felt pressured by anti-smoking groups, which I still resent. Also, I had low blood pressure and a healthy family. I didn’t cough or feel sick, and I seemed to recover from colds faster than friends who lived healthier lives.

On that ordinary Thursday afternoon, I went to a session of The Easy Way to Stop Smoking to write an article about others trying to quit. I said, ""I won’t be trying to stop; it wouldn’t be fair."" I was there to write, not to quit, so I thought it wouldn’t be right to expect the method to work for me. I enjoyed smoking; it gave me real pleasure. The counsellor seemed to understand this. We were encouraged to smoke as much as we wanted, and the room was so full of smoke that we had to open the windows. I noticed that when I was told to smoke, I didn’t want to, and neither did the others. 

What happened was that the messages about stopping made sense to me. Just as smoking had become a challenge against opposition, the idea of quitting started to feel appealing. The thought of not being a smoker made me feel strong. It was a personal feeling that didn’t involve anyone else. Could I also achieve other things? In many ways, it was easy. The physical cravings for nicotine, which felt like hunger, faded after a minute or two and lasted only four or five days. I thought my work would be the hardest part without cigarettes, but it turned out to be fine. I had believed I wouldn’t be able to meet deadlines without nicotine and that I would fail to write a story. Surprisingly, the hardest part was doing simple things at home on weekend mornings, and it still is. 

I am starting to think that smoking helped me deal with boredom; having a cigarette was an activity in itself. Yes, I do miss smoking, but not too much. Every new experience as a non-smoker is something I have to get used to—like eating out, waiting for a flight, checking into a hotel, or during a theatre break. These are all moments when I would have smoked before."

Dorothy Hodgkin is the only British woman scientist to win a Nobel Prize, yet many people in Britain do not know her name. For the past four years, I have been asking friends if they know about her. If they respond positively, they pass my test. Why should people in Britain know about Dorothy Hodgkin? The fact that she won a Nobel Prize should be enough. If someone in literature had the same achievement, they would be famous. Hodgkin, who passed away in 1994, was an extraordinary person, as complex as the crystals she studied. Her life shows important changes in the 20th century, including the progress of women's education and the global nature of science.

When I started my research, I wanted to read scientific biographies. A friend of Hodgkin suggested a biography of Linus Pauling, who was a close friend and worked in the same field. I went to a local bookstore but found no biographies of Pauling. I was surprised that he was not considered interesting enough for British readers, even though he was a major chemist and won Nobel Prizes for both chemistry and peace. Even scientists sometimes think that biographies of scientists are not interesting. Peter Medawar, a Nobel laureate, once said that the lives of scientists are often dull. If scientists believe this, it is not surprising that publishers think the same way.

Scientists are often treated differently from other people in biographies, which reflects the idea that there is a big gap between the arts and sciences. Only a few famous scientists have biographies in bookstores. It is not true that scientists lead less interesting lives than artists, writers, or politicians. Some scientists are very careful about their public image. One geneticist told me he would not want to be quoted or photographed because he did not want to seem like he was promoting himself. This avoidance of personal stories can give a wrong impression of science and may discourage young people from pursuing it.

Fortunately, things are changing. Nowadays, scientists often appear in public in ways other than just scientific interviews. For example, Professor Richard Dawkins gives out prizes on a TV quiz show, and geneticist Steve Jones appears in car commercials. These activities help people see scientists as real individuals, more than just their academic work.

The publishing world is also changing. Scientific biographies used to be very serious and dull, often ignoring the personal lives of scientists. This changed with Richard Feynman's book, ""Surely You're Joking, Mr Feynman?"", which is both funny and touching. Recently, even famous scientists like Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, Albert Einstein, and Marie Curie have been shown with their flaws. Readers find it interesting to see how creative geniuses deal with personal challenges, even if those challenges seem unrelated to their scientific work.

Dorothy Hodgkin was dedicated to her science. She made significant discoveries, including the structures of penicillin and vitamin B12, which earned her the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1964, and insulin, which her team solved in 1969. She achieved these successes by pushing scientific techniques to new levels. However, she also raised three children and was married to a husband who was often away due to his job as a historian. While her personal life may not seem directly related to her science, it shows how she balanced different parts of her life.

There is much in her life that is interesting to everyone, but her scientific work is also important. Scientific research was her passion, which is essential for any successful scientist. The challenge for biographers is to communicate this passion. Many readers may not have enough scientific knowledge to understand complex ideas without detailed explanations. Understanding science is not harder than reading Shakespeare or learning a new language; it just requires effort.

It is unfortunate that educated people, who would feel embarrassed if they did not know a famous writer or artist, often do not recognize the valuable contributions of scientists like Dorothy Hodgkin."
CAE_56,"**Text: Margaret and Her Water-Finding Skills**

Margaret Wilkins is known for having a special ability, often called a ""sixth sense."" She can use a forked hazel stick to find water underground. Farmers whose wells have dried up are increasingly seeking her help. Along with her husband, Margaret runs a well-drilling business that uses modern technology like drilling rigs and air-compressed hammers. However, when it comes to finding water, she relies only on her forked hazel stick. The couple has a success rate of over 90%.

This ability to find water, minerals, and lost objects underground is known as dowsing. There are many theories about how dowsing works, ranging from physical explanations like magnetism to spiritual ideas. One of the most believable theories suggests that everything on Earth vibrates, and water vibrates more than other materials. Some dowsers believe they can sense these vibrations, while others claim they can smell water, as smell is a very strong sense.

In recent years, due to drought, Margaret has been very busy, with a waiting list of almost six weeks at one point. Most of her clients are farmers with dry wells. She explains, ""We usually see customers only once because wells last a long time."" Other clients include owners of remote cottages or barns that have become holiday homes, where running water pipes over long distances is too expensive. There are also golf-course developers who need water for their clubhouses.

Margaret typically looks for water between 50 and 70 meters deep. She emphasizes that it is important not to drill where there is a risk of contamination from waste. The water she finds is usually in cracks in solid rock, and if they bring it up properly, it should be clean. However, in Cornwall, there are many minerals, so they must be careful about iron in the water. 

Another important factor is electricity to power the pump, which can be costly to run over long distances. Therefore, it is best if the well is close to existing power sources. Once she considers all these factors, Margaret begins her search for water. 

For large areas like golf courses, she starts with a map and a pendulum. She holds the pendulum still and moves it over the map. It will swing when she is above a water source. After identifying possible locations on the map, she walks over the fields with her hazel stick, which is forked and equal in size on both sides. 

""When I am above water, I feel a strange sensation; I sway a little. Once that feeling goes away, I use the stick to find the exact spot to drill."" She holds the two forks of the stick with both hands and pulls them slightly apart to create tension. ""When water is directly below, the straight part of the stick rises. It is crucial to drill exactly where the stick indicates. If we drill even a little off, we might miss the water completely.""

Margaret's husband also dowse the same area. Usually, but not always, they agree on the exact drilling spot. If they disagree, they will not drill until they reach a consensus.

Margaret Wilkins is not alone in her practice; many anthropologists and writers have been intrigued by this mysterious ability. She describes it as an ""intuitive perception of the environment,"" which is the best way to explain how she finds water so accurately. If she did not have this ""sixth sense,"" it would be hard to understand how her family could continue to thrive in their well-drilling business year after year."
CAE_36,"**Simplified Text: 'We Changed Lives for a Day!'**

Have you ever thought about living someone else's life for a day? It might be fun to try something completely different. We arranged this for four people - here’s what happened.

**A. Amanda's Story**

I had never been in a place like this before. It was dark and noisy, with many people and a lively atmosphere. It was very different from my hometown, and honestly, I wasn't sure I could handle it! Being a mother is a busy job, but this was something else! I had just fifteen minutes to learn how to carry a tray of drinks with one hand. The other waitresses made it look easy, but just as I was getting the hang of it, the drinks started to slide off the tray and fell to the floor, spilling cocktails everywhere. I felt so embarrassed, but the other waitresses laughed. Everyone makes mistakes at first!

By opening time at 11:30 am, there was already a line outside, and I started to feel really nervous. I worried about remembering all the orders, but luckily, everything was automated. After a couple of hours, my feet hurt, and I couldn’t get used to the loud music. Every time a customer spoke to me, I had to say 'Pardon?', which was embarrassing! By the end of my shift at 5 pm, I was completely exhausted and wanted to soak my feet in hot water. I couldn’t believe it when one of the waitresses said it had been a 'quiet' day! I never realized how tiring waitressing could be. I always thought it was an easy job, but you really need to be friendly and able to handle a lot of customers at once. I’m quite shy, and I don’t think I could manage on a busy Saturday night. I wasn’t impressed with the pay either. I must have been a bad waitress because even the rich customers didn’t tip me! I was very happy to return to my children. It felt easy compared to waitressing!

**B. Cindy's Story**

I was nervous about being a 'mum' for a day, but I was also excited. I had been told the girls were cheeky, but I thought I could manage. As Amanda left for the restaurant, I had to get the two girls dressed and fed. After dropping off Sophie at school and Katie at nursery, I thought I would have three hours of peace. I was wrong! A note from Amanda reminded me that I still had to make the beds, clean the house, and do the laundry.

At 1 pm, I picked up Katie, rushed through the supermarket, and then took her home for lunch. But when I brought Sophie home from school, the real trouble began. They turned the couch into a trampoline and played a game that involved screaming as loudly as they could! I thought they would tire out soon, but I was wrong again. I thought I had a lot of energy, but they outlasted me! After much persuasion, I finally got them to bed by about 8 pm, but then the fun began! How many glasses of water can a child drink? I realized they were just trying to come downstairs to watch television, but it was exhausting to negotiate with them all evening. I never knew how tiring it could be to take care of two small children. You don’t have a moment to think about yourself, and the responsibility is overwhelming. Still, I really enjoyed the day.

**C. Rosemary's Story**

On the farm, I wake up at 5:30 am, so sleeping in until 7 was a treat! But I took a long time deciding how to dress. I couldn’t show up in my farm clothes, could I? When I faced about 400 students at assembly, I hoped I blended in and didn’t look too much like a farmer. After that, I helped with a maths class where the children worked in small groups, which was very different from my school days when we had to recite together! Then I helped with a nature project, identifying and feeding different types of snails.

By lunchtime, I was tired and looking forward to a break, but teachers only have about five minutes to eat. There’s so much to do before classes start again. I attended a staff meeting about reports and ended up helping with athletics trials. After lunch, there was a silent reading lesson (which was nice!) and then a French lesson in the video room. The children wanted to practice their French with me, which showed how rusty I was! Finally, we moved to the gym for Physical Education. I was exhausted, but the children had endless energy. The hardest part was speaking in front of the class, even for just two minutes. Teachers may have more holidays, but I think I’ll stick to farming!

**D. Hilary's Story**

I arrived at White House Farm at 8:30 am, only to find out that Rosemary had been up for three hours! Rosemary’s farm has 100 Jersey cows, 15 calves, and about 800 sheep. She also makes ice cream, yogurt, and cream, which are sold in shops and restaurants. I spent most of the morning in the ice cream shop, bottling milk and making ice cream. It was hard not to taste everything!

At lunchtime, I checked on the sheep. I drove to one of the fields and helped a sheep that had fallen over. If they are left for more than 12 hours, they could die, so they need to be checked daily. What a nightmare it must be in winter! After feeding the calves, I started milking, which took two and a half hours. Rosemary does this twice a day, starting at 6 am, every day of the year! I found it quite lonely. I missed the children a lot - animals don’t talk back! The worst part of the job is that you can’t take time off. The cows need to be milked twice a day, so it’s hard to plan any time away. Rosemary will only get about three days off this year. Farming seems romantic, but the reality is very different. The income is unstable, and I wouldn’t want to depend on the weather."

A trumpet isn't just for Christmas. It is surprising how many musicians, even famous ones, come from families without music. Hakan Hardenberger, the only son of non-musical parents in southern Sweden, has become a unique trumpet player at the age of 30. His recordings introduce new music, including concertos by lesser-known composers from the baroque and classical periods, as well as new pieces. When you meet him, he looks younger than his age, with a bright and friendly manner that matches the sound of the trumpet.

Recently, he performed the Hummel Trumpet Concerto in one of London’s top concert halls. A television feature was made about his work and development, filmed in both London and Sweden. Born near Malmo, his career began with a Christmas gift when he was eight years old. His father, who did not play music but liked Louis Armstrong, decided to give his son a real trumpet instead of a toy. The gift was a success, and the boy played constantly. His mother arranged for him to take lessons from the second trumpet player in the Malmo Symphony Orchestra, Bo Nilsson, who recognized his natural talent. Hardenberger is grateful to have had such a dedicated teacher from the beginning, someone who was passionate about the trumpet and always looking for ways to improve.

Hardenberger explains that the trumpet is a simple instrument, and it is impossible to create a perfect one. There will always be some imperfections, and no two mouthpieces are exactly alike. He believes it is important to understand these imperfections and build a relationship with them. From the start, he had a unique sound that was recognizable even in his childhood. Unlike John Wallace, a famous British trumpet player who came from a brass band background, Hardenberger has always seen himself as a solo artist. He admired the French trumpeter Maurice Andre and bought all his records. His parents supported his dream of becoming a professional trumpet player.

At 15, it was time to decide where he would study. Although Bo Nilsson wanted him to go to America, it was considered too far and dangerous, so at 16, he went to Paris to study with Pierre Thibaud. Thibaud confirmed Hardenberger's belief that playing in an orchestra was not for him, comparing it to digging in the garden. He knew he played better than many of his peers, but it was only after his first competition at 17 that he realized he had a special ability to connect with people through music. Thibaud suggested he enter the competition for experience. Hardenberger prepared only for the first round but advanced to the second. He was lucky to know most of the pieces in that round, but in the final, he faced a concerto that intimidated him. He did not win first prize, but he enjoyed the performance and realized that even though he felt he played poorly, people were still listening.

Hardenberger's honesty about his work might seem arrogant, but that is not the case. He thoughtfully avoids analyzing his gift of communication, saying, ""You risk destroying it by trying to explain. The power of music lies in its ability to move people."""

**A.** The story of Tristan Smith, a citizen in the made-up republic of Efica, is a remarkable tale about human power, history, and humor. The author skillfully creates a world with its own history, traditions, and customs. The book is also known for its humor and the author's unique perspective, combined with deep psychological insight. It is a challenging but rewarding read.

**B.** Harriet is a composed, middle-class woman with an architect husband and her own business. Normally, she would not have met Sheila, a traditional working-class woman who cares for her elderly father and has raised her grandson, Leo, since he was three. Their lives change dramatically when Leo violently attacks Harriet's son, Joe, in the street. After the court case, both boys refuse to discuss what happened. Leo, who had always been a good student and never fought before, cannot explain his actions, while Joe, although physically recovering, becomes withdrawn. Harriet is deeply affected by her son's situation, and caring for him takes over her life. Sheila feels so guilty that she asks to meet Harriet, leading to an unexpected friendship. The author excels at showing how people respond to major changes in their lives and captures the mother's feeling that she can never do enough for her son.

**C.** This book, shortlisted for the Booker Prize, tells the story of one of the most isolated Scottish Orkney islands and its people over a long, quiet history. The narrative is set against important moments in Scottish history, vividly imagined through the daydreams of the young character, Throfinn Ragnarson. He disappears at one point in the story but returns after World War II, having learned to appreciate the simple lives of his ancestors.

**D.** After his recent success, the author has written a sequel that carries the same gentle irony and sharp observations of family life that made the first book popular. Fifteen years after her daughter's death, Aurora Greenway is nearing her seventies, accompanied by her lively friend, Rosie Sunlap. Aurora's approach to life remains a mix of vanity, charm, and reluctant kindness, while Rosie supports her in her enjoyable manipulation of friends and suitors. By the end of the book, Aurora must face the passage of time and the arrival of a new generation. The author skillfully reveals the sadness that lies beneath the ordinary aspects of life, focusing more on the shadows than the bright moments.

**E.** Six very different people are brought together by millionaire Logan Urquhart to sail around the South Pacific islands on his yacht, the Ardent Spirit. The author uses beautiful descriptive language to explore the personal journeys of self-discovery that each sailor experiences, returning home with renewed spirits after their time adrift on ""the desert cities of waves."" The author employs striking images to express themes of memory and awareness, which are both isolating and enlightening."

Rebecca Cripps meets five women who share their different jobs, discussing the positives, negatives, and their typical workdays.

**A. THE BRAIN SURGEON**  
**Name:** Anne  
**Age:** 34  

**ANNE'S DAY**  
""I wake up at 6:30 am, go to the gym at 7:00 am, and arrive at work by 8:00 am. I start surgeries at 8:30 am. I perform surgeries all day on Mondays and Wednesdays, and sometimes on Friday afternoons. Most brain surgeries last about three hours, but some can take all day. Occasionally, I work for ten hours straight without eating or taking a break. Deciding when to operate can be stressful. While I don’t feel stressed during surgery, I sometimes worry about the next day’s operations. Brain surgery is often a last option for patients, but when it succeeds, it is incredibly rewarding, making up for the times it doesn’t. From 10:00 am to 1:00 pm, I run an out-patients' clinic where I explain the surgeries to patients. I enjoy this and find it easy to talk to them. If they get upset, I try to comfort them, but time pressure can make this hard. I usually leave work between 6:00 pm and 8:00 pm. Some nights and weekends, I am on call and carry my bleeper. During holidays, I often worry about my patients and dream about operating at night. I find it hard to relax.""

**B. THE SENIOR DESIGNER**  
**Name:** Marita  
**Age:** 31  

**MARITA'S DAY**  
""I wake up at 7:45 am, leave home by 8:20 am, and take the train to work, arriving at 9:15 am. On Mondays at 10:30 am, we have a meeting to discuss our projects and any issues. I work in a team of three senior designers, a partner, and a junior designer. My work is mostly production, with about ten to fifteen percent being design. I receive a brief from the client, and if they have clear ideas, I spend three to four weeks designing and developing the project. After that, I present my ideas to the client. Once they approve, we create estimates and budgets, and I start hiring photographers and illustrators. I also coordinate with printers to ensure everything is done on time. Managing multiple projects can be very stressful, and deadlines are always tight. I usually have lunch at 1:00 pm for an hour, often going to the pub, but sometimes I eat sandwiches while working. It feels great when a client appreciates my designs, but it’s disappointing when a project I worked hard on gets rejected. I usually get home by 7:30 pm, but it can be much later. I find it hard to relax after a busy day.""

**C. THE CHAUFFEUR**  
**Name:** Linda  
**Age:** 42  

**LINDA'S DAY**  
""I usually wake up around 7:00 am, but on two or three mornings a week, I wake up between 4:30 am and 5:00 am to meet long-haul flights. At 10:30 or 11:00 am, I might go for a bike ride or swim. Since chauffeuring is a sedentary job, I need to watch my diet and exercise. I usually have a big breakfast and snack throughout the day. People often ask for my recommendations for restaurants or shops, so I need to know the area well. Many jobs are pre-booked, allowing me to plan my routes. While most passengers are polite, some can be rude. I have built good relationships with my regular clients. Sometimes, I hear conversations in the car and have to focus on driving. I work seven days a week, up to fifteen hours a day, so I must be careful not to get too tired. I try to go to bed by 11:00 pm.""

**D. THE LANDSCAPE GARDENER**  
**Name:** Tracy  
**Age:** 27  

**TRACY'S DAY**  
""I wake up around 7:00 am, leave home at 7:30 am, and start my first job. My assistant and I mainly maintain gardens we designed. We do some commercial work, but most is in private gardens, spending about an hour and a half at each location. Around 11:00 am, we take a break at a local café for a big breakfast. In summer, I may work until 10:00 pm, and in winter until 4:30 pm. I run the business from home, so when I return, I check messages and return calls. If someone wants their garden landscaped, I usually schedule a consultation in the evening. We focus on using old materials to create gardens that look historic. Sometimes clients have specific ideas that aren’t great, but it’s very satisfying to see a garden we designed bloom. I find it hard to relax in the evenings because I can hear the business phone ringing. I sleep well because my job is physically demanding, leaving me exhausted at the end of the day. I may not be very strong, but I am fit. It’s a tough job, but it allows for creativity.""

**E. THE CIVIL ENGINEER**  
**Name:** Zena  
**Age:** 27  

**ZENA'S DAY**  
""I arrive at the construction site by 8:30 am. As the assistant resident engineer, I oversee the building of bridges and a retaining wall. I check that contractors are following the schedule and safety guidelines while minimizing environmental impact. I help coordinate the site professionals and solve any problems. The contractors start work at 6:00 am, so my first task is to find out what happened since I left the night before. The rest of my day is based on what I learn from the clerk of works. I usually have paperwork to review or design questions to answer. I take a half-hour lunch break between 2:00 pm and 2:30 pm, but I often eat on the go. Since we monitor the contractors' work, it can lead to conflicts, so we need to maintain an open relationship. I see the duty resident engineer once a day, but I act quickly if something urgent arises. I typically leave the site around 6:00 pm and am on call all the time."""

**A. Credit Card Executive**  
I wake up at 6 am and reach the office by 7:30 am. My job involves managing customer development programs for our credit card users. I am responsible for launching and managing the Membership Rewards scheme in major European markets. I need to maintain contact with current card users, attract new ones, and build relationships with partner companies. I spend the first 45 minutes organizing my day and then respond to emails. I oversee advertising for the membership program across Europe, which requires meetings with marketing staff and advertising agencies to create strategies and plan future projects. I have meetings throughout the day, but I keep my door open for anyone who has questions. I travel to different markets in Europe once or twice a week to address any issues. When I am in London, I usually leave work between 6:30 pm and 7:00 pm.

**B. Record Company Executive**  
I arrive at work by 10:00 am and start by reviewing the mail, which includes ten to twenty demo tapes, letters from producers, concert information, and invoices from musicians and studios. The phone starts ringing around 10:30 am with calls from producers and publishers, and I have meetings throughout the day to discuss campaigns or projects for specific artists. I listen to demo tapes carefully, knowing that they represent people's hard work, and I try to provide constructive feedback. Once I sign a band, we begin working on their first album, selecting songs, producers, and additional musicians. I also communicate my vision for the album to the marketing team. I manage budgets and expenses as well. I typically leave work by 7:00 pm, and most evenings I attend concerts, sometimes seeing up to five new bands in one night. I often don’t get home until 1:00 am, when I listen to a record to relax.

**C. Sales Director**  
I wake up at 8:00 am and drive to work, arriving by 9:30 am. I start by opening the mail and checking the schedule for client meetings. I enjoy showing customers around the showroom and love the satisfaction of making a sale. We sell antiques priced between £1,000 and £6,000, sourcing them from auctions, private clients, and overseas. Many items need restoration, so I work closely with our full-time restorer and other specialists. I read the Antiques Trade Gazette while enjoying coffee to stay updated on the industry, and I often visit the Victoria and Albert Museum to compare furniture. I handle the accounts once a month and complete tax returns every three months. I leave work at 5:30 pm, and it usually takes me about an hour to unwind.

**D. Air Traffic Controller**  
I work on a set shift schedule. On early shifts, I leave home at 6:00 am. I start my shift at 7:00 am, taking over one of the control positions in the tower. We have a rotating schedule, working for about an hour and a half at one station, then taking a half-hour break before switching to another station. The air traffic controllers, a supervisor, and the watch manager work closely together to manage aircraft movements. In winter, we handle around 1,000 movements daily, and even more in summer. Night shifts are quieter, allowing me to read about new air traffic regulations between 12:00 am and 4:00 am. This job can be stressful, and I prioritize my health, taking sick days if I feel unwell. I hope to become a watch manager and eventually the general manager of the airport.

**E. Shop Manager**  
If I have an early shift, I leave home by 8:00 am. My first task is to set up the electronic point-of-sale system. I ensure someone is watching the till and coordinate staff lunches and breaks. In the morning, I assist customers in finding and ordering books. I enjoy helping customers, although it can be frustrating when they come in with reviews and expect me to gather many books quickly. From 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm on weekdays, publishers' representatives visit, and I discuss upcoming titles with them. I need to estimate how many copies of a new title we might sell. When we want to feature a new title, I ensure it arrives on time. My early shift ends at 5:45 pm. On two days a week, I work a late shift, during which I close the computer system, lock up, and go home.

**F. Financial Analyst**  
I listen to the news at 7:00 am, then get up and take a taxi to work, arriving by 8:45 am. My first task is to contact freelance reporters to learn about developments in my region. I assess financial risks for multinational companies operating abroad, aiming to warn clients about potential issues. I provide three services: an online executive preview, a security forecast, and a travel information security guide. From 9:15 am to 9:30 am, I meet with editors to discuss the stories I will follow. My first executive preview must be online by 10:00 am, and my second by 11:00 am, so I need to work quickly. I write the stories, send them to my editor for approval, and make any necessary changes. I travel to Africa about three times a year to report on events and stay updated. I usually leave work around 6:00 pm, and it can be hard to relax in the evenings; I often find myself awake until 1:00 am."

**A. What Makes a Good Leader?**  
A good leader inspires others and drives change. Leadership is not about physical traits like height, nor is it just about intelligence. According to Pat Dixon, author of *Making the Difference: Women and Men in the Workplace*, leadership is about ""making things happen through people who are as enthusiastic and interested as you are."" Enthusiasm is essential, and a good leader should communicate clearly and confidently. Dixon emphasizes the importance of saying ""I believe"" instead of ""I think.""

**B. Potential for Leadership**  
John van Maurik, director of a Leadership in Management course, states that most people have more potential for leadership than they realize. Becoming a leader involves recognizing and developing your hidden talents. In a way, we are all born leaders; we just need the right environment to grow. While it is easy to see leadership in famous figures like Emmeline Pankhurst or Mahatma Gandhi, it can be harder to see it in our own workplaces. However, leadership is now seen as essential for effective management.

**C. Comparing Bosses**  
Think about the best and worst boss you have had. They might have been equally good at setting goals and meeting deadlines. But how did they achieve these goals? A good leader motivates and supports you, while a bad leader makes you feel unimportant and blames you when things go wrong. The first person led well; the second just managed poorly.

**D. Leaders vs. Managers**  
Leaders and managers are different. Managers prefer to work within set limits, while leaders create new possibilities. Micheal Shea, author of *Leadership Rules*, writes that a good manager can keep a company running smoothly, but a good leader can change a discouraged organization, whether it’s a business, a sports team, or a country.

**E. Improving Your Leadership Skills**  
Whether you are a boss or a middle manager, you can improve your leadership skills. Here are some lessons to consider:  
- Leadership works best when you choose to lead. Discover your passions and act on them when you feel inspired.  
- Start seeing yourself as a leader. Your ability to lead is an important part of who you are.  
- Collaboration is good, but sometimes strong leadership is necessary. Try different leadership styles. If you usually negotiate, take the lead instead and see how it changes the outcome.  
- Set goals and strive to exceed them. Identify areas in your job where being a leader can improve your effectiveness and career opportunities.

**F. Developing Leadership**  
Leadership does not happen by itself. It develops through taking the lead, taking risks, and learning from mistakes. Learn to delegate, motivate, organize, and provide feedback.  
- Don’t assume your leadership style will be immediately accepted by your colleagues; it might even push them away. Keep improving your communication skills. You don’t need to be liked, but your ideas and achievements should be respected.  
- Be visible and approachable to those who matter. Remember, you don’t have to lead all the time. Understand when your contribution is crucial and how you can help others become leaders."
CAE_64,"**Text: Films on Video - Film Critic Nick James Reviews Recent Releases**

A. **Abyss**  
Before *Titanic*, director James Cameron created this intense Cold War thriller about oil workers and navy experts trying to rescue a nuclear submarine deep underwater. The friendly banter and modest bravery of foreman Bud and his team remind us of similar heroes in films by Howard Hawks. The production design and special effects are very impressive, but the dialogue and character development feel weak. Despite the skill in filmmaking, the story is basic B-movie material.

B. **The Thin Red Line**  
This video release of the James Jones novel about the battle for Guadalcanal, directed by Andrew Marton, offers a different perspective compared to Terrence Malick's recent film. While Malick's version is mystical and poetic, Marton's film is more traditional, focusing on a single soldier and his difficult relationship with his tough sergeant. Malick's film is richer and more complex, but Marton's version has its strong moments, especially the flashback where the soldier dreams of his wife, which is portrayed more harshly than Malick's softer imagery.

C. **On Guard**  
Loosely based on Paul Feval's 1875 novel, this entertaining swashbuckler is better than most musketeer films. It features a skilled villain, played by Fabrice Luchini, who causes chaos behind the scenes. Vincent Perez is a lively hero, though his role is short-lived. Daniel Auteuil, while perhaps too serious for a fun film, also shines as an acrobat-turned-swordsman. The filmmakers use costume-drama clichés with such humor and charm that it doesn't matter.

D. **Character**  
This serious film is set in early 20th-century Rotterdam. The detailed production and costume design make it look like a museum piece. Jan Decleir plays the grim bailiff Dreverhaven, who is harsh when evicting tenants. His troubled relationship with his son is central to the story, but the filmmakers focus too much on the period details to fully explore the dark themes.

E. **The Good, the Bad and the Ugly**  
This digitally re-mastered video re-release highlights director Leone's skill. The sound editing is particularly impressive, making every footstep, creaking floorboard, and barking dog clear. The storytelling is harsh, and whenever there is a quiet moment, Morricone's powerful music brings excitement. Morally, there is little difference between the good (Clint Eastwood), the bad (Lee van Cleef), and the ugly (Ell Wallach), as they all act unscrupulously in the post-Civil War West.

F. **The Longest Day**  
The publicity for this three-hour war epic boasts ""Forty-eight International stars."" With four directors and 23,000 extras, it feels overdone. The early scenes, where battle-hardened veterans wait for news about the invasion, drag on for both the audience and the soldiers. Logistically impressive, it lacks aesthetic appeal and is diminished when viewed on video instead of the big screen."

**BOOK A** Steve Martin's *Compelling Evidence* is indeed very interesting. The narrator, a lawyer trying to start a new practice after leaving a powerful law firm, ends up defending his boss's wife when she is accused of murdering her husband. The trial scenes are exciting, with the outcome uncertain until the verdict, and there is a surprising twist at the end. This is a great debut in a popular genre.

**BOOK B** *Curtains for the Cardinal* starts with a strong opening and follows the charming Sigismondo, a troubleshooter for the Italian Renaissance aristocracy, as he gets involved in politics, church intrigue, and serious murder. We are confident he will uncover the guilty parties. The plot is complex, and the book is a bit long, but it is still very enjoyable.

**BOOK C** *File Under: Deceased* introduces a new detective from first-time author Sarah Lacey. Leah Hunter is a tax inspector who finds herself in a unique position to investigate when a strange man collapses at her feet. Despite facing challenges and the disapproval of a handsome local detective sergeant, brave and adaptable Leah proves to be a strong character.

**BOOK D** *Double Deuce* by Robert B. Parker features Spenser, a smart private investigator, who helps his friend Hawk remove drug dealers from a poor neighborhood in Boston. The dialogue is quick and engaging, and while there are fewer deaths than usual, there is more thoughtful discussion. As always, Parker provides high-quality entertainment.

**BOOK E** *False Prophet* by Faye Kellermann features her regular detectives, Pete Decker and Marge Dunn, as they investigate an attack and burglary at the home of a famous film star's daughter. The author's easy writing style and keen observation of unusual human behavior make this an enjoyable mystery.

**BOOK F** *Blood Red, Snow White* is written by husband and wife team Diane Henry and Nicholas Horrock. It features another lawyer and a female client, but the action takes place outside the courtroom, and the defender becomes a victim as the story unfolds. The mix of romance, money, and violence creates a gripping suspense novel.

**BOOK G** *Dead for a Ducat* by Simon Shaw presents actor Philip Fletcher as the intended victim. A funny group of characters comes together to film a story about Robin Hood, but Philip feels this is not the right direction for his career. Simon Shaw usually entertains, but this time, moving from black comedy to farce does not meet his usual high standards.

**BOOK H** *Fall Down Easy* is Lawrence Gough's best book in a while. Canadian police are searching for a clever bank robber who targets female bank tellers. The slow and skillful build-up of tension and the portrayal of the intelligent, troubled robber make this book stand out from typical detective novels."
CAE_57,"Text: ""I might be too old for this adventure, but here I go! At 34, Tim Pozzi has left a good job to go backpacking. He thinks about why he and others his age have decided to take this step. This summer, I quit my job and decided to rent out my flat to travel in South East Asia for a year. You might think I'm lucky, but I'm 34 years old and feeling nervous. It's not like I haven't traveled before. After university, I spent two years backpacking in North and South America, and when I returned, I promised myself I would do it again someday. But then life happened—I fell in love, started a career, bought a flat, and got used to earning a salary. Gradually, I realized I was sacrificing my own happiness for my salary. When I handed in my resignation, it felt like I was taking control of my life again. I have no ties now. Many of my friends are married with children, and while they wouldn’t trade places with me, they envy my freedom. I’m not in a relationship, and I don’t have strong career goals. I feel I should make the most of this freedom, at least for my friends' sake! 

Why am I so nervous? First, I need to make all the necessary arrangements. How could I let someone else live in my home? How do I organize the rental? And I also need to decide where to go. I tend to procrastinate and am already behind my planned schedule. I thought, 'I might as well enjoy the summer in England,' and then, 'Why not wait for the start of the football season?' Letting go of emotional ties makes it even harder. I’m delaying because I wonder if I can still handle backpacking. Will I be able to adjust to a simpler way of life? Will I feel out of place among younger backpackers? Maybe not. I’ve noticed that more Britons in their late twenties and thirties want to break free from their established lives and travel abroad. Jennifer Cox from Lonely Planet says there’s a growing realization that adventure is available: 'People who always say ""I wish I had that opportunity"" are realizing they can have it anytime. They just need to be brave, organized, and confident enough to do it.'

For Danny, a 30-year-old accountant, and his girlfriend Tammy, a 28-year-old teacher, this trip is a chance to enjoy life before settling down. They bought a round-the-world ticket for a year. 'I’m willing to give up job security for this trip,' says Danny. 'There’s always a worry that I won’t move up in my career and will return to the same position, but I think it’s a risk worth taking. When I left the office, I threw my calculator into the river as a symbolic act of defiance!' For Matt, who just left the Army, his year of travel was transformative. 'In the military, there’s a strict way of doing things. I needed to change that to live well as a civilian.'

While there are many reasons for traveling at my age, some common factors exist. 'Today, we have a more flexible workforce,' says Angela Baron from the Institute of Personnel Development. 'More people work on short-term contracts, so if your contract ends, you have nothing to lose.' Larger companies are even creating career-break policies. 'If you’ve invested time and money in training someone, it’s good to know they’ll return instead of going to a competitor.' Dan Hiscocks, managing director of Travellerseye, a company that focuses on stories of 'ordinary' travelers, says more thirty-somethings are reassessing their lives. 'If you’re not happy with your job—and many aren’t—it’s no longer just about sticking it out. People now know that opportunities exist and that a job isn’t permanent. Travel allows you to reflect and think about your life.'

Is giving in to wanderlust just another sign of my generation's struggle with adulthood? Jennifer Cox doesn’t think so. 'It shows a better-educated, more stable society where we care less about paying bills and more about living a balanced life. We’re taking the time to ask, ""Is this what I want?""' Ben, a 32-year-old picture researcher going to Central America for a year, believes he’s not running away. 'It’s more about running towards something. I want to pursue my own interests.' However, he does feel some anxiety. 'I’ll miss my comfortable routine—going to the office every day, saying ""hi"" to everyone, and having my morning coffee.' I share Ben’s concerns about leaving behind a structured life with few challenges, and I’m not sure I would be making this journey if I hadn’t found my boss so unbearable. As Jennifer Cox points out, 'This is quite common. There’s often a trigger, like a breakup or job loss, that pushes people to travel.' 

It may have taken a little push to get me moving, but I’m now looking forward to the next 12 months with growing excitement. No matter what happens, I’ll take pride in having embraced life. I believe many of us older backpackers feel the same way."""

Georgina McGuiness took a long break from journalism and felt disconnected from the changes in technology. In this text, she shares how she turned her home into an effective workplace.

The Christmas before last, I turned 37 and realized that if I wanted to restart my journalism career, I needed to act fast. I felt like my skills were outdated, stuck in the 1980s when typewriters were common. I noticed that many job ads required experience in desktop publishing, which I didn’t have. I thought I would have a better chance of hosting a seminar on nuclear physics than learning to use a computer for layout. I was known as the family technophobe; even simple devices like calculators confused me, and I struggled with the video timer.

I knew I had to change quickly. I thought leaving home before my children would be difficult, but then I entered a competition in a local newspaper. To my surprise, my family won a computer package. We received a laptop for my husband and a personal computer for the family. We jumped into this new world, and terms like cyberspace, Internet, and surfing became part of our everyday language. We started chatting online with strangers from around the world. The children stopped watching television, and I created a mini-office in the kitchen with a phone, a fax machine, a CD-ROM, and a modem connecting me to the Internet. I had everything I needed to work from home while still taking the kids to school. The children were already comfortable with computers from school, while I was more cautious, worried that I would lose my work by pressing the wrong button. I was wrong. Although I wasn’t very skilled, I learned the basics quickly; it was logical and straightforward. With practice, I improved a little each day.

I recently started freelancing for a magazine, writing about two articles a month, and I feel proud to balance both work and family life. How has the computer helped me? Since school, my desk has always been a chaotic mess, and I often lost important papers. The computer has made me more organized, especially with office tasks. Spreadsheets help me track income and expenses, and ready-made invoices and letterheads save me a lot of time.

As a journalist, being online allows me to research stories, ask for information on forums, and discuss working from home with people worldwide. However, there are downsides to working from home. I can feel isolated without face-to-face contact, and there are distractions at home, especially when the children are there, leading to arguments over computer use.

Despite this, more people are buying multimedia PCs, not just for education and entertainment. In my neighborhood, a new type of home-based business is emerging, as people prefer not to commute to the city every day. 

What defines home workers as we enter the next century? A report called PC Usage in UK Homes gives a profile of the typical computer user: they are around 38 years old and well-educated; 93% own a personal computer, 32% have a CD-ROM, 38% have a laser printer, and 50% have a modem. Considering this, I feel I am ahead of the game. Who knows, one day I might be emailing a column to a newspaper in Melbourne or even publishing my own magazine from home. It seems that the possibilities in cyberspace are endless."
CAE_59,"**The Tartan Museum**

The modern buildings of Scotland's national museum stand out in historic Edinburgh. But are the exhibits inside just as impressive? Sally Varlow visited the museum just before it opened.

You cannot miss the new Museum of Scotland, located at the corner of Chambers Street in Edinburgh. It features a large yellow sandstone tower and unique, wedge-shaped buildings topped with a hanging garden. Last winter, the building received mixed reactions: some called it a ""masterpiece"" or ""stunning,"" while others were more critical.

Now that the inside is almost ready for visitors, the exhibitions are expected to receive similar opinions. The museum tells the story of the nation and has a timeline to help visitors understand the displays without restricting them. It showcases important national treasures, like Mary Queen of Scots' jewels and silver from Holyrood chapel, without overwhelming visitors with national pride.

The main concern is whether people will find the museum interesting enough to return. Dr. David Clarke, the head of exhibitions, believes that a visit should be enjoyable and accessible to everyone, not just experts. He prefers to show real objects rather than imaginative recreations of the past, as he believes the public deserves the truth.

The challenge for visitors is whether the stories of the objects can be told effectively through explanation panels, captions, and multimedia displays, with only about 30 computers available in the museum. With less than three days before the opening, it is still uncertain.

Some aspects are clear, though. The museum offers stunning views of Edinburgh Castle, and inside, visitors will notice a series of interconnected galleries of various sizes and shapes. The pale walls resemble large stone blocks, and natural light pours in through narrow windows and roof lights, creating a space for visitors to appreciate each exhibit.

Thanks to a Junior board made up of 9- to 12-year-olds from across Scotland, the museum includes a Discovery Centre. The group wanted a way to interact with the displays, and while they didn't get that, they did create a hands-on center for children in what was supposed to be a temporary exhibition gallery. The Twentieth Century gallery on the top floor is the only temporary exhibition, featuring items chosen by Scottish people that have significantly impacted life in Scotland during the twentieth century. Suggestions included an electric guitar, televisions, thermos flasks, and favorite toys. While this idea is fun, it may not address more serious topics.

Dr. Clarke believes that ""objects open windows on the past more vividly than anything else."" As for the modern architecture, it works well from the inside and the top, but its location may be questionable."

The end of print newspapers may take a long time. ""Transition"" is a nice word that suggests moving smoothly from one place to another. However, the change from print newspapers to online news is uncertain and uncomfortable. Many people believe that this change will happen eventually because print newspaper sales are falling while visits to their websites are increasing. For example, the print sales of The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian have dropped by 8% to 10% each year, but their website traffic keeps growing.

However, there are some things that do not fit this picture. A recent survey by the World Association of Newspapers showed that global newspaper circulation actually increased by 1.1% last year, reaching 512 million copies a day. While sales in Western countries have decreased, Asia has compensated for this decline. News and current affairs magazines, which are thought to be struggling, reported a 5.4% increase in sales.

The same trend can be seen in books. E-readers like Kindle are becoming very popular, with sales rising significantly this year. Yet, when booksellers looked at the sales of physical books over the last six months, they found only a small decrease of 0.4%. This suggests that people are buying both digital and physical books.

The idea that young people are completely abandoning newspapers is exaggerated. According to the latest National Readership Survey, nearly 5 million people aged 15 to 35 still read major national newspapers. Different countries in Europe have different trends. In Britain, there has been a 10.8% drop in newspaper sales, but in Germany, the decline is only 7%, and in France, it is just 3.1%.

These varying trends suggest that the situation is more complex than what many believe about the digital revolution. In the past, media analysts thought that increasing online advertising would support the change to digital newspapers. However, digital advertising on newspaper websites is now decreasing. Many US newspapers have started charging for online access. The best way to attract paying readers seems to be offering a package that includes both print and digital access. This means that print newspapers are still important for selling online subscriptions, as they generate much more advertising revenue than online ads.

Maintaining both a website and a print edition is challenging and costly for newspaper companies. However, print newspapers still have a strong presence, and it is harder for them to be noticed online."
CAE_32,"**Photographing People**

People are the most fascinating subjects for photography. A photo that includes a person is usually more interesting than one without. However, photographing people can be challenging. Besides technical skills, photographers must pay attention to actions, gestures, and expressions. The presence of a camera can sometimes change how people behave.

**A. Grouping People**  
When taking group photos, avoid straight lines. Have people stand at different angles and distances, and if possible, at different heights. You can also have some people sit or kneel in front so that all faces are visible, or raise your camera to get a better view.

**B. Posing for Pictures**  
People often feel stiff in front of a camera. Help your subject relax by suggesting comfortable positions, like folding their hands or putting them in their pockets.

**C. The Right Approach**  
Do not pretend you are not taking a picture when it is obvious you are. This can create tension. Most people will agree to have their photo taken, even if they hesitate at first. They may feel self-conscious, so you might need to guide them. A photo can be less interesting if the subject looks away from the camera.

**D. Eye Contact**  
A photo is more powerful if the subject looks at the viewer. Ask your subject to look into the lens, and they don’t have to smile. They might not be able to do this for long, so remind them just before you take the picture. You can also say something funny to get a natural reaction.

**E. Candid Concentration**  
Instead of direct eye contact, you can have the subject focus on something in the picture. This can make it easier for them, and it gives the viewer a sense of observing the subject naturally. Candid shots are often very engaging, and the subject's expression is crucial.

**F. Expressions and Gestures**  
Expressions and gestures reveal a lot about a person. For example, a laughing child can make viewers smile, while a sad face can evoke sympathy. Look for common expressions like shrugs, winks, or smiles; they communicate feelings instantly.

**G. Situation Interest**  
While close-up shots of a person can be striking, the background can add context and interest. When including a background, avoid irrelevant details and focus on what matters. Ensure the subject stands out against the background, perhaps by using a wide-angle lens.

**H. Interaction**  
Capturing moments where people interact—like talking, laughing, or working together—can lead to great photos. Couples, parents with children, and teams are all good subjects. Look for moments of connection, such as eye contact or gestures that show how one person is responding to another.

**I. People and Places**  
Many photos of people are taken during trips. To improve these pictures, use a standard or wide-angle lens and step back to include the entire background, like a building or landscape. Position your subjects close to the camera while ensuring the background is visible. A slightly elevated camera position can help achieve this balance.

**J. To Pose or Not to Pose?**  
Decide why you want to take the picture. If it’s to remember someone you met briefly, a clear posed photo against a nice background is good. However, family photos can become boring if they are all formal poses. Candid shots of events are often more lively and can capture genuine moments, making them more memorable in the future."
CAE_65,"**Text: Under Sarah's Spell**

Sarah Janson is a trompe-l'oeil artist, which means her paintings create an illusion of reality. In this interview with Joanna Watt, we learn more about her unique perspective on art.

Unlike many artists, Sarah does not sign her work unless asked. She believes that the artwork is more important than the artist. ""It's not about me; it's about the work,"" she says. At first, she seems shy and uncomfortable with the idea of being interviewed. ""I just don't like to talk about myself,"" she admits, and she is nervous about being photographed. However, after some time, she relaxes, and the interview becomes enjoyable and entertaining.

Sarah has been a trompe-l'oeil artist for sixteen years. She studied drawing for two years at art school, earned a degree in graphic illustration, and worked at a publishing house. However, she found her true passion when she worked with a specialist decorator named Jim Smart. He asked her to create a trompe-l'oeil piece, and from that moment, she knew she wanted to pursue this art form. ""Suddenly, my interest was focused,"" she explains. She started her own business, unsure of where it would lead, but trusting her instincts.

Sarah believes that trompe-l'oeil is about observation and life experiences. ""No one can teach you trompe-l'oeil; it's something you learn through life,"" she says. She is always learning and feels that if you think you have mastered something, you should stop. She is honest about her weaknesses, admitting, ""I can't paint bread; it always looks like grey concrete."" She also struggles with math, especially when working on large projects, like a ceiling at Lulworth Castle. ""I thought, 'You're not Michelangelo. Who do you think you are?'"" This self-doubt leads her to speak about her work in a distant way, as if it is separate from her. ""When I finished that ceiling, I thought, 'Well, I didn't do it; she did,'"" she reflects.

Sarah's trompe-l'oeil art is exceptional and stands out from others in the field. She has completed many important projects for both businesses and private clients. Much of her work is inspired by architecture. For example, she created a trompe-l'oeil dining room based on a Venetian palace and a painting that makes a hallway look like it leads to two more rooms.

However, trompe-l'oeil art has a challenge: once people understand the trick, they may lose interest. Sarah knows this and believes that her art must do two things: first, it should draw people in and trick them, and second, it must engage their imagination. ""That is the most important part,"" she insists. 

Sarah also thinks that trompe-l'oeil should be personal to the client. ""I love working with clients; that's where the ideas come from,"" she says. Some clients have clear ideas, while others do not, so she must listen carefully to understand their vision. Many of her clients become friends because she spends a lot of time with them during the project. 

She appreciates her clients, saying, ""I am very grateful for the adventurous ones who let me work on their walls."" They seem happy with her work, which keeps her busy, even though she tends to downplay her talent. ""I really don't like to talk about myself,"" she repeats. ""Like my work, I am very restrained. I don't want it to be loud. You get tired of things that are too loud."" 

While she may be modest, Sarah Janson and her art deserve more recognition, and I am happy to share her story."
CAE_61,"**Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success**

Daniel Goleman explores the important 'people skills' needed to succeed in our careers.

A. The rules for work are changing. We are now evaluated by a new standard—not just by our intelligence or training, but also by how well we manage ourselves and interact with others. This new standard is increasingly used to decide who gets hired or promoted. It helps identify who is likely to excel and who may not. Regardless of our current jobs, these skills are essential for our future employability. This new measure is different from what we learned in school. Doing well in exams is not as important anymore. Instead, it assumes we all have the necessary knowledge and skills for our jobs. It emphasizes social skills and personal qualities, such as initiative, empathy, adaptability, and persuasiveness—collectively known as emotional intelligence.

B. In a time when job security is uncertain, personal qualities are becoming more important in the workplace. For many years, these qualities were referred to by various names, such as 'character' and 'soft skills.' Now, we have a clearer understanding of these abilities, which we call 'emotional intelligence.' This is defined as the ability to understand and manage our own feelings and those of others, using emotions to guide our thoughts and actions. In the workplace, emotional intelligence includes self-awareness, self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills. Some people think it just means 'being nice,' but it can also require being direct and honest when necessary. Emotional intelligence does not mean expressing all feelings freely; instead, it involves managing emotions so they are expressed appropriately, helping people work together effectively towards shared goals.

C. More businesses recognize that promoting emotional intelligence is vital for good management. The more complex a job is, the more important emotional intelligence becomes. A lack of these skills can limit the effectiveness of a person's technical knowledge. While some individuals have succeeded despite lacking emotional intelligence, as work becomes more collaborative, companies that foster teamwork gain a competitive advantage. In today's workplace, where teamwork and customer focus are emphasized, emotional intelligence is essential for success in every job around the world.

D. Unlike IQ, which changes little over time, emotional intelligence can develop as we gain life experience. Studies show that most people become better at managing their emotions, motivating themselves, and improving their empathy and social skills as they grow older. This growth in emotional intelligence is often called maturity. We can learn emotional intelligence and add these skills to our toolkit for success, especially in a time when job stability is uncertain. While emotional intelligence is not a guaranteed solution for struggling organizations, ignoring the human aspect can prevent success in other areas."

Digital cameras and camera phones have made it easier to capture important news events, but social media has truly changed citizen photography. With news often breaking on social networks, some journalists are now using these platforms for images as events unfold. However, some reporters have shared user-generated content (UGC) without permission. Although there is guidance stating that images on social media can be used without permission in special cases or when there is strong public interest, the question of whether this is ethical remains debated. Research shows that about one in ten people would film or photograph a news event, indicating that UGC will play a significant role in the future of media. To maintain a good relationship with the public, the media must ensure that individuals are fairly compensated for their work and that permission is always obtained.'"
CAE_28,"**Simplified Text: Ancient Chinese Medicine in the West**

Acupuncture is a practice that is over two thousand years old. It comes from traditional Chinese medicine, which also includes herbal remedies, massage, diet, and exercise. Acupuncture is often used to treat various health issues, but it is especially noted for its effectiveness in relieving pain. Many general practitioners, midwives, and physiotherapists in the West use it for this purpose.

**A. What is Traditional Chinese Medicine?**  
Traditional Chinese medicine views health as a balance of energy in the mind, body, and spirit. This energy, called Qi (pronounced ""chee""), flows through the body along pathways known as meridians. There are twelve main meridians, each connected to an internal organ, and many smaller ones that deliver Qi to every cell. When the flow of Qi is blocked or weak, it can lead to illness or weakness. During a visit to an acupuncturist, they will check for imbalances in your Qi by feeling your pulse, looking at your tongue, and assessing your overall health. They will also ask about your medical history, current health, mental state, and your eating and sleeping habits. Acupuncturists use fine needles that are inserted into the skin. They may also use heat from burning herbs or apply pressure to specific points to help the flow of Qi.

**B. Acupuncture Points**  
The acupuncture points are linked to the meridians and may not be located near the area of pain. Many people report feeling a mild ache or tingling when the needle is gently moved. This can be done by hand or with an electro-acupuncture machine. Acupuncturists believe this sensation indicates that the needle has reached the Qi in a meridian. There are over three hundred acupuncture points on the main meridians, with many more used less frequently.

**C. Scientific Understanding**  
While Western doctors do not fully accept traditional Chinese medicine, many agree that acupuncture can help relieve pain. They have found scientific reasons for its effectiveness. For example, it is thought that stimulating certain nerves can block pain signals from reaching the brain. Some scientists believe that acupuncture points can release natural pain-relieving chemicals in the body, called endorphins.

**D. Types of Pain Treated**  
Many people with chronic pain turn to acupuncture when other treatments have failed. Commonly treated conditions include back pain, sports injuries, arthritis, headaches, and pain after surgery. Acupuncturists also claim to help with menstrual pain, facial nerve pain, and pain in terminally ill patients.

**E. Modern Use of Acupuncture**  
Although acupuncture has been practiced in China for over 2,000 years, its use as an alternative to anesthesia during surgery began in the 1950s. This development helped convince some doctors outside China of its effectiveness. Today, acupuncture is used in various surgeries in China, including tonsillectomies and heart surgery. Needles may be used alone, with electrical stimulation, or alongside medications. While some patients report little to no pain, experiences can vary. Acupuncturists argue that acupuncture has fewer side effects than traditional anesthesia, such as nausea, and allows for quicker recovery.

**F. Effectiveness of Acupuncture**  
Like many alternative therapies, it is challenging to conduct clinical trials on acupuncture. However, studies show that 50 to 80 percent of people find it effective for chronic pain. Acupuncturists generally report similar success rates. They acknowledge that it may not work for everyone and that individual responses can differ. Traditional acupuncturists suggest that patients may need six to seven sessions to feel significant relief, but some improvement can be noticed after just two or three visits.

**G. A Different Perspective on Pain**  
Western and Chinese medicine have different views on pain. Acupuncturists take a holistic approach, meaning they consider the whole person rather than just specific symptoms. They spend time diagnosing the problem and looking for underlying issues in the Qi. They also consider external factors that may affect the pain, such as weather conditions. These details are important for determining how to use acupuncture effectively. Most conventional doctors may not consider these factors.

**H. Traditional vs. Modern Acupuncture**  
Some medical professionals have training in traditional acupuncture, while others, including many general practitioners, prefer scientific explanations. Traditional acupuncturists believe that using traditional Chinese medicine is essential for achieving deep healing, which can be hard to measure in studies. It is important to choose a qualified acupuncturist, who should refer you to a medical doctor for further investigation if needed."

P.D. James is a well-known crime writer whose gentle appearance hides a deep and creative mind. Her full name is Phyllis Dorothy James, and she has a strong presence that makes you think she could have been a headmistress at a girls' school. However, it quickly becomes clear that this strong exterior covers her shyness. She admits that Adam Dalgliesh, the detective in her books, is based on herself, or how she might have been if she were a man. Dalgliesh likes to solve crimes alone, just like P.D. James prefers to write in solitude. She needs complete privacy to write, no matter where she is.

Although she is too humble to agree that she is the most famous crime writer in Britain, her 12 detective novels are enjoyed by millions worldwide. She admires her friend Ruth Rendell's psychological novels, which she writes under the name Barbara Vine. The books she enjoys most are often by women writers like Iris Murdoch, Anita Brookner, and Penelope Lively, but she also appreciates male authors like Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh, whom she believes were the best novelists of their time.

P.D. James found success later in life. She was 42 when her first crime novel, *Cover Her Face*, was published. Born in Oxford, she grew up in Cambridge after her family moved there when she was 11. She met her husband, who was a university student, in Cambridge, and that is why she set her book *An Unsuitable Job For A Woman* there.

She shares that her life has been challenging and sometimes tragic. Her husband, Connor Bantry White, returned from World War II very ill. She had to work long hours to support him and their two young daughters, Clare and Jane. Although she had many ideas for stories, she had little time to write. Thankfully, her husband’s parents helped care for her daughters during those tough years.

While working full-time in administration for the National Health Service, she used her excellent organizational skills. At one point, she managed five psychiatric outpatient clinics. She then spent 11 years at the Home Office, first in the Police Department and later in the Criminal Law section, focusing on juvenile crime. While working in forensic science, she became used to seeing dead bodies, but it was not death itself that inspired her writing. Instead, she was drawn to the structure and creativity involved in writing crime novels. She has always loved reading detective stories and knew she wanted to be a writer.

P.D. James did not want to write about her own traumatic experiences. She saw writing detective stories as a great way to learn how to be a serious novelist while keeping her own life separate. Over time, she realized that it was possible to follow the traditional rules of detective stories and still create meaningful novels about people. She believes that writing detective stories helps bring order to chaos. Solving a crime shows the value of life, even if that life is difficult. She notes that no one truly enjoys violence."

**The Pen is Mightier than the Psychoanalyst**

The study of handwriting to understand a person's character is becoming more popular. In some countries, if you apply for a job, you will likely be asked to provide a sample of your handwriting. This handwriting sample can significantly influence whether you are considered suitable for the job. Handwriting analysis, known as graphology, is recognized as a real science in many places. Researchers believe it can help identify certain health issues, like heart disease and cancer, and can show psychological states and emotional problems. 

Graphology is increasingly used for career guidance and as a supplement to job interviews. Many large companies now hire graphologists to analyze the handwriting of job candidates. However, many doctors and psychiatrists are skeptical about the usefulness of graphology. Patricia Marne, a professional graphologist with over 20 years of experience, argues that it should be taken more seriously. She believes handwriting can reveal psychological traits and some medical conditions. 

Marne states, ""Handwriting is a strong indicator of social class and intelligence. It can also help determine whether someone should focus on arts or sciences and whether they have a manipulative or honest character."" She claims that graphology can be especially helpful in identifying potential criminal behavior. ""Criminals often have disturbed handwriting, which is usually poorly shaped. Many come from difficult backgrounds and have emotional issues, which can show in childish handwriting and repeated letters.""

Marne explains that she can tell if people are honest or manipulative through their handwriting. For example, young male offenders often have very tall letters, suggesting they live in a fantasy world. Graphologists can also predict if someone is about to become violent, if they are under extreme stress, or if they have psychopathic traits. Handwriting can even indicate potential suicides. 

She adds that heart and lung problems can also be reflected in handwriting. ""You cannot diagnose a condition from just one sample unless the writing is clearly shaky. However, if handwriting changes over time or becomes disjointed, it could indicate a serious issue."" A significant emotional upset can also temporarily change a person's signature.

Marne describes other psychological traits revealed by handwriting. For instance, people whose letters connect in 'threads' may be clever but devious. Those who write mostly in capital letters might be hiding their true selves. Light pressure in writing suggests sensitivity, while originality in handwriting shows confidence and creativity. Disconnected writing often indicates someone who prefers to be alone. Very small signatures can suggest feelings of inferiority, while circles over the letter 'i' indicate a desire for attention. Heavy crossing of the letter 't' can show intolerance and a condescending attitude.

Marne believes it takes six years of study and experience to analyze handwriting accurately, along with empathy and intuition. She thinks more research is needed to establish graphology as a scientific field, and she believes this will happen soon. ""It is actually more accurate than psychoanalysis because it reveals a person's entire history, including emotional crises, without needing to ask questions that they might answer incorrectly.""

Despite these interesting claims, there is little solid evidence to support them. Some psychiatrists criticize graphology, arguing that handwriting is influenced by education, artistic skills, and the type of writing taught, and that it has no deeper meaning."

Is your office working well? Fresh air and good chairs are important for a happy and healthy workforce, according to a new survey. We visited four different offices to see how healthy and happy they were as workplaces. Our expert panel included a building health consultant, an ergonomist who studies working conditions, and an occupational psychologist. Here are their opinions.

**Office A: Advertising Agency**  
*Building Health Consultant:* This office is very simple; it has no central heating or mechanical ventilation, and the windows open directly onto the street. It’s surprising that this space works, but the small team of seven people seems happy. They adapt to the seasons by opening doors and roof panels or using electric heaters, similar to how they would at home. This may be the reason: they have created a comfortable working environment without much outside control.  
*Ergonomist:* The furniture here is mismatched and creates bad postures. The chairs are old, most are not adjustable, and many are broken. However, the staff have a varied work schedule that they control, which helps reduce fatigue and boredom.  
*Occupational Psychologist:* The staff enjoy the variety of work and the flexible office space. They feel the office is 'just the right size'—small enough to know what colleagues are doing, but large enough to focus on personal tasks. I found the office attractive and fun, showing both efficiency and creativity.

**Office B: News Service**  
*Building Health Consultant:* This office may not be very exciting, but it is comfortable and the staff do not dislike it. The air quality and maintenance are good, helped by a No Smoking policy.  
*Ergonomist:* The company has hired an ergonomist, so the chairs are excellent, and the lighting and computer equipment are good. The layout could be better, but the environment feels impersonal with grey, bare walls.  
*Occupational Psychologist:* The walls are mostly bare except for year planners and a poster about maternity rights. Most staff have been there for at least five years, and relationships are satisfactory. The office could improve by arranging desks to make sharing information easier and displaying success stories on the walls.

**Office C: Bank**  
*Building Health Consultant:* This office gets mixed reactions from employees. It feels like being in a glass case, surrounded by many similar offices. Despite having both smokers and non-smokers, the air does not feel stale.  
*Ergonomist:* The office is very standard and uninspiring. The desks are just adequate, and not all chairs meet the requirements for computer work. Computer screens are often on low desks, which is not suitable for modern equipment.  
*Occupational Psychologist:* Staff support each other well and have good technology. There are many awards on display. The wood paneling and brown carpet make the office feel a bit dull, but it is busy with activity.

**Office D: Newspaper**  
*Building Health Consultant:* There is not much good to say about this building. The air conditioning is poor, causing big temperature changes. The space is cluttered, and most people do not have enough desk space. The office is very dusty, and the roof collects dust that falls on those below.  
*Ergonomist:* The furniture looks more like it belongs in a workshop than a modern office. Many chairs are old and do not adjust well, making it hard for shorter users to work comfortably.  
*Occupational Psychologist:* The office has old brown chairs, dirty carpets, and dust everywhere. There is a lot of room for improvement—cleaning is needed, individual achievements should be recognized, and the air conditioning must be fixed. There were few conversations during our visit; everyone seemed stressed and focused on deadlines. The company should encourage teamwork."
CAE_38,"**Chewing Gum Culture**

Chewing gum is popular, accessible to everyone, and Americans chew about 12 million sticks each day. This ancient practice has turned into a large business. Each stick of gum has fewer than ten calories, but it is considered food and must meet the standards set by the American Food and Drug Administration.

Today, most gum is made from synthetic materials, including pine resins and softeners that help maintain flavor and improve texture. However, this was not always the case. The ancient Greeks chewed a resin from the mastic tree, which grows mainly in Greece and Turkey. Greek women especially liked mastic gum for cleaning their teeth and freshening their breath. American colonists learned from the Native Americans in New England and chewed resin from spruce trees. In the early 1800s, lumps of spruce for chewing were sold in the eastern United States, marking the beginning of commercial chewing gum in the country.

Modern chewing gum began in the late 1860s with the discovery of chicle, a milky substance from the sapodilla tree found in Central America. Gum made from chicle was smoother, more enjoyable, and more elastic, leading to the growth of a whole industry. However, attempts to grow sapodilla commercially have not been successful. As the demand for chewing gum increased, synthetic alternatives were created.

Today, the few remaining chicle gatherers, known as chicleros, struggle to make a living. They trek for miles to collect sapodilla in very humid conditions. The environment is dangerous, with poisonous snakes and many insects. One of the most concerning pests is the chicle fly, which lays its eggs in the ears and noses of the gatherers. Despite these dangers, experienced chicleros climb trees quickly to cut the bark and collect the sap in bags. They then carry the liquid to a camp, where it is boiled until it becomes sticky and is formed into bricks. Life at the camp is tough, with a boring diet mainly of maize and local alcohol made from sugar cane. 

Even though the working conditions are harsh, chicleros worry about their jobs. Not long ago, the United States imported 7,000 tonnes of chicle each year from Central America. Last year, only 200 tonnes were collected in Mexico's Yucatan peninsula. As chewing gum sales have increased, manufacturers have turned to synthetic materials to lower costs and meet demand. 

Meanwhile, gum producers are finding creative ways to market their products. They claim that gum helps you relax, boosts your energy, and reduces stress. During both world wars, soldiers were regularly given gum. The most significant claim is that chewing gum can help reduce tooth decay. Plaque acid, which forms when we eat, is harmful. Our saliva helps neutralize this acid and provides minerals like calcium, phosphate, and fluoride, acting as the body’s natural defense. Gum manufacturers say that chewing for 20 minutes can increase saliva production. Research is ongoing to develop new textures and flavors. Glycerine and other vegetable oils are now used to create the gum base. Most new flavors are artificial, but some still require natural ingredients. Additionally, 137 square kilometers of land in America is dedicated to growing mint for the two most popular chewing gums in the world."

**A. INDIA - GHANERAO HOTEL, RAJASTHAN**  
Ghanerao Hotel is located at the edge of the Aravalli Hills in a small village known for its craftsmen. It combines the calmness of an English country house with Indian culture. The Ghanerao family has lived here for 400 years, and now, Sajjan Singh and his wife welcome guests into their home. The facilities are basic, with hot water provided by bucket, but this simplicity adds to the hotel's charm.

**B. NEW ZEALAND - HERMITAGE HOTEL, MOUNT COOK**  
One of my favorite hotels is the Hermitage Hotel on New Zealand's South Island, which I discovered while climbing. After being flown close to the top of a glacier and climbing down, I was surprised to find this hotel in the stunning countryside. It is located in a remote area, surrounded by beautiful, wild landscapes. Arriving at this luxurious hotel after a tiring climb, with a pianist playing Cole Porter, was an unforgettable experience.

**C. MAURITIUS - PARADIS HOTEL**  
On the southwest coast of Mauritius, the Paradis Hotel is situated on a quiet peninsula. The road to the hotel winds along the coast, passing empty beaches where only fishermen are present. Although the hotel is large and offers many free water sports, you can easily find solitude along its nine kilometers of private beach. If you swim a little way out into the Indian Ocean, the hotel becomes hidden behind palm trees. In the evening, when the beach is empty, you can enjoy a peaceful atmosphere as the sun sets.

**D. ST LUCIA - LADERA HOTEL**  
The Ladera Hotel in St Lucia has one of the most stunning views in the Caribbean. It is quiet and located at an altitude of 1,000 feet, with open rooms that look out between the twin peaks of the Pitons to the Caribbean Sea. The hotel features colonial-style furniture made of mahogany and greenheart wood, and has four-poster beds with muslin netting.

**E. TURKEY - THE SPLENDID HOTEL, ISTANBUL**  
The Splendid Hotel, located on Buyukada in the Princes Islands, is an ideal escape from the noise of Istanbul. The islands are just an hour away by boat and are very picturesque. There are no cars, only horse-drawn carriages and beautiful wooden buildings from the 1920s. The Splendid Hotel, made entirely of wood and painted white with red domes, resembles a historic hotel from the French Riviera. Although it is a bit worn down now, it still retains its charm.

**F. FRANCE - CHATEAU D'ETOGES, EPERNAY**  
In the small village of Etoges, in the Champagne region, there is a lovely seventeenth-century chateau surrounded by a moat with two swans. This chateau, which was recently a family home, has 20 unique rooms, some with four-poster beds, and one even has a billiard table. They offer special weekend rates for two nights, including breakfast and dinner, along with complimentary champagne from their own brand.

**G. KENYA - THE FAIRVIEW HOTEL, NAIROBI**  
The Fairview Hotel is a rare find in Africa—a comfortable hotel that avoids excessive luxury. It serves as a popular stop for travelers recovering from safaris and planning their next adventures. Guests often arrive, see the beautiful gardens and dining options, and decide to stay longer. The hotel has spacious grounds and buildings on Nairobi Hill, providing a peaceful escape from the busy city. It’s a great place to enjoy the stunning African sunset while sipping beer and looking forward to a hearty dinner.

**H. ITALY - HOTEL SPLENDIDO, PORTOFINO**  
The Hotel Splendido was first signed into by the Duke of Windsor, and since then, many famous people have visited, including Lauren Bacall and Humphrey Bogart. Today, you might meet wealthy guests, but this former monastery-turned-villa-turned-hotel remains splendid. The restaurant serves simple yet delicious food, and the hotel features beautiful Persian rugs and homemade pasta."

Sue Brown is a hotel inspector. Christopher Middleton watched her during an inspection at the Globe Hotel. Just one minute into the inspection, things start to go wrong. The receptionist is busy giving room rates to a potential guest and does not notice Sue and Christopher. ""She hasn't even acknowledged us,"" Sue whispers. ""Very poor."" This is a common mistake that Sue has seen many times in her 11 years as an inspector. ""But this isn't just any three-star hotel,"" she says. ""It has three red stars, so I expect better."" Having red stars means the Globe is among the top 130 hotels out of 4,000 in the guide published by Sue's organization.

Before they even get a warm welcome, Sue feels uneasy. The entrance from the car park is through an unmanned door with a buzzer, leading to a long, empty corridor. ""This is not what I expected,"" Sue comments. Things get worse when the receptionist says, ""We have no record of your booking,"" in a cheerful voice. It turns out that only three of the hotel's 15 rooms are occupied that night. One room is on the top floor, but Sue does not like it because it feels stuffy and has a large hole in the wall behind the wardrobe.

When Sue started her career, she earned a reputation for being tough. ""I was known as the Woman in Black,"" she remembers, ""which was funny because I never wore black. And I was never really that tough."" The next morning, after paying her bill, she reveals her identity to the hotel’s general manager, Robin Greaves. He looks scared when he sees her. Before she says anything, he apologizes for a bad smell in the main lounge. ""We think there's a blocked drain,"" he says sadly. ""The whole floor might need to be fixed.""

Sue suggests that he should also tell his staff not to quickly show guests to that lounge. ""It might be better to guide them to the other lounge,"" she advises. Greaves nods and takes notes. He has only been at the Globe for five months and seems unsure about Sue's comments being helpful for the hotel in the long run. 

However, not everything is negative. Sue praises Emma, the assistant manager, and Trudy, the young waitress, who provided information about the hotel’s 400-year history. The dinner also meets the standards to keep the hotel’s two-rosette food rating, which makes Greaves hopeful. ""What do we need to do to get three rosettes?"" he asks. Sue replies, ""Don’t serve a dessert that falls apart."" Greaves’ excitement fades.

Sue's job is to express the complaints that many customers do not have the courage to say. ""Sometimes it can be very sensitive. I remember a woman complained that I got her son fired. I just told her the truth: he served me apple pie with his fingers."" She often receives letters with false claims about her attitude or demands for bribes. ""You get used to it, but it still hurts,"" she says.

Sue must not only tell the hotel manager her findings verbally but also send a detailed written report. After all, the hotel pays for her feedback. Despite the challenges, being recognized with red stars makes it worthwhile. It is good news for Greaves that Sue will not recommend taking away the Globe's red stars. The bad news is that another inspector will return in the next two months to check if everything has been fixed. ""Good,"" Greaves says with a forced smile. ""We’ll look forward to that."""

Doug Scott, a mountaineer, shares his experiences of climbing the highest peaks on each continent, known as the Seven Summits. He began this journey later in life and will describe each mountain in the order he climbed them.

**A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)**  
While resting in a snow cave below the summit, Doug and his climbing partner, Dougal Haston, talked about sleeping bags, which seemed odd since they were alone. Doug thought he was losing oxygen and even started talking to his feet, which were getting cold. They were not just worried about surviving but also about how well they would survive. Over the next two days, Doug reflected on their time on the summit ridge and felt confident climbing with Dougal. He focused on finding a better rhythm to reach the summit.

**B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)**  
This mountain is known to be very dangerous. In April 1976, Doug and Dougal arrived at the Kahiltna Glacier and spent four days carrying equipment to the base. After the first day, they realized how difficult their climb would be. They followed a route from 1967 but decided to take a new path to the summit. They climbed with all their gear on their backs, which was a first for this area. After a tough climb, they finally reached the summit and celebrated their success.

**C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m)**  
In September 1976, Doug and his friend Paul Braithwaite flew to Nairobi to climb Mt. Kenya but ended up climbing Kilimanjaro instead. They got lost in the jungles on the lower slopes, which was serious because water was hard to find. On the second day, they found a rock pool and were relieved. They tried to climb a steep wall but had to retreat due to falling rocks and ice. They then chose a safer route to the summit.

**D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)**  
In January 1992, Doug and his wife, Sharu, arrived at Punta del Inca and met a guide named Phil Erscheler. Phil invited them to join his group climbing a less crowded route. After waiting for bad weather to pass, they set off. The Polish Glacier was icy and dangerous, so they decided to take the standard route instead. They reached the summit just before dark and met climbers who encouraged Doug to pursue the Seven Summits goal.

**E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)**  
Doug learned that climbing Vinson Massif could be funded by guiding others. In November 1992, his team traveled to the South Pole. During this time, the sun never sets, and the atmosphere is refreshing. On December 7, they set out for the summit. Despite strong winds and freezing temperatures, they all reached the top within eight hours, although visibility was very low due to a storm.

**F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)**  
In the summer of 1994, Doug's team gathered in St Petersburg. After acclimatizing, they took a cable car to 3,900m and then walked to a refuge at 4,200m. Two days later, they faced strong winds while climbing. They thought they had reached the summit but discovered there was still more to climb. They returned to the refuge and descended the volcano the next day.

**G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)**  
On their expedition to Carstensz, Doug and his team wanted to create a new climbing route and spend time with the local Dani people. They were warned about possible dangers from bandits but decided to continue. On May 12, the weather improved, and they reached the summit by 11 am. Doug received a standing ovation for completing his seventh summit.

The Merrion Hotel, a new five-star hotel, has opened in Dublin after nearly two years of work converting four large 18th-century houses. This project focused on understanding what customers want and allowed for the installation of the latest technology to benefit both staff and guests.

General Manager Peter MacCann expects his staff to know guests by name, but he uses a computer system to track guests' preferences. This system helps the hotel provide special treatment for returning clients. Although it cost £250,000 to install, MacCann believes it will be worth it over time due to its efficiency. For instance, if a guest requests specific music CDs during their first stay, those same CDs will be ready for them on their next visit, thanks to the guest-history feature.

Room temperature is another common concern for hotel guests. The Merrion has a high-tech system that allows guests to adjust the temperature within three degrees of the normal 18°C. Additionally, the front desk can change the temperature in each room between 14°C and 25°C.

Business travelers are a significant part of the hotel's clientele, making up about 65% of its business. To cater to their needs, the hotel has equipped each room with three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that also works as a photocopier and printer, and video-conferencing capabilities. The hotel has also prepared for future technological advancements by laying extra cables and renting televisions, which can be easily replaced with newer models.

Despite all this technology, MacCann emphasizes that they want guests to feel comfortable, not overwhelmed. The hotel has 145 spacious and well-furnished bedrooms that are inviting. Guests can also enjoy a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a lovely garden.

The food at the Merrion is of high quality, with Chef Patrick Guilbaud, who has two Michelin stars, moving his restaurant to the hotel. This partnership benefits both the chef and the hotel, as he has designed a modern kitchen and improved parking facilities. The hotel gains a successful dining option without financial risks. With the help of technology and a skilled staff, the Merrion Hotel is set to thrive."

Artist Susan Shepherd is well-known for her flower paintings, and the large garden around her house provides many of her subjects. It is filled with her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wildly and spread throughout the garden. The two long flower borders along the paved path that runs from east to west show a beautiful mix of colors, shapes, and structures. This beauty is partly due to the previous owners, who were passionate gardeners and left behind plants that Susan loves. She also kept the gardener, Danny. ""In fact, it was really his garden,"" she says. ""We got along very well. At first, he would say, 'Oh, it's not worth it' for some of the things I wanted to add, but when I told him I wanted to paint them, he understood my vision.""

Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than painting the entire garden. However, she sometimes paints groups of plants in their natural setting. More often, she picks a flower and takes it to her studio. ""I don't set everything up at once,"" she explains. ""I take one flower out and paint it, which might take a few days, and then I bring in another one to add to the painting. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.""

Her busiest time is spring and early summer when the tulips bloom, followed by the poppies. ""They all come out together, and you're so busy,"" she says. But she also finds beauty in the gradual decay of flowers. For example, with tulips, ""you bring them in and put them in water, then leave them for a day, and they each change into different shapes. They open up and look amazing. When you first put them in a vase, they seem dull, but they keep changing with twists and turns.""

Susan has always loved plants. ""I studied botany in school and used to collect wildflowers from the countryside,"" she says. ""I wasn't really interested in gardening back then; in fact, I didn't like garden flowers because they looked like the fake ones sold in some florists' shops. To me, only wildflowers were real. I was fascinated by how they could grow in difficult places, like cracks in rocks or on cliff tops.""

Today, her garden includes many plants from distant lands, but they seem just as comfortable in her garden as they do in their native places like China or the Himalayas. She has a relaxed attitude towards her garden, similar to a loving aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don't cause serious trouble. With two upcoming exhibitions to prepare for and plenty of subjects right outside her door, finding time to work in the garden has been challenging. She now hires an extra gardener, but despite her busy schedule, she knows that to stay connected with her subjects, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""

Many trees in the Brackham area were damaged in the severe storms that occurred in March. The town lost two large lime trees from the old market square. The loss of these important trees changed the look of the town center completely, which upset many of the more traditional residents. Normally, Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, the head of the local police, would have been among those upset. However, during the worst of the storm, when even the walnut tree in his garden fell, Pelham was too ill to notice. He was a large and healthy man, but for the first time, he was seriously sick with bronchitis. When he first felt a headache and tightness in his chest, his wife, Molly, urged him to see a doctor. Believing the police needed him, he ignored her advice and tried to keep working. This decision made him forgetful and irritable. It was only when his colleague, Sergeant Lloyd, took him to the doctor that he finally agreed to go. By then, he was too weak to argue. Soon after, she took him to the pharmacy for his antibiotics and then home to his wife, who sent him straight to bed.

On Thursday morning, when Molly told him that the walnut tree had fallen during the night, Pelham could hardly believe it. That evening, he weakly asked if the house was damaged and felt relieved to hear it was not. He then pulled the sheets over his head. It was not until Saturday, when the antibiotics worked, his fever went down, and he got up, that he realized the loss of the walnut tree had changed the living room's appearance forever. The Pelhams' large house was in a big garden. It had been expensive, but Pelham had no regrets about buying it. The green garden had given them a sense of privacy. Now, however, the storm had changed his perspective. Before, the living room had a beautiful view of the walnut tree, which did not darken the room because there was also a window on the opposite wall. The tree created interesting patterns of light and shadow that hid the worn furniture they had brought from their old house. Without the tree, the room felt harshly bright, revealing the shabby furniture. The view from the window was not pleasant either. The tall house next door, which had been hidden by the tree, was now visible, dominating the view with its unattractive purple bricks and pipes. It had many upstairs windows, all seemingly watching the Pelhams' every move. 

“Doesn’t it look terrible?” Pelham said weakly to his wife. But Molly, standing in the doorway, sounded more happy than upset. “That’s what I’ve been saying since we moved here. We need to buy a new sofa, no matter the cost.”"
FCE_16,"**Text: Living in the Valley**

We had been living in our valley for sixteen months when we first understood the dangers that could come from the surrounding hills and threaten our survival. It was the year when the storms arrived early, even before November ended. Until then, we felt safe and protected in our valley below the hills. Soon, snow began to fall. Within a day, it was about 15 centimeters deep. It almost completely blocked our lane and made the path by the stream slippery and dangerous. However, in the hills, the snow was much deeper and lasted longer. Up there, the wind blew fiercely. In our valley, we only felt sudden gusts of wind; the trees swayed, but their branches stayed strong. Still, we knew we had reasons to worry. The snow and wind were annoying, but they did not really trouble us much. The real threat was the river, the Ryburn, which usually flowed gently. It reminded us of what could happen if the water from the hills was not controlled by a series of dams built many years ago.

Soon, the snow began to melt. Day after day, we watched dark clouds gather over the hills to the west. These grey clouds spread over the valleys, twisting and turning, warning us of what was coming. We had seen enough of the sky; now we focused on the river, which was becoming fuller and wilder each day. The snow was washed away as more rain fell from the clouds, but the reservoir in the hills was filling up and nearing a dangerous level. Then it happened – for the first time in years, the reservoir overflowed. It was like Niagara Falls as the water surged over the dam and poured into the stream below. The river seemed wild as the water rushed down towards its lower stretches. Just a couple of meters from our cottage, the stream looked furious beneath the bridge. It was much deeper than we had ever seen it so close to our home, crashing violently against its banks. For three days, we hoped it would stay below its limits. Fortunately, our hopes were answered as the dam held, and the water began to go down.

In the past, before the dam was built, the river had flooded nearby villages in such a rage. Now, the dam controls the river's flow, and usually, everything is fine. The large amount of water from the hills, caused by snow and heavy rain, stays behind the dam, with only occasional overflow. Because of this protection, we can enjoy the huge clouds over the valley and appreciate the great power of the river. Thanks to the dam, we feel that our home in the valley is still safe and secure."

Film critic Mark Adams reflects on his ten years of work for a newspaper called The Front Page. Writing articles about films for this newspaper was his first real job. Before that, he had done some reviewing of novels for other newspapers, films for a magazine, and radio work. This is how he met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, who also had experience in radio and television. Tom hired Mark, but he was not mainly a journalist, which meant he was not very careful in choosing his team.

Initially, Tom wanted a group of critics to cover different art forms that did not need special knowledge, like books, TV, theatre, film, and radio. They would have a weekly lunch to discuss which topics to cover, and there would be guests to make it more enjoyable. At that time, it felt like a dream for Mark to be part of a new newspaper in a busy market. He even thought it was unlikely that a millionaire would want to help him personally. His lack of self-confidence showed when he saw someone reading the newspaper on the London Underground and found one of his reviews; he felt embarrassed.

Tom's idea for a team of critics did not work out as planned. Although it was a good idea, they did not meet as expected, and most communication happened by phone. It also became clear that the public preferred to have a reviewer focus on one subject area, so Mark decided to specialize in film. Without Tom's initial support, they would not have developed the current system where Mark writes a detailed weekly article, usually about one film. This way of working suits him well. He is not interested in the typical role of a film critic, which requires reviewing every new film. He believes that such a routine would quickly make him feel bored and frustrated.

The freedom he has allows him to expand his arguments or, during a dull week, to create something interesting from little material. But what is his role in the public eye? He thinks people choose films based on stars, advertising, or the director. There is also a tendency for viewers to stick to their preferences. It is rare for someone who dislikes westerns to watch one after reading a review, or for a fan of romantic films to avoid a love story because of a critic's opinion. So, if a film review is not a guide for consumers, what is it? Mark does not feel he must be ""right"" about a movie, nor does he believe there should be a set number of ""great"" or ""bad"" films each year. His job is to present an argument. He does not see himself as a judge, nor does he want to be one."

Why would a schoolgirl want to swim 1500 meters, cycle 40 kilometers, and then run 10 kilometers? Because ""it's fun."" 

**Teenager with a Passion for Endurance**

**Wanted:** A sports-loving training partner for a triathlete, preferably female. This is a chance to work with a potential Olympic champion. You should be very interested in distance running (regular 15 km sessions), distance swimming (enjoying winter training in cold rivers is a plus), and distance cycling (a love for 100 km rides is helpful). You must be able to do all three activities without resting.

The triathlon is becoming one of the most popular Olympic sports. It has attracted large crowds who are both fascinated and shocked by athletes who swim 1500 meters, cycle 40 kilometers, and then run 10 kilometers without stopping. While it may be exciting for spectators, what drives triathletes to push their bodies so hard? Why would a talented 17-year-old, with great academic results, give up so much for this challenging sport?

Melanie Sears has not yet learned the common phrases about personal satisfaction and mental challenges that most athletes use when asked similar questions. ""You swim 1500 meters, then run out of the water and jump on your bike, still wet. Of course, then you get cold. After the 40 km bike ride, you have to run 10 km, which feels long when you’re tired. But it’s really fun, and it’s all worth it in the end,"" she says.

Melanie entered her first triathlon at 14. ""I won the junior section, but I was the only junior competing. It felt so easy that I waved at my teammates as I went around."" Feeling confident, she entered the National Championships. Although she had the second fastest swim and the fastest run, she did not place well. ""I was following a man, and suddenly we reached the sea. We realized we had gone the wrong way. I ended up cycling 20 kilometers too far. I cried all the way through the run."" But she did not give up and is determined to keep going. ""Sometimes I wish I could stop, because then the pain would end, but I’m afraid that if I stop just once, I would want to stop again.""

Her determination impresses Steve Trew, the sport's coaching director. ""I just tested her fitness,"" he says, ""and she worked so hard on the running machine that it finally threw her off into a wall. She gave it her all, but while most people stop when they realize they can’t go further, she just kept going.""

Melanie was the top junior in this year's European Triathlon Championships, finishing 13th. ""I was almost as good as the top three in swimming and running, but much slower in cycling. That’s why I’m working very hard on it."" She is trying to convince her supportive parents, who will pay the £1,300 cost of her trip to New Zealand for this year's World Championships, to buy a £2,000 bike (it’s a special deal with £1,000 off) so she can compete in national 25 km and 100 km races later this year.

However, there is a cost. Her intense training has made her somewhat of a recluse. ""I don’t have a social life,"" she says. ""I’m not a party person anyway. After two hours of hard swimming on Friday nights, I just want to sleep. But I call and write to the other girls on the team."" What do they talk about? Boys? Clothes? ""No, we talk about our times.""

Where will all this focus lead? Melanie has tried other events, like the triathlon ""sprint,"" where you only swim 750 meters, cycle 20 kilometers, and run 5 kilometers. She wants to enter even tougher events than the triathlon. ""The big problem is, I have no one my age to train with,"" she says. Isn’t that funny?"
FCE_70,"**Text: The Collectors**

Amanda Roy discusses her passion for collecting and why many people share this hobby. Collecting is a popular activity, with one in three adults participating. It is a world filled with passion, envy, enthusiasm, and joy. However, if you decide to collect, remember this: only collect items you truly love. 

Since ancient times, people have felt the need to collect. Early humans collected pebbles and wore them as necklaces. Attracted by their shapes and colors, these pebbles were among the first objects gathered for intellectual and spiritual reasons. Over the years, not much has changed; children still collect stones and seashells for their beauty.

I have been collecting for as long as I can remember, from flowers like tulips to pottery and paintings. My first collection was stones from my parents' garden. When I was six, I attended a school in a remote, cold part of England. When my parents visited, they took me to a local museum filled with objects collected by others. I was captivated by these items. 

Interestingly, I am not alone in my interest in collecting. One in three adults shares this passion. The reasons behind collecting have become a topic of interest. Some believe it gives individuals a sense of control in their lives. For me, it is simply an enjoyable activity.

One famous collector was the Duc de Berry in France, who had a ""room of wonders"" filled with natural and artificial curiosities, like coconut shell cups and carved ivory beads. Another notable collector, Catherine the Great of Russia, owned over 4,000 paintings. However, you don’t need to be wealthy to start a collection. I have collected various items, from tulip bulbs to china cups, with great determination. 

I remember convincing a fellow tulip collector to sell me a special bulb. I planted it and cared for it, but one year it disappeared—stolen by another collector. I also collected 350 American rag dolls, searching across the USA for different designs. Unfortunately, this collection was lost in a house fire. The next morning, I stood in my front hall, saddened by the loss of my furniture and collection.

What fascinates me is how collections change hands. A silver spoon that belonged to a king or a poet adds value to items traded in markets. As certain objects become popular among collectors, their prices rise. For example, toys from the 1950s are now considered valuable, especially if kept in their original boxes. (I regret throwing away both the boxes and the toys!)"

Four people talk about their jobs.

**Lisa - Exhibition Programmes Organiser, Science Museum**  
I am in charge of creating temporary exhibitions. This involves planning, designing, and promoting the exhibition. I need to research the exhibition topic and speak with key people to understand the main themes and goals. I also decide which objects and images to display. It is important that the public understands the ideas behind the exhibition, so I plan interactive displays, workshops, and performances. I work with engineers and electricians to ensure the exhibition is safe for visitors. Before the exhibition opens, I help design and write brochures and leaflets to inform people about it.

**Janet - Teacher of London Taxi Drivers**  
When I arrive at 7:30 a.m., the first thing I do is check the accounts. Then, I see what new maps and documents need to be created for the taxi-driver test. By midday, about 50 students are in class, learning how to navigate the city. They figure out the most direct routes, using one-way streets and making the correct turns. I step in when there are disagreements, like whether a right turn is allowed at a certain junction. As they prepare for the test, I give them a simple route, but I tell them they must take a different path because the road is closed. The next student must find another route, and I will give them a reason why they cannot take that one either. This is to encourage them to think critically.

**Sarah - Marine Conservationist**  
I live by the coast and work from home. My job involves answering phone calls, creating educational materials, and organizing training courses. Sometimes, I go to our main office, but I mostly work along the coast. I collaborate with schools and study centers, running courses for coastal managers and decision-makers about marine conservation. I take them out to sea to help them understand the underwater life, which often changes their perspectives compared to making decisions on a computer. I feel very fortunate because conservation is my passion, so I find great joy in my work. However, since I work for a charity, there is always a need for more funding, which means I am constantly looking for resources and cannot achieve everything I want.

**Chris - Map and Atlas Publisher**  
My job is quite diverse. I ensure that our publishing program meets market needs and that we keep around 300 copies of the books we publish in stock. We maintain very high standards for information and content. We receive many letters from readers about issues like the representation of international borders, which require careful responses. I discuss future projects and current sales with my co-publishers. I work with a passionate team, which makes the job more enjoyable. However, like many jobs, there is a lot of administration to handle, which takes time away from more interesting tasks like product development and design."

We always went to Ireland in June. Since the four of us started going on holidays together, we spent the first two weeks of the month at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. It is a large house by the sea, not far from the village of Ardbeag. The English couple who own the house, the Malseeds, have made some additions to it, but they did so very carefully. Strafe found Glencorn for us. He saw an advertisement when the Malseeds still needed to promote their place. ""How about this?"" he said one evening and read the details. The summer before, we had gone to a hotel recommended by friends, but it was not a success because the food was terrible. The four of us have been playing cards together for a long time: Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia, and me. They call me Milly, although my real name is Dorothy Milson. Dekko got his nickname at school; Dekko Deacon sounds nice, I guess. He and Strafe were schoolmates, which is why we call Strafe by his last name, like the teachers did. We are all about the same age and live close to the town where the Malseeds lived before moving from England to Ireland. We always think it’s a funny coincidence.

""How very nice,"" Mrs. Malseed said, smiling to welcome us again this year. She seems to know when guests are arriving because she is usually waiting in the large hall that always smells of flowers. ""Arthur, take the luggage up,"" she told the old porter. ""Rose, Tulip, Lily, and Geranium,"" she said, referring to the names of the rooms we had. Mrs. Malseed painted flowers on the doors instead of using numbers. In winter, when not many people come to Glencorn Lodge, she takes care of little details like that; her husband handles repairs and redecorating. 

""Well, well, well,"" Mr. Malseed said as he entered the hall from the kitchen. ""A hundred thousand welcomes,"" he greeted us in the Irish way. He was smiling widely, and his dark brown eyes sparkled, making us feel like we were more than just another group of guests. Everyone smiled, and I could sense that the others felt our holiday had truly begun. Nothing had changed at Glencorn; everything was fine. Kitty from the dining room came out to greet us. ""You look younger every year, all four of you,"" she said, making everyone in the hall laugh again. 

Arthur led the way to our rooms, carrying as much luggage as he could and returning for the rest. After dinner, we played cards for a while, but we didn’t play for too long because we were still tired from the journey. In the lounge, there was a man alone and a French couple. There were other people at dinner, of course, because Glencorn Lodge is always full in June. From where we sat by the window, we could see some guests walking on the lawns and others taking the path down to the beach. In the morning, we would do the same: walk along the sands to Ardbeag and have coffee at the hotel there, returning in time for lunch. In the afternoon, we would drive somewhere. I knew this because over the years, we had developed this routine. Since we first came here, we had all fallen in love with the beautiful landscape in every season."

Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex, shares her experiences as a chalet girl in Val d'Isere, France. This is her second year in this role, where she cooks and cleans for visitors who come to ski and stay in traditional wooden houses called chalets. Sarah graduated last summer from Oxford Brookes University with a degree in French and History of Art. She views her job as a fun way to spend a year or two before starting a more permanent career. ""It's a great way to meet successful people,"" she says.

Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to work. She has her own breakfast before preparing breakfast for the guests, which includes porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants. After breakfast, around 9:30 a.m., she cleans up and either prepares afternoon tea for the guests or cleans the rooms, which she finds the least enjoyable part of her job. By 11 a.m., she is ready to ski, enjoying the slopes until about 4:30 p.m.

After skiing, Sarah returns to the chalet to prepare dinner. She takes a shower first but avoids sleeping, as she believes it would make her feel worse. Dinner, a three-course meal, is served at 8 p.m., and coffee is usually ready by 10 p.m. After dinner, she cleans the kitchen, as she dislikes starting the next day with a messy space. Sometimes she chats with the guests, but other times they prefer privacy. ""Good guests can make a week wonderful,"" she notes, recalling a particularly enjoyable breakfast.

Sarah lives in a chalet with friends, and they often go out around 11 p.m. They usually start their night at a place called Bananas, then might visit G Jay's and end at Dick's T-Bar. However, she avoids staying out too late on Saturdays because Sundays are her busiest days. ""It's a tough day,"" she admits, ""especially when you have to cook breakfast with a headache.""

On Sundays, Sarah starts work earlier, preparing breakfast for guests leaving by 7 a.m. Once they leave, she cleans quickly, clearing breakfast, stripping beds, and getting everything ready for new guests. If she hasn't done the shopping on Saturday, she does it now. By around 3 p.m., after finishing the cleaning, she prepares tea for the new guests who arrive around 4:30 p.m. Sometimes they seem confused and have many questions, which she finds amusing.

Between tea and dinner, Sarah helps guests who need ski equipment by taking them to the ski shop and getting a lift back. Soon, it’s time for dinner again, and sometimes she enjoys a drink afterward, but often she is too tired and goes to bed early."
FCE_27,"Miss Rita Cohen, a small girl with pale skin who looked much younger than Seymour's daughter, Marie, but claimed to be six years older, visited his factory one day. She wore overalls and large, unattractive shoes, and her curly hair framed her pretty face. Seymour found it hard to believe that she was studying at the University of Pennsylvania, researching the leather industry in New Jersey for her Master's degree. A few times a year, someone would contact Seymour to ask if they could visit his factory. Sometimes, he would help students by answering their questions over the phone or, if they seemed serious, by giving them a short tour. 

Rita was almost as small as the children from Marie's third-grade class, who had visited the factory years ago to learn how gloves were made. Seymour remembered how Marie loved to see the laying-off table, where workers shaped and pressed each glove using steam-heated brass hands. These hands were very hot and shiny, sticking up from the table like flattened hands. As a child, Marie found them fascinating and called them ""pancake hands.""

Seymour heard Rita asking, ""How many pieces come in a shipment?"" He replied, ""Between twenty and twenty-five thousand."" She took notes and asked, ""Do they come directly to your shipping department?"" He was pleased to see her interest in every detail. ""They go to the tannery first. The tannery is a contractor. We buy the material, and they prepare it for us. My grandfather and father worked in the tannery here in town. I also worked there for six months when I started in the business. Have you ever been inside a tannery?"" 

""Not yet,"" she answered. 

""Well, you should visit a tannery if you want to write about leather. I can arrange that for you. They are basic places. The technology has improved, but it’s not that different from what it was hundreds of years ago. It's tough work. Tanning is said to be one of the oldest industries, with six-thousand-year-old artifacts found in Turkey. The first clothing was just animal skins that were tanned by smoking them. It’s a fascinating subject once you dive into it. My father is a leather expert; he’s the one you should talk to. If you start a conversation with him about gloves, he could talk for two days. Glovemakers are passionate about their trade. 

By the way, have you ever seen anything being made, Miss Cohen?"" 

""I can't say I have,"" she replied. 

""Never seen anything manufactured?"" 

""I saw my mother bake a cake when I was a child."" 

He laughed; her answer amused him. She was innocent yet eager to learn. His daughter was at least 30 cm taller than Rita, fair where Rita was dark, but otherwise, Rita reminded him of Marie. He remembered how Marie would come home from school, full of what she had learned, her notebook filled with neatly written notes that she memorized overnight. 

""I have an idea. We will take you through the entire glove-making process. Come on! We’re going to make you a pair of gloves, and you will watch them being made from start to finish. What size do you wear?"""

Raquel Graham calls from a taxi on her way to the airport. She cannot meet us tomorrow because her boss needs her in Los Angeles. As a personal assistant to a pop star, she often travels around the world at a moment's notice. Raquel loves her job and has a good relationship with her boss, but there is one small issue—she dislikes flying. ""On a nine-hour flight to California, I usually take sleeping pills to help me relax,"" she shares. Her worst experience was flying on Concorde, which felt too enclosed with its small windows. When she is not traveling, she works in offices in Manchester and London, handling routine tasks like organizing schedules, attending meetings with lawyers and accountants, and planning travel. Raquel did not apply for this job; she met the manager of a pop group by chance, which led to her behind-the-scenes work. She also took a secretarial course in the evenings. Five years later, she was in the right place when her boss needed a personal assistant.

**B. David Brown**  
David Brown has worked as an accountant and a golf caddy, which is someone who carries a golfer's bags. He prefers caddying because golf is his passion. However, there are downsides. He earns a small flat fee plus a percentage of the winnings, with average earnings between £25,000 and £35,000, much of which goes to travel and hotels. He started caddying for golfer Greg Norman when he was 31. ""You're not just carrying bags; you're giving advice, using your knowledge, and reading the course,"" he explains. Recently, his accounting skills were recognized by European Tour Productions, which made him a statistical data administrator. He collects and analyzes statistics from the caddies, which are valuable to TV commentators, golf magazines, and the players.

**C. Martin Fern**  
Martin Fern is the editor of the ""Food and Drink"" section of a daily newspaper. One of his easier tasks is to taste food at fine restaurants. What does he think about expensive restaurants? ""For those who can afford it, it's their choice,"" he says. ""I would rather spend £120 on a memorable meal than buy a microwave."" His cooking talent led to a friend offering him a food column in a Saturday Review. At that time, he was the creative director of an advertising agency, and it provided him with extra income. When he was 42, another newspaper offered him a full-time job. ""It meant a 50% cut in my guaranteed income,"" he says, ""but it was a chance to turn my passion into a career."" He still cooks at home and tries to stay fit by cycling a couple of miles to the nearest tube station.

**D. Dick Prince**  
""I started writing children's stories about 20 years ago,"" says Dick Prince, one of Britain's most popular children's authors. ""Before that, I loved words and enjoyed writing, but I mostly wrote poetry. Then I had an idea for a story. Having been a farmer, I knew about the problem of chickens being killed by a fox. So, I wrote a story called *The Fox Busters*, which became my first published children's book."" Where do his ideas come from? ""It's not easy; I have to work for them,"" he says. ""I usually do this in the mornings. I don't wake up at dawn, though. After lunch, I spend a couple of hours typing what I wrote in the morning—all with one finger on an old typewriter instead of a laptop, which I dislike. I receive between 50 and 100 letters a week, and that is the part of being a writer I enjoy the most. I try to answer them all, but I now have some secretarial help."""
FCE_66,"Text: In the lumberyard by the lake, where trees were turned into boards for building, there was an old two-story brick building. Surrounding it were large piles of soft sawdust, creating golden mounds that reached down to the blue lake. That afternoon, feeling bored, a group of boys followed Michael up the ladder to the roof of the old building. They sat with their legs hanging over the edge, looking out at the lake. Suddenly, Michael said, ""I dare you to jump down."" Without thinking, he jumped off the roof and landed in the sawdust, rolling around and laughing. ""I dare you all!"" he shouted. ""You're all cowards,"" he teased, trying to get them to jump too. 

Still laughing, he watched as they hesitated on the roof, looking scared. One by one, they jumped down, relieved to land safely. In the warm afternoon sun, they lay on the sawdust pile, telling jokes. Eventually, one of the boys suggested, ""Let's go back up to the roof and jump down again."" Although they were not very excited, they climbed back up and began jumping off in a determined way. Soon, only Michael was left on the roof, while the others grinned up at him, calling, ""Come on, Mike. What's wrong with you?"" 

Michael wanted to join them, but he stayed at the edge of the roof, nervously licking his lips and grinning foolishly. He wondered why the jump had not seemed so scary the first time. For a while, they thought he was just joking, but then they noticed him clenching his fists. He tried to count to ten and jump, but when that didn't work, he took a deep breath and closed his eyes. 

After a while, the boys started laughing at him. They were tired of waiting, and it was almost dinnertime. ""Come on, you're a coward! Do you think we're going to sit here all night?"" they shouted. When he still didn't move, they began to walk away, still teasing him. ""Who started this? What's wrong with you all?"" he called out. But he remained on the edge of the roof, staring unhappily at the ground. 

He stayed there alone for nearly an hour while the sun slowly set over the lake. His clothes were damp from nervous sweat. Finally, he closed his eyes, jumped off the roof, and landed heavily in the sawdust, lying there for a long time. The yard was quiet; the workers had gone home. As he lay there, he wondered why he had been unable to jump earlier. Eventually, he got up slowly and walked home, feeling ashamed and wanting to avoid everyone. 

He was so late for dinner that his stepmother said coldly, ""You're old enough to get home on time. If you won't come home, you might as well stay out tonight."" She was a strong woman with fair skin, a hint of grey in her hair, and a patient smile. Although she spoke firmly, Michael, with his dark, gloomy face, hardly heard her. He was still thinking about the grinning faces below and their laughter."
FCE_44,"**Careers Advice**

Are you unhappy in your job and unsure how to change it? Kitty Doherty offers some helpful advice. Many people looking to change their careers turn to a careers adviser. You will need to write a brief history of yourself and take several tests called 'psychometrics'. Afterward, you will receive a summary of the results, along with suggested careers and any retraining you might need.

I decided to try Career Analysts, one of the largest career advice organizations. Taking the careers test felt like being back in a science exam. I was in a group of about ten people, answering questions under time pressure. I had to remind myself that it wasn't about passing or failing. It was difficult to see how the psychometric tests could accurately represent me. The tests included tasks like finding mistakes in lists of names and numbers and matching similar shapes.

After the tests, I had a long conversation with an adviser. Based on our discussion and the test results, he created a report with his observations and recommendations. I agreed with most of his conclusions, although I was a bit disappointed to learn that I had performed poorly in the scientific, technical, and practical tests. I’m sure many sick people are relieved I never became a nurse! However, it was comforting to hear that I had made the right choices regarding journalism.

Changing your career doesn’t always mean a complete shift. Last March, after working as a marketing manager at a large insurance company for five years, 25-year-old Donna Laney lost her job. Her friends encouraged her to seek help from Career Analysts. ""Losing my job was a great chance for me to step back and evaluate my career,"" Donna says. ""I wanted to reassess my skills and interests."" Some of the results surprised her. ""I didn’t realize I had such a talent for design. But in the end, I had to weigh the cost of retraining in design against my financial responsibilities,"" she explains. Other suggestions included taking a year off to work in the Far East. ""I chose to use my existing skills and move into a field that suited me better than insurance. I am now a Public Relations officer. I believe I would have reached this point without Career Analysts, but they helped me understand what I truly wanted to do. I’ve recommended them to several friends, and they are all satisfied with the service.""

Not everyone finds career advice helpful. Amanda Margetts, a 24-year-old sales representative, says, ""I reached a point in my career where I felt lost. I thought a careers adviser might suggest something new. Although I received many ideas, I rejected them because they either required a significant pay cut or a lot of retraining. I didn’t learn anything new about myself,"" she says. ""You have to share a lot of personal information with the adviser, and I felt that if I had told a friend the same things, they would have given me similar advice."""
FCE_22,"**Text: Fun at the Dentist's?**

If you visit W. Lloyd Jerome's dental clinic in the center of Glasgow, you will notice bright, modern paintings on the walls and a stylish blue couch where patients sit while he examines their teeth. Jerome mentions, ""Fifty percent of people only visit the dentist when they are in pain instead of going for regular check-ups. This is often because they are scared."" To change this, he has worked to create a space where people feel comfortable. For example, he decided not to wear a white coat, as many people link it to pain. He believes that dental treatment should happen in a relaxing, interesting, and enjoyable atmosphere.

This approach may surprise many, as most people associate dental visits with discomfort or formal settings. Jerome states, ""If patients are relaxed, entertained, and treated well, they will forget their past negative experiences."" One of his innovative relaxation methods is using virtual-reality headsets. ""We were the first dental practice in Britain to use them, and they are very popular. During the initial check-up, the patient sits comfortably on the blue couch and watches a film about underwater wildlife while I examine their teeth. Then, the headset switches to a special camera that gives the patient a visual tour of their mouth.""

Interestingly, most patients seem to enjoy this part of their dental visit. Another important aspect is that the clinic smells more like a perfume shop than a dentist's office. Today, there is a pleasant smell of orange. Jerome explains, ""When people enter, I want them to realize through all their senses that this is not a typical dentist's visit. Smell is crucial. The usual dental smell can make someone anxious if they are afraid of dentists."" I found the gentle scent in the clinic very nice.

Although Jerome is known as Glasgow's most stylish dentist, he emphasizes that he takes his work seriously. While relaxation techniques are important, the quality of treatment is the top priority. For instance, Jerome uses a special tool that sprays warm water on the teeth to clean them instead of scraping, which can feel strange at first, but is not painful if the patient is relaxed.

Five years ago, Jerome traveled to the United States to study dental techniques. ""One thing I learned is that making it easier for the patient also makes it easier for the dentist,"" he explains. He believes his patient-focused approach is the beginning of a shift towards a more relaxed style in the traditional British dentistry field.

At that moment, a patient arrives. Jerome quickly goes over, offers him a cup of tea (herbal or regular), asks what video he would like to watch, and gently guides him to the chair.

Chocolate, which originated in South America, is now a major global business worth millions. During Easter, British people spend over £230 million on chocolate, with eight percent of all chocolate sales happening at this time. Only at Christmas do people consume more chocolate. 

Although large-scale chocolate production started in the last century, the cacao plant was first grown by the Aztec, Toltec, and Mayan civilizations in Central America over three thousand years ago. The cacao tree is a tropical evergreen found in Africa, South and Central America, the West Indies, and Southeast Asia. Its fruit is the size of a melon and contains 20 to 40 seeds. When dried, these seeds become cacao beans, which are used to make chocolate. In English-speaking countries, they are often mistakenly called cocoa beans, a misspelling from the 17th century when they were also referred to as cacoa and cocao beans. 

The Aztecs used cocoa beans as currency and made a drink called xocoatl, which means ""bitter water"" in the Aztec language, Nahuatl. In Aztec times, this chocolate drink was flavored with spices and served during ceremonies and to welcome guests. The Spanish found it more enjoyable when mixed with cinnamon and sugar, but the recipe did not reach the rest of Europe for another hundred years. 

In the late 17th century, chocolate houses opened in major European cities where people gathered to drink chocolate. Until the last century, the drink was made from solid chocolate blocks that had to be melted in hot water. In 1826, CJ van Houten from the Netherlands invented chocolate powder by removing most of the cocoa butter from crushed beans. The modern chocolate bar began in 1847 when a Bristol company, Fry and Sons, mixed cocoa butter with pure chocolate liquor and sugar to create a solid block. A Swiss company later added milk solids, resulting in milk chocolate.

At the turn of the century, French companies dominated the British chocolate market. In 1879, the English company Cadbury named their Birmingham factory Bournville, hoping to attract some French charm. Then, Cadbury introduced the Dairy Milk bar, originally called Dairymaid in 1905. Smart advertising linked it to the health benefits of milk from the English countryside, making it a strong competitor to luxurious French brands. 

Currently, chocolate consumption in Britain has stabilized at about four bars per week, prompting manufacturers to find new ways to attract customers. One recent marketing strategy is the ""extended line,"" where chocolate bars are transformed into ice cream, soft drinks, or desserts to appeal to chocolate lovers who want something new. 

Meanwhile, cacao farmers are still struggling due to a drop in cocoa bean prices in the late 1980s. Many small-scale farmers went out of business. So, as you enjoy your next chocolate bar, consider the challenges faced by these farmers."
FCE_18,"**THE SHELL ARTIST**

At 83 years old, Peter Cooke has become a master in his craft. He still has many interests, such as paper-making and feather-work, but for now, he focuses on creating delicate and unique objects from shells. As he shows me his work in his apartment, he asks, ""Tell me if I am boring you."" There is a fine line between being boring and being passionate, but Cooke is clearly the latter, thanks to his charm and the beauty of his creations.

He points to some shell-covered ornaments above his fireplace. ""I won’t mind if people don’t buy them because I’ve grown so fond of them. I never intended to sell my work. About five years ago, some friends suggested I have an exhibition so people could see my art. They even spoke to a gallery owner."" This led to a successful exhibition in London, where 70% of his pieces sold. His second exhibition opened yesterday. Given the high prices of his work—around £2,000 for the ornaments—Cooke seems to think that giving up some space above his fireplace is a small price to pay.

There are 86 pieces in the exhibition, with prices starting at £225 for a shell-flower in a crystal vase. Cooke insists he has no control over the prices and is open about them. He believes that no one else creates work like his, and as the gallery owner told him, ""One day you will stop, and everyone will want your pieces because there won’t be any more.""

Cooke wishes he had started this art earlier in life, as he feels he could have created even more wonderful things. Although he still has many ideas and does his best now, he feels more limited physically than when he began. Nevertheless, his work is far from the typical shell crafts found in seaside shops. ""I have a miniature mind,"" he says, which has led him to create boxes covered in thousands of tiny shells, shaded pictures made from shells, and baskets of incredibly realistic flowers.

He has developed his own methods and uses materials he finds. For example, he uses cardboard from laundered shirts for flower bases, a special glue bought in bulk from a sail-maker, and washing-up liquid to clean the shells. ""I have an idea of what I want to do, and it just happens,"" he explains about his working process. However, the attention to detail, color variations, and symmetry in his work seem far from random.

Cooke's search for beautiful, especially tiny, shells has taken him beyond his local beaches in Norfolk to places like France, Thailand, Mexico, South Africa, and the Philippines. He insists that he only collects dead shells and defends himself against accusations of damaging the environment. ""When I collect shells, I hear people stepping on them much faster than I can gather them. The remaining shells are broken by the sea. I would never collect shells with living creatures inside or dive for them, but once the creatures have left, why shouldn’t I collect them?"" His argument is convincing, especially considering the beauty of his work often exceeds the sum of its parts."
FCE_62,"**The Schoolgirl Model**

Kira Langer is a 15-year-old girl who balances her modeling career with school. When she is not traveling to exciting places or appearing on magazine covers, she is studying for her exams. Jane Laidlaw shares more about her.

The receptionist at Kira's modeling agency informed me that Kira would be late. I thought about the negative stereotypes I had heard about models, such as being difficult or vain. I worried that Kira might not show up at all or that she would be in a bad mood if she rushed in. However, when Kira, the winner of the Looks magazine supermodel competition, arrived, she was smiling, calm, and accompanied by her mother. She wore a simple black dress and trainers, showing no signs of arrogance. Instead, she was friendly and approachable.

Kira explained that models under 16 must bring an adult with them to work. Her mother, who looked proud of her daughter, was just a regular mom. Kira seemed a bit surprised by her sudden fame, which was unexpected. It was her older sister who encouraged her to enter the modeling competition. Kira initially said no, but her sister submitted some photos anyway. When Kira learned she was a finalist while at school, she gained the confidence to participate, and she won easily. The Select model agency in London quickly offered her work.

Now, Kira finds it challenging to manage her two lives as a student and a model. Her friends and teachers are proud of her success, but some classmates make rude comments, saying she has a high opinion of herself. Kira finds this difficult, especially since she is not self-important. She explains, ""They think that because I became a model, I can't stay the same. The only change is that I am more confident, but not in a bad way.""

Being a busy model affects her social life. The agency can call her at any time for a job the next day, making it hard for her to make plans with friends. ""If my friends go out, I can't promise to join them because I don't know my schedule,"" she says. However, her friends understand and do not complain about her modeling commitments.

Kira has the talent, looks, and support to have a successful career ahead of her, even before finishing her school exams. As I conclude the interview with this remarkable girl, I ask what she would like to do if she didn't have her beauty. She pauses and replies, ""I'd like to do what you're doing."""

Father and son start Gold Rush

Terence and Chris Madden have traveled from the cold north of Canada to the hot lands of Africa in search of valuable metals. This father and son team—one an explorer and the other a mineral expert—believe their mine on a Welsh mountain could hold up to 10,000 ounces of gold. After ten years of digging in the Welsh hills, they are sure they are very close to a gold vein worth five million dollars. ""As we dig, we are finding high levels of gold; now we just need to dig a few more meters to where it is concentrated,"" said Terence, 68, from Liverpool.

The pair have dedicated their lives to finding gold. Their search began when Terence read about gold worth millions buried in the 'Dolgellau gold belt,' an area near the town of Dolgellau in Wales. While reading old mining journals and newspapers at the Welsh National Library in Aberystwyth, they chose the best area of land to explore. Since they first cleared the land and found pieces of gold in the rocks, they have spent the last ten years getting permission from landowners, taking soil samples, and removing old cars and trash. They have dug out 150 tonnes of greenstone rock to create a tunnel and a 10-meter shaft.

Now, they are running low on money. After spending their savings on this dream, they need to convince someone to invest £50,000 to dig a few more meters to reach the gold. Chris Madden says, ""Right now, this seems unlikely, but we have several people we can contact.""

As news of their dig spread through the valleys last week, the allure of gold began to attract the attention of local residents as well as other gold diggers. Dolgellau depends on tourism, and locals are cautiously optimistic. ""If they are right, it would bring more visitors here,"" said Peter Woolven, manager of the Royal Ship Hotel, ""but if they find gold, I hope millions of people don’t come and damage the hillside.""

The Welsh gold industry has greatly declined since its peak in the late 1880s when thousands worked in many mines across the countryside. One of the last remaining mines, Clogau-St David's, which made wedding rings for the Queen and the Princess of Wales, closed a month ago. However, individual gold diggers are returning. George Hall, another prospector, plans to dig a tunnel deep into the hill on the other side of the ridge from the Maddens. ""Searching for gold is very emotional,"" said Hall, 70. ""It's adventurous and exciting, the thrill of finding hidden treasure. Maybe I will be lucky this time."""
FCE_31,"**Text: IN HOT WATER**

Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends a lot of time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She teaches and researches marine geochemistry, which means she studies the chemical processes in the sea. Rachel is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she is not teaching, she gets into a small steel vehicle designed for underwater exploration and dives three kilometres down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes. 

Inside the vehicle, space is very limited, and she can touch the two pilots. They are used to these conditions, where they cannot stand up or move freely, and they must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last for 16 hours: three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours to collect rock and water samples, and three hours to return to the surface. If there is an emergency and they need to get to the top quickly, they can press a panic button. This releases a small escape vessel that rises quickly to the surface. Rachel says, ""No one has tested it yet, but I don't think it would be a very pleasant journey.""

Rachel recalls her first experience in the vehicle. It was on the deck of a ship, and she got in with an instructor who explained the emergency procedures, including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack. They were assessing how she would react in such a small space. Now, Rachel has made six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian crew to a site five days west of the Canary Islands in the Atlantic. There, on the ocean floor, is a large area of underwater volcanoes, with their chimneys releasing black smoke. The Russian team was dropping off scientific equipment to study the effects of a multinational program that would create a hole 150 metres through a volcano.

When Rachel is not at sea, she works in her office at the Oceanography Centre in Southampton. She says, ""Two-thirds of my salary comes from teaching, which I love, but I do it so I can continue my research on the 'black smokers,' another name for underwater volcanoes. Water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke, pouring out at a rate of one metre per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees.""

Rachel shares a frightening experience from her first dive with an American team. They were towing equipment on a 50-metre rope when there was an explosion. She felt a huge bang as shock waves hit their vehicle and thought, ""I'm going to die."" They looked at each other in silence, waiting. When nothing happened, they were incredibly relieved to find they were still alive.

Diving to the deepest part of the ocean is an adventure for Rachel. Every time she looks out of the porthole and sees the chimneys, she feels a sense of wonder. She thinks, ""Here I am at the bottom of the sea, and no one else on this planet has ever seen them before."" After studying the black smokers for three years for her PhD, seeing them in person was an amazing experience."
FCE_58,"Text: ""I felt dirty, smelly, hungry, and a bit sunburned. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. My body was exhausted, and my mind was tired of dealing with foreign train schedules, currencies, and languages. 'Never again,' I thought as I returned home. I repeated this thought the next year and the year after that. All I needed was one train ticket, and since I was under twenty-five, I could travel anywhere in Europe for a whole month. 

Once you learn to sleep in a train corridor, regular beds feel different. Carrying all your belongings in a rucksack makes you travel simply and can lead to wasteful habits, like burning socks that smell bad or throwing away finished books. However, this carefree attitude is part of the Inter-Rail spirit, where common sense can be set aside along with your paperback and socks. All it takes is one of those tickets in your hand. 

A system that allows young people to travel through multiple countries in a day is special. On my first trip, my friends and I didn’t realize the full potential of this train ticket; we thought it was just a cheap way to reach our campsite in southern France. But the idea of continuous travel was too appealing, as there was always another country just beyond the border, always a little further to explore. And the extra miles? They cost us nothing. 

We were not completely uninterested in culture, but this was our first holiday without parents, like many other Inter-Railers. In planning our own schedule, we focused only on the most accessible sights. It was a chance to escape guided tours and do something different. I took pride in the fact that sometimes all I wanted to see was the view from the train station. We were just trying to get by and enjoy ourselves, just like most other Inter-Railers with whom we shared train corridors, food, money, and music. 

The excitement of travel comes from the sudden reality of a place that was once just a name. It feels like the city you arrive in didn’t exist until the train pulls into the station, and you see it with your own tired eyes for the first time. Only by experiencing Europe, watching the changing landscapes, and noticing different attitudes and lifestyles can you truly understand the continent. Everyone knows what is there, but it means little until you see it yourself. This is why other people's holiday photos can be dull. While the train journey may not reveal new discoveries in the world, it is a valuable personal experience. Europe is vast, and Inter-Rail offers the best chance to appreciate this, even if it didn’t happen for us right away."""
FCE_37,"Text: 'There is nothing more disappointing than arriving at an airport in another country and finding out that your luggage has been left behind. At best, you will have to wear the same clothes for hours or even days until the airline returns your bags. At worst, you might be in a different climate, far from home, and stuck in unsuitable clothing. Although airlines do not often share how many bags they lose, it is a reality that regular travelers will eventually experience lost luggage. Even the best airlines make mistakes sometimes, and no airline can guarantee that your checked luggage will travel on the same flight, especially if your journey involves changing planes.

The system works like this: Airlines require passengers to check in early, which is meant to give enough time for bags to be processed and loaded onto the plane. Minimum connecting times (MCTs) are the shortest time needed to transfer between two flights, and these times are also extended to allow for baggage transfers. Normally, this system works well. However, extra security checks and air traffic issues can lead to flight delays, which can disrupt the baggage system. Human error or accidents, such as a destination label being torn off, can also cause problems. These issues can be worse at large airports, known as 'hubs', because they handle many bags. 

For example, last year, London’s Heathrow airport served over 41 million passengers, with nine million changing planes. British Airways alone managed two million transfer passengers at Heathrow, most of whom transferred between Terminal 1 (for domestic and European flights) and Terminal 4 (for long-distance flights). Even efficient airports like Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Singapore, and Zurich can have bad days. The risk of losing luggage when changing planes is higher at certain airports. In the United States, Miami airport is known for losing luggage when transatlantic passengers make quick connections to Latin America.

To reduce the chance of losing your luggage, choose direct flights whenever possible and check in well before the official time. If you must change planes, try to fly with the same airline for all legs of your journey. Allow extra time for connections by taking an earlier flight to the transfer airport, and make sure to label your luggage inside and out with your home and holiday addresses, including your flight numbers. If your luggage still goes missing, contact the airline staff in the baggage area and fill out a property irregularity report (PIR) before leaving the airport.'"
FCE_2,"**Text: The Kingfisher**

Wildlife photographer Charlie James is an expert on the kingfisher, a beautiful blue-green bird that lives near streams and rivers and feeds on fish. Old trees hang over the stream, providing shade to the shallow water. The main colors in this scene are soft greens, browns, and various shades of yellow from the sunlight, creating a peaceful atmosphere, much like the gentle sounds of water in the breeze. The kingfisher moves quickly and gracefully, like a flash of light, leaving a strong impression even after it disappears in an instant. 

Charlie James fell in love with kingfishers when he was young. His deep affection for this small bird is shown by his uncertainty about what exactly attracts him to it. The kingfisher is part of many legends. In Greek mythology, it is a moon goddess that transformed into a bird. Another story tells how the kingfisher flew so high that its upper body became the blue of the sky, while its lower body was burned by the sun. There is some truth to this tale. Despite the various shades of blue in their feathers, kingfishers do not have blue pigment. Instead, the structure of their feathers scatters light, making them appear blue. This is why a kingfisher can look bright blue or rich emerald green depending on the angle of the light.

It is no surprise that many wildlife photographers are passionate about kingfishers. Their vibrant colors, combined with the fact that they are shy but can be observed from a distance, create a perfect opportunity for photographers. Charlie James's first hideout was an old blanket he draped over himself while waiting near a kingfisher's favorite spot. The bird returned within minutes and sat just a meter away. However, it took him another four years to capture his first good photograph. During this time, the European kingfisher became a major part of his life. He spent as much time as possible by a stream rich with kingfishers, but school limited his time with the birds. He missed classes and considered himself an ""academic failure."" Nevertheless, his passion for this widespread kingfisher, the only one of its family that breeds in Europe, was recognized. At 16, he was hired as an advisor for a nature magazine, then became an assistant to the editor, and eventually worked as a freelance wildlife film cameraman.

Now, he dreams of making the ultimate kingfisher film: ""No speech, just beautiful images that say it all,"" he says. ""I’m drawn to simplicity. I like to photograph parts of kingfisher wings..."" His voice trails off as he thinks about the colors of the bird he has spent more than half his life observing, which still fascinates him. His photographs express some of his feelings, but Charlie knows that there is much more to his connection with the kingfisher than his work can ever reveal."

Giving directions to an orchestra is challenging. Anne Inglis speaks with five new conductors about their experiences.

**A. ANNE MANSON**  
Anne Manson, 30, asked to attend conductor Claudio Abbado's practice sessions in Vienna and ended up filling in for an absent assistant. She was later invited to help with another opera the following season. ""I had to lead the first orchestral rehearsal for Abbado. I wasn't nervous. I have always felt confident standing in front of an orchestra."" Manson, who is from America, works with a well-known opera company in London that focuses on modern works. She is also gaining recognition in other European countries, thanks to support from the British Arts Council. Since that first experience, she has assisted Abbado on several projects.

**B. ANDREW CONSTANTINE**  
Andrew Constantine, 31, believes the hardest part of being a conductor is finding the right opportunities. He won a major competition in 1991 after two unsuccessful attempts. Looking back, he feels lucky about the timing: ""If it had happened earlier, I would have been forgotten."" The competition opened many doors for him, including a position as an assistant to a famous conductor. However, he struggles with being labeled as a competition winner: ""If in three years my name is still linked to the competition, I will be concerned. But orchestras like the English Chamber Orchestra, which hired me after the competition, are inviting me back. If that doesn't happen, my career could suffer.""

**C. WASFI KANI**  
Wasfi Kani, who founded Pimlico Opera, enjoys the long rehearsal periods that come with opera productions. ""The music deserves four weeks of focus,"" she says. Kani began conducting seriously in her late twenties. After university, she worked in London's commercial sector until Pimlico Opera became fully professional two years ago. Starting lessons with Sian Edwards was a turning point for her. ""I saw her conduct and realized she was my size—previously, I had only learned from much larger conductors, which makes a big difference."" She appreciates the complexity of opera: ""There are many conflicts, and you have to consider the personalities of the singers.""

**D. ROGER VIGNOLES**  
Roger Vignoles, 48, says, ""Conducting surprised me, but it fascinates me."" This career path is not so unusual for him; he began as a resident musician at an opera house and worked with talented conductors. Last year, he was asked to direct Handel's Agrippina from the piano at a festival, something he had never done before. ""It was easier than I expected. I knew the music well and what I wanted it to sound like. I did my best to achieve the performance I envisioned. Thankfully, people respect my skills as a musician. I am learning from every experience I've had, both in musical style and performance. Now, I am open to any opportunities to discover what I enjoy.""

**E. WAYNE MARSHALL**  
In 1986, conductor Simon Rattle noticed a young assistant conductor during one of his productions and informed his agent about Wayne Marshall. Now 32, Marshall quickly found himself conducting a musical in London on short notice, which was a tough start. He even had to manage some relaxed professional musicians who were reading newspapers during the show: ""I was firm with them. I always kept a clear beat and aimed for the best results. Many orchestral musicians I’ve encountered don’t seem to need guidance from a conductor. But I’m never afraid to express my needs. If people see you’re anxious, it only gets worse. I have never formally studied conducting, and no book teaches you how to do it, but people have been supportive. I am determined and know what I like."""
FCE_23,"**Variations on a Theme**

If you are considering taking children to a theme park, there are many options in Britain. We asked five families to review some of the best parks.

**Fun Island - The Burns Family**  
Last year, we visited a large theme park in the US and thought Fun Island might not be as exciting. However, we were pleasantly surprised. The park is designed for younger children, so our three-year-old felt included. The kids enjoyed the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. There is a special dodgems ride for very young children, which was a big hit. For older kids, there are thrilling rides like Splash Out, where you end up in a pool! After five hours, my husband Steve and I were ready to leave, but the children wanted to stay because they were having so much fun. Our only complaint is that the park could use more atmosphere, and the scenery was not very appealing. However, the staff were very helpful, and we found the park to be clean, well-organized, and focused on safety.

**Wonderland - The McMillan Family**  
None of us had been to a theme park before, so we were unsure what to expect. We thought Oscar might be too young, but he loved it. He enjoyed the Mountain Train and especially liked Little Land, which has small models of famous buildings that he could explore! The older children liked the ferris wheel and driving toy cars on a real road layout. We spent six hours there and appreciated the areas where we could relax. The landscaping was beautiful, and the staff were friendly and helpful. There was something for everyone, including adults.

**Adventure World - The Jeffree Family**  
After seven hours, we felt there was still more to see. The children loved the Big Top Circus, which had an amazing trapeze act that kept us excited. We tried the Terror Line, and although the girls were scared and kept their eyes closed, they said they enjoyed it. Their favorite ride was Running River, where you think you will get wet, but you don’t. Toy Land is also great fun for younger children. The kids looked at the new ride, Fear Factor, but we were relieved when they realized they were too small to go on it! The park is so well designed that even waiting in line for rides is not boring. It was very clean, and the staff were excellent. On one ride, I couldn’t sit with both girls, so a staff member kindly offered to accompany one of them.

**The Great Park - The Langridge Family**  
We arrived at one o'clock and were disappointed that the park closed at 5 p.m. This is a fantastic theme park for younger children because the rides are not too scary. I am quite timid, but I still had a great time. We all loved Exotic Travels, a boat ride that starts slowly and then becomes very exciting. We waited for half an hour for Lightning River, and it was over too quickly! I wouldn’t try the Big Leap, but it looked fun if you are brave. If the children had been a bit older, they might have found it less exciting, but they were the right age and enjoyed it.

**Fantasy World - The Break-all Family**  
According to the park's advertising, there is 'No Limit to the Fun', and we certainly felt that was true. Europe's tallest roller-coaster, the Rocket, stands out in the park, and Ben thought it was the scariest ride, while Jennie said the Hanger, where you hang upside-down 30 meters above the ground, was even scarier! There are about a dozen main rides, which the older children went on several times. Sarah was too small for some rides but enjoyed the Long Slide. We found the staff's attitudes varied. Some were great with younger children, but the welcome was not always warm. You need a full day to enjoy Fantasy World. We wouldn’t have dared tell the kids we were going home early."
FCE_60,"**Running a Business in the Countryside**

Five women share their experiences of starting a business in the countryside.

A. **Christine Hogan** runs a computer-aided design business that earns over £200,000 a year and has four full-time employees. She says, ""My customers are friends."" Christine and her husband moved from London to the countryside when their children were young. She wanted a job she could do from home. Since she had experience with computers, her husband encouraged her to start this business. Although it required a lot of money and was challenging at first, she managed her finances carefully and kept the bank informed about her spending. Working from home saves her money, and she can work in the evenings if needed. The business remains small, and most customers pick up their orders directly.

B. **Maggy Sasanow** is a greetings card designer who works from home. She studied art at university and initially wanted to work in a museum. However, after moving to the countryside, she decided to start her own business, creating a collection of 50 cards that she sells to museums. She works in a large room upstairs. One downside of working from home is that there are always chores to do, like mowing the lawn. Maggy relies on word-of-mouth for business and does not advertise. She finds that her prices are lower than those of other artists, which attracts customers from London. Although she misses exchanging ideas with others, she believes the benefits of working alone outweigh the drawbacks.

C. **Delia Turner** runs a curtain-making business that has faced ups and downs. She started her business eight years ago when the market was growing, and her income increased from £24,000 to £80,000 in two years. At one point, she managed six full-time employees, but due to an economic downturn, she had to let them go, which was difficult because jobs are scarce in her area. Now, she makes curtains at home with her husband's help and collaborates with women who work from their homes. Delia knows she must be flexible with her prices and explore new opportunities.

D. **Tessa Strickland** operates a children's book publishing business from her farmhouse. She moved to the countryside three years ago for financial reasons and because she loves the rural lifestyle. Tessa enjoys the freedom to work on her schedule, but 80% of her income comes from international deals, requiring her to take calls at unusual hours. She finds it challenging to maintain discipline and close her office door. Tessa publishes children's books that reflect various cultures, collaborating with authors and artists. Initially, she felt isolated since all her professional experience was in London.

E. **Meg Rivers** runs a cakes-by-post business and a shop that generates £250,000 a year, employing six people, some part-time. She started her business ten years ago from home, focusing on health by making fruit cakes with high-quality ingredients. After receiving requests from friends and family, she began shipping cakes nationwide. Seven years ago, she rented a small building where everything is produced, employing a baker, an assistant, and a professional cake decorator. Meg no longer bakes herself, as she manages the business side. Her biggest challenge has been the financial aspect, as she started with limited funds."
FCE_1,"**Text: Meet the Amazing Watkins Family**

The Watkins family is special because they are all involved in music. The sons are composers and award-winning musicians, while their father makes musical instruments. 

John and Hetty Watkins, who are schoolteachers in South Wales, wanted to buy a cello for their ten-year-old son, Paul, but found it too expensive. John thought about making one himself. He discovered the Welsh School of Instrument Making nearby and took evening classes for about three years. 

After trying to make violins and violas, John successfully made his first cello. Paul, now 28, remembers using that cello until recently. John has since retired from teaching to become a full-time craftsman, making up to twelve violins a year. One of his violins was sold to the famous American musician Jaime Laredo, which he considers a great achievement.

Paul and his younger brother, Huw, were encouraged to play music from a young age. Paul started with the piano and then moved to the cello. Although their father wanted Paul to play the violin, Paul preferred the cello after being inspired by a cellist in his father's music group. Huw, now 22, is also making a name for himself as a pianist and composer. He appreciated the support from his parents and felt motivated by Paul’s success.

Paul has achieved great things with the cello his father made. He won the string final of the BBC Young Musician of the Year competition and became the principal cellist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra at just 20 years old. Recently, he has started using a Francesco Rugeri cello, which is on loan from the Royal Academy of Music. Paul jokes that his father's cello will improve with age, just like his new one, which is already 304 years old.

Soon, Paul will perform on television with the Rugeri cello in Elgar's Cello Concerto. He believes that his performance will be unique, regardless of the cello's history. However, he will miss watching himself on TV because he is performing at the Cheltenham Festival that same night. Huw will also be busy, as his String Quartet will premiere in London at the Wigmore Hall. John and Hetty will have to be very organized to keep up with all their sons' musical events in the coming weeks."
FCE_53,"**Looking after the Countryside: The National Trust**

The National Trust is an organization that aims to protect the British countryside. Gill Page visits the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and speaks with Gareth Roberts, one of the wardens who works for the Trust to care for its beautiful areas.

According to Gareth, a National Trust Warden needs common sense and good people skills because they interact with farmers, visitors, conservationists, and construction companies regularly. Gareth grew up on the Lleyn Peninsula and worked on his parents' farm until he got married. About 80 people applied for the position of National Trust Warden for the Lleyn Peninsula. In the end, Gareth's local knowledge and farming experience helped him get the job, even though he did not have formal training. He says, ""It helps that I still farm with my parents, so I can relate to farmers and understand their issues. They can't fool me!""

His farming background also prepares him for the physical demands of the job, such as building fences, planting trees, and constructing walls. Since joining the Trust, Gareth has learned more about nature conservation. He remembers, ""When I was younger, I used to pick flowers, collect butterfly larvae, and find old birds' nests. Recently, I wondered where I could find those flowers and nests now. It has become clear to me that farming has changed the countryside. It's not the farmers' fault; they were just following government advice.""

Gareth notes that when he started, farmers and conservationists were often in conflict, each wanting things done their way. Now, they are communicating and understanding each other's perspectives. ""We're at a turning point, and it only takes a small step to bring them together,"" he says.

Conservation is a key part of Gareth's job, along with allowing public access to the Trust's land, planting trees, and working with tenant farmers. ""My role is to ensure tasks are completed efficiently and with minimal fuss. I enjoy seeing projects finished, although I spend about half my time on reports and paperwork.""

Gareth is passionate about his job and enjoys every moment, especially interacting with the public. However, he admits, ""I dislike the attitude of some visitors. They come in, demand everything, and leave as if they have a right to it. Being polite to those people can be frustrating!"" But as Gareth says, it all comes down to common sense. If you have plenty of that and enjoy outdoor work, you might consider applying to be a warden like Gareth. Just don't expect a position to open up in the Lleyn Peninsula anytime soon!"
FCE_55,"**The Netball Captain**

In our series about women in sports, Suzie Ellis met England's netball captain, Kendra Slowinski. Kendra is the captain of the England netball team. When I met her, she had just finished a typical day of teaching at a local school, followed by a training session in a supermarket car park. I asked her, ""Don't you get strange looks?"" She replied, ""I'm so focused on my movements and my feet that I don't notice much else. I might see cars slow down out of the corner of my eye, but that's it.""

Kendra explained, ""My life right now is all about being at my best for the Championships. I follow a strict schedule to get fit."" This will be her fourth World Championships, and it is expected to be the largest ever, with 27 countries participating. ""Having home support is very special,"" she said. ""It's important to improve the reputation of netball in this country. Playing at home means there will be more pressure than usual. The crowd will have expectations and will support us more. People want us to start the tournament with a strong performance.""

Their first game is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. ""As far as I know, we have always won against them, but they will be exciting to play. They have a lot of talent."" The England team is currently ranked fourth in the world. However, Kendra noted that the World Championships will be challenging. ""You have to push yourself to play every day; there’s no break between games like in a series. You can still win a series if you lose the first game, but the Championships are different because you only get one chance, and you must be ready to take it.""

In the fifteen years since she started playing at a high level, the sport has become tougher and faster. Players are more aggressive on the court. ""You don’t train hard just to lose,"" Kendra said. ""But once the game is over, we become friends again.""

Netball is also using a more scientific approach to fitness testing. ""It’s essential for us to think and train like world-class players,"" Kendra stated. ""As captain, I believe it’s important to have a strong mindset and lead by example. I see my role as supporting and encouraging my teammates.""

Kendra mentioned, ""From the start of my netball career, everything has been carefully planned. I decided some time ago that this competition would be my last as a player."" She will likely coach young players in the future, but for now, she is focused on her final big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she is likely to have tears in her eyes."
FCE_50,"**SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS**

How can parents support a child with exceptional musical talent? It can be challenging to know how to nurture their abilities. Some parents may not recognize their child's needs until frustration leads to difficult behavior. While most schools can help children who excel in academic subjects, musically gifted children often need special attention that regular schools may not provide, especially if music is seen as less important.

Children who are musically talented, along with those encouraged by their parents or teachers, may benefit from attending a specialist music school. In Britain, there are five such schools, which have been established relatively recently. These schools aim to create a supportive environment for gifted children aged seven to eighteen, allowing them to fully develop their skills under the guidance of professional musicians.

At specialist music schools, students spend about one third to one half of their day on music-related activities. This includes individual lessons (up to three hours a week for their main instruments), participation in orchestras and chamber groups, voice training, conducting, and music theory. They also practice in well-equipped private rooms, sometimes with a teacher. The remainder of their time is spent on a limited academic curriculum, focusing on essential subjects like English, math, basic sciences, and languages, although students can study more subjects if they wish.

All five British specialist music schools are independent, with small class sizes and a high teacher-to-student ratio. Most students live at the school, which means they spend their formative years with peers who share similar goals and interests.

However, there are some disadvantages. One major issue is the cost; fees for boarding students range from £12,000 to £17,000 a year. Each school tries to help parents of exceptionally gifted children through scholarships and financial aid. Additionally, not all parents want to send their children to boarding school, especially at a young age. Many directors of these schools have concerns about admitting children as young as seven into such a demanding environment. They emphasize that their goal is to develop well-rounded individuals.

It is important to note that separating musically gifted children from their peers at an early age can create stress. Some early signs of musical talent may fade during the teenage years, and the pressure to succeed can lead to feelings of failure. However, all specialist schools monitor their students closely and provide support when needed.

While many former students feel they gained a lot from the high-quality music education, some have concerns about the limited academic curriculum, which often takes a back seat to music. Many musically gifted young people are also very intelligent and can handle academic challenges, so they may feel frustrated if their intellectual needs are not met.

For these reasons, it might be better to wait until a child is older and can make their own choices before pursuing a specialist education. Children who are also academically gifted may thrive in a less specialized setting, such as a school with a strong music program, or by combining a regular school schedule with music training at junior departments of music colleges. These colleges offer Saturday morning lessons with excellent teachers, as well as orchestral and chamber music experiences. However, this option may not be feasible for families living far from London or other major cities."

Artist Susan Shepherd is well-known for her flower paintings, and the large garden around her house provides many of her subjects. It is filled with her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wildly and spread throughout the garden. The two long flower borders along the paved path that runs from east to west show a beautiful mix of colors, shapes, and structures. This beauty is partly due to the previous owners, who were passionate gardeners and left behind plants that Susan loves. She also kept the gardener, Danny. ""In fact, it was really his garden,"" she says. ""We got along very well. At first, he would say, 'Oh, it's not worth it' for some of the things I wanted to add, but when I told him I wanted to paint them, he understood my vision.""

Susan prefers to focus on detailed studies of individual plants rather than painting the entire garden. However, she sometimes paints groups of plants in their natural setting. More often, she picks the flowers and takes them to her studio. ""I don't set everything up at once,"" she explains. ""I take one flower out and paint it, which might take a few days, and then I bring in another one to add to the painting. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.""

Her busiest time is spring and early summer when the tulips bloom, followed by the poppies. ""They all come out together, and you're so busy,"" she says. But she also finds beauty in the gradual decay of the flowers. For example, with tulips, ""you bring them in and put them in water, then leave them for a day, and they each change into different shapes. They open up and look amazing. When you first put them in a vase, they seem dull, but they keep changing with twists and turns.""

Susan has always loved plants. ""I studied botany in school and used to collect wildflowers from the countryside,"" she says. ""I wasn't really interested in gardening back then; in fact, I didn't like garden flowers because they reminded me of fake ones sold in some shops. To me, only wildflowers were real. I was fascinated by how they could grow in tough places, like cracks in rocks or on cliff tops.""

Today, her garden includes many plants from distant lands, but they thrive just as well in her garden as they do in China or the Himalayas. She has a relaxed attitude towards her garden, similar to a caring aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don't cause serious trouble. With two upcoming exhibitions to prepare for and plenty of subjects right outside her door, finding time to work in the garden has been challenging. She now hires an extra gardener, but she knows that to stay connected with her subjects, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""

A chalet girl's work is never finished, as Sarah Sutherland-Pilch explains to Veronica Lee. This is Sarah's second year as a chalet girl. She is 24 years old and comes from West Sussex. Known as Pilch, Sarah works in Val d'Isère, France, where she cooks and cleans for visitors who come to ski and stay in wooden houses called chalets. Sarah graduated last summer from Oxford Brookes University with a degree in French and History of Art. She views being a chalet girl not as a career, but as a fun way to spend a year or two before starting a more permanent job. ""It's a good way to make contacts. I meet successful people every week,"" she says.

Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to the chalet, which can accommodate up to 18 guests each week. She has her own breakfast before preparing breakfast for the guests. ""They get the works - porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants."" After breakfast, around 9:30 a.m., Sarah cleans up and either prepares afternoon tea for the guests or cleans the rooms, which she admits is ""the worst part of the job."" By 11 a.m., she is ready to ski. ""On a good day, we can be up there until 4:30 p.m.""

Sarah returns to the chalet to prepare dinner and takes a shower first, but she does not sleep. ""It's fatal if you do,"" she says. Dinner, which is a three-course meal, is served at 8 p.m., and coffee is usually ready by 10 p.m. After dinner, Sarah cleans the kitchen. ""There's nothing worse than coming into a messy kitchen the next morning."" Sometimes she chats with the guests, but other times they prefer to be alone. ""Good guests can make a week brilliant - breakfast this morning was great fun - but some weeks don’t go quite so well.""

Sarah meets her friends in the chalet where she lives, and they usually go out around 11 p.m. ""We usually start off in Bananas, might go to G Jay's, and perhaps Dick's T-Bar at the end of the evening,"" she says. However, she never stays out too late on Saturday night because Sunday is her busiest day. ""A frightful day,"" she says, ""when you certainly don't want to be cooking breakfast feeling exhausted."" 

On Sundays, work starts earlier than usual, as breakfast for guests must be ready by 7 a.m. Once the guests leave, Sarah cleans quickly. ""We just blitz the place - clear the breakfast, strip the beds, and get everything ready."" If she hasn't done the week's shopping on Saturday, she does it now. Around 3 p.m., after finishing the cleaning, Sarah prepares tea for the new guests. ""They arrive around 4:30 p.m. Sometimes they seem confused and have many questions. I think the mountain air affects them.""

Between tea and dinner, Sarah helps any guests who need boots or skis by taking them to the ski shop and then getting a lift back to the chalet. Soon, it is time for dinner duty again, and she may chat with friends, but not always. ""Sometimes I'm so tired I just have an early night,"" she says."

Mandie Currie, a zoo-keeper, spent a day at the magazine Marie Claire. ""Choosing my outfit for Marie Claire was difficult because I usually wear a uniform at the zoo. First, I went to a photo studio, then to press previews, all before lunch. The zoo is a calm place, and here I was rushing around when I could be quietly spending time with an animal. Some members of the fashion team seemed stressed, but my job is not very pressuring. At a fashion shoot in the afternoon, I found it funny to think that I would usually be cleaning cages or handling rats. I am interested in how magazines operate, but I really enjoy my job at the zoo, so I will stay there.""

Alice Cutler, a fashion assistant at Marie Claire, spent a day at London Zoo. ""I arrived at the zoo in my leather boots and dark blue trousers. The zoo gave me a green polo shirt to wear, which was good because I got very dirty. While I petted one of the elephants, I thought Mandie was probably organizing clothes in a cupboard. By five o'clock, I was dirty but had a fantastic day. When I retire from fashion, I could see myself working with elephants, maybe in Africa.""

Karen Hodson, a nurse at Hammersmith Hospital, worked with the television gardening show Ground Force. ""I was very excited to meet the team, and Alan Titchmarsh, the presenter, was very nice. I enjoyed being outside because I sometimes don’t see daylight due to my shifts. Even though it was hard work, it was a lot of fun. I thought I was strong, but I felt weak compared to the rest of the team. My idea of gardening did not include hard physical work or careful planning. I am more enthusiastic than effective at gardening, so I don’t plan to leave my nursing job.""

Charlie Dimmock, a landscape gardener on Ground Force, worked a shift at Hammersmith Hospital. ""I made beds and handed out medicine. I thought I would feel faint during some tasks, but I surprised myself by managing well. The friendship among the nurses is wonderful, and it felt very friendly compared to my usual male environment. I feel my job is less meaningful compared to nursing. My day at the hospital was not easy, but it gave me a great sense of satisfaction.""

Lucy Harvey, a personal trainer, spent a day with Ryanair as cabin crew. ""I changed into the uniform, and as soon as I put it on, I felt different—people looked up to me. Before the flight, our supervisor talked about safety and what to do if someone had a heart attack, which I knew from my fitness training. When the passengers boarded the flight to Paris, I handed out magazines. Everyone looked at me, and I felt very self-conscious. On the return flight, we had 80 schoolchildren who wouldn’t sit still. I wished I was back in the gym with one sensible adult to manage them.""

Sonia McDermott, an air hostess with Ryanair, spent a day as a personal trainer in a gym. ""I was nervous about this swap because I don’t exercise. I was surprised by how much attention you give to one person. In my job, I meet 130 passengers four times a day. At lunch, I was surprised to see that some trainers didn’t eat very healthily, but they all drank a lot of water. I wouldn’t change my job for this, but it has inspired me to join a gym and try to be healthier."""

**A. Andrea Thompson - Newsreader**  
I fell in love with the south of France a long time ago and try to visit as often as I can. There is a local train from Cannes that travels along the coast and crosses into Italy. It takes you past stunning seascapes. No matter the weather or the time of year, the journey is always magical. Out of the other window, you can see some of the most beautiful gardens and homes in France. It feels like you are peeking into the lives of the rich and famous. The passengers are always lively, with a mix of tourists and locals, all enjoying the breathtaking views.

**B. Raj Patel - Explorer**  
I have had many great train journeys, but my favorite is the Nile Valley Express, which travels across the northern Sudan desert. When I was young in South Africa, I missed a family train trip from Cape Town to the Kruger National Park because I was considered too young and troublesome. I was sent to stay with an aunt instead. When I moved to England as a teenager, I had never been on a train. London Waterloo was the first real station I saw, and its large glass dome amazed me.

**C. Betty Cooper - Novelist**  
I am grateful to one train in particular: the Blue Train, which took my husband and me on our honeymoon across France to catch a boat to Egypt. On that train, my husband gave me a pink dress, which I thought was wonderful. Someone mentioned that pink is good for the brain, and I have worn it ever since. The journey itself was lovely, traveling through France and then by boat up the Nile. It was the perfect way to relax after all the wedding preparations.

**D. Martin Brown - Journalist**  
We were working on a series of articles about a round-the-world trip and needed to cross a desert in Africa. There was no road, so we took the Desert Express. The schedule was unpredictable; we were just given a day. We heard that the driver would often wait for days if he knew people were still coming. When the train arrived, many people rushed to get on, even climbing onto the roof for free. During the night, the train passed through some of the most beautiful landscapes I have ever seen. It felt like a dream, like traveling across the moon.

**E. Arisu Mezuki - Actress**  
Most people form their favorite memories of trains when they are young, but that’s not my case. I grew up in Singapore and Cyprus, where I saw very few trains. It wasn’t until I was a teenager that trains became important in my life. I made a film that featured a railway in Yorkshire. Most of the filming took place on an old, unused part of the line that volunteers had carefully maintained. That’s where my love for steam trains began. When we weren’t filming, we took every chance to ride the train, and when I returned last year, it felt like time had stood still. Everything was still there, even the gas lights on the station platform!"

Are you trying to get published? If you want to know where to send your story, our expert Margaret Stubbs has some helpful advice. Many readers of this magazine ask, ""I have written a story or book. Who should I send it to?"" One of the first things they need to do is research their markets and learn about publishers while also improving their writing skills. Turning your writing into something that can be sold requires a good understanding of the publishing world. 

No matter what type of writing you do, it is important to know the markets you are targeting. There are several ways to do this, but the best way is to read as much relevant material as you can. Visit your local library and check out local bookstores and newsagents. Reading widely will help you understand what kinds of writing publishers are currently accepting. 

As time goes on, you need to keep this knowledge updated because new publications are always appearing—editors change jobs, and magazines change their focus. Publishers are always looking for new talent, so as writers, we must provide what they want. 

At first, you might not be sure what you want to write. For example, if you think you would like to write short love stories, the first step is to find out which magazines publish love stories, as this market is quite limited these days. Get as many recent copies of these magazines as you can and learn about the types of stories they are buying, paying attention to their readers' expectations. The editor wants to meet the needs of these readers.

Writers often ask me, ""This has been rejected three times—am I wasting my time? Do I have a chance?"" As a former teacher, I would never discourage anyone. However, it is likely that the work is not yet ready for publication, so I try to give honest feedback while remaining positive. The issue is that many new writers are too eager to submit their work before they are truly ready. If you have only written one story or article, it is very unlikely to be published. This almost never happens. When you hear about someone's success, they usually have been in the publishing or journalism field for several years before achieving it.

When you finally send out your work for the first time, start writing more while you wait for a response. Write ten more stories, or even twenty. Each one will improve your skills, and you will start to see yourself as a writer, which will boost your confidence. Instead of giving up on your stories, work on improving them. I also recommend not sharing your work with others in the early stages. Remember, every successful writer has faced many rejections before finding success.

Do everything you can to advance your writing career. Look for a creative writing course nearby, or consider joining a local writers' group to gain ideas and confidence from other aspiring writers. Think of yourself as a writer and practice writing every day if possible."

On the last day of a difficult year, I was leaning against a pillar in the Baltimore train station, waiting for the 10:10 train to Philadelphia. There were more people waiting than I had expected. The usual clean and bright atmosphere of the station felt lost. Elderly couples with matching luggage filled the benches, and groups of college students had left their bags scattered on the floor. A grey-haired man was walking around, talking to different strangers one by one. He looked well-off: tanned skin, nice sweater, and a soft beige coat. He approached a woman sitting alone and asked her a question. Then he came over to a girl near me. She had long blond hair, and I thought I wouldn’t mind talking to her. The man asked, ""Are you traveling to Philadelphia?"" She replied, ""Well, I’m going north, but to Philadelphia?"" ""No, to New York, but I’ll be..."" ""Thanks anyway,"" he said, moving to the next bench. Now he had my full attention. 

""Ma'am,"" I heard him ask an old lady, ""are you traveling to Philadelphia?"" When she said, ""Wilmington,"" he just moved on to a couple with matching luggage. I straightened up and drifted closer, pretending to look at the platform as if I was focused on the train. I was going to Philadelphia. I understood why he didn’t ask me; he probably thought I looked unreliable. He glanced at me quickly and then went to the other end of the waiting area. He looked stressed now. ""Please!"" he said to a woman reading a book. ""Tell me you’re going to Philadelphia!"" She lowered her book. She looked about thirty-five, older than me. A schoolteacher type. ""Philadelphia?"" she said. ""Yes, I am."" ""Could I ask you a favor?"" I stood a few feet away, pretending to check my wrist (even though I didn’t have a watch). I could tell she was becoming cautious. The man must have noticed too, because he said, ""Nothing too difficult, I promise!"" 

They announced my train. People started moving toward Gate E, older couples pulling their wheeled bags behind them like pets. Then I heard the man talking. ""My daughter is flying out this afternoon for a study year abroad, leaving from Philadelphia. I put her on a train this morning, stopped for groceries, and came home to find my wife upset. She hardly said 'hello' to me. My daughter forgot her passport. She called from the station in Philadelphia; she didn’t know what to do."" The woman listened sympathetically. I would have stayed quiet to see where he was going with this. ""So I told her to stay put. Stay right there in the station, and I would get someone to bring her passport."" 

That seemed suspicious! Why didn’t he go himself if it was such an emergency? ""Why don’t you go yourself?"" the woman asked. ""I can’t leave my wife alone for that long. She’s in a wheelchair."" I thought that was a weak excuse. It also seemed like too much bad luck for one family. I looked at them. The man was holding a packet, not a plain envelope, but a padded one, the size of a paperback book. Aha! Padded! So you couldn’t feel what was inside! From where I stood, it looked stapled shut too. Watch yourself, lady, I thought silently."

John Moore, the owner of a restaurant, shares his thoughts about his son Gary, who is a well-known TV chef. He believes that everyone has a chance in life. Gary had his chance with cooking, while John had the opportunity to run a restaurant. When John learned about a restaurant for sale, he quickly went to see it, even though it was in poor condition. He thought it was perfect for his plans.

Running the restaurant reminded John of his childhood. He remembered feeling sad when his mother went to work in a factory and left him alone. This made him value family time. His wife took care of their children and managed the finances while John ran the restaurant. They lived above the restaurant and always made it a point to have meals together, which helped their children, Gary and Joe, become confident. From a young age, they would talk to the regular customers, giving them a good start in life.

Gary was an energetic child. When he was about seven, he tried to jump into a corner bath like it was a swimming pool and accidentally knocked himself out. As he grew older, he earned pocket money by doing small jobs. By the age of ten, he was working in the kitchen every weekend, which meant he always had money at school. He was disciplined and often woke up before John. In a family business, everyone helps out, and John enjoyed seeing Gary contribute.

Although Gary was not very academic, he excelled in the kitchen. By 15, he was as skilled as the adult chefs and sometimes even managed the kitchen. He could prepare over a hundred meals, and John realized that Gary would pursue a career in catering. When Gary needed work experience for school, John sent him to a friend’s restaurant.

Recently, Gary started playing the drums and formed his own band. John worries about what will happen to Gary's cooking if his music career takes off. He advised Gary to focus on one goal at a time, saying, ""If you chase two hares, you catch neither."" John also told Gary that he needed to achieve his goals by the age of 30, or it might be too late.

At 17, Gary attended catering college. On his first day, while other students were just starting, Gary quickly chopped vegetables and sliced meats, finishing his tasks in less than an hour. He even helped his classmates. John is amazed by Gary's success with his TV cooking show and feels very proud of him. He has always encouraged Gary to work hard for what he wants because nothing is given for free. Gary has recognized the opportunities he has and has taken full advantage of them. John believes that even if children only remember a small part of what their parents say, it is still a positive outcome. He sees that Gary listens and learns from him."

Finding a good flat in Dublin that you can afford is very difficult. The best way to find one is through personal connections. If you know someone who knows someone else who is moving out, that can help. But if, like Jo, you have just arrived in Dublin, you don’t have those connections. You might have to stay in a hostel and look for a flat. For Jo, Dublin felt like a big unknown place. She felt nervous when she took the train to start her job there. She didn’t question why she was going; everyone at school expected her to leave her small town. They all wanted to escape and experience life. Some of her classmates had moved to nearby towns like Ennis or Limerick, where family members helped them settle in. But Jo was going to Dublin alone.

Jo’s mother thought it would be good for her to stay in the hostel permanently. It was run by nuns, so her mother believed she would be safe. Her father hoped the hostel would be warm, as they are often cold. Jo’s sisters, who worked as waitresses, thought she was crazy for staying in a hostel for a whole week. However, Jo was unaware that they were still talking about her while she responded to an advertisement for a flat in Ringsend. The ad said, ""Own room, own television, share kitchen and bathroom."" It was very close to her workplace and seemed too good to be true. Jo hoped it would be nice, that the people would like her, and that it wouldn’t be too expensive.

There wasn’t a long line for this flat because it was more about finding a ""Third Girl Wanted"" than just a flat to rent. The mention of ""own television"" made Jo wonder if it was too fancy for her, but the house looked normal. It was a simple red-brick house with a basement. The flat was upstairs, and as Jo climbed the stairs, a cheerful girl with a college scarf came down. ""Desperate place,"" she told Jo. ""They’re both awful. Common as dirt.""

""Oh,"" Jo replied and continued up. ""Hello,"" said the girl with ""Nessa"" on her T-shirt. ""Did you see that snobby girl leaving? I can’t stand her kind."" 

""What did she do?"" Jo asked.

""She didn’t do anything. She just looked around, made a face, and giggled, saying, 'Is this all there is? Oh dear, oh dear,' in a posh accent. We wouldn’t want her here, would we, Pauline?"" 

Pauline, wearing a very colorful shirt, looked like a punk, which surprised Jo. She had seen punks on O'Connell Street but had never talked to one before. 

""I'm Jo, I work at the post office and I called about the flat,"" she said. Nessa mentioned they were about to have tea and brought out three mugs—one with ""Nessa,"" one with ""Pauline,"" and one labeled ""Other."" ""We’ll put your name on a mug if you decide to stay,"" she offered kindly."
FCE_43,"**Text: Behind the Dolphin's Smile**

People love dolphins. We enjoy watching them in seaside marinas, movies, and TV shows. However, according to the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society, dolphins are in serious trouble. Mark Simmonds reports on the decline of these animals.

Dolphins are special to us. They are among the most intelligent animals, sensitive to human feelings, and they inspire us with dreams of freedom in the ocean. Our affection for dolphins has been supported by television shows. First, there was Flipper, and now we have Darwin from Seaquest. But these happy images hide the harsh reality of dolphins living in polluted and overfished waters.

The population of North Sea harbour porpoises, a type of dolphin, has decreased by up to 89,000. You might think that such beloved animals would be protected by law and cared for in marine reserves, but this is not the case. The lack of plans to protect them could lead to one of the biggest wildlife disasters of our time.

There are forty different types of dolphins worldwide. In northern Europe, the most common are the striped dolphin, the common dolphin, the bottlenose dolphin, and the smaller harbour porpoise. The striped and common dolphins usually live far out at sea and are seen only in small groups, so we know little about them. Bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises were once frequently seen near European coasts. Bottlenose dolphins are very social and used to be found along the Channel coast and in rivers like the Thames. Now, they can only be found in small numbers in places like the Moray Firth in Scotland and Cardigan Bay in Wales. The injuries on the few remaining dolphins show that they are under stress.

The complex behavior of dolphins makes it hard to understand why their numbers are decreasing. Overfishing is reducing fish populations and threatening local fishing industries, which also endangers porpoises and dolphins. Porpoises need to find food quickly, and if fish are removed from one area, they may not survive long enough to find food elsewhere. They are also at risk of getting caught in fishermen's nets, which they cannot see. Many modern fishing methods use large nets that are either left floating or pulled quickly through the water. In recent years, hundreds of dead dolphins have washed up on the beaches of France and Cornwall, with injuries showing that they were caught in these nets.

Pollution in the sea can accumulate in dolphins' bodies. For example, pesticides can build up in their fat, and female dolphins produce milk that contains these toxins, which can harm their young. There is already a recorded case of a young dolphin dying from its mother’s poisoned milk.

Another serious threat to dolphins comes from human activity. Dolphins live in groups and rely on sound to understand their environment. Noise pollution from ships and oil drilling travels much better in water than in air, which may disturb dolphins in ways we do not fully understand."
FCE_51,"**Getting Fit**

Exercise is important for your mind, body, and spirit. It helps you maintain balance in a world that often feels chaotic. You might be tired of reading about fitness, but there are many good reasons to exercise, and very few reasons not to. 

Exercise improves muscle tone and can quickly change your body shape. It increases muscle strength and helps you maintain good posture, which is how you hold your body when sitting or standing. It also prevents muscle imbalances that can lead to injuries and improves specific areas like your thighs, stomach, and upper arms. Additionally, exercise benefits your heart, lungs, and blood circulation.

You may have heard these benefits before, but here’s something that might catch your attention: exercise can help reduce feelings of depression and tiredness, and it can improve your sleep. It also helps manage stress and can relieve certain medical conditions. 

If you’re still not convinced, just remember that common sense tells us exercise is good for us. There are many types of exercise you can try, such as aerobics, jogging, or using weights. However, be careful not to overdo it, as training too hard can lead to injuries. If you’re unsure about what exercises are right for you, it’s a good idea to talk to your doctor.

Good posture is essential for improving your body shape. Poor posture can make you look unattractive and can lead to low energy and health issues. If you tend to slouch, try to imagine that a helium balloon is pulling the top of your head upward. This can help you lift your chest for better breathing and make your body look slimmer.

Stretching is also important. It improves flexibility and helps you move easily, while also preventing injuries. If you stretch four or five times a week, you will become more flexible and fit. Your exercise routine should include a warm-up, stretching, an energetic workout, and a cool-down period."

What keeps filmmakers Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman away from their comfortable homes for months? They are searching for the perfect shot. Among all the animals in the jungles and plains of East Africa, two of the hardest to find are Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman. Currently, they are in the Ngorongoro Crater, which has experienced six months of almost continuous rain, leading to several unexpected challenges. Newman mentioned that they had to buy an expensive piece of equipment so that if one of their vehicles gets stuck in the mud, Amanda can pull him back to safety. Their collaboration has produced some of television's best wildlife films, including a well-received documentary about leopards. While this film about one of Africa's most elusive cats was being shown, they were already back in the field, this time tracking the equally shy jackal.

This is common in television partnerships. Traveling filmmakers have been exploring the world to capture exotic wildlife on camera since television began. I spoke to Newman during one of his rare meetings with other people at a safari lodge. ""We do have occasional arguments, but we usually resolve them quickly,"" he said about his colleague. Neither of them sees themselves as the leader, and he believes they get along well because they both view the animals similarly. ""When we are on the move, we have to set up our tents each night. But this time we are working from a more fixed camp, so we prepare tea the night before and keep it warm in a vacuum flask."" Their daily meals consist of pre-packaged food that is heated and served by whoever is available. ""It's not unusual for us to be out for up to eight weeks, so meal preparation can be stressful,"" Newman explained. 

It can be a tough life, but the advantage of being in such remote areas is that they can get close to the animals and become part of their lives. Newman recalled a time when they were filming a family of lions. One lioness would often wander off alone, but when she returned, she would greet all the other lions in her pride, and eventually, she included their vehicle in her greetings.

Newman first worked with Barrett in 1988 on a film called ""The Great Rift,"" and two years later, they began filming Arctic foxes together. Since then, they have learned to spend four months on location to gather enough material for each half-hour film. Before they can start filming, they must submit a script for approval. ""Amanda and I developed a strong working relationship from the beginning,"" Newman said, ""because it was clear we shared the same ideas and vision. Our goal is to create a film that captures the atmosphere, brings to life the true spirit of the place and its animals, and touches people's hearts. I believe that evoking an emotional response is much more powerful than just appealing to logic."""
FCE_14,"**The Netball Captain**

In our series about women in sports, Suzie Ellis met England's netball captain, Kendra Slawinski. Kendra is the captain of the England netball team. When I met her, she had just finished a typical day of teaching at a local school, followed by a training session in a supermarket car park. I was surprised by her choice of training location. I asked her, ""Don't you get strange looks?"" She replied, ""I'm so focused on my movements and my feet that I don't notice much else. I might see cars slow down out of the corner of my eye, but that's it.""

Kendra explained, ""My life is all about being at my best for the Championships."" She follows a strict schedule to achieve maximum fitness. This will be her fourth World Championships, and it is expected to be the largest ever, with 27 countries participating. ""Having home support is very special,"" she said. ""It's important to improve the reputation of netball in this country. Playing at home means there will be more pressure than usual. The crowd will have expectations and will support us more. People want us to start the tournament with a strong performance.""

Their first game is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. Kendra mentioned, ""We have always beaten them, but they will be exciting to play against because they have a lot of talent."" The England team is currently ranked fourth in the world. However, Kendra noted that the World Championships will be challenging. ""You have to push yourself every day; there is no break between games like in a series. You can still win a series if you lose the first game, but the Championships are different. You only have one chance, and you must be ready to take it.""

In the fifteen years since she started playing at a high level, the sport has become more intense and faster. Players are more aggressive on the court. Kendra said, ""You don't train hard just to lose."" But once the game is over, players become friends. 

Netball is also using a more scientific approach to fitness testing. Kendra stated, ""It's essential for us to think and train like world-class players."" As captain, she believes it is important to have a strong mental attitude and to lead by example. ""I see my role as supporting and encouraging my teammates.""

Kendra shared, ""From the start of my netball career, everything has been carefully planned."" She decided that this competition would be her last as a player. She may coach young players in the future, but right now, she is focused on her final big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she is likely to have tears in her eyes, knowing her loyal supporters will be with her every step of the way."

Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends a lot of time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She teaches and researches marine geochemistry, which means she studies the chemical processes in the sea. Rachel is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she is not teaching, she gets into a small steel vehicle designed for underwater exploration and dives three kilometers down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes.

Inside the vehicle, Rachel says, ""Space is very limited. I can reach out and touch the two pilots. We cannot stand up or move around, and we must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last for 16 hours: three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours to collect rock and water samples, and three hours to return to the surface.""

""If there is a problem and we need to get to the top quickly, we can hit a panic button. This releases a small escape vessel that rises quickly to the surface. No one has tested it yet, but I don't think it would be a pleasant journey.""

Rachel recalls her first dive: ""I didn't know how I would react. I climbed into the vehicle on a ship with an instructor who explained the emergency procedures, including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack. They were testing my reaction to being in such a small space."" Now, Rachel has made six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian crew. ""We went to a site five days' sail west of the Canary Islands. There, on the ocean floor, is a large area of underwater volcanoes, with their chimneys releasing black smoke. This is where the Atlantic Ocean comes alive. The Russian team was dropping off scientific equipment to study a project that would create a hole 150 meters through a volcano.""

When Rachel is not at sea, she works in her office at the Oceanography Centre in Southampton. ""Two-thirds of my salary comes from teaching, which I enjoy, but I do it to support my research on 'black smokers,' another name for underwater volcanoes. Water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke, pouring out at a rate of one meter per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees.""

""The only time I felt scared was during my first dive with the Americans. We were towing equipment on a 50-meter rope when suddenly there was an explosion. There was a huge bang as shock waves hit our vehicle, and I thought, 'I'm going to die.' We looked at each other in silence, waiting. When nothing happened, we couldn't believe it. The relief was incredible—we were still alive!""

""Diving to the deepest part of the ocean is such an adventure. Every time I look out of the porthole and see those chimneys, I feel a sense of wonder. Here I am at the bottom of the sea, and no one else on this planet has ever seen them before. I studied black smokers for three years for my Ph.D. When I finally saw them in person, it was an amazing feeling."""
FCE_56,"**Interview Tips**

First impressions are very important. Research shows that people form opinions about us within the first few minutes of meeting. They notice how we dress, our eye contact, our body language, and how we speak, including our speed, volume, and tone of voice, as well as the words we use.

Mary Pearce studied to be a teacher. She worked hard to earn her degree and felt confident when she graduated. She applied for a job at a nearby primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher. On the day of the interview, she noticed a small hole in her jacket. She thought about changing but decided it would make her late, and she believes being on time is very important. Unfortunately, Mary did not get the job. A friend who teaches at the school told her that the Head Teacher said, ""If someone doesn't take the time to present her best image at an interview, what kind of teacher will she be?""

Simon Grant, a hotel manager, explains that interviewees who care about their appearance are more likely to care about their jobs. While many believe that what is inside matters most, it is essential to present yourself well in an interview.

Janet Goodwood worked for ten years as an administrative assistant in a large accounting firm. When the office manager retired, she applied for the position but did not get an interview. She thought it was a mistake and asked the Director of Personnel what happened. He told her she did not fit the image of an office manager and suggested she improve her wardrobe before applying again. Janet was shocked because she believed her work performance should matter more than her appearance.

Movement and gestures also affect an interviewer's first impression. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian found that only 7% of our message about feelings comes from the words we use, 38% from our voice, and a surprising 55% from our facial expressions. When our facial expressions and words send different messages, the listener will pay more attention to the non-verbal message. Therefore, it is important that your words match your body language. Mixed messages can confuse the interviewer.

It is also crucial not to seem too desperate for the job or overly eager to please. Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, applied for a promotion and was offered the job immediately after her interview. She was very happy but showed too much excitement. Once her boss sensed her enthusiasm, he offered her a lower salary than she expected. She believes she could have negotiated a better salary if she had controlled her excitement.

Finally, what we say and how we say it can greatly affect the success of an interview. David Artesio, a manager at an employment agency, suggests learning about the company before the interview. For example, reading the annual report can provide information about the company's activities. Mentioning an area that interests you during the interview can create a positive impression and show your interest in the company. Business consultant Marian Woodall advises having a few questions prepared and avoiding long, confusing sentences. She states, ""Poor communicators talk in paragraphs. Successful communicators talk in short sentences and highlight key points."""

**The Farmer**  
Matt Froggatt used to work as an insurance agent in London, but now he runs a sheep farm. ""After 14 years in the business, I found that working in the City became boring—no one was enjoying it anymore. I had planned to stay for another five or ten years, but then I was unexpectedly made redundant. I didn’t receive a great severance package, but it was enough to start my farm. My big break came when I met the head chef of a local hotel with one of the best restaurants in the country. By supplying them, my reputation grew, and now I also sell meat through mail order. I’m happy to be out of the office, but it’s surprising how little has changed: I still work 80 to 90 hours a week and sell a product.""

**The Painter**  
Ron Able was a manager in advertising, but now he makes a living as an artist. ""I started painting as a hobby, but I found it much more exciting than my job. Choosing to take redundancy and become an artist felt like the right decision. The career counselor I spoke to was very supportive. I think I was the first person to tell him, 'I don’t want to go back to my old job.' He was surprised because most people in their mid-forties need to find work quickly for financial reasons. My wife and I married young, and our children no longer need our support. It was a big change for us. We moved to northern England, where we didn’t know anyone. We left our friends behind, but luckily, our friendships have lasted, and many of them visit us now.""

**The Hat Maker**  
Katherine Goodison worked as a company lawyer for five years before starting her own hat-making business in her London flat. ""Being a lawyer was enjoyable and well-paid, but the hours were long. I realized I didn’t want to become a senior partner, working even more hours, so I decided to leave. Many people said I would get bored, but that has never happened. The key is to set deadlines. Since my business is fashion-related, I have collections and seasonal designs to manage, so there’s always a lot to do, and I need to keep a strict schedule. I feel happier now and less stressed. However, I do miss the social interaction with colleagues. What I love about this job is that I am fully responsible for my work. If I do a poor job, I am the one to blame. Of course, you care when working for a company, but when your name is on the promotional materials, you care even more.""

**The Masseur**  
Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16 years before becoming a masseur at the Life Centre in London. ""I had been in financial markets since I was 22, making deals. I enjoyed the excitement, but I never found the work fulfilling. I almost lost my job in 1989, but I chose to resign and travel for a year. During that time, I tried to figure out what I wanted to do. I was interested in health, so I visited some of the best gyms in the world and spoke to the owners about how they started. I knew I needed qualifications to change careers, so I took various massage courses. Then I got a part-time job at the Life Centre. I have no regrets. I used to feel out of control, but now I have peace of mind and control over my future. That is the best part."""
FCE_6,"**Text: Dedicated to Their Sports**

Four young athletes share their experiences.

**A. Darius (Runner)**  
I have always been active in sports. I tried many, but I excelled in football and athletics. When I was 14, I had a chance to join a professional football club, but I chose to focus on athletics instead. My proudest moment was competing for my country in the youth team and winning a medal. Unfortunately, it did not attract much media attention, which was disappointing. I had hoped for sponsorship, as training can be expensive. I train at home during the winter and then spend three weeks in Florida before the season starts. It’s enjoyable because the facilities are excellent and the nightlife is fun. However, I must be disciplined. If friends invite me out the night before training, I have to decline. I wish I could go, but dedication is important in this sport. My main goal is to qualify for the next Olympics—that would be amazing.

**B. Gabriel (Surfer)**  
The surfing community is small, so I often see the same people at competitions. Professional surfers take their sport seriously, and the best waves are usually at dawn, so I have to avoid late-night parties. I don’t mind this too much, but I do miss sleeping in. However, it’s worth it because my dedication helped me win the National Championships last year. After a win, I always celebrate with a big night out, and if I win money, I treat myself to a nice getaway. The sacrifices pay off in the long run, as winning the championship led to me hosting a surfing series on TV. I suppose I’m a bit of a celebrity now.

**C. Dieter (Yacht Racer)**  
Being on a boat with five guys is always fun. We have a traditional way of celebrating our wins. Some say we act a bit childish when we celebrate, but we don’t seek media attention. Often, reporters seem more interested in our celebrations than our race results. I spend eight months a year away, so it’s nice to return home and hang out with friends from different backgrounds. You can’t focus on the sport all the time; it’s not healthy. I’m recognized in the sailing world, but I prefer to keep a low profile. I’ve only been recognized a few times in public, and I wouldn’t want to be a celebrity. I do receive many letters from fans asking for signed pictures, and I make sure to reply to each one, even if it takes time.

**D. Tomas (Tennis Player)**  
It’s always exciting to walk onto the court and feel the support of the crowd. At my last tournament, things got a bit hectic with fans crowding around. I enjoy being recognized by fans when I’m out shopping, but it has its challenges. My last girlfriend didn’t like it when I received too much attention from female fans. Tennis players travel a lot, and that contributed to our breakup. It was tough, but sacrifices are necessary in any sport; you must be serious and professional. I’m focused on my game now and plan to catch up on other aspects of life after I retire, which comes relatively early in this sport."
FCE_33,"**Text: Young Shoppers**

Shopping in supermarkets with children can be very challenging for parents. One mother explains, ""They want everything they see. If it’s not the latest sugary cereal, it’s a Disney video or a comic. Usually, they want all three. I can’t afford all this, and if I give in to their requests, I feel guilty about buying unhealthy food. I hate saying no all the time, and I get anxious before we even leave home. I try to avoid taking them shopping, but then I worry that I’m not letting them learn how to make their own choices. It feels impossible.""

Research shows that children ask for something to buy every two minutes when they are in a supermarket. Over £150 million is spent each year on advertising aimed directly at children, mostly on television. This amount is expected to grow, and supermarkets are where this advertising is most effective. For children, the reasons their parents give for not buying certain things are often unclear. Arguments about how bad sugar is for their teeth are not convincing when compared to the appealing advertisements they see.

Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, ""Most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, but these ideas are not always correct. It’s important for parents and children to talk about food. If children only hear about products from TV ads, they get a very one-sided view. Parents feel frustrated because they are competing with the advertising industry and often have to disappoint their children.""

The Independent Television Commission, which oversees TV advertising, does not allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy products. However, as Dibb points out, ""The main goal of advertising is to persuade people to buy something. So even if they can’t say, 'Tell your mom to buy this,' that is still the effect.""

Shopping with children can be stressful for parents because they have to decide which requests to agree to and which to refuse. One mother says she is patient when discussing food with her children, but she still feels uneasy about how she handles their requests: ""My son pays attention to ads but is critical of them. We talk a lot about different products and look at labels together. I’ve talked about it so much that he thinks all ads are bad. Now, we have very little conflict in the supermarket because the children don’t ask for things I don’t want to buy.""

Parents also admit they can be inconsistent in how they respond to their children’s requests. Mike, a father of a seven-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter, says, ""We refuse to buy sweets for him because we say they are bad for him, but we load our trolley with cream and chocolate for ourselves. It’s nice to buy good things, and it’s normal for children to want to share that. But I still get annoyed by their requests. It depends on my mood. If I’m feeling good, I’m more likely to say yes. It’s hard to be consistent.""

Supermarkets could help reduce conflicts between parents and children by removing sweets from checkout areas or providing supervised play areas. Although parents might spend less if their children are not with them, the idea of shopping without their children’s demands could attract enough extra customers to make up for it."
FCE_20,"**Text: Five-Star Luxury and Modern Technology**

The new five-star Merrion Hotel in Dublin combines luxury with the latest technology. It was created by transforming four large 18th-century houses, a project that took nearly two years and involved extensive research into what customers want. This approach has allowed the hotel to install advanced technology that benefits both staff and guests.

General Manager Peter MacCann expects his staff to know guests by name, but he uses a computer system to track guests' preferences. This system helps the hotel provide a special experience for returning clients. Although it cost £250,000 to set up, MacCann believes it will be worth it over time due to its efficiency. For instance, if a guest requests specific music CDs during their first stay, those same CDs will be ready for them on their next visit, thanks to the guest-history feature.

Room temperature is another common concern for hotel guests. The Merrion has a high-tech system that allows guests to adjust the temperature within three degrees of the normal 18°C. Additionally, the front desk can change the temperature in each room between 14°C and 25°C.

Business travelers are a significant part of the hotel's clientele, making up about 65% of its business. To cater to their needs, the hotel has equipped each room with three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that also works as a photocopier and printer, and video-conferencing capabilities. The hotel has also prepared for future technological advancements by installing extra cables and renting televisions, which can be easily replaced with newer models.

Despite all this technology, MacCann emphasizes that they want guests to feel comfortable, not overwhelmed. The hotel features 145 spacious and well-furnished bedrooms that are inviting and cozy. Guests can also enjoy a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a lovely garden.

The food at the Merrion is of high quality, with Chef Patrick Guilbaud, who previously earned two Michelin stars, moving his restaurant to the hotel. This partnership benefits both the chef and the hotel, as he has designed a modern kitchen and improved parking facilities. For the hotel, having a renowned restaurant adds value without financial risk. With its combination of technology and skilled staff, the Merrion Hotel is poised for success."

Emma Marsden asked six women who live life fully to share how they find their energy.

A. **Jeanette Kupfermann, Journalist and Author:** ""I get my energy from excitement. I need to be challenged and learn new things. Right now, I'm learning flamenco dancing, which is very energizing. If I'm bored, I feel drained. Being effective, even in small ways, gives me energy.""

B. **Linda Kelsey, Magazine Editor:** ""I have a lot of work, but I enjoy it. Work is not a chore for me. When I get enough sleep, I feel great. I know exercise boosts my energy, but sometimes it's hard to find the motivation. I do yoga once a week and try to work out at home. After exercising, I feel much better. I often feel low in the afternoon, so I think it's good to have a snack then.""

C. **Annie Nightingale, Disc Jockey:** ""I don't rely on healthy eating for energy; I think it's about being enthusiastic and positive. I dislike negative people. I believe we should enjoy life and set goals. I love my job, and the last two years have been exciting. Being around lively young people energizes me. I enjoy taking photos and writing lyrics for fun, which helps me relax while traveling.""

D. **Floella Benjamin, Author and Children's TV Presenter:** ""My energy comes from doing things I love. I believe in my work and being positive. Working with kids gives me energy because they are so resilient. Energy is like a natural chemical that comes from connecting with others. Smiling at people can create a wonderful feeling. I try to eat healthily and avoid smoking and drinking, but I don't have a strict exercise routine. I get my energy from playing with kids.""

E. **Deborah Moggach, Author and Playwright:** ""What I love most is creating a garden from a wasteland. I once turned a concrete area into a beautiful garden, which was more energizing than any workout. Knowing that someone wants to read my writing also gives me energy. I enjoy sneaking into nature, and if caught, I playfully say I didn't know it was private.""

F. **Katherine Monblot, Therapist:** ""I believe it's important to have an interest in what you do. I like taking risks and get bored easily, which keeps me motivated. Doing things I don't want to do drains my energy. I used to be part of many committees, but I found them demanding. You have limited energy, so focus on what matters most to you."""
FCE_45,"**ICE SKATING**

Ice skating has been around for thousands of years. Archaeologists have found skates made from animal bones, which were used until iron was introduced in Scandinavia around 200 AD. For the upper classes in Scandinavia, skating was an important skill. In the early 1900s, skating was seen as elegant, but everything changed at the 1924 Winter Olympics when 11-year-old Sonja Henie brought a more athletic style, making skating very popular. Today, skating combines art and athleticism, making it both beautiful and physically challenging.

For beginners, balance and control are crucial, and speed comes with practice. The way you position your body is key to maintaining balance. Keep your legs slightly bent and your knees relaxed, leaning a bit forward. Relaxation is essential in skating, more than in many other sports. To start, your heels should almost touch, and your feet should point outward. As you push off with your back foot, make a small movement with your other foot. It’s not too hard! If you keep practicing, you can gradually make longer movements as you improve.

Learning how to fall is one of the first skills a skater should master. Even professional skaters fall sometimes. To fall safely, stay relaxed to reduce the impact when you hit the ice. To get up, use your hands to kneel first, then stand up. Once you feel confident moving on the ice, you can try different styles like figure skating, freestyle, distance skating, speed skating, and pair skating. The best way to start is by learning figure skating and then basic freestyle.

With proper instruction available at most ice rinks, you can quickly learn the basic moves, and soon you’ll be able to do turns, jumps, and spins in freestyle. If you watch skilled skaters, you’ll notice how relaxed and fluid their movements are. To achieve this, it’s important to follow a regular exercise routine. Skating with a stiff body can be risky, so warm-up exercises should focus on your legs, back, shoulders, and especially your ankles and knees. After skating, do the same exercises to prevent stiffness.

Skating helps improve balance, coordination, relaxation, and movement. It also boosts heart and lung health and strengthens the body. When combined with swimming or jogging, it creates an excellent program for overall health and fitness."

If there is one thing that can make you cry with joy, it is seeing a talented child receive a medal. Julia Gregson spoke to three young stars and their mothers about the joys and challenges of their lives.

A. **Annika Reeder**, 15, won a gold medal in gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games. She hopes to become a physiotherapist and compete in the next Olympics. ""The training is very hard right now. I don’t have time to watch TV, go out with friends, or do much besides gymnastics and school. I try to take it one day at a time, and when I feel really tired, my coach sometimes gives me a day off. But usually, I just keep going because taking too many days off makes me stiff.""

B. **Annika's mother**: ""From a young age, Annika showed great talent. I’ve seen some parents push their children, but that doesn’t work. To perform at Annika's level requires a lot of time and energy, and you have to want to do it yourself. People often say that we, as parents, have sacrificed a lot, but they don’t see what the sport has given us. We love it and what it has done for Annika. Before gymnastics, she was a shy girl who hid behind me, but now she has met people from all over the world and gained confidence through her success.""

C. **Sarah Stokes** started show-jumping at the age of ten and has since won the British National Championship. ""It’s great that my parents enjoy show-jumping because they train me and take me everywhere in the horse box. The shows can last from one to five days. I never get tired of it—I love the excitement and fun of show-jumping. Even if my parents weren’t involved, I would still do it because I am determined. I’m happy when they are proud of my wins, but I’m not doing it for them. This year, I want to qualify for the British young riders (under-18) team. My big dream is to win a gold medal at the Olympics.""

D. **Sarah's mother**: ""From the moment Sarah first sat on a horse at age one, I knew she had found her passion. When she was five, she would wake up early to exercise her pony. To qualify for major shows, we travel all over England. To save money, we sleep in the living quarters of our horse box. Sarah is very organized. She is completely happy on a horse and knows what she is doing. Watching your child succeed at something they love is an incredible feeling.""

E. **Jane McShane**, 10, is the Under-14 Chess Champion in Britain. ""Tournaments are really friendly. I know everyone, and it’s fun. When I play, I don’t focus as much as I should. I just look around and don’t think too much. I’m not worried about becoming arrogant; I don’t talk about my success at school because I don’t like feeling embarrassed.""

F. **Jane's mother**: ""Jane played her first game when she was five. My father suggested we see if she liked it. He had tried to teach me when I was young, but I found it boring. Jane loved it from the start. By the end of that day, she had memorized all the moves, and by age six, she was beating adults. Of course, I’m proud when she wins, but if she decided to stop playing tomorrow, I wouldn’t stop her. I also don’t want to discourage her because she is exceptional. If she has this talent, I want her to reach her full potential."""
FCE_29,"Text: 

It's true - we are all getting taller. Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy after school. The teacher jokingly asked, ""What do you want to be? The flagpole on a ship?"" This was funny because Chris was already almost two metres tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is the tallest man in Britain. 

Every decade, the average height of people in Europe increases by about one centimetre. More tall people are being born, but this does not mean we are becoming a super race. Instead, we are returning to how our ancestors looked. According to palaeontologist Professor Chris Stringer, ""We are starting to reach our true potential,"" similar to the Cro-Magnons who lived 40,000 years ago.

For most of human history, our ancestors had a varied diet. Women gathered herbs, fruits, and berries, while men hunted animals. One study found they ate from 85 different wild plants. However, about 9,000 years ago, agriculture began, which changed everything. Farmers took over many natural areas, and now just three plants—wheat, rice, and maize—provide more than half of the calories we eat. This limited diet has harmed our health. 

In Ohio, scientists found that when healthy hunter-gatherers started farming corn, they became sickly and underweight. Tooth decay and diseases increased. Although corn was thought to be beneficial, some anthropologists see it as a health disaster. Still, agriculture spread because one piece of land could support many more people than hunting could. 

Today, many people are poorly nourished, but this issue is only recently being addressed, even in wealthier countries. In Europe, the US, and Japan, diets are starting to reflect the variety of our ancestors' diets again. As a result, the average height of men is now 179 cm in the US, 180 cm in Holland, and 177 cm in Japan. This is a positive trend, but it comes with challenges. 

Although people are getting taller, some things have not changed. The standard bed length has been 190 cm since 1860, and legroom in planes and trains seems to have decreased. Clothing manufacturers are constantly adjusting their products to fit taller people. 

The question is: how tall can we get? We cannot keep growing forever. There must be a limit. According to Robert Fogel from the University, this limit could be around 193 cm, and we might reach it this century. However, scientists warn that while individuals may be getting taller due to better nutrition, as a species, we are actually getting smaller. 

During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, humans were slightly rounder and taller, which helped them stay warm. As the climate warmed, we became thinner and shorter, even when well-fed. If global warming continues, we might shrink even more. In other words, our growth could be affected by climate change."
FCE_57,"**Text: Studio Audiences**

What is it like to be in the audience when a television show is being filmed? Cosmo Landesman explored this topic. Like technical problems, studio audiences are a common part of television, but many people find them mysterious. When we see audiences getting excited on game shows, we often wonder: who are these people?

Studio audiences are often seen as the least important type of audience. Some people in the television industry even look down on them, comparing them to cattle. I used to think that studio audiences were made up of silly people wanting a moment of fame. However, there is no typical studio audience; they come from various backgrounds, jobs, and income levels. Television shows try to attract different types of people for different programs.

Many of us who watch television at home cannot understand why someone would want to be in a studio audience. Why would anyone apply for tickets, travel far, and endure hours of boredom just to watch something they could see at home? One idea is that people hope to be seen on television. I didn’t believe this until I spoke to Angela, who said, “I came for a chance to be on TV.” Another reason is that people are curious about what happens behind the scenes. However, the most common reason I heard was, “A friend gave me a ticket.”

Few of us have been in a studio audience, yet we think we know what it is like. You sit close to strangers while someone holds up cards that say APPLAUD or LAUGH, and you respond accordingly. This may be true for some shows, but not all. As one studio manager said, “We believe a good show shouldn’t need these signs.”

Is there a real difference between being in a studio and watching at home? For Claire, being in a studio is “more exciting,” while Charlotte enjoyed the feeling of being part of a live show. “Last year, I saw my favorite comedian. When you watch him on TV, you miss a lot.” What I missed was seeing the live actors; from my seat, I could only see the back of someone’s head. The opening scenes were filmed far from where I sat, so I ended up watching the show on a monitor.

Going to a studio may not be the best way to watch television, but that’s not what matters. For most audience members, it was simply fun and a free night of entertainment."

**Bruce**  
I do not like completely wild landscapes. I find the human touch important. This is also true when I travel abroad. I am attracted to charming villages with old temples, not empty deserts. When I was eight, I went to school in England, and on Saturdays, I would ride my bike to the village of Lastingham in its beautiful valley. Cycling helped me relax from school. I enjoyed exploring the bare hilltops, sheltered valleys, and old villages. Coming from Scotland, I found the landscape both familiar and different, and I still visit there today. I used to write about my adventures in my private diary. In a way, that was my first attempt at travel writing, which later became my career.

**Sophia**  
There is a small railway that runs from Hythe to Dungeness, operated by volunteers. I always travel first class because it is not much more expensive than the regular ticket. The scenery is not amazing. The train travels across Romney Marsh with its sheep and next to a canal. However, there is one part of the journey I always look forward to - when our small train goes through back gardens. For a few moments, we passengers see people in their homes, making tea, washing dishes, or setting up a deckchair. I see myself in their eyes, a woman in a tiny train carriage, looking into other people's lives. It is the simplicity of the landscape that attracts me. Just fields, sheep, and a distant grey sea. This makes me look more closely and search for something that opens my eyes.

**Matthew**  
The Hartland Peninsula is a quiet and beautiful coast. The beaches are hard to reach and filled with rocks, so there are not many people here. A few brave surfers come, but most visitors prefer to enjoy the beauty of the sea. The coast faces the Atlantic and is known for shipwrecks. There are walking paths along the coast that you can combine with trips into lovely damp valleys filled with oak trees, ferns, and wildflowers. We stay in simple self-catering accommodation with a family who owns property in the village of Southole.

**Annette**  
My favorite place in England is the Trough of Bowland, a wide-open moorland that is perfect for hiking. There are not many people living there and not many visitors either. It is a quiet and remote area, and I enjoy the feeling of space. I found this place by chance when I was a student, and since then, I have visited every year, either alone, with my boyfriend, or now with my son. It has changed little since my first visit. Having a child makes these visits more special. It makes me sad that he is growing up in a city.

**James**  
I bought Glenthorne, my favorite house in Britain. It was about finding peace and reconnecting with my English roots. I grew up in what is now Sri Lanka, but at twelve, I went to school in Devon, in the west of England. I used to ride my bike around the moors and village streets. There was a story about a place we would never cycle past: if you went down the driveway, you would never return. That place was Glenthorne. It is the house of my dreams. It is a magical, secluded, and romantic place. You can only hear the sea, wind, and birds."

We are a family that loves animals of all kinds. One afternoon, my daughter called me at work to tell me she had found a beautiful pine snake. ""Can we keep him?"" she asked excitedly. I agreed, but only for one night. We prepared a special tank for the snake, just for a short visit, so we could admire it and look it up in our natural history book.

I got home late and quickly started boiling some water when I heard my sons screaming, ""Oh, Mother! Help! Do something!"" I rushed to their room. The chaos involved our cat, Domino, and a white mouse named Bianca, which I had received as a Mother's Day gift. Domino was running around with the mouse in his mouth, trying to escape while avoiding the children who were waving their arms.

In the confusion, I tripped and fell. As I thought about how to stop Domino, I noticed the snake had escaped. It was slithering off the table and onto the floor. I crouched down as the snake moved closer, while the cat, mouse, and kids were all jumping around in a noisy mess. The snake was striking, and our dog was barking loudly. Meanwhile, the pot in the kitchen boiled over, so I quickly turned off the gas and returned to the chaos.

With renewed energy, I grabbed Domino by the tail and rescued the small, wet, and surprisingly unharmed mouse from his jaws. Interestingly, this same mouse was caught by Domino three more times in its life but eventually died of old age.

Feeling encouraged by my success, I looked at the snake to find a way to catch it. It seemed impossible. In the end, I sat on the floor like a snake-charmer, rocking back and forth, but without any music. Slowly, the snake relaxed and rested its head on its body, though its eyes still looked wary. I carefully slid my hands under the snake and stood up, then walked to the end of the garden. There, I pointed the snake towards a tree, giving it the chance to live freely.

When I finally let go of the snake's head, expecting it to attack me, it instead wrapped itself around my shoulders like a colorful scarf, seeming to settle in for the winter. We stood together in the fading light, with my four children, me, and the snake. My oldest child, DJ, broke the silence with a comment: ""You know what it is, Mum? You're nice and warm, and the shed isn't.""

I asked the children to gather at the snake's tail and gently encourage it to move on. Slowly, it did, climbing up the wall and disappearing over the roof. As the last bit of its tail vanished from our sight, my three-year-old, Clay, sighed and said what we were all thinking: ""Boy, that was one big snake!"""

""Drop me a line! In our fast-paced world of phones, faxes, and computers, the traditional art of letter writing is at risk of disappearing. However, I believe that receiving a letter brings a special joy that no other form of communication can match. There is excitement when a letter arrives, pleasure in seeing who it is from, and enjoyment in reading its contents.

Letter writing has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. It probably started with the little notes I wrote to my mother. She always made sure I wrote my own thank-you letters for Christmas and birthday gifts. It didn’t matter if they were short or messy, as long as they were letters.

When I left home at 18 to study medicine in London, I wrote to my parents every week, and they wrote back. Sometimes my father wrote, and I loved receiving his long, funny letters. Most of the letters from home shared everyday news about my parents and their friends. We also made phone calls, but I remember the letters the most.

I also received letters from my boyfriends. In my youth, I often dated people who had to work or study far away, so we kept in touch through letters. Instead of hurting our relationships, writing letters seemed to strengthen them. I found it easier to express my feelings in writing than in conversation.

I enjoy the letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. Short notes are nice, but it’s even better to receive a whole year’s worth of news! I especially love getting airmail envelopes with beautiful stamps. I have friends who write to me from different countries, like Mangala in Sri Lanka, a penfriend in Australia, and another in Vancouver. There’s also a lady from France who writes to me. If we hadn’t met in a restaurant on the way home from a holiday, I would never have had her address. Thankfully, she replied to my letters, and now we have a regular correspondence. I can practice my French with her since she doesn’t speak English. We have visited her twice, and she has stayed with us.

My biggest success in letter writing happened this summer when my family and I visited my American penfriend in Texas. We had been writing to each other for 29 years but had never met. Everyone was surprised that our correspondence lasted so long. The local newspaper even featured our story on the front page.

I am happy that my children are continuing this tradition. Like my mother, I make sure they write their own thank-you letters. My daughter writes me little letters, just as I did to my mother. She and my son have their own penfriends in Texas, organized by my penfriend. I strongly encourage everyone not to let letter writing become a lost art."""

**Careless Tourists Damage Ancient Rock Art**

Many ancient pictures carved into the rocks at one of France's most important tourist sites are being slowly destroyed. Scientists worry that the 36,000 drawings on rocks in Mont Bego in the French Alps are being damaged so quickly that they may not survive for future generations. The mountain, which was once a place for prayer and worship, has drawings that are about 4,000 years old. These include images of cows with horns, cultivated fields, and various gods and goddesses. However, as more people visit the site, the pictures are being ruined by careless graffiti.

Jean Clottes, the chairman of the International Committee on Rock Art, says, ""People think that because the pictures have been there for so long, they will always be there. But if the damage continues at this rate, there will be nothing left in 50 years."" He has seen tourists stepping on the drawings, which wears away the rock and blurs the artwork. Some visitors even break off pieces to take home as souvenirs. ""When people think they can't take a good enough photograph, they rub the drawings to get a clearer picture,"" he explains. ""The drawings are polished by the weather, and if the sun is shining and visitors can't see them well, they rub and scrape them to make them look fresher.""

Other researchers report that some people arrive with long sticks that have sharp ends to scratch their own drawings or names into the rocks. Experts disagree on the best way to protect the drawings. Henry de Lumley, director of the Museum of Natural History in Paris, believes the only way to save the site is to make the whole mountain a ""no-go"" area, allowing the public to visit only on guided tours. He warns that if this is not done, the site will be completely destroyed, and important research will be lost.

Clottes disagrees, saying, ""Henry de Lumley's plan is the most extreme, and while it may be effective, it will certainly cause protests from local residents."" He adds, ""The site was declared a historic monument years ago by the Ministry of Culture, and we must do everything we can to protect what is there.""

David Lavergne, the regional architect, also wants to keep the site open. He says, ""Henry de Lumley's idea isn't ideal. Our department believes the best solution is to let people visit the site, but because the area is very large, it is hard to stop visitors from causing damage. I would prefer that everyone could see it, but the main issue is money. We do not have enough funds to hire the necessary number of guards. We may need to consider charging a fee, as there seems to be no chance of government funding.""

In Nice, Annie Echassoux, who has also researched the site, is worried that as the mountain becomes easier to access—tourists can now avoid the three-and-a-half-hour walk by hiring vehicles—the damage will increase quickly. She believes the only solution is to close off the area and provide guides. ""You can't say the plan can't go ahead because there is no money,"" she says. ""That is not acceptable. Money must be provided because the Ministry of Culture has classified this area as a historic site. If we do not take action, we will be responsible for losing the drawings for future generations."""

Shopping in supermarkets with children can be very challenging for parents. One mother describes it as ""absolute murder."" She explains that her children want everything they see, whether it’s the newest sugary cereal, a Disney video, or a comic book—often all three. She feels guilty when she buys them these things, but she also hates saying no all the time. This makes her feel frustrated before they even leave home. Although she tries to avoid taking them shopping, she worries that she is not letting them learn how to make their own choices. 

Research shows that children ask for something to buy every two minutes when they are in a supermarket. Over £150 million is spent each year on advertising aimed directly at children, mostly on television. This amount is expected to grow, and supermarkets are where this advertising is most effective. Children often do not understand why their parents say they cannot afford certain items, and arguments about the health risks of sugar are not convincing when compared to the appealing advertisements they see.

Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance states that most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, although these ideas are not always correct. It is important for parents and children to talk about food, as children who only hear about products from advertisements get a very limited view. Parents feel frustrated because they are competing with the advertising industry and often have to disappoint their children.

The Independent Television Commission, which oversees TV advertising, does not allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy products. However, Dibb notes that the main goal of advertising is still to persuade viewers to make purchases, even if they do not directly say, ""Tell your mom to buy this.""

Shopping with children can be stressful for parents because they have to decide which requests to agree to and which to refuse. One mother mentions that she tries to be patient when discussing food with her children, but she feels uneasy about how she handles their requests. She says her son pays attention to advertisements but is critical of them. They often talk about different products and read labels together. Because of this, her children rarely ask for things she does not want to buy.

Parents also admit they can be inconsistent in how they respond to their children's requests. Mike, a father of a seven-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter, explains that they refuse to buy sweets for their son because they believe they are unhealthy, while they themselves buy rich foods like double cream and chocolate. He finds it enjoyable to buy nice things and understands why children want to share in that. However, he still feels annoyed by their requests. His willingness to say yes often depends on his mood and how well things are going in his life.

Supermarkets could help reduce conflicts between parents and children by removing sweets from checkout areas or providing supervised play areas. While parents might spend less if their children are not with them, the idea of shopping without constant demands from their kids could attract more customers, making up for any loss in sales."
FCE_65,"**Text: Going Up the Wall**

In the past, climbers went to the mountains to climb. Now, people can enjoy climbing in many places, both indoors and outdoors. The audience watches closely as the French climber Francois Lombard hangs upside down by just two fingers on a climbing wall. He is competing in the World Cup Climbing Championships at Birmingham's National Indoor Arena. This arena is better known for hosting the TV show Gladiators, but both events have one thing in common: The Wall. The ability to hold such events is due to new and rapidly advancing technology.

Before the mid-1960s, climbers practiced on natural cliffs where there were good climbing spots. In winter, they either dealt with the cold, went for walks, or climbed on snow and ice in Scotland. As the sport grew, it became important for climbers to stay fit. Since they could not use cliffs for much of the year, they began to train on brick edges or stone buildings. This helped them strengthen their fingers and avoid boredom from not climbing.

Soon, many sports centers started building climbing walls specifically for training, using bricks with special edges. One of the first climbing walls was created by Don Robinson, a physical education teacher, in a corridor at Leeds University in the mid-1960s. He came up with the idea of embedding natural rock in concrete blocks to create climbing walls. Throughout the 1970s, many similar walls were built in sports halls across the country, but they had clear design issues. These walls could only be vertical, while outdoor cliffs have features like overhangs and slanted rocks. Additionally, once the walls were built, they could not be changed, and climbers would eventually get bored with the same routes.

In 1985, a Frenchman named Francois Savigny invented a material that could be shaped like the holds found on cliffs. These holds could be attached to any wall and removed when climbers wanted a change. French manufacturers also started to create panels on steel frames. Concrete was too heavy for making overhanging walls without significant construction, but steel frames could be built anywhere as free-standing structures. This system of interchangeable holds provided climbers with endless new challenges."
FCE_61,"**Text: 'So You Want to Be an Actor'**

If you tell someone that you want to be an actor, they will likely mention that it is a risky career. Acting is indeed risky because there are many actors but not enough jobs for them. When you decide to pursue acting, some people you thought were friends may think you are making a mistake, while others may support you. Everyone will give you different advice, but ultimately, it is a personal choice, and you are responsible for your own path and dreams.

There are no easy ways to succeed in acting. There are no exams to pass, and even after training, there is no guarantee of success. Success often depends on a mix of luck and talent. However, there is always a need for new actors, and the profession can offer excitement, glamour, and sometimes financial rewards.

Many people ask what talent is. I believe talent is a combination of natural skill and imagination, with imagination being the hardest to measure. Talent also involves courage and confidence in what you are doing. 

The desire to act can be hard to explain. In theater, the important moment is the connection between the actor and the audience. This connection is what motivates actors to perform. When you ask successful actors how they achieved their success, they often do not have a clear answer. They understand their own skills and those of others, but they do not take their success for granted. They know they are only as good as their last job, and fame can be fleeting.

Disappointment is a major challenge for actors. One month, you might be unemployed, working in a store or as a waitress. Then, you might get a chance to audition for a role. However, even if you want the job badly, you might not get it. Because of this, actors often avoid discussing their chances of success. They find ways to cope with the stress of competition and the fear of rejection, which is something no one enjoys. 

From the moment you start auditioning, you are saying you are available and hopefully talented enough for the role. Ultimately, it is up to you; if you do not care enough about your career, others may not care about you either."

It's true - we are all getting taller. Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy after school. The teacher jokingly asked, ""What do you want to be? The flagpole on a ship?"" This was funny because Chris was already almost two metres tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is the tallest man in Britain. 

Every decade, the average height of people in Europe increases by about one centimetre. More tall people are being born, but this does not mean we are becoming a new super race. Instead, we are returning to how our ancestors looked. According to palaeontologist Professor Chris Stringer, ""We are starting to reach our true potential,"" similar to the Cro-Magnons who lived 40,000 years ago.

For most of human history, our ancestors had a varied diet. Women gathered herbs, fruits, and berries, while men hunted animals. One study found they ate from 85 different wild plants. However, about 9,000 years ago, agriculture began, which changed everything. Farmers took over many natural areas, and now just three plants—wheat, rice, and maize—provide more than half of the calories we eat. This limited diet has harmed our health. 

In Ohio, scientists found that when healthy hunter-gatherers started farming corn, they became sickly and underweight. Tooth decay and diseases increased. Although corn was thought to be a blessing, some anthropologists see it as a public health problem. Still, agriculture spread because one piece of land could support many more people than hunting could. 

Today, many people are poorly nourished, but this issue is only recently being addressed, even in wealthier countries. In Europe, the US, and Japan, diets are starting to reflect the variety of our ancestors' diets again. As a result, the average height of men is now 179 cm in the US, 180 cm in Holland, and 177 cm in Japan. This is a positive trend, but it comes with challenges. 

Even though people are getting taller, standard bed lengths have stayed at 190 cm since 1860. Legroom in planes and trains seems to have decreased, and clothing manufacturers are constantly adjusting their sizes. The question is: how tall can we get? Experts suggest there might be a limit, possibly around 193 cm, which we could reach this century. 

However, scientists warn that while individuals may be growing taller due to better nutrition, as a species, we are actually getting smaller. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, humans were slightly rounder and taller to keep warm. As the climate has warmed, we have become thinner and shorter, even when well-fed. If global warming continues, we might shrink even more. In other words, our growth could be affected by climate change."

I had planned to stay for another five or ten years, but then I was unexpectedly made redundant. I didn’t receive a great severance package, but it was enough to start my farm. My big break came when I met the head chef of a local hotel with one of the best restaurants in the country. By supplying them, my reputation grew, and now I also sell meat through mail order. I’m happy to be out of the office, but it’s surprising how little has changed: I still work 80 to 90 hours a week and sell a product.""

Choosing to take redundancy and become an artist felt like the right choice. The career counselor I spoke to was very supportive. I think I was the first person to tell him, 'I don’t want to go back to my old job.' He was surprised because most people in their mid-forties need to find work quickly for financial reasons. My wife and I married young, and our children no longer need our support. It was a big change for us. We moved to northern England, where we didn’t know anyone. We left our friends behind, but luckily, our friendships have lasted, and many of them visit us now.""

Since my business is fashion-related, I have collections and seasonal designs to manage, so there’s always a lot to do, and I need to keep a strict schedule. I feel happier now and much less stressed. However, I do miss the social interaction with colleagues. What I love about this job is that I am fully responsible for my work. If I do a poor job, I am the one who faces the consequences. Of course, you care when working for a company, but when your name is on the promotional materials, you care even more.""

I knew I needed qualifications to change careers, so I took various massage courses. Then, I was offered part-time work at the Life Centre. I have no regrets.

FCE_5,"**Text: A Winning Game**

Two brothers have discovered that their childhood game is great for business. Dave and Norm Lagasse, two bearded brothers in their forties, are at their simple home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA, enjoying their childhood memories. In front of them is a wooden board with round plastic pieces. They are playing pichenotte, an ancient game that they believe is unique. Their grandfather, Lucien Rajotte, a grocer from Quebec, Canada, brought the game to the USA and introduced it to his family. Soon, every weekend and holiday, the family played the game and, as Dave says, ""had the best time ever."" Eventually, they moved to New Mexico, but they continued to play with Grandpa's pichenotte board, which he had made from old wooden crates. Visitors were often intrigued because the game was unknown in the southern USA.

Three years ago, Dave noticed how worn the pichenotte board had become and decided to make a new one. It turned out beautifully. A relative wanted one, and then a friend asked for another. Curious about the interest, the brothers took one of Dave's new boards to a sports bar in Santa Fe. ""People started to watch,"" says Dave, ""and said, 'No way I'm playing that silly game.' But soon, they couldn't get up from the table!"" When people asked about the game's origins, Dave researched it. He found that the roots likely come from India, where a similar game called 'carroms' exists. This game evolved into 'squails,' played in British pubs, and British immigrants brought it to Canada. Pichenotte is the French-Canadian version that developed in Quebec.

Pichenotte can be played by two to four people and is a game of skill. Each player has 12 pieces or 'pucks' that are flicked across a wheel-like board using one hand. Scoring a puck into a small hole is worth 20 points, while three rings around the hole are worth 15, 10, and 5 points, respectively. There are also eight small posts that act as obstacles. The game usually lasts about two minutes.

Seeing the game's popularity at the Santa Fe bar, the Lagasses made more boards and took them to markets and craft fairs. Crowds gathered, money was exchanged, and the game's popularity increased. Championships began, and a trophy called the 'Lord Pichenotte Cup' was created. As word spread, the boards sold quickly, and the brothers decided to start a pichenotte business full-time. They set up a workshop in their garage and have produced over 450 boards. Made of birchwood and mahogany, each board weighs 12 kg and is 1 cm thick. Norm explains, ""They're very durable, as they have to withstand a lot of use."" They are available for $595 each on the brothers' website.

Currently, there are no professional pichenotte players or TV coverage to create pichenotte stars. However, the day may come when the brothers' garage will be home to a luxury Mercedes instead of tools and wood. Until then, they are happy to spend their free time playing the game they hope will bring them success."

However, through careful planning and hard work by one man, with the support of his wife, this land has been transformed into the beautiful site you see today. 

During the construction of the village, many tons of soil and clay were moved to change the flat land into a sculpted landscape. Although machines like bulldozers helped, a lot of manual labor was also involved. Once the land was shaped, about 1,000 tons of topsoil were added to create lawns, flower beds, and rockeries. Hundreds of trees and shrubs were planted, carefully chosen to survive in the salty air near the sea and to withstand strong winter winds. Most plants came from local garden centers, but some were imported from as far away as Canada and New Zealand.

The entire village was designed by Colin Sims, who created over 100 models over nine years, starting in 1972. The models are made from various materials—stone, concrete, specially treated wood, and plastics—to endure different weather conditions. Initially, Colin needed help from experts to understand how materials would hold up over time, but he quickly became skilled himself. 

You will notice that a consistent scale has been maintained, and great attention has been given to even the smallest details of the models. This was achieved through patience and the development of unique building techniques. The Model Village has become a popular attraction, known for its high-quality craftsmanship and upkeep. The methods used to create these realistic models have been adopted in other model villages across England and are even taught in some college courses on modeling.

All the buildings in the village represent traditional British architectural styles and are not based on any specific place. One of the most impressive structures is the Manor House, a typical 13th-century stone building with a brick tower and stone walls, inspired by manor houses found in the West Country. As you walk around, you will also see the Castle, St Mary's Church, a zoo, and a mini golf course, which is the newest addition to the village.

We ask you to stay on the paths during your visit and not to touch any of the models, as any damage can lead to hours of repair work for us. You may take photographs from the pathways only. Dogs are welcome on a short lead.

To enhance your experience, you will find buttons in front of some working models. Pressing these will make the models operate. At the end of your visit, we welcome your feedback. We are always planning new models, and your ideas can help us create a more varied and interesting display. We also want to know if any models did not meet your expectations, as we are continually updating and replacing them.

We hope you enjoy your visit and look forward to seeing you again. Please tell your friends about us!"

Every week, British tabloid newspapers publish pictures that invade people's privacy and violate the editors' code of practice. While some pop stars do pose for paparazzi sometimes, this is not the norm. More often, serious harm is done to public figures when their private moments are shown on the front page. However, very few people report these issues to the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), which was created to handle such problems. Rarely are these pictures in the public interest. For example, do private photos of pop stars help solve crimes? How does a picture of a famous actress on a hotel balcony protect public health and safety? The actress has previously complained about long-lens photos, and since she was in a hotel—a place where people expect privacy—she had a valid reason to complain, but she did not take action. It is a scandal that the PCC did not start an investigation. It should also look into the recent shocking story about a pop star's love life. Like the actress, the pop star has not made a formal complaint. Shouldn't the PCC take the lead on this and other disgraceful incidents? 

At first glance, this seems like a good idea. It could lead to many decisions against newspapers, which would be reported by their competitors and on TV and radio. The public would not support such actions, and editors would have to stop publishing this kind of material. Photographers would also be affected, as they would no longer be able to afford to hide behind trees to take pictures of unsuspecting celebrities. If the PCC decided to act as a 'police officer', which it technically could, there would be several challenges. How would it decide whether to start an investigation? Should it contact the victim and encourage them to complain? And if the person still refused to act, should the PCC proceed anyway? Additionally, celebrities and royals might expect that any story about them would be investigated, and they could be upset if it wasn’t. 

Moreover, the role of the PCC is too vast. How could it realistically monitor all of the British press: national, regional, and magazines? There is also the issue of embarrassment to consider. Even if someone's privacy has been violated, would they want the added embarrassment of an investigation? Most likely, they just want to move on with their lives. Some may have other reasons for staying quiet. They might be hiding a worse story from the press and fear that it could come out if they complain. In other words, even the PCC could become a problem for them. 

One British comedian faced issues with the press when he and his wife were secretly photographed on their honeymoon in the Caribbean. He did not complain then, nor did he when he and his family were photographed during a holiday. His reason was the fear that the newspaper, News of the World, would publish the pictures again with a new story about his 'anger', claiming they thought it was just a joke and that, as a comedian, he would have a sense of humor about it. This fear is understandable. People believe they will become targets again if they challenge the tabloids. It is difficult to find an easy solution to this serious problem."
FCE_38,"Text: ""Many college graduates receive advice about starting their first job. This article focuses on moving to a second job. We are not discussing those who are looking for a temporary job while searching for a permanent one, nor those who leave a job they dislike within a few weeks. Instead, we will talk about those of you who are ready to take a significant step in your career. You have gained some experience and skills and have a clearer idea of your career goals. 

What kind of job should you seek? It largely depends on your long-term goals. You need to consider whether you want to specialize in a certain area, aim for higher responsibilities, or explore a broader field. Whatever you choose, it is important to select your second job carefully. You should plan to stay in this job for two to three years, as it will be closely examined by future employers when you apply for your next position. This job should demonstrate that you have thought seriously about your career. Most importantly, it should help you grow, develop your skills, and provide you with more responsibilities.

If you have a desire to travel, now might be a good time to do so. You can take temporary work when you return and then find your second job later. Future employers will appreciate that you have satisfied your travel interests and are less likely to leave again soon.

Juliette Davidson spent her first year after graduating from St. Aldate's College working for three solicitors. It was a great first job because they were very supportive. She learned how to navigate an office and improved her word processing skills. However, there was no opportunity for advancement. Eventually, she decided to leave, bought a plane ticket, and traveled for a year.

Now, Juliette works as a Personal Assistant to Brenda Cleverdon, the Chief Executive of Business in the Community. She says, 'In two and a half years, I have become more capable, and my job has really evolved. From the start, my boss was eager to help me grow. My job title is the same as when I began, but my responsibilities have changed. I now handle most of the correspondence and budgets, and I deal with various inquiries, from company chairmen to people wanting to start their own businesses. Brenda includes me in all her work and also assigns me specific projects and events to organize.'"""
FCE_17,"**Text: 'What is the Secret of Confident People?'**

Confident people may seem like they were born that way, but many will say it is a skill they learned over time. Nina Hathway interviews five individuals about how they became confident.

**A. Jenny**  
When I finished school, I was very shy and thought I would always be that way. At about twenty-five, I was asked to help at my daughter’s school. I was nervous but surprised myself by doing well. Someone suggested I take a university course. On my first day, I felt very anxious, but my confidence grew over time, and I became more outgoing. Looking back, working at the school was a turning point in my life.

**B. Michaela**  
My journey began four years ago when my father got sick, and I had to take over the family business. I was scared and became overly aggressive. I thought that was how confident people acted, but I learned that true confidence comes from believing in yourself. If work becomes too much, I don’t feel guilty about postponing tasks. When facing challenges, I remind myself that I have nothing to lose. Fear can destroy confidence, so I often talk to myself to overcome those fears.

**C. Lisa**  
People see me as confident, but I often feel scared inside. I learned to appear confident because it is essential in TV. Interviewing people has shown me that many of us feel tense in important situations, but we feel better when talking to friendly people. My mother once told me that everyone is too busy worrying about their own appearance to notice me. I remember this advice often. I also believe that facing your fears helps build confidence. I was nervous during my driving test, but after passing, I felt I could handle anything.

**D. Barbara**  
My confidence comes from enjoying my work, but I have built it up over the years. If you keep working and learn from mistakes, you will feel more confident next time. I work hard and am well-liked in the restaurant, but not everyone will like you. It’s important to accept yourself and not try to meet others' expectations. My company offers training courses that have boosted my self-esteem. Setting achievable goals helps you see your progress instead of aiming too high and feeling disappointed.

**E. Kim**  
After college, I worked as a secretary and often sat in meetings without speaking up, even when I disagreed. Eventually, I found the confidence to share my thoughts. When I started working in politics, I had never spoken in public and would shake with nerves. I told myself, “Don’t be silly. People do this every day, so you can too.” I also found it helpful to write down points to refer to, like a comfort blanket. I believe everyone feels a bit nervous when speaking publicly. The real secret to confidence is reminding yourself that “Nothing is impossible.”"
FCE_47,"**Text: Visit to Malaysia**

Paul Forster attends a kite-flying festival and spends a nervous night in the forest. Adnan Ali smiled widely when I gave him his torn kite. ""You should keep it,"" he said, ""it's a tradition - if the line breaks, the finders keep it... and I have many more."" He pointed to a pile of beautifully decorated kites at his feet. All were exactly 120 cm wide and long, made of tissue paper and split bamboo. We sat in the shade of the whispering conifer trees behind the Beach of the Seven Lagoons in Kelantan, looking out at Malaysia's largest kite festival. 

In the center of the beach, ten platforms held up the kites, while tense competitors waited with their kite lines for the countdown. When the whistle blew, the crowd cheered, and the kites shot into the sky like rockets. More than 500 men and boys had signed up for the competition, which lasts five days each year. Each participant entered four different designs, judged on decoration, stability in the air, and flying efficiency. 

""Flying kites isn't too hard,"" Adnan said, ""but making them requires real skill. Come visit me at home, and I'll show you how."" This was one of five invitations I received that day, and I decided to accept. At his house, I drank cold milky tea and ate fish crackers in a large, polished room. As night fell, he invited me to return the next day to start rebuilding his kite, but I couldn't. Instead, I explored the southern part of the state, driving towards Kuala Lumpur, through granite mountains covered in lush rainforest. 

I took a wrong turn, and the smooth road ended at a river. A small boat was waiting to take pedestrians across. Nearby, a sign caught my attention. It pointed up a footpath into the forest and read: ""Jelawang Jungle 3 km."" Before I started, it would have been helpful to know that most of this distance was steep and slippery. When I reached the track, I found a man named Baba waiting with a flask of tea. He managed a tented kitchen and several bamboo huts. I decided to stay there, trying not to think about insects crawling under my thin foam mattress. 

The night was completely dark, filled with various sounds. A nearby waterfall roared, and thousands of creatures moved and squeaked. In the morning, I enjoyed a stunning view over five ranges of green mountains. In the afternoon, it rained. First came the wind, then lightning struck the treetops. Moments later, I was soaked. As I slid downhill, I wondered how the giant butterflies avoided the heavy raindrops. I also worried about my car being washed away (it sometimes happens) and the risk of drowning if I opened my mouth. Luckily, my car was still there, covered in mud, at the bottom of the track. 

In Kota Bahru, the capital of Kelantan, everyone asked me questions: ""Where are you from?"" ""How old are you?"" But their curiosity was friendly. While Kelantan is famous for its kites, I will always remember it for the kindness of its people."

Shopping is something we all do, whether we enjoy it or not. But there are different types of shoppers. Do you know what type you are? Abby Edwards asked several people about their shopping habits:

A. **Melanie, 22, Dancer**  
""I love shopping! When I have money, I go out and feel happy. I can't resist sale signs. My boyfriend is the same, so we often shop together. We're both addicted!""

B. **Brenda, 40, Office Manager**  
""I'm not a fan of shopping. My husband does most of the grocery shopping because he cooks and knows what he likes. I take my kids shopping for clothes, but it’s not fun since we all have different styles. I rarely buy things for myself, and when I do, I feel guilty and tell my husband I spent less than I actually did.""

C. **Juliet, 28, Personnel Manager**  
""I only shop for what I need. I dislike shopping and only go when necessary. When I do shop, I know exactly what I want and won’t settle for anything else. Shopping feels exhausting to me.""

D. **Anita, 35, TV Producer**  
""I enjoy browsing sometimes, but I usually know what I want and where to find it. I don’t waste time and prefer to shop quickly. However, I do have some items in my wardrobe that I regret buying, so maybe I’m careful but sometimes make mistakes.""

E. **Lizzie, 41, Secretary**  
""I really dislike shopping, especially for clothes. I can never find what I want or get help. The stores are too noisy and messy, which makes it a nightmare for me. Luckily, I don’t have to shop for clothes often since I receive many as gifts. For groceries, I go to the supermarket once a week and get it done quickly.""

F. **Lisa, 22, Actress**  
""I would say I’m a happy shopper. Sometimes I go out with my friends just to look around, and we often end up buying things. I don’t usually have a specific item in mind, but if I see something I like, I’ll buy it.""

G. **Suki, 26, Art Gallery Assistant**  
""I’m a careful shopper. I enjoy shopping, but I don’t buy much. I usually know what I want and don’t go overboard. Sometimes I shop to feel better, but then I often regret spending too much.""

H. **Ann-Marie, 29, Nursery Worker**  
""I love shopping, but only on certain days and never on Saturdays because it’s too crowded. I’m a careful shopper; I have a good idea of what I want and don’t rush into buying things. I like to check other stores to find better deals, which takes me a long time.""

I. **Linda, 32, Restaurant Manager**  
""I don’t like shopping, maybe because I work in the city center and the shops don’t excite me anymore. When I have to shop, I go without trying things on because it’s too much effort. The clothes I buy don’t always fit, but I don’t mind making mistakes rather than spending too much time in stores."""

**New Artwork**  
The Gallery now features a beautiful still life by the Dutch painter Jan van Os from the 18th century. This large painting (89.1 cm x 71 cm) depicts flowers and fruit in bright colors on wood. It is one of the first of its kind in the Gallery. The painting is signed and dated 1777 and 1778. It is common for artists to date their work in two years, as they wait for specific flowers to bloom in different seasons. This artwork was generously donated to the Gallery by Miss Violet Churchman in memory of her sister, Ida Nancy. It is currently displayed in Room 25.

**Special Exhibition**  
The exhibition titled ""Painting in Spain during the Late 18th Century"" opened in the Sunley Room on 15 March. The Gallery has recently acquired works by three Spanish painters from this period: Paret, Melendez, and Francisco Bayeu, who are the main focus of the exhibition. They are joined by Francisco's brother Ramon, Antonio Gonzalez, and two Italian artists who worked in Spain during this time: Corrado Giaquinto and Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. The exhibition will be open until 31 May.

For a group of children aged ten to fifteen, Saturdays are dedicated to learning serious cooking. Their weekly lessons in small classes are so popular that there is a waiting list of 30 children wanting to join. Parents pay £280 for the course, where their children can have fun and learn to make good food. 

Bill, who is ten years old, says, ""I love my mum's cooking, and now I can do it better than her. The teachers make us laugh, especially when we sit down to share the food we've made."" 

Flora, who is twelve, has some trouble with onions. She says, ""I love cooking. I made a meal for ten friends, and they really enjoyed it. My mum suggested I find a hobby instead of doing nothing on weekends. I was happy at home, so I wasn't very interested at first. But I'm really glad I decided to come."" 

Their teacher, Philippe, says, ""It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, even if the kitchen isn't always tidy when they cook! As adults, we keep learning more about food. If parents get their children interested in cooking when they are young, they will have the skills to cook for themselves when they leave home."""

PET_21,"**MONEY**

What is money? The pound, the dollar, and the franc are similar to a gram or a kilometre. The key difference is that you can trade money for goods or services. For example, a five-pound note can buy a book, a large bag of sweets, or a few cinema tickets. However, the note itself is just a piece of paper that costs very little to produce.

Thousands of years ago, people did not have money as we understand it today. There were no banks or shops. Back then, Mr. Green, a farmer, would trade the corn he grew for Mr. Hive's honey. This was a direct exchange between two people, each having something the other wanted. Over time, most societies created their own forms of 'currency' to facilitate more exchanges. Eventually, different currencies began to connect, which is why today everyone uses a national currency."

They want interesting and original stories. Last year, detective fiction was very popular, but the winner wrote a love story.

You can write about anything you like, but here are some tips to help you:

1. **Write About What You Know**: This is important advice for every writer. Last year, most stories were about love, family, and friendship problems. Try to make ordinary situations interesting so that people want to read them.

2. **Get Your Facts Right**: Make sure your descriptions and information are accurate. If you are unsure about something, do not include it in your story.

3. **Hold the Reader's Attention**: Start with an interesting beginning and end with a surprise. A weak ending can ruin a good story. Develop your story carefully and think of something unusual for the ending.

4. **Think About the Characters**: Make your characters feel real by using descriptive language. 

Your story must be your own work, between 2,000 and 2,500 words, typed, double-spaced, and printed on one side of each page. We cannot accept stories sent by fax or email, even if you are close to the deadline. You must include the application form with your story. Unfortunately, we cannot return your story or discuss our decisions. 

You should not have had any fiction published in any magazine or book in this country, as per a new rule. Your story must not have been published in any form, including on radio or TV, anywhere in the world.

Hypatia was born in Alexandria, Egypt, in 370 A.D. For many centuries, she was the only woman scientist recognized in history. Her father was the director of Alexandria University, and he ensured that she received the best education possible. This was rare, as most women at that time had limited opportunities for study. After studying in Athens and Rome, Hypatia returned to Alexandria and began teaching mathematics. She quickly became well-known for her understanding of new ideas. Although we do not have copies of her books, we know she wrote several important mathematical works. Hypatia was also interested in technology and created several scientific tools to assist her work. During her time, many rulers feared science, and those involved in it were often in danger. In March 415, Hypatia was attacked in the street and killed."

PET_27,"**Text: Grass**

Grass is one of the most successful plants in the world. There are over 9,000 different types of grasses, and they can be found in every part of the earth. Grass is unique because it can grow in very cold places like the Arctic and Antarctic. Grasslands are home to many animals, from small insects and birds to large animals like cows and lions. All these animals rely on grass in some way.

One interesting feature of grass is that it grows back quickly after being cut or damaged. Unlike many other plants, new leaves of grass grow from below the ground, not from the top. This ability allows many animals to live together in the same area. When they eat all the grass in one spot, new grass starts to grow again, providing a fresh food source."
PET_44,"Text: Kal Kaur Rai, the Young Achiever of the Year, has always loved fashion and recently won this title at the Asian Business Awards. Since childhood, she has enjoyed drawing clothes and creating designs. However, she never told her parents, who run a supermarket, about her dream to make fashion her career. She believed they wanted her to pursue a more traditional job, so she studied management at university. After graduating, she moved to London and worked at an advertising agency. Although she attended industry events, she could not afford the designer clothes she admired. To solve this, she began making skirts and tops for herself. When her friends noticed her creations, they asked her to make clothes for them too. She then found a small shop in London that agreed to sell her designs on a sale-or-return basis. The clothes were very popular, and nothing was returned. This success motivated her to leave her advertising job, take out a £20,000 loan, and start her own womenswear brand. Her parents were supportive of her decision, which made her very happy. Now, her clothes are sold in over 70 stores, and her business earns more than £500,000. Her designs are featured in fashion magazines, she creates outfits for pop stars, and she gained public recognition by winning this award.

Tom Cruise is one of the most successful actors in film history. However, his life has not always been easy. As a child, Tom was shy and struggled to make friends, even though he loved participating in school plays. After finishing high school, he moved to New York to find work. He got a job as a porter while also taking drama classes. In 1980, the film director Franco Zeffirelli gave Tom his first role in a movie. Ten years later, he had become so successful that he was one of the highest-paid actors in Hollywood, earning millions for each film. Today, Tom continues to act in films and remains very popular with his many fans around the world."

Mark Ottaway traveled by train from Darwin, in northern Australia, to Adelaide, in the south. The Ghan train goes across the Australian continent, from the warm northern coast through vast deserts to the cooler Southern Ocean. It is often called the 'famous Ghan', but it is known for being late. The idea of a train link between Darwin and Adelaide started in the 1920s with a line from Adelaide to Alice Springs, but flooding often made it hard for trains to run. A new line was finished a few months before my trip. The railway was built for speeds of up to 115 kph, but the Ghan is not a high-speed train. It has few stops, and most passengers are on holiday. The Ghan does not offer luxury like the Orient Express, but the food on board is very good. The railway was originally built to transport goods, not passengers. It was believed that sending goods from Europe to southern Australia via Darwin and the train would save time and money compared to shipping around the continent. It is rare to complete a transcontinental railway, and the Ghan claims to be the world's first north-south railway.

As I waited to board the Ghan, I noticed that everyone was excited about the journey. Many of my fellow travelers were Australian pensioners who were eager to get on the train. Our first stop was Katherine, where the Ghan stayed for four hours. Some passengers got off to take a boat trip up the gorge. I stayed on the train until Alice Springs, where I joined a two-day trip to Uluru (Ayers Rock) with a small group and a guide. Climbing the rock is not encouraged now, and few people do it. Our group walked around the rock and enjoyed the beautiful sunset. From Alice Springs, there are two trains a week heading south, so many passengers stop their journey here. The view from the train after Alice Springs is not very interesting; there is a lot of flat land with only cattle to see. But at dawn on the third day, we reached the foothills near the Southern Ocean. My journey was ending, and although the train did not meet all the promises made in advertisements, it took me to some of the most amazing sights in Australia."

Every year, thousands of people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland. Because it is located in the north, the weather can be very cold. Climber Keith Hewitt shares his experience of climbing Ben Nevis for the first time.

It was February, and it was my first big winter climb. We chose a route up the north face of the mountain to Tower Ridge. This climb is six hundred metres high, making it one of the longest in Britain. We planned to camp for three days in the 'Carries', which are large bowls cut into the mountain halfway up. We carried tents, sleeping bags, and metal spikes for our boots. These spikes are necessary because the snow can be so hard that it feels like walking on ice. Even though some members of our group were very experienced, we packed a lot of safety equipment, including lights to signal for help, hard hats, and extra clothing. 

Although the weather forecast was good, with no strong winds, there was still a sense of nervousness when we started our climb. Climbing Ben Nevis in winter is always difficult. The path quickly became steep, and my legs felt heavy. As the weakest member of the group, I needed to take more breaks. The others sometimes paused to let me catch up, but as soon as I arrived, they would start again. I promised myself that I would train better before my next climb.

After climbing 200 metres, we reached the start of Tower Ridge, the path that would take us to the top of Ben Nevis. It is only a metre and a half wide, and the mountain drops hundreds of metres on both sides. We knew we had to stay calm and focus on each step as we moved slowly along it. After seven hours of climbing, we finally reached the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and the island of Skye, which is 48 kilometres away. Unfortunately, we were not so lucky, as a mist had come down.

Getting back down to camp can be just as challenging as going up. You need to be able to read a map well; a wrong turn could lead to dangerous slopes in winter. I was glad we decided to take turns with this task. It was only when I was safely in the tent that I could say I truly enjoyed the experience. But at least I made it to the top."
PET_58,"**Text: Anna's New School**

This week has been very exciting because we have moved into our new school building! It is a wonderful place. The builders used wood for the entire structure, similar to our old school, but this one is also designed to be environmentally friendly. The school took many months to build, and we watched the process. It was thrilling to see the builders clear the land, even though it meant some beautiful open space was lost. The noise from the construction machines was quite loud, and the builders often had to stop because of heavy rain. At times, we worried that the building would never be finished.

Now, we have five large classrooms, much bigger than those in our old school, which was very old. We also share one room with people from the town for meetings. There is a nursery, a lovely dining room, and spacious changing rooms that we are excited to use once our new sports field is ready.

When you enter the school, you will notice that there are no heaters! Instead, the warmth comes from everyone inside—the students, teachers, and computers. The building is designed to keep the heat and sound inside, so when we sing in our classrooms, it feels like we are in a concert hall!

Another interesting feature is that the school roof has a tree on it! The builders placed it there after finishing the roof, as it is a tradition in Austria, where the roof was made. The electricity for our lights and computers comes from a wind turbine on a hill behind the school. We visited it with our teacher yesterday, and it spins very fast. It is so large that it can be seen from far away! We took some pictures to share on our website.

Even though we are already using the school, some parts are still being completed. For example, we are currently preparing a play for our parents, but we have to go back to our old school hall to perform it. The new hall will be ready by next year. We are very happy with our new school, and our teachers say we will learn much faster now that we are here!"

Now, as I looked down at the river far below, I understood why people love rock-climbing. My friend Matt and I arrived at the Activity Centre on Friday evening. The accommodation was basic, but we had everything we needed: beds, blankets, and food. We were happy to be out of the city and in the fresh air. 

On Saturday morning, we met the other ten members of our group. Cameron came with his friends, Kevin and Simon, while sisters Carole and Lynn were with Amanda. We all came from different places and none of us knew the area well. We knew we would spend the weekend outdoors, but we were not sure how. Half of us went caving in the morning while the others went rock-climbing, and then we switched activities at lunchtime. Matt and I went to the caves first. Climbing out was harder than going in, but after a lot of effort, we finally made it out—covered in mud but happy and excited about what we had accomplished.'"

On Saturday afternoon, I accidentally left my handbag on the bus. Inside were my cheque book, address book, and my purse, which had about £50 in cash and some credit cards. When I realized my mistake, it was too late. I felt lost: I am 72 years old, far from home, and quite worried. I stood by the road and cried. A young man saw me and asked what was wrong. I told him what had happened, and he kindly gave me some money for my bus fare home. When I explained the situation to the bus driver, he told me I could keep the fare. I made it home safely, and soon after, the phone rang. It was the manager of CityBus, the company that owned the bus where I left my handbag. He said they had found it and offered to bring it back to me. I was amazed to get my handbag back, with everything inside still there. I want to express my gratitude to everyone who helped me that day and to acknowledge their kindness and honesty.

PET_60,"**Text: Sharks**

Sharks are among the most intimidating animals in our oceans. They are well adapted for hunting underwater because they have excellent vision and can sense movement through special lines on the sides of their bodies. This makes sharks very dangerous for smaller sea animals that they prey on. 

While sharks share some similarities with other fish, their bodies are quite different. For instance, most sharks must keep swimming constantly to breathe and survive, which means they hardly ever sleep. Additionally, if sharks are flipped onto their backs, they can stop moving entirely. This is a useful method for researchers who need to study sharks, as it helps them learn more about these intriguing animals."

My name is Nathalie. Last year, I became one of the youngest foreign students to join the Kirov Ballet School in St. Petersburg, Russia. On my first day of ballet class, I felt nervous because I didn’t know anyone. Everyone came over to ask me questions, all in Russian. I tried to respond in Russian, and they switched to English, so we were able to communicate. Now, six months later, everyone is very friendly, my Russian has improved a lot, and I understand my teachers well.

For the first two weeks after I arrived, my mother stayed with me, and when she left, I felt a bit sad. I even called home late one night to talk to her because I was feeling lonely. Compared to my ballet school in England, the classes in Russia are much more challenging, and I eat a lot to keep my energy up. This gives me confidence that I can meet the school's high standards.

In the evenings, I like to watch my favorite movies on my computer, but sometimes I fall asleep before the DVD finishes. Now that I have settled in, I feel really at home here. I enjoy walking around the city and visiting different shops, even in December when it was extremely cold. I decided to buy a fur hat because it was minus 10°C, but the locals said it was mild for that time of year! At least my room is warm and cozy.

Currently, we are preparing for a new production, and there is also a competition for young dancers that I plan to enter. I feel very lucky to be here.'"
PET_55,"**THE ICEHOTEL**

For many years, the Arctic was a popular summer destination to experience the land of the midnight sun. However, in winter, the few residents enjoyed the snow and ice alone. By the late 1980s, people began to see the dark and cold winter as a positive aspect. In the winter of 1990, French artist Jannot Derit was invited to open an exhibition in a specially built igloo (a structure made of snow) in the small town of Jukkasjarvi, located on the frozen Torne River. This building, called Arctic Hall, attracted many visitors to the area. One night, a group of foreign guests decided to sleep in Arctic Hall. The next morning, they were very happy with their experience, and the idea of an ice hotel was created. Today, it is famous worldwide.

As winter begins, a team of snow builders, architects, and artists from around the world come to Jukkasjarvi to construct the hotel for that year. As each section is finished, it opens to visitors and overnight guests, while other parts are still being built. The first section is completed in December, and each week a new section opens until January 7th, when the hotel is fully completed. Since the ICEHOTEL is built outdoors using natural winter materials, the completion date depends on the weather, so plans can sometimes change. In spring, as temperatures rise, the hotel melts away.

Inside the hotel, the temperature never drops below -5°C to -8°C, no matter how cold it is outside. Guests receive winter clothing, such as warm overalls, hats, and gloves, as part of their stay. It is also wise for guests to bring sweaters, scarves, and plenty of woollen socks, and to choose footwear that is slightly larger than usual to fit thick socks. If you plan to visit the hotel, you can purchase warm sweaters, woollen socks, and more on the ICEHOTEL website. You can order these items and any necessary equipment when you book your stay, and they will be delivered to your room upon check-in.

The hotel is located in the village of Jukkasjarvi, 200 km above the Arctic Circle, but only 15 km from Kiruna airport and 17 km from Kiruna train station. Bus transport can be arranged from the airport or train station to the ICEHOTEL."

A report by Dave Worthington

Homestyle, a new furniture store, had to close shortly after it opened at midnight last Thursday. Up to 6,000 people rushed to the store. There were many special offers, such as a leather sofa for £45 (only until 3 am) and a bed for £30 (only between 3 am and 8 am). The store's regular hours will be from 9 am to 9 pm every day, but Homestyle had planned to stay open for the first 24 hours. However, it had to close within half an hour of opening.

A police officer who was called to the store said, ""The police knew a large crowd was expected, but people were not patient. The store quickly became full, and the managers wisely decided to close the doors. The people outside got angry because they thought everything would be sold before they could get in, and they refused to wait quietly until there was space for them. Another issue was that there was a long line of cars trying to reach the parking lot. I couldn't believe that many people left their cars in the middle of the road and walked the last few meters to the store, which blocked the road completely.""

One customer, Jenny Smith, who got into the store, said, ""I waited in line for three hours and didn't have time to buy what I wanted. But the staff were very calm and explained what was happening. They had no choice, as it wasn't safe. I will come back when they reopen, but I don't want to wait in line again."""

PET_34,"**Text: Free-diving in the Caribbean**

Tanya Streeter holds four world records in free-diving, a sport where competitors dive to great depths on just one breath of air. In 2003, she made history by becoming the first person to dive 120 meters into the ocean and return to the surface without assistance. Although she had dived deeper the previous year using a balloon to help her ascend, this time she held her breath for over three and a half minutes, making her the only woman to break a world record previously held by a man.

A team of fourteen safety divers monitored her dive at various depths. Despite some concerns about the dangers of free-diving, Tanya believes that safety and training are the most important aspects of the sport. While many free-divers focus on one or two types of events, Tanya maintains a consistent training schedule. Two-thirds of her training is done in the gym, while the rest is split between the pool and the ocean. She uses an exercise bike to improve her heart fitness but avoids running to prevent knee injuries. Instead, she prefers fast walking to build her fitness.

When preparing for practice dives, Tanya usually travels away from home. She aims to complete fourteen dives over four weeks, ensuring she has a rest day between each dive to avoid fatigue, which could affect her performance. When not training, she often makes public appearances to promote sports products and supports environmental organizations through research and film projects.

Growing up on the Caribbean island of Grand Cayman, Tanya spent her childhood swimming and exploring rock pools to observe sea life. She feels that her current life reflects her childhood dreams. Being well-known in some countries, she believes people listen to her when she discusses environmental issues. Looking ahead, Tanya, now in her thirties, plans to continue breaking her own world records. Since she started free-diving at the age of twenty-five, she is eager to emphasize that she does not plan to retire from the sport for many years."

Cartoon films have very few limits. If you can draw something, you can make it move on the screen. New ideas and advanced computer programs are making cartoons exciting for people of all ages. By the late 1970s, the film industry thought cartoons were only for children. However, soon after, a few directors had original ideas. They showed that it was possible to create films that both adults and children could enjoy together. Not every cartoon film was a success, though. For instance, *The Black Cauldron* did not do well because it was too scary for children and too silly for adults. Directors learned from this mistake, and film companies started to make a lot of money again."

Business can be enjoyable, it can be run with care, and it can have a positive impact. In both business and life, I want to feel joy, a sense of family, and excitement from the unexpected. I have always wanted the people who work for 'The Body Shop' to share these feelings.

Honey is a sweet liquid created by bees. It is made up of water and sugars. To produce just half a kilo of honey, bees can travel up to seventy-five thousand kilometers and visit over two million flowers. The color and taste of honey vary depending on the type of flower the bees visit. There are more than three hundred different types of honey. Generally, lighter-colored honey has a milder flavor compared to darker honey. 

In ancient times, honey was the main source of sweetness, as sugar was very rare. The ancient Egyptians valued honey highly and even used it as a form of payment. Today, honey is produced and consumed all over the world. Research indicates that honey can help reduce tiredness and enhance athletic performance. Additionally, honey is not only a food; it can also be used to soothe sore throats and is included in many skin and hair-care products."

Norwich is the capital of East Anglia, a region in Britain, and has been inhabited for over two thousand years. It started as a small village by the River Wensum. By the time of the Norman invasion in 1066, it had grown into one of the largest towns in England. Norwich has two cathedrals and a mosque, making it an important center for different religions. The first cathedral was built in 1095 and recently celebrated its 900th anniversary. In 1994, Norwich celebrated the 800th anniversary of receiving a Royal Charter, which allowed it to be called a city and to govern itself.

Today, Norwich is smaller than cities like London or Manchester, with a population of about 150,000. However, in the 16th century, it was the second city of England. For the next 300 years, it continued to grow and became wealthy, known for having as many churches as there are weeks in a year and as many pubs as there are days. Nowadays, there are fewer churches and pubs, but in 1964, the University of East Anglia was established in Norwich. With a growing student population and its role as a modern commercial center (it is the largest center for insurance services outside London), Norwich now offers a variety of entertainment options, including theatres, cinemas, nightclubs, busy cafes, excellent restaurants, and several arts and leisure centers. The city also has a football team known as 'The Canaries', which wears green and yellow, though the reason for the name is unclear.

One of the city's recent developments is a modern shopping center called 'The Castle Mall'. For over two years, the people of Norwich dealt with a large hole in the city as builders worked on the main car park. They moved nearly a million tons of earth to create a park on the roof of the Mall, complete with water features and many trees. The local community is happy that the old open market remains in the city center, next to the new development. Both areas continue to thrive, showing that Norwich has successfully combined the old and the new."

Every autumn, the sky above Albuquerque, a city in the southwestern United States, fills with bright colors. This is the Albuquerque Balloon Festival, an annual event that lasts for nine days. The first festival took place in 1972 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of a local radio station. It started with about twelve hot-air balloons taking off from a parking lot in the city. Since then, the festival has grown significantly.

This event is called a ""balloon glow,"" and it offers a great chance for taking beautiful photographs. To see the ""glows,"" you should arrive just after nightfall or before 5:30 AM, as the balloons rise into the dark sky. During the day, you can walk among the balloons and talk to the pilots as they prepare for take-off. The balloons come in various sizes and colors, some shaped like animals or cartoon characters, and even popular products like soft drinks and fast food. Children will enjoy it.

In the afternoon, you can experience a balloon flight over the desert by booking a ride with one of the many companies that offer this service. Another option is to take the cable car from the desert floor to the top of the nearby mountains, which is the longest ride of its kind, and enjoy a stunning view of the festival. There are many other attractions for visitors of all ages, including balloon races and fireworks on the opening night and the last three nights of the festival.

**The Albuquerque Box**

This is a local wind pattern that creates ideal conditions for balloonists. The Sandia Mountains protect the balloons from strong winds and create gentler wind currents at different heights. This allows skilled pilots to control the direction of their balloons by rising or descending.

**Practical Advice**

Buy your tickets in advance online to avoid long waits at the festival site. Wear several layers of thin clothing, as it can be cool at night and in the early morning, but during the day, sunglasses and sunscreen are necessary. Bring a flashlight for nighttime events and, of course, your camera. If you use film instead of digital photography, make sure to bring high-speed film for evening and nighttime photos."

Since it opened, the Eden Project in the south-west of England has become one of the UK's most popular tourist attractions. At first glance, the large 'biospheres' on this former industrial site resemble a scene from a science-fiction movie. Each biosphere represents a different climate zone, demonstrating the important relationship between people and plants. It is surprising to see how many everyday products come from plants, such as wood, rubber, fruit, rice, sugar, coffee, and chocolate. Over 135,000 different types of plants are grown here. No matter how cold it is outside, computer-controlled electric heaters maintain the right temperature for the plants. In the Rainforest Zone, the atmosphere is always humid due to a large waterfall. Another zone mimics the environment of the Mediterranean, California, and South Africa, and there are plans to create a desert zone in the near future."
PET_11,"Text: 'No Title Some people have expressed dissatisfaction with this year's collection, New Writing 3, but I find it hard to understand why. After all, 500 pages of original writing of this quality for £6.99 is quite impressive. The majority of the book consists of fiction, including both parts of novels and complete short stories. There are enjoyable contributions from well-known authors like Candia McWilliam and Rose Tremain. Interestingly, many lesser-known writers have focused on food in their pieces. For example, Jane Harris's Those Nails should definitely not be read right after meals, as it contains some very disturbing scenes! The collection also features excellent work from nineteen poets, including R. S. Thomas and John Burnside. Additionally, there are excerpts from novels-in-progress by Jim Crace and Jane Rogers. Lastly, there is a small amount of non-fiction, including a humorous article by Alan Rusbridger about certain newspapers and a remarkable piece by Ursula Owen about her own life. This is an outstanding collection, and I am eager to see what next year's edition will bring.'"

""The best age to start learning the violin is between three and six,"" says Margaret Porter, a violinist and music teacher. ""This is when children are discovering the world."" Margaret, who lives in London, usually teaches children who are three or four years old, but she has made exceptions for enthusiastic five-year-olds. When she began teaching the violin in 1972, her first class included her children's five-year-old friends.

Margaret's students have group lessons, with about twelve pupils in each group. Each lesson lasts one hour and takes place every two weeks. Additionally, each student has one individual lesson with her each week. Parents are also required to attend the classes, as it is important for them to be involved in their children's learning.

From the very first lessons, students learn to play by ear. They do not start reading music until they have been playing for several years, and there is often a noticeable difference between their playing and their ability to read music. Margaret explains that her teaching method is not designed to create expert violinists. She often advises students who excel to leave and pursue more traditional methods of learning the violin."
PET_56,"**Text: Moonshine**

The band Moonshine released their third CD last week. ""Here Again"" is a follow-up to their previous album, ""The Waves."" There have been some changes since the last CD: Tom Wilcott has joined as the new bass guitarist, replacing Simon McVee, who left the band last year. Additionally, Tom Simpson is now playing the drums.

From the first song, which is a dance track, it is clear that the band is shifting away from slow songs. The second song is also a dance track and is even louder and more energetic. Most of the later songs return to the band's usual slow style. These two dance tracks may surprise many fans, but either could easily become a hit single because they are excellent. 

Singer Rob Letchford showcases his talent by hitting every note perfectly. Fans should appreciate that he recorded these songs before experiencing throat issues, which led to the cancellation of their upcoming tour. However, anyone who has bought tickets need not worry, as all concerts will be rescheduled once Rob has recovered.

On this CD, Moonshine demonstrates their ability to create great music in various styles, from the familiar slow songs to lively tracks that make you want to dance. I did feel that they placed their best songs at the beginning, and the last few tracks were not quite as strong. Nevertheless, ""Here Again"" is sure to be a big hit and will bring more success to the band."

San Francisco is located on the northern California coast. The first Europeans to find this area were led by a Spanish explorer named Gaspar de Portola, who saw it for the first time in 1769. Interestingly, San Francisco Bay, which is a beautiful natural harbor, was discovered by land instead of by sea. 

In 1849, many people came to San Francisco hoping to find gold. However, it was not the gold seekers who became wealthy. The richest individuals were those who owned banks and law firms, and they built large houses on a hill known as Nob Hill. 

Today, San Francisco attracts many tourists who want to see famous sites like Chinatown and the Golden Gate Bridge. Many visitors also take a short boat trip to Alcatraz Island to visit the former prison there."

The most famous diary in English was written by Samuel Pepys. It provides a detailed and engaging account of daily life in England from 1660 to 1669. Pepys discusses significant events of the time, such as diseases, an enemy navy sailing up the River Thames, and the Great Fire of London. He also shares personal stories, including his own flaws—like often falling asleep in church or admiring pretty girls. He describes his home life, including arguments with his wife and how they reconciled, as well as his concerns about her health. In addition to reading, he enjoyed music, theatre, card games, and lively parties with good food. Pepys was a busy man with many important roles; he served as a Member of Parliament and was the President of the Royal Society. He is also remembered for his contributions to the British Navy."
PET_33,"**The History of Shoes**

In the past, people did not focus on shoes being comfortable or stylish. Early shoes were likely made from animal skins, which people tied around their ankles to keep warm. Today, we still use leather, but other materials like silk, plastic, and cotton are also common, depending on current trends. It was only about one hundred and fifty years ago that people started wearing different shoes for each foot. Before that, shoes were straight and could be worn on either foot. All shoes were handmade in the past, but now, while some shoemakers still use traditional methods, most shoes are made by machines in large factories. The invention of sewing machines allowed the shoe industry to produce many more affordable shoes for a larger number of customers."

When I hurt my back, I had to stop running for a while. I wanted to help more women get involved in the sport, to show them how enjoyable it can be and to help them feel confident enough to run. I decided to start a running club for women in my area because I was frustrated with how some race organisers think. They often say there are not enough women in running, but they also use this as a reason not to provide separate changing rooms.

I put up posters, and 40 women of different ages and fitness levels joined. Most of them were interested in losing weight, but I don't think they had considered running before. If they did, they imagined it as painful training. They didn’t think about the fun of chatting and smiling while running in beautiful places, like by a river. At first, they could only run for one minute, but now they can run for thirty minutes. They have also learned about diet and fitness from other runners. I wanted to support women's running, and it has been a joy to see their progress—almost as much as they have enjoyed it themselves."
PET_40,"**THE HISTORY OF THE IDITAROD - THE LAST GREAT RACE ON EARTH**

In the 1880s, gold was found in Alaska, the northernmost state in the USA. Many people moved there hoping to become rich. New towns were quickly built, including one called Iditarod, which means 'far, distant place'. In 1909, Iditarod grew so fast that it briefly became the largest city in Alaska. 

During the summer, supplies could be brought to these towns by boat. However, in winter, the rivers and ocean froze, making it impossible to reach them. To solve this problem, a winter trail was created in 1910 for dog teams pulling sleds. They delivered mail, food, and clothing to gold miners. This trail became known as the Iditarod Trail. It took about three weeks for a team of dogs to travel across Alaska, stopping at 'roadhouses' where drivers could find a warm bed and food for themselves and their dogs.

The trail was used every winter until the 1920s when airplanes replaced boats and dog teams as the main transport. However, in 1925, the dogs gained fame again when a disease called diphtheria struck the city of Nome. The disease could be treated, but the nearest medicine was in Anchorage, on the other side of Alaska. Airplanes were still new, and it was uncertain if they could fly in such cold weather. The only skilled pilot, Carl Eielson, was away at that time. Therefore, it was decided to transport the medicine using dog teams.

The journey covered over 1,000 kilometers, mostly along the Iditarod Trail. Twenty teams completed the trip in just six days. Leonhard Seppala, a Norwegian who had come to Alaska for gold, traveled the first 400 kilometers. He relied on his dog Togo to guide him through the blinding snow, and Togo proved to be a dependable guide. The final part of the journey was completed by Gunnar Kaasen, who had driven dog teams in Alaska for 21 years. His lead dog was Saito. At one point, Balto, another dog, refused to go further, preventing the team from falling into icy water. The diphtheria outbreak was stopped, and Balto became a hero.

Today, a dog sled race is held every year from Anchorage to Nome, following the route of that famous journey in 1925. This race is called the Iditarod and is known as 'The Last Great Race on Earth'."
PET_45,"**Sweden's Ice Hotel**

The village of Jukkasjarvi is located in Swedish Lapland, where winter temperatures can drop to -40°C. Despite the cold, around 6,000 tourists visit each year to experience one of Europe’s most unique hotels. In this hotel, everything is made of ice—you eat, drink, and sleep in ice rooms. You can even have a wedding there. The bar is also made of ice, so it’s not a good idea to place hot drinks on it! The bedrooms are kept at about -4°C, but guests receive special sleeping bags to keep warm in the cold. If needed, they can also get suitable outdoor clothing. The hotel lasts for only six months because it melts in the summer, and every winter, it is rebuilt. Building the hotel requires 10,000 tonnes of ice and 30,000 tonnes of snow."
PET_29,"**Text: Maria Mutola**

In 1988, Maria Mutola was the only girl on an all-boys football team in a local competition in Mozambique. ""We won,"" she said. ""At first, no one thought it was a problem that I was a girl. But then the team we beat complained."" This story was published in a local newspaper, and Jose Craveirinha, who supported African athletes, learned about Maria. He went to meet her and saw her kicking a ball outside the football club. He quickly realized she was very fast. 

""He talked to me about athletics. I didn’t understand what he meant. The only sport I knew was football. Then he bought me running shoes and took me to train. It was very hard work, and my legs hurt a lot."" Jose spoke to her parents and convinced them that she could be successful, which would help improve their financial situation. They agreed to let him take her to train.

In 1991, she accepted an invitation to train in the United States. She had previously refused because she was worried about missing her family. Her background was different from the girls she met in the US. She said, ""They were good athletes, but while I worried about my parents having enough to eat, they worried about dresses and make-up. They knew very little about me and even less about my problems. But I knew I was lucky to be there. The trainers were excellent, and I learned a lot.""

Today, Maria still runs and spends most of the year happily living in South Africa with her mother."

The Grand Canyon in the United States was formed by the Colorado River. Many people visit Grand Canyon Park to walk, run, and, most importantly, to enjoy the stunning views. One of the highlights is the Skywalk, which enhances the already beautiful scenery. The Skywalk is 1,219 meters above the bottom of the Grand Canyon. It is a platform made of glass, allowing visitors to see the magnificent rocks below. Up to 120 people can stand on it at the same time. The Skywalk opened in 2007, and since then, thousands of visitors have experienced it. To protect the glass surface, you must wear special shoe covers. Walking on the Skywalk gives you the sensation of soaring like a bird high in the sky."

The Rocky Mountains stretch nearly the entire length of North America. They begin in the Northwest but are also found a few hundred miles from the center in more southern regions. Although the Rockies are not as tall as the Alps, they are equally impressive. There are many roads that cross the Rockies, but the best way to experience them is by train. 

You can start your journey from Vancouver, which is one of Canada's most beautiful cities. This city is unique because it is close to both the ocean and the mountains, allowing residents to ski just 15 minutes by car from downtown. 

In the past, thirty passenger trains left Vancouver each day for the cross-continent railway. Now, there are only three trains a week, but the journey remains an exciting adventure. You can sleep on the train, which is enjoyable, but you will see some of the most stunning scenery at night."
PET_42,"**Text: Zoos**

People have kept animals in zoos for over 3,000 years, starting with a large zoo in China called the Gardens of Intelligence. In the past, animals were trained to perform for visitors, but this practice has stopped. Now, the main purpose of zoos is to allow people to see animals in their natural behavior. Most cities today have a zoo or wildlife park.

However, opinions about zoos vary. Supporters believe that zoos help us learn about nature and allow us to see wild animals up close, which would not be possible otherwise. On the other hand, some people oppose zoos. They argue that it is wrong to confine animals in cages and point out that poorly managed zoos can have dirty conditions and provide unsuitable food for the animals."
PET_59,"**JAZZ**  
By Katie Atkins, aged 14  

I play the trumpet in my school jazz band. Last month, we held a jazz competition with bands from local high schools, and our band won! Each band had their own costumes, from black school uniforms like my band wore to brightly-colored T-shirts. We may not have looked like professional adult bands, but we were all experienced in competitions, so the quality of our playing was impressive, especially considering our age. Players from each band even created new tunes right on stage. It was exciting to watch, but even better when my band performed!  

Our school has a fantastic jazz band, but not everyone who wants to join gets accepted—only about half of the applicants. However, anyone eager to play can attend jazz practice before school, and we often spend time together after school, listening to jazz and learning about it. We also go on trips to jazz summer camps across the country. I have attended a couple and learned a lot.  

Adults are often surprised that young people are interested in jazz. My music teacher believes this is because pop music is not challenging enough for serious musicians like me. I find jazz exciting because it feels both new and old at the same time. You can create your own music while also feeling connected to its history, as you perform on stage like the great jazz artists before you. My school is fortunate to have excellent teachers and supportive parents. Without them, we would not progress in our music!"
PET_54,"**Text: Watering the Desert**

In Marrakesh, Morocco, it can rain anytime from November to March. However, rain is not common, and when it does occur, the city's water pipes often cannot handle the sudden floods, causing the streets to become like rivers. Many winters have been dry recently, so when rain finally arrives, the local people appreciate it. 

The parks and gardens in Marrakesh do not rely on rain; instead, they benefit from a system of underground channels built in the 11th century. These channels bring water from the mountains throughout the year. Areas that are mostly dry but receive water this way are called oases. 

Traveling further south from Marrakesh, one reaches Skoura. In Skoura, every piece of land is divided into small squares by water channels, which are used to grow food. The snow-covered Atlas Mountains in winter create a beautiful backdrop."

Gareth Ellis, 13, is the youngest son of Alan, an engineer, and Kath, a nursery teacher. His older brothers work in banking and computers, but Gareth has always dreamed of being a clown. Three years ago, Alan, Kath, and Gareth joined a circus. ""People laugh when we tell them,"" says Kath. ""But it's true. Gareth has wanted to be a clown since we took him to the circus when he was three."" 

When Alan lost his job, he and Kath decided to look for full-time jobs in the circus. They both found work with a well-known circus, and Gareth started training to become a clown. He calls himself Bippo. They travel with the circus in the summer and return home in the winter. Gareth's brothers are old enough to take care of the house while they are away. 

""I can't say it was easy,"" says Kath. ""There was a lot to think about and organize. We only had a car and a very small caravan to sleep in, and we were leaving behind our nice house. The only thing Gareth missed was his long, hot baths."" 

""People ask about my education,"" says Gareth, ""but from the start, wherever we go, someone has always come to teach me. I use the same books as everyone back at school, and I have a computer. I've never fallen behind my classmates."" 

And what about the future? ""It was a tough decision,"" says Kath, ""but there was no other way to teach Gareth about being a clown. I'm happy to say it's working, and we're enjoying it."" And Gareth? ""I'm going to be the main clown in a circus one day,"" he says, ""maybe Bippo's circus."""

Eight-eighteen News is a news agency designed for young people aged 8 to 18. We gather news and write reports, stories, and articles. These are sent to major national and local newspapers, magazines, television, radio, and websites for publication. You can read or listen to the news stories and articles created by our members on the Eight-eighteen website.

We have three centers across the country where young people can meet others and participate in projects, and we plan to open more centers nationwide. Since our agency began in 1994, originally called 'Young News', over 2,500 young people have joined. Sophie is one of them. She says, ""I first learned about Eight-eighteen when they interviewed me for an article about young people's views on hip hop music. I was in a room with young journalists and was impressed by the opportunities they had. Age didn’t matter; they were trusted to handle stories independently. I started attending the Eight-eighteen center in my city, received training, and remained a member until I turned 18. Eight-eighteen helped me achieve more than I expected. With the skills I gained, I got a job at 19 and am now the youngest employee at a major news website, where I check articles written by journalists before they are published online.""

**Get Involved at Every Level**

When you join Eight-eighteen, you will receive training and participate in monthly meetings to decide who will write each news story. Eight-eighteen promotes skill-sharing among members. 'Peer trainers' are experienced members aged 12 and older who train new members and teach them basic journalism skills. As they gain more experience, some members present sessions to audiences of young people and adults outside of Eight-eighteen, often at youth clubs and summer camps. These young trainers are always supported by older staff who accompany them on these outings.

Eight-eighteen News holds training sessions for new members three times a year. Our next training for new members will be in February. If you or someone you know is interested in joining, please call Director Den Ley at 01622 657874 for more information. The Eight-eighteen program is suitable for children with reading and writing skills at all levels. Membership is free, and there is no test to join."
PET_28,"**Antarctica Sightseeing Flights Website**

Welcome to our website! Here, you will find all the information you need before booking a flight. During the short summer in Antarctica, we offer sightseeing flights from Sydney, Australia, on a Boeing 747. The exact flight dates for next year are not confirmed yet, but if you book now, your deposit can be transferred if we need to change the date.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**How long is the flight?**  
The average flight lasts 12 hours. About four hours into the journey, we usually see the first sea ice and icebergs. We spend four hours flying over Antarctica and the rest of the time returning home. During the flight, experts who have worked in Antarctic research stations will give talks about the environment and history, and they will answer your questions. There is a camera next to the pilot that is connected to the video system on board, providing a view from take-off to landing.

**Will I get a seat next to a window?**  
All passengers receive two boarding passes. At the halfway point of the flight, you will be asked to move to the seat indicated on your second boarding pass. Business and first-class passengers will have a window seat for half of the flight and a seat next to a window for the other half. Economy passengers will have either a window seat or a seat next to a window for half of the flight and an end-of-row seat for the other half. While flying over Antarctica, we encourage passengers to get up and move around the plane so everyone can enjoy the views. The pilot will fly in long 'figure 8s' over interesting sights to ensure that both sides of the plane have a good view.

**What happens if the weather is bad?**  
We have 17 different approved flight plans. On the morning of the flight, our captain will check the satellite cloud images and choose the direction that offers the clearest views.

**Will I see penguins and other wildlife?**  
Most Antarctic wildlife lives at sea level, which is over 3,000 meters below the plane, so we cannot see them in detail. We do not land in Antarctica for environmental reasons. If you want to see Antarctic wildlife, you would need to join a boat tour.

**Can I take photographs?**  
Absolutely! All cameras are welcome. We even offer some fun photo opportunities on board where you can try on Antarctic cold weather clothing."

For a group of children aged ten to fifteen, Saturdays are dedicated to learning serious cooking. Their weekly lessons in small classes are so popular that there is a waiting list of 30 children wanting to join. Parents pay £280 for the course, where their children can have fun and learn to make good food. 

Bill, who is ten, says, ""I love my mum's cooking, and now I can do it better than her. The teachers make us laugh, especially when we sit down to share the food we've made."" 

Flora, who is twelve, has some trouble with onions. She says, ""I love cooking. I made a meal for ten friends, and they really enjoyed it. My mum suggested I find a hobby instead of doing nothing on weekends. I was happy at home, so I wasn't very interested at first. But I'm really glad I decided to come."" 

Their teacher, Philippe, says, ""It's great fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, even if the kitchen isn't always tidy when they cook! As adults, we keep learning more about food. If parents get their children interested in cooking when they are young, they will have the skills to cook for themselves when they leave home."""
PET_5,"**Winter Driving**

Winter can be dangerous because it is hard to predict what will happen, and accidents can happen easily. Fog may appear suddenly over a hill. Ice can be hidden under melting snow, ready to cause you to lose control. A car coming towards you might slide unexpectedly across the road.

**Rule Number One** for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly. Sudden movements can make it hard to control your car. When you turn the wheel, brake, or speed up, do it gently and slowly. Imagine you are driving with a full cup of hot coffee next to you; drive carefully so you don’t spill it.

**Rule Number Two** is to be aware of what could happen. The more ice there is, the further ahead you should look. Test how long it takes to stop by braking gently. Remember, you might be driving faster than you think. Generally, allow double your normal stopping distance on wet roads, three times this distance on snow, and even more on ice. Try to keep control of your car at all times to avoid problems."
PET_41,"**Craigie Aitchison**

Craigie Aitchison was a painter from Scotland. He moved to London with the plan to study law, but instead, he went to art school. He found the traditional drawing classes challenging, but he continued to paint. In his late twenties, the Italian government funded his art studies, and he became interested in early Italian artists, which is reflected in some of his artwork. He loved the greens and browns of the Italian countryside and the bright light there, and he wanted to capture this light in his paintings. 

To achieve this, he painted colors in thin layers from light to dark, but he admits he is never certain about the final outcome. He explains, ""It's a secret - because I don't know myself. I don't start by painting yellow, knowing I'm going to put anything on top."" Like many talented artists, Aitchison makes it seem easy. He says, ""Anyone can do the colors - you can buy them. I just pay attention to what colors are next to each other.""

Unlike some artists, he does not create sketches before starting a painting because he believes that doing so might make him lose interest in the painting. Instead, Aitchison often changes his paintings multiple times before they are complete. This is why he prefers to work with models who do not ask to see their portraits while he is painting. He states, ""If I feel they're worried and want to look at the painting, I can't do it.""

Since moving to London, Aitchison has not felt connected to the Scottish art scene. He claims he is not interested in following any artistic tradition; he simply paints in his own way. Nevertheless, his work continues to inspire young British painters."
PET_38,"**Text: Rock Band**

Two years ago, our 14-year-old son, Ben, asked us for a drum set for his birthday. At first, we were against it because we worried about the noise. Ben argued, ""It's better than watching TV or playing video games in my free time, and it will keep me out of trouble."" In the end, we agreed. We said, ""Okay, but you need to think about the rest of the family and the neighbors when you play.""

That was just the start. Since drums are hard to move, Ben's band members began coming to our house with their guitars and other equipment. Now, for several hours each week, our house shakes with their music and singing. At least Ben's hobby has been good for our health: whenever the band practices, my husband and I go for a long walk. 

I must admit that, even though their music can sound a bit strange, they are a friendly and polite group of young men. I cannot judge their musical talent; after all, I didn't expect my parents to like the same music I enjoyed as a teenager. They do perform regularly in local clubs for young people. 

Our main concern is that they might not spend enough time on their schoolwork because of their music, but this has not happened yet. I always remind Ben how important his studies are. One thing is clear: Ben was right; playing music has kept him out of trouble and he is never bored."
PET_17,"**Text: Atlantic College**

Last week, I visited Atlantic College, a great private college in Wales. Uniquely, it provides young people with valuable experiences outside the classroom, along with the chance to prepare for their exams. The students, aged 16 to 18 and from various countries, study in the morning. In the afternoon, they participate in meaningful activities, such as helping on a farm, caring for individuals with learning difficulties, or checking for pollution in rivers.

One of the remarkable aspects of Atlantic College is its diverse student body, which comes from different social backgrounds and countries. Since many students cannot afford the £20,000 fees for two years, financial aid is available. About 25% of the students are British, and many of them can only attend because they receive government support.

""I really admire the college for promoting international understanding among young people,"" said Barbara Molenkamp, a student from the Netherlands. ""You learn to live with and respect others, even those you may not like. During the summer holidays, my mother noticed that I argued much less with my sister.""

In conclusion, Atlantic College provides an excellent education through effective methods."
PET_47,"**Text: Being an Older Student**

At 32 years old, I have just completed my first year at university. In addition to attending lectures regularly, I have had to learn to read books quickly and write long essays. I decided to go to university after being away from school for fourteen years. As a secretary, I earned a decent salary, but I felt bored because my job did not require much thinking. This made me increasingly unhappy, as I felt trapped in my job. I envied the students at the local university, who seemed happy, carefree, and full of hope, and I wanted to be part of that experience.

Now that I am a student, I find it challenging to connect with younger classmates. They often mistake me for a lecturer and ask me questions I cannot answer. I also feel distant from the lecturers because, even though we are the same age, I know much less than they do. However, I am grateful for this chance to study because I understand that having a qualification is important for getting a good job, which matters a lot to me. Unlike most eighteen-year-olds, I prefer spending my weekends studying rather than going out to parties. I also enjoy the typical student benefits, like long holidays and discounts for theaters and cinemas. I often worry about what I will do after university, but I hope that continuing my education at this stage in my life is a smart decision."

Henry Ford was born in 1863 on a farm in Michigan, but he did not enjoy farming. At the age of fifteen, he started working as a mechanic, and in 1893, he created his first car. After driving it for 1,500 kilometers, he sold it and then built two larger cars. In 1903, he founded the Ford Motor Company. By using strong yet lightweight steel, he produced affordable cars for everyday people. In 1908, he introduced the first Ford Model 'T', which was priced at $825. Soon, he was selling 100 cars each day. By 1927, the Ford Motor Company was valued at $700 million. Early Ford cars were simple and inexpensive, but this simplicity sometimes meant fewer options. Henry Ford famously said about the Model T, ""You can have any color you like, as long as it's black."""

Rebecca Stevens was the first woman to climb Mount Everest. Before this achievement, she worked as a journalist and lived in a small flat in south London. In 1993, Rebecca decided to leave her job and family to travel to Asia with other climbers. She discovered that life on Everest is very challenging. ""You must carry everything on your back,"" she said, ""so you can only take what you really need. You can't wash on the mountain, and in the end, I didn't even take a toothbrush. I usually like to stay clean, but there is no water, only snow. Water is very heavy, so you only take enough to drink!""

When Rebecca reached the summit of Mount Everest on May 17, 1993, it was the happiest moment of her life. Suddenly, she became famous. She has since written a book about her journey, and people often invite her to speak about it. She also has a new job on a science program on television. Although Rebecca is well-known now and has more money, she still lives in her small flat in south London, surrounded by her pictures and books about mountains!"

I’m sorry you couldn’t come to my party yesterday. Jon told me you had a bad cold and chose to stay in bed. Are you feeling better now? It was a great party; the best I’ve ever had! Many of my friends were there, and they gave me some wonderful presents. I will tell you more about the party when you come to school on Monday.

KET_13,"**Text: CANADA GEESE**

Canada Geese are large birds with blue and white feathers. When autumn comes, they must fly south to find warmer weather. The winters in Canada are very cold, and the birds would not survive if they stayed there. Last spring, Bill Lishman discovered sixteen young Canada Geese on his farm. They had lost their parents. Bill thought, ""These young birds will not know how to migrate in the autumn."" 

Bill owned a small plane and decided to teach the geese to follow him. Throughout the summer, he took short flights in his plane, and the young geese followed him. When autumn arrived and the weather turned cold, Bill flew to Virginia in the United States, which is 600 miles south of his home in Canada. The geese followed him all the way.

After reaching Virginia, Bill left the geese there and returned home. This spring, he waited for the birds to come back, but they did not arrive. So, Bill flew back to Virginia to find them. He searched for two weeks but could not locate them. When he returned home, he was surprised to find the geese waiting for him. They had managed to find their way home on their own!"
KET_16,"**Esther's Story**

When Esther finished school at sixteen, her aunt Flory gave her £500 for her birthday. While most of Esther's friends chose to go to college, Esther decided to use her aunt's money to start her own business. She bought fruit, sugar, and glass jars to make jam. She sold the jam for £1 per jar to her friends and quickly doubled her aunt's £500.

At first, Esther's parents were not supportive of her decision. They wanted her to focus on studying and hoped she would become a teacher or a doctor. However, Esther ignored their advice and continued making jam. After a few months, she began selling her jam at the local market. She also started making orange juice, which she sold to a school where a friend worked.

After two years, her business grew significantly, and her parents were proud of her. She produced various types of food and sold them to shops and supermarkets. She became so busy that she needed to hire some employees to help her."

KET_46,"**Corryvale Farm**

Corryvale Farm is located in the west of England. Stephen and Jenny Blackler raise cows and chickens and sell milk and eggs. However, most of their income comes from Jenny's sheep. She has 50 sheep, and each sheep produces enough wool for six sweaters. Every six months, Stephen shears the wool from the sheep to keep them comfortable.

Five years ago, Jenny made some sweaters from the wool and tried to sell them at local markets. Unfortunately, it was summer, and the hot weather meant people were not interested in buying sweaters. Instead, she decided to make socks. Everyone loved the socks because they were affordable, durable, and easy to clean. This is how Jenny's business began.

At first, she made the socks at home, but soon she gained thousands of customers. As a result, she had to send the wool to a factory, where machines now produce all the socks. There are six colors, five sizes for all ages, and different types of socks for walkers, athletes, and skiers. Jenny is especially busy during Christmas because Corryvale socks are a popular gift. In her office, she has many letters from satisfied customers from around the world."

KET_10,"**Text: 'BURGLARS PREFER THE AFTERNOON'**

Most house burglaries occur between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m., according to the police. Inspector Ian Saunders informed our newspaper that the number of burglaries has increased by over 30% compared to last year. He mentioned that 67% of burglaries happen when people leave their homes and forget to lock a door or a window. He also noted that burglaries at night are rare because families are usually at home during that time. However, winter afternoons are ideal for burglars since it gets dark, making it harder for them to be seen. Many houses are often empty during this time because people are still at work.

Inspector Saunders suggested that it is wise to leave lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when going on holiday, as this can deter burglars. He also encouraged neighbors to keep an eye on each other's homes when someone is away and to call the police if they notice anything suspicious. ""We will also provide advice on how to secure your home,"" Inspector Saunders said. ""This assistance is free of charge."""

KET_44,"**Text: The History of Farming**

Before farming began, people searched forests for plants and fruits to eat. This meant they had to move constantly to find food. However, around 12,000 years ago, in the Middle East, people started to grow their own food. These individuals were the first farmers. Farming allowed people to settle in one place, leading to the growth of larger villages. As a result, some villagers could focus on other jobs, like making clothes, because farmers provided food for everyone. Unfortunately, farming could be challenging, especially during bad weather, which sometimes left people without enough food. Today, farmers can produce more food, which can travel thousands of kilometers to reach our homes."

""My office is at Heathrow Airport, but I spend 60% of my time in the air. I train flight attendants and assist them with any issues. I also attend many meetings. My working hours are usually from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., but sometimes I work from 1 p.m. to 9 p.m. At work, the first thing I do is check flight schedules on my computer, and then I talk with some of the flight attendants. Occasionally, I go on long flights to see how the flight attendants are performing. That is my favorite part of the job, but I also enjoy office work. Traveling can be tiring. When I return from a long trip, all I want to do is eat something and then go to bed! I don’t earn a lot of money, but I am happy with British Airways and want to stay there and keep traveling."""

In the past, farmers spent a lot of time observing the sky, animals, and plants to understand the weather better. Nowadays, there are many computer programs that help us learn about the weather, and people can even access weather information on their mobile phones. Despite this, many people still hold onto traditional beliefs about the weather. For example, some say that a red sky in the evening means it will be sunny the next day.

Like their other friends, they enjoy fishing and swimming on weekends. However, for the past few months, they have spent every weekend in Peter's room working on his laptop. This is not because they have a lot of homework. Instead, they have created a new computer word game. The idea for the game came from Frazer's younger brother, Kevin, who struggles with reading. Kevin learns words more easily by seeing pictures and hearing sounds than by reading text. His brother wanted to help him. Frazer and Peter worked together for over 200 hours to develop this computer game, which is now ready to use. It is a speaking and picture game. For example, when you see the word 'hat', there is a drawing of a hat next to it, and you can hear Peter saying 'Hat! Hat!' at the same time. The two boys have won many awards for their game, and it will soon be available for sale worldwide. Many schools are interested in purchasing it.'"

Staying active is also essential. Before my car accident, I spent two and a half hours at the sports center five days a week. Now, I can't do that, so I do about 150 sit-ups each day. I do not drink alcohol or smoke, and I try to eat healthily. I also drink a lot of water because it is beneficial for health.

Bollywood is the name of the film industry in Mumbai, India, and it produces nearly 1,000 films each year. Since its first film in 1913, Bollywood has created over 29,000 films, making it the largest film industry in the world, far surpassing the USA. Watching films is the most popular leisure activity for many Indians, with ten million people visiting cinemas daily. 

Bollywood films often focus on romantic love stories, and they include a lot of singing and dancing. These films are also popular outside of India. Last year, Bollywood earned over $500 million by selling its films to other countries. 

Indian actors produce more films each year than American actors in Hollywood, but they earn less money. This is why most Bollywood films have a production cost of about $2 million, while Hollywood films typically cost at least $5 million. Most Bollywood actors are young and work hard, but their careers usually last only a few years. Amitabh Bachchan, often regarded as India's greatest actor, is an exception. He has starred in more than 140 films over a career that has lasted nearly 40 years."

Most smaller Schnauzers are grey, while the Giant Schnauzer is typically black.

Today, we see police officers everywhere, but in 1700, London had no police force. A few elderly men tried to protect the streets at night, but they were not paid well. Around 300 years ago, London was growing larger. The city was very dirty, and many people lived in poverty. There were many thieves who stole money in the streets, which made people stay at home as much as possible.

In 1750, Henry Fielding began to pay a group of individuals to catch thieves. They were similar to police officers and were known as the 'Bow Street Runners' because they operated near Bow Street. Fifty years later, there were 120 Bow Street Runners, but London had expanded significantly and required more police. Therefore, in 1829, the first Metropolitan Police Force was established with 3,000 officers. Most of these men patrolled on foot, while a few rode horses. Until 1920, all police officers in London were men. Today, London police officers are paid fairly well, and those who still ride horses earn even higher salaries than their colleagues."

If you drive north from Toronto for three hours, you will reach Lake Nipissing. In winter, the lake freezes, and many Canadian fishermen go there every weekend. They build small wooden houses on the ice and paint them in bright colors. Inside these houses, they fish for the fish swimming beneath the ice. Bob Marvisch has been coming here for twenty-five years during this season. 

""You need to wear clothes that are light but warm: two pairs of socks, gloves, several thin sweaters, and a snow suit on top,"" he explains. ""Catching fish is easy. First, you break the ice to make a small round hole. Then, you take a fishing line, put some bread on it, and lower it through the hole into the water. You pull the line up when the fish eat the bread. The fish are usually between ten and twenty centimeters long.

Last summer, I went to Thailand for a beach holiday with my family. One day, we visited a park near our hotel. The park had beautiful flower gardens, but we were mainly interested in the elephant show. We went directly to a large area with seats on three sides. Three elephants entered with their keepers and stood in front of a big piece of white card. Each elephant was given a paintbrush and began to paint on its own card. Occasionally, the keepers would give a new brush filled with paint to each elephant and take the old one away. Slowly, following their keepers' instructions, the elephants created pictures on the cards. I couldn't believe my eyes! One picture showed a river, another a tree, and the third a bunch of flowers. When the keepers displayed the paintings, everyone wanted to buy one. We also gave the elephants the bananas we had brought for our lunch. Twenty years ago, elephants worked in the forest. Now, they no longer work there, but the smartest of these animals live in special centers where visitors can watch them."

There are many types of cats, and they vary in size, appearance, and behavior. Tigers are the largest cats, measuring up to 3.7 meters from head to tail. While most cats avoid water, tigers often enjoy lying in pools when it is hot. Lions are unique because they live in large family groups. These groups often work together to hunt for food.

Here is a photo of me in my new uniform. Do you like it? 

Best,

KET_20,"**THE OSTRICH**

The ostrich is the largest bird in the world, with adults weighing over 90 kilograms. Most wild ostriches are found in southern Africa, but their numbers are low. Like all birds, ostriches have wings, but they cannot fly. They use their wings to help them change direction while running. Ostriches can run very fast, reaching speeds of 65 to 90 kilometers per hour, making it hard for predators to catch them. Baby ostriches are about the same size as chickens and take around 3 years to grow into adults. They eat plants and can survive for many days without water."
KET_40,"Text: Victoria Jamieson, a 23-year-old snowboarder from Britain, began snowboarding at the age of 20. She has achieved success in many competitions. Recently, we interviewed her at a snowboarding event in Switzerland and asked why she chose this sport. She explained, ""I have always enjoyed various sports, especially skiing, so it felt natural to try snowboarding. It’s easy to learn, and you can become quite skilled in just a few months.""

When we inquired about her practice routine, she shared, ""In winter, I snowboard in the mountains every day from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. I also enjoy running and biking. I truly love all of it! Competing and being in the mountains is wonderful. However, free-riding—doing what you want outside of competitions—is the best part for me.""

We also asked her what is essential for beginners. She replied, ""You can learn quickly, but taking lessons is important. Having the right clothing is crucial too, so you stay dry, especially since you will fall a lot at first!"""

Dear Sir or Madam,  

I would like to book a room at your hotel for three nights, from September 15th to 17th. I prefer a single room with a shower and a telephone. Could you please arrange for a quiet room on the ground floor? I will be driving to the hotel. Is there a parking area available? I expect to arrive around 10:30 p.m. What time does the restaurant close in the evening? If possible, I would appreciate a meal upon my arrival. Thank you for your assistance.  

Yours faithfully,

KET_64,"**Text: Mount Kilimanjaro**

Mount Kilimanjaro is the tallest mountain in Africa. Many people have successfully climbed it, including a seven-year-old boy and an 87-year-old man. There are several routes to the summit. The Marangu route, which is five kilometers long, is considered the easiest and takes about five days to complete. It is very popular among tourists. However, only half of those who attempt to climb Kilimanjaro reach the summit. This is often due to sudden changes in weather. At the start of the climb, it can be hot and rainy, but at the top, climbers encounter ice and snow, with temperatures possibly dropping below 20 degrees Celsius. Therefore, climbers should pack both sunglasses and warm clothing!"
KET_29,"**Text: Otters**

Not many people have seen an otter. These animals live near rivers and build their homes using small pieces of wood. They usually come out at night. Otters are excellent swimmers and can swim faster than 10 kilometers per hour. They have thick brown fur that keeps them warm in the water. An otter can close its ears and nose, allowing it to stay underwater for several minutes. 

Twenty years ago, there were very few otters in Great Britain. The rivers were so polluted that many fish and insects died, leaving otters without food. However, today there is plenty of food for them because the rivers have become clean again."
KET_57,"Dear Deshini,

I am happy to have you as my new penfriend. My name is Tom, and I am fifteen years old. I was born in Canada, but I now live in England. Please write to me and share about your life in India. I would love to visit there someday. Do you live in a small village or a big town? What is your school like? If you have any pictures of your school, could you send them to me? I am including a few photos of my family with this letter. I will send more next time I write. I hope to hear from you soon.

Best,

Dear John,

Thank you for helping me with my English. You are a great teacher. I enjoyed my time in Cambridge. Now, I am staying at my brother's apartment. He is studying to become a doctor. I will stay with him for two weeks and then return home to Greece. I really like London. Yesterday, we took a bus to Regents Park. It was very sunny, and we had a wonderful time. Tonight, I will watch a film with my brother and some of his friends. I will write again from Greece.

Best wishes,

Dear David,

Next month, I will visit your country with two friends. We are unsure about where to stay. Are there any affordable hotels in your town? We would prefer to stay in the city center. Can you assist us?

Carlos

Dear Carlos,

Hotels in the center can be costly, but I have some good news. I talked to my aunt Gloria, and she said you can all stay at her house. It has more bedrooms than my house! That will be fine for you, right?

KET_59,"**Text: Buildings**

People have always created buildings. We need houses to keep us warm and dry, and we build stadiums to watch football matches and concerts. Other buildings, like museums, are used to display beautiful items. Many people work together on a building project. The architect decides how the building will look and creates drawings to share their ideas. Engineers ensure that the building is strong and safe. Then, workers carefully construct it. 

The Sydney Opera House is a well-known modern building with a stunning roof. However, the building is beautiful from all angles, not just from above. Another famous structure is the Olympic Stadium in Munich, which has a unique roof that resembles a glass tent."

I don't have a lot of money, but I think it will be enough. Would you prefer to meet in the morning or the afternoon? Please let me know. Sarika"""
KET_32,"Text: 'The Cerne Giant

Sherborne and Dorchester are two towns in southern England that are close to each other. Between them, there are many green hills and fields. On one of these hills, there is a large figure of a man. This figure is called the Cerne Giant because the nearby village is named Cerne. The exact date when the Cerne Giant was created is unknown, but it is believed to be very old. You can walk from Cerne to get closer to the figure. If you visit on the first of May at sunrise, you will see the villagers dancing around the giant on the hill.'"
KET_61,"**Text: Gail Rollins**

Gail Rollins is one of the best runners in Edinburgh. This summer, she plans to compete in the 10,000 metres and possibly the 5,000 metres at the European Championships. In the past, Gail was known for finishing second in major competitions. However, she always smiled and laughed, which made her popular in her hometown. Everything changed in 2004 when she participated in her first half-marathon, a long road race. She won with an impressive time, the fastest of any British woman that year.

Gail's manager and husband, Mike Rollins, used to race when he was younger, but he had to stop due to an injury to his right leg. He can still run a little and sometimes trains with Gail, but it’s not enjoyable for him when she runs ahead and he cannot keep up. Gail trains hard; she does a long run in the morning and fast runs in the afternoon, but she always takes Sundays off from running. Mike says, ""I am with her all the time. Sometimes I ask, 'Are you sure you should be eating that?' It's usually cakes, but she can eat almost anything."""
KET_52,"**Text: Piano Players - Their Early Years**

**Ivan Petrov**  
Ivan was born on a farm in Russia. From the age of twelve to eighteen, he studied in Poland. His first music teacher could not play the piano but taught him and his sister songs from operas. His mother started teaching him the piano when he was six years old. At ten, he decided he wanted to write music and soon began working on his first song.

**Oleg Gagarin**  
Oleg was the youngest of five children. When he was four, his father, who enjoyed playing the piano, taught him some traditional Russian music. At six, he began taking lessons from a piano teacher in his city. Oleg quickly started winning prizes for his piano playing. At fourteen, he attended a music college in Austria for two years before returning to Russia.

**Josef Heptmann**  
Josef's father was German and taught music in Poland, where Josef was born. The family moved to Germany when Josef was two, and he began playing the piano a year later. He gave his first concert at six years old. At ten, he performed fifty-two concerts in two months during a trip to England! Josef has always loved music, but he is also interested in physics and languages. Although he is very busy now, he hopes to write his own music one day."
KET_28,"**Text: Bill Prince-Smith**

Bill Prince-Smith was a farmer, teacher, and dentist before he became a children's book writer at the age of 60. Now, thirteen years later, he has written over 80 books. Every day, he goes to his office to write. In the evening, he shares his work with his wife, who tells him what she thinks. ""She lets me know when she doesn't like something,"" says Bill. His ten grandchildren, who live far away, also read his stories and give their opinions.

Through this feedback, Bill has learned what young children enjoy reading. He writes about life in his village and the nearby farms. His favorite book is his fifth one, *The Sheepdog*, which tells the story of a farmer and his helpful dog. ""I have always loved animals,"" Bill says, ""and dogs are very smart; they learn quickly."" 

Last year, this book was turned into a film featuring real animals and actors. The filmmakers used advanced computer technology to make it seem like the animals were talking. Bill was very happy with the film. ""Sometimes filmmakers change the story, but they didn't change mine, and I love the film."""
KET_35,"**POSTCARDS**

Today, many people enjoy sending postcards to their friends and family. These postcards usually feature images of beaches, mountains, or castles, and you can write a message on the back. Many individuals send postcards while on holiday because they are inexpensive, and the images are often more appealing than personal photos. The first postcard was sent at the end of the nineteenth century, and it displayed a picture of a seaside town. Over time, postcards began to feature images related to current events, such as accidents or visits from important figures. People appreciated these postcards because newspapers at that time did not include pictures."
KET_5,"**Dinosaurs**

No one has ever seen a dinosaur. The last dinosaur died about 60 million years ago, long before people existed on Earth. We do not know exactly why they all became extinct. The closest living relatives of dinosaurs are birds. Dinosaurs were not all the same; there were over 5,000 different types. Some were very small, while others were enormous. The largest dinosaurs were bigger than any other land animals that have ever lived. For instance, the Brontosaurus was twenty meters long and ate plants. The Tyrannosaurus Rex was not as large, but it was very strong. It had sharp teeth for eating meat and could run quickly because it had long back legs."
KET_41,"**Bears**

Bears can be dangerous animals. An adult bear is very strong and can potentially harm a person. They are skilled climbers and can run quickly. However, their eyesight is poor, and like many animals, they rely on their sense of smell to find food. There are seven species of bears. The largest is the polar bear, which can grow to nearly three meters tall. There are two types of black bears: one inhabits the forests of North America, while the other is found in Southeast Asia. Interestingly, not all black bears are actually black; some can be dark brown or reddish-brown. The black and white panda bear, native to China, is beloved by many. Unfortunately, there are not many pandas left in the wild today, as they struggle to find enough food."
KET_38,"**CROCODILES**

Crocodiles are found in tropical regions around the world, such as Africa, South America, and Northern Australia. They usually live in slow-moving water, but they can swim quickly and move fast on land. You often see crocodiles in large groups. They eat a variety of things, including fish, birds, and small animals. Occasionally, they may also attack larger animals or even humans. There are more than ten different types of crocodiles, all of which have very sharp teeth. Although they often lose teeth, they quickly grow new ones. Typically, crocodiles are about 3.5 meters long, but some can be much larger. They have long lifespans; the oldest crocodile in a zoo lived to be 66 years old."
KET_17,"**A HISTORY OF AIR TRAVEL**

In 1783, two French brothers created the first balloon that could carry people into the sky. One hundred and twenty years later, in 1903, the Wright brothers invented the first powered airplane and successfully flew it in the United States. In 1918, the US Post Office started the first airmail service. Over the next thirty years, airplanes underwent significant changes. By the 1950s, airplanes became much faster due to the introduction of jet engines. In 1976, Concorde was developed in the UK and France. It is the fastest passenger airplane in the world, capable of flying at 2,500 kilometers per hour, which allows the trip from London to New York to take only four hours. Today, millions of people fly on airplanes, and it is hard to imagine a world without them."
KET_47,"Text: 'The Globe Theatre

Visiting the theatre in London 400 years ago was very different from visiting a modern theatre. The building was round and had no roof, so people could get cold and wet if the weather was bad. The queen enjoyed going to the Globe Theatre, located by the River Thames, to watch the plays of William Shakespeare. At that time, all the actors were men. Visitors would eat, talk to their friends, walk around during the show, and some even threw things at the actors! Today, you can still visit the Globe Theatre. A new theatre has been built in the same location near the river. You can enjoy a Shakespeare play there or learn about life in the seventeenth century.'"
KET_48,"Dear Jeff,

I am enjoying my holiday in Australia. When we arrived two weeks ago, the weather was bad and cold. Now, the weather has improved, and we go to the beach every day. This week, we are in Sydney, but next week we will visit the Great Barrier Reef. The water is very warm, and I love swimming there. The fish are all different colors: red, yellow, and purple! Australia is truly beautiful, and we don’t want to go home! I will see you at the end of September.
