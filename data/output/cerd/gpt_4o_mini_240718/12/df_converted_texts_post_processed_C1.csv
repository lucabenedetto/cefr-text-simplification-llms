**Garbage in, garbage out**
Charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems like a good idea for the environment and the economy. However, it may not be as effective as it seems. In many developed countries, the way we collect rubbish is similar: at regular times, garbage bags or bins are taken away by a special truck to a landfill. Economists find this strange because, in most places, this service is free. Households pay for it through local taxes, but a family that produces a lot of rubbish pays the same as an elderly couple who produces very little. However, the cost of rubbish disposal is not zero. The more rubbish people throw away, the more collectors and trucks are needed, and the more local authorities have to pay for landfills.
This creates a basic economic problem: if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. A common solution is to make households pay for the disposal of their waste. This would encourage them to throw away less and recycle more, assuming local governments provide places to collect recyclable materials.
However, economists Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman found that what seems like a logical solution can lead to complicated and sometimes disappointing results. They studied several American towns that started charging households for rubbish. The most common method was to sell stickers or tags that residents had to attach to their rubbish bags. Only bags with these tags would be collected each week.
In a study published last year, Fullerton and Kinnaman looked at a scheme introduced in July 1992 in Charlottesville, Virginia, a town with about 40,000 people. Residents were charged 80 cents for each tagged bag of rubbish. While this seems like a good use of market forces, the authors concluded that the benefits of the scheme did not cover the costs of printing materials, paying sellers, and the wages of those running the program. 
Although the number of bags collected fell sharply by 37%, this was mainly due to a behavior called the ""Seattle stomp,"" where people crammed more rubbish into each container instead of buying more tags. This method of compacting rubbish is less efficient than using machines at landfills. The weight of rubbish collected in Charlottesville fell by only 14%, which is a better measure of disposal costs than volume. In 25 other Virginian cities without a pricing scheme, the weight of rubbish also fell by 3.5%.
Worse still, some people chose to dump their rubbish illegally instead of paying for collection. Although it is hard to measure, the authors estimate that illegal dumping may account for 30-40% of the reduction in collected rubbish. 
On a positive note, there was a 15% increase in the weight of materials recycled, suggesting that people preferred to recycle (which is free) rather than pay for rubbish removal. However, this increase may not be directly related to the fee, as many residents were already part of Charlottesville's voluntary recycling program.
In a more recent study, Fullerton and Kinnaman looked deeper into the economics of rubbish. They found that while pricing does reduce the amount of rubbish, the effect is small. On average, a 10% increase in sticker prices only reduces rubbish by 0.3%. This is less than in other studies, but it makes sense. To significantly reduce rubbish, people would need to buy less of almost everything. A small tax on garbage is unlikely to make a big difference.
If this is true, we should consider whether other factors, like income and education, are just as important as price. For example, in wealthier towns, people tend to throw away more rubbish and have less time to recycle.
Should we conclude that charging households for rubbish is a bad idea? Not necessarily; free disposal is likely too cheap. However, the effects of seemingly simple policies can be complex. Detailed economic models are often needed to understand them, and sometimes the results are not pleasant."
CPE_19,C2,"
Theodore Zeldin explores how our work life might change. Do you feel respected and valued in your job? Success in a career is no longer enough. Many professions feel they are not appreciated or understood, and even famous individuals often feel bitterness despite their success. Loving your work used to be enough to be part of a respected group, but now you must consider how your job affects you as a person, your mind, character, and relationships. This question is very important. No matter how skilled you are, if your work makes you boring or unable to connect with others outside your field, then no amount of status or money can make up for your lack of personal fulfillment.
I am trying to find ways for work to focus on personal fulfillment instead of just serving industrial needs. Work should not only create wealth but also provide a meaningful lifestyle, help us discover hidden talents, and allow for diverse human connections. However, this change will not eliminate unemployment. As more people get educated, they seek jobs that are interesting and enriching.
A lifetime of work should be seen as a work of art, with the fulfilled individual at its center. Even middle-class jobs, like those of doctors, accountants, and architects, no longer have the appeal they once did. Doctors often feel more stressed than their patients, accountants worry about ethics, and architects rarely get to use their creativity. Middle managers, who once felt proud of their status, are losing their confidence. Meanwhile, the companies and institutions they work for are shrinking. Efforts to decentralize decision-making and improve skills have not succeeded in gaining employee commitment. In Britain, only 8% of employees feel their values match those of their organizations.
I have started to investigate various occupations to see how they shape or harm individuals. I have looked at how different cultures have expanded the idea of human potential and how courage can be developed. I have focused on important issues like happiness, love, friendship, and respect. Now, I am concentrating on finding more satisfying ways to earn a living. Many experts focus on increasing the profits of companies, but we also need to examine ourselves as human beings and consider what kind of people we want to work with.
How many of us feel truly alive at work? How many are like part-time slaves, feeling trapped by our qualifications and careers, working not to improve ourselves but because we see no other choice? For example, 10% of the workforce is in the hospitality industry. Many intelligent and lively people endure low pay and long hours because the concept of a hotel has not changed much since the days of the Ritz. A hotel is not just a place for travelers to sleep; it is a small version of the United Nations. People from around the world meet in hotels, but they often do not interact.
Many hotel staff are foreigners eager to learn new languages and cultures, yet they have only superficial interactions with guests. Hotels could become cultural centers, connecting guests with the city and each other. Hotel managers could utilize the knowledge of their student employees instead of assigning them only basic tasks. If they paid attention to their staff's true ambitions, they would see many other services hotels could offer. However, they are often limited by accountants who advise focusing on one main activity to maximize profits. 
It is time to rethink what this means from a human perspective, not just a financial one. For me, work is about relationships. Many people now want work that allows for independence and personal expression. They should have the opportunity to design their own jobs and choose their colleagues and customers, within practical limits. This requires the ability to communicate across different professional languages and connect with people who may seem very different at first.
Everyone understands the importance of communication, but true conversation is different. Traditional conversation is not the same as the new kind of conversation that people feel is missing today. This new conversation is more personal and creates a bond of respect between participants. It allows for a deeper understanding of one another and can change both people involved. It is more than just relaxation; it is a powerful way to establish equality. Every meaningful conversation we have can change the world, even if just a little."
CPE_24,C2,"Broadcasting: The Social Shaping of a Technology**
The term 'broadcasting' originally referred to the act of spreading seeds widely by hand. This idea is not just about farming; it also represents a hopeful view of modern progress. It suggests planned growth that can lead to a fruitful outcome if conditions are favorable. The metaphor implies that there are central resources available for spreading and reproducing this growth.
We need to explore why a new technology that sends words and images electronically was organized in a way that fits this agricultural metaphor. Although television is linked to two-way communication methods like the telegraph and telephone, it was designed from the beginning as a centralized 'mass' medium. This means that it was set up to send signals from a central source to private homes, which matched the social and economic structures of modern societies.
There were attempts to create different forms of television, but these remained just experiments. Two lesser-known alternatives are worth mentioning because they show what television could have been in a different social setting. In the early 1930s, radio enthusiasts in Britain experimented with two-way television as a possible substitute for regular telephones. Popular science magazines like Radio News published articles on how to build television transmitters and receivers, and many amateur experimenters were active across the country. However, in 1938, the British Radio Manufacturers Association established standards for television equipment and channel regulations that pushed these grassroots innovators out of the picture. This marked the end of a potential counter-cultural development of television as a widely accessible and egalitarian form of communication.
Broadcasting was not only influenced by strong economic interests but also by the fundamental structures of modern societies. Despite the efforts of TV amateurs, television in the early 1930s was mainly a medium for public entertainment in the USA and was often seen as a competitor to the film industry. In fact, during the 1930s, most people experienced television in public spaces, especially in Britain and Germany.
While the idea of amateur, two-way television was unlikely to succeed, systems based on collective public viewing were operating in several countries during the 1930s. These systems could have posed a greater challenge to the domestic use of television, but this threat did not materialize. Manufacturers recognized the potential for mass sales of home television sets once prices dropped. Given the separation between public and private life that is characteristic of modernity, centralized broadcasting to a wide domestic audience was the most suitable way to organize the medium.
As working-class people improved their living standards and joined consumer society from the 1920s onward, the dream of the home as a center for entertainment and cultural experiences became a reality for many in Western countries. This trend is now occurring on a global scale. There is a clear link between social modernization and the dominant structures of broadcasting. While social and economic changes led to greater centralization of power and capital, the breakdown of traditional communities created new lifestyles. People became more mobile, both socially and geographically, which often left them feeling isolated compared to those in more stable early communities.
Centralized broadcasting addressed the need for governments to efficiently inform all citizens and helped create a unifying 'imagined community' within the nation-state. The widespread nature of these processes made broadcasting the dominant form for both radio and television. However, it is important to also consider the positive view of broadcasting as a tool for democracy. During the period between the World Wars, many countries recognized broadcasting as a way to ensure equal access to the resources needed for informed participation in political, social, and cultural life.
Television is evolving, and there is a possibility that the term broadcasting may become outdated or insufficient. If this happens, the metaphor will only refer to a specific organization of audio-visual technology during a certain centralized phase of social modernization."
CPE_13,C2,"Clutter**
Sometimes, it feels like no matter how many things you own, you never feel secure. While it is natural to want a home that meets your needs, there comes a point when the desire to acquire more possessions becomes excessive. Modern advertising is designed to exploit our insecurities. A common message we receive is that if you don’t have certain items, you are somehow less valuable. To see how much advertising influences you, try not to read any billboards the next time you walk down the street. These expensive messages constantly shape our thoughts in persuasive ways, often without us realizing it. We are surrounded by them—on television, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, t-shirts, and the internet—all urging us to buy more.
**Caves**
Research institutions and universities worldwide have spent years studying caves, focusing mainly on their origins, water systems, and biology. Caves are a small but intriguing part of the natural world, sparking our curiosity and desire for knowledge. Because they are natural features, they have been studied for a long time, especially in areas where caves impact our lives. However, exploring caves requires physical skill, which means that cave research often involves both professional scientists and amateur enthusiasts who visit caves for recreation.
**Weather Watch**
Many observant people, using only their senses, laid the groundwork for meteorology, which has evolved since the 17th century into a complex science. Today, satellites and electronic devices provide us with quick weather information, and computers can solve complicated calculations much faster than humans. Meteorological terms can be difficult for non-professionals to understand, and it may seem like there is no place for simple weather knowledge. However, human experience remains essential in turning data into weather forecasts. Personal observations can still offer valuable insights that help professionals understand the complexities of the atmosphere."
CPE_16,C2,"**MUSIC AND THEATRE**
Until recently, I believed that opera was primarily theatre. However, after working at a national opera house, I realized that music is actually the main focus, with theatre being secondary. This makes sense, but I come from a theatrical background where the spoken word and the actor are most important. In theatre, once the performance starts, there is no one directing the action, and the performers and audience usually share a common language.
At musical performances, whether in a concert hall or an opera house, many audience members, like me, may not have a deep understanding of music. Some might feel embarrassed about their lack of knowledge, while most are simply amazed by the performers' skills. A talented singer or a skilled string section is easy to admire. Even a decent musician demonstrates years of hard work. Watching top-class music is similar to watching an athletics event; we know athletes are doing something we can relate to, but we also see how much better they are than us.
In contrast, theatre audiences have different expectations. They often do not fully appreciate an actor's skill and may not be particularly impressed by performances that seem similar to what they could do. They frequently ask actors how they memorize their lines, but this does not mean they are less demanding than concert audiences. In fact, many theatre-goers are also concert-goers. This suggests that audiences and performers interact on more equal terms in theatre, regardless of how challenging the material is.
The question arises: does music need to learn from theatre about this relationship? I believe it does. I have seen how a different approach can enhance the experience for concert-goers. Live music is inherently theatrical, filled with emotion, humor, and intimacy. It can be unpredictable and connects with the audience both individually and collectively. However, traditional music presentations often emphasize a hierarchy between performers and listeners, with strict dress codes and excessive respect for conductors and soloists.
On the other hand, contemporary music audiences sometimes disrupt performances by applauding between movements or after impressive pieces. While this is often a genuine expression of appreciation, it can also interrupt the flow of the performance. 
Is there a solution? Yes, many initiatives are underway to attract new audiences to concert halls and opera houses and to break down the barriers that make people feel that ""serious"" music is not for them. I recall a remarkable event, the community opera ""In Search of Angels,"" which took place in various locations within a cathedral and the surrounding town. This experience was not only musical but also transformative for many audience members, who were actively involved.
What I desire in music is more of the risk and creativity that the best theatre can offer. This can come from using unusual or challenging locations that disrupt normal expectations, creating surprising effects for both performers and audiences. While some plays are presented in conventional ways, I believe there is potential for change in how music is experienced.
As an enthusiast of both theatre and music, I want both art forms to flourish and for more people to enjoy the pleasure I find in being part of the audience."

**Sand**  
While I appreciate sand's amazing ability to be turned into useful items like glass and concrete, I am not a big fan of it in its natural form. To me, it mainly acts as a barrier between a seaside parking lot and the ocean. It blows into your face, gets into your food, and can swallow important items like car keys and coins. When you are wet, it sticks to you like glue and is hard to remove, even with a strong hose. However, the strange thing is that as soon as you step onto a beach towel, get into a car, or walk on a recently cleaned carpet, it falls off you easily. For days after, you find small amounts of it on the floor every time you take off your shoes, and you spread even more when you take off your socks. Sand seems to stay with you longer than many illnesses. So, as far as I’m concerned, you can keep the sand.
**Lock and Key**  
The search for a safe home, privacy, and security has existed since humans first built permanent homes. The simple wooden beam behind the door has changed to electronic locks activated by plastic cards with countless combinations. However, the desire to keep out intruders remains. The appeal of a lock and key is partly psychological. Recently, some companies have tried computerized locking systems, where smart cards control electronic locks through a digital command. But people do not prefer them. You might accept them at work, but at home, everyone wants the comfort of using a physical key. Therefore, when one locksmith company created a new electronic system, they made sure to include a real metal key in the device.
**Modern Art**  
I felt nervous about visiting the new Tate Modern gallery because, like many people, I find modern art confusing. I know I like some of it, especially furry items, neon light sculptures, and large photographs. Maybe if I knew more about it, I would have stronger opinions. However, art is not meant to be understood in a strict way. The goal is not to fully grasp it, but to let it speak to you. This is a great idea, but it has not worked for me in the past. This new gallery has tried to give visitors real insight into the reasons behind the artworks. The first thing I noticed was the labels, which provided context and explained what the art was trying to convey. Instead of staring blankly at the pieces as I used to, these helpful bits of information allowed me to understand better."
CPE_46,C2,"**Every Picture Tells a Story**
**Adapting Novels for Film**
Turning novels into films often means reducing and simplifying the original story. This can be frustrating for writers, but it can also be enlightening. While working on a script, I realized that I could remove much of the dialogue and description from a scene in the novel and still convey the same message. This does not mean that the original dialogue and descriptions were unnecessary. It relates to how each medium engages the audience and the type of repetition it uses. 
In this context, ""redundancy"" refers to the repeated mentions of character traits and speech tags like ""he said."" A character's trait only needs to be described once, but reminders help the audience understand better. In dialogue, we can often guess who is speaking from the context, but speech tags make it easier to read. 
Stage plays, which mainly consist of dialogue, mimic real speech's redundancy to varying degrees. In some modern plays, this can be excessive, making the dialogue seem almost entirely repetitive, which can confuse the audience about the actual message.
**Watching Movies**
When watching movies, viewers can feel completely immersed in the film's world. This experience allows them to escape from reality, at least for the duration of the film. However, once the lights come on, this illusion is shattered, and they return to the real world. People often do not feel accountable for the time spent watching a film, and this sense of unreality can lead to a lack of serious consideration of movies as an art form. Many from previous generations, including our parents and teachers, viewed films as mere entertainment rather than art. While they enjoyed being entertained, they did not appreciate the artistic value of movies.
**The Film Studios**
The Leiper Film Company studios consisted of many different buildings. The layout was confusing, with only a few recognizable landmarks like the Script Department. Most of the space was filled with small, similarly furnished rooms used for meetings, which were hard to identify without a complicated system of letters and numbers. Finding a specific room was a challenge. 
The studio lacked a clear main entrance, having three equal entrances that offered no guidance. This made it difficult for newcomers to navigate. However, there were not many outsiders, as the organization preferred to keep them away. It was assumed that employees could find their way around. Through their teamwork, they created films that allowed viewers to escape from everyday life, even if just for a few hours.
**Film-Makers**
It seems that many people want to make movies. Bookstores are filled with guides on scriptwriting and film production, and universities offer related courses. There are competitions that reward aspiring filmmakers with equipment, like the camera used by Robert Rodriguez to create his film *El Mariachi*, which cost $7,000 and launched his career as an independent director. Rodriguez reflects on his early success, noting that he felt pressure to achieve his breakthrough film before turning 26, just like famous directors Orson Welles and Steven Spielberg did.
In the past, filmmakers were expected to take their time to develop their skills. They often worked behind the scenes as editors, writers, or cinematographers, learning the craft by directing low-budget films. For example, John Huston was 35 when he made his first film, *The Maltese Falcon*, and Fred Zinnemann, who directed *High Noon*, found his stride in his forties. Today, without the support of studios or television, aspiring filmmakers often have to forge their own paths."
CPE_3,C2,"In the past, the council houses spread across the western part of the city, with many rows of small, shabby homes made of orange brick or pale white stucco. In the summer, the chemicals from the May and Baker factory, located two miles away, created a strong smell of sulphur that lingered around the doors and gardens. A common sight in that area of Norwich in the early morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he walked along someone’s front path. I have forgotten much of my early life, but I remember sitting near an upstairs window, looking at the houses as they disappeared into the distance. 
Later, I have memories of faces I cannot name, my mother ironing towels in a house that I don’t think was ours, and snow falling on the turrets of a large mansion at Earlham. It is not surprising that my mother appears in these early memories. I remember her as a small, precise, and often angry woman, and I never fully understood the reason for her anger, so I could not do anything to make it better. Even as a child, when I went with her to the small shops in Bunnett Square or on longer trips into the city, I sensed something unusual about her personality. She was the most solitary person I have ever known, feeling alone even in a crowded room. 
Her solitude was combined with a strict sense of propriety that was unusual for the West Earlham estate. This sometimes resulted in intense spring-cleaning sessions or strict instructions to ""behave properly."" I found this moral code hard to understand, and even now, I am not sure I fully grasp it. It meant not wandering into neighbors' gardens or damaging their rose bushes while walking down the street; it meant sitting quietly for long periods in a silent dining room, hands folded across my chest, listening to radio programs my mother enjoyed; it meant countless rules and restrictions. 
Over time, other figures appeared in these strict early memories. Despite her solitude, my mother had a few friends. There was Mrs. Buddery, who was obsessed with the Royal Family; Mrs. Winall, who rarely spoke except to agree with others; and Mrs. Laband, who was more lively and somewhat disapproved of by the others. Looking back, I realize that this trio was not good company; they often talked about their bad legs, the cold weather, and ungrateful children, a category in which I often felt included. 
Reflecting on this, it felt like a heavy weight made up of the West Earlham houses, my mother, her friends, and the pressure to ""behave properly"" rested on my shoulders, and I felt it was my responsibility to break free from it. However, this was not easy. Growing up in West Earlham followed a predictable pattern. Until you turned five, you stayed at home and got in your parents' way (I remember long, aimless days playing on a rug while my mother sat coldly in an armchair). Then, in September after your fifth birthday, you were sent to Avenue Road infants school, half a mile away. The lucky few had mothers with old bikes and child seats, which were unusual contraptions with makeshift safety straps. I remember my mother letting me walk with other children in the street for this journey. 
If I recall anything from those early years, it is the summer holidays, when I caught glimpses of the world beyond West Earlham: a vague old man next door to Mrs. Buddery who told stories about his time in the Merchant Navy; a charity fair held at a house far away where a kind woman offered lemonade and tried to interest me in something called the League of Pity, a kind of junior charity. However, my mother dismissed it, saying the organizers were ""only after your money."" My mother often spoke about mercenary motives, and she held politicians in deep contempt. If she thought of the House of Commons, it was as a place where wealthy people opened letters filled with money sent by a gullible public. 
I may exaggerate and overlook her good qualities while focusing on her flaws. However, there was little kindness in my mother; it seemed to have been drained from her. To be fair, she was aware of her role in my education. Occasionally on Sundays, she would take me, dressed in my ""good clothes,"" on the 85 bus to the Norwich Castle Museum. Hand in hand, we would walk through rooms filled with paintings by the Norwich School of Artists. My mother was not completely against this activity and eventually developed some opinions about the art. I remember her stopping in front of a painting of a Roman soldier in full armor and saying, ""Well, I wouldn't want to meet him on a dark night!"" This was one of the few times I remember my mother trying to make a joke."
CPE_10,C2,"Philadelphia Avenue**
I walked down the odd-numbered side of Philadelphia Avenue. The evening was getting darker, and the air was humid with a light drizzle that made my walk feel secretive. I knew this side of the street well; I remembered our neighbors, the Matzes and the Pritchards, Han Kieffer's grocery store, and the houses of my first playmates, all girls. Although I didn’t know everyone by name, each house was clear in my memory, just like the small troughs in the sidewalk that carried rainwater from the roofs to the street, which I would skate or scoot over.
As the street sloped down, I noticed a slight decline in the social status of the houses: the porches were lower, and the front yards were smaller. Over the years, things changed: wooden porch railings were replaced with wrought iron in a style that reminded me of the South or Spain. In Shillington, houses I remembered as homes had turned into stores, and strangely, some stores, like Pep Conrad's and Han Kieffer's, had become homes again. I wondered how the residents used those open spaces and how they lived with the lingering smells of the goods that used to be sold there.
**Bachelor Fads Furniture Designer Rick Gilbert**
Rick Gilbert lives in a flat that used to be a curtain warehouse. It has the typical features of a loft, like exposed brick and large doors that once allowed curtains to be moved from trains nearby. However, Gilbert did not want a completely open space for practical and aesthetic reasons. He explained, ""In my last place, my living and working areas were mixed. It was hard to relax or start working when everything was in view.""
To create a more defined space, he used a large piece of corrugated plastic near the entrance. This screen hides the office, creates a hallway, and leads to the kitchen in the middle of the flat. He wanted the kitchen to be a neutral area where he could cook for friends or make coffee for clients. To balance the modern look of the plastic and stainless steel kitchen, he chose light wood for the floors. His flat is filled with modern furniture, but it also has sentimental pieces from his parents or items he found at markets.
**Bruce Chatwin**
Bruce Chatwin's life and writing are filled with secrets and lies, yet he was a brilliant and unique author. His first book, *In Patagonia*, published in 1977, is a remarkable work of imagination. It reinvented travel writing, combining the excitement of a thriller, the charm of romantic fiction, and the deep insight of great literature. Even in this book, Chatwin mixed fact with fiction; he often changed details to create a more engaging story or to highlight the essence of what he wanted to convey. He suggested that through travel, one could uncover rich histories that seemed to exist just to inspire future explorers.
**Swimming**
During a warm summer rain, I rushed across my lawn and jumped into the pool. As I swam, I kept my eyes just above the water. Each raindrop created a small splash that turned into a bubble and burst. The best moments were when the rain became heavier, drowning out the sound of birds and creating a mist over the water, as if the pool was rising to meet the sky. It was during this summer in 1996 that I began to think about a long swim across Britain. I wanted to follow the rain as it traveled across the land to the sea, escaping the frustration of swimming laps and feeling trapped like a tiger in a cage.
Many of us live in a world where everything is labeled and explained. This trend makes our reality feel more like a visual experience. That’s why activities like walking, cycling, and swimming are so important; they allow us to reconnect with the wild and ancient parts of our world by stepping off the beaten path and breaking free from the official narratives. A swimming journey would let me explore the parts of our world that still hold mystery, like darkness, misty forests, or high mountains."
CPE_67,C2,"**Crying**
Charles Darwin believed that crying did not have a clear purpose in human evolution. However, recent research suggests he was likely mistaken. Scientists now emphasize the social importance of crying, with psychiatrist John Bowlby noting its role in forming the bond between a mother and her child. Many people think that tears, especially in children, mainly show feelings of helplessness. 
Understanding why adults cry is more complicated. It appears that the sound of crying is less important than the visual message it sends. Crying may have been beneficial for early human groups by helping to build trust and social connections. 
There are also other reasons for crying. We might cry to show sympathy for those facing great injustice. Additionally, tears can come unexpectedly, often causing embarrassment, when we hear touching music or powerful speeches. We may also cry while watching emotional movies, and interestingly, this happens more often when we are with others than when we are alone. The social role of crying seems clear, but research on this topic is ongoing."
CPE_27,C2,"The Heat is On**
We have all heard about global warming, but how much warmer will the Earth become, and how will it affect our lives? Most people have some understanding of global warming, but few know its consequences. A warmer climate is likely to change the weather in all parts of the world. Since the atmosphere is closely connected to every aspect of our planet, any climate changes will significantly impact plants, animals, water, and soil. Humans have learned to use these natural resources to our advantage, allowing us to produce food, build cities, and support billions of people. Therefore, any changes to these resources must be taken seriously.
The challenge we face is understanding how the world will change and what is causing these changes. Over the last century, human actions have significantly increased the levels of certain gases in the atmosphere, which are closely linked to global temperatures. These increased levels are likely already affecting the global climate, but our limited knowledge of the global heat balance makes the current and future situations uncertain. 
We know that greenhouse gas levels have fluctuated in line with global temperatures over the past 40,000 years, suggesting a strong connection between the two. Evidence indicates that the Earth's surface has warmed by about 6°C over the last century. Most scientists believe this warming is not entirely natural and is partly due to human pollution. 
A lot of research has been done to predict the conditions resulting from higher global temperatures. Most of this research uses computer programs called general circulation models (GCMs). These models analyze the interactions of temperature, pressure, solar radiation, and other climatic factors to predict climate conditions for the past, present, or future. However, they are simplifications of reality and have many limitations. Their results are only approximate, and they are slow and expensive to run. 
Despite these challenges, most people agree on one important aspect of climate change: the rate of change will be faster than anything we have experienced before. The predictions from GCMs provide some insight into the world we will live in over the next few generations. Currently, they suggest that the average global surface temperature could rise by between 1°C and 3.5°C by the year 2100. They also predict that global sea levels will rise by 15-95 cm and that changes in rainfall patterns will occur. Scientists expect extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, floods, and droughts, to become more common in some areas. 
These forecasts highlight the potential impact of climate change on the natural environment and humans. Changes in climate could affect the locations of ecosystems, such as forests and grasslands, the variety of species they contain, and their ability to provide essential benefits for society. This includes food production, water resources, and human settlements. Some effects may be irreversible and likely unfavorable in many regions, but not all impacts will be negative. In fact, some climate change effects may be beneficial. 
For example, in Australia, research has shown that wheat yields have increased by about 0.5 tonnes per hectare since 1952, partly due to climate trends. Warmer temperatures have led to fewer frosts, which has reduced damage to crops. However, many predicted effects of future climate warming are concerning. Even small changes in climate can affect water availability, especially in dry regions or areas already facing shortages. 
The Mediterranean Basin is one example where decreasing rainfall has been observed, particularly in western-central areas. In southern Portugal, rainfall has become more concentrated in a shorter period, affecting seasonal patterns. Another serious concern is the impact on glaciers, which will affect ice, vegetation, wildlife habitats, and human structures. There is a strong possibility that Arctic ice will melt completely, making marine transport easier but increasing risks from icebergs.
Perhaps the most dramatic effect of global warming will be rising sea levels. This will occur due to the thermal expansion of oceans and melting ice. With about half of the world's population living in coastal areas, the consequences of rising sea levels could be severe. Increased flooding and inundation are likely, affecting cities like London, New York, and Tokyo. Many people could lose their homes and livelihoods, leading to millions of environmental refugees. 
The most severe consequences may be faced by small, low-lying island nations, which could disappear entirely if worst-case scenarios occur. This would be devastating not only for the people and cultures of these islands but also for the countries that would need to accommodate those displaced."

Wanted: a middle-aged, married couple for a 501-day round trip to Mars. Applicants must be physically and emotionally strong. This will be the profile of the first astronauts on Mars if multi-millionaire Dennis Tito's plans to launch a capsule on January 5, 2018, succeed. The capsule will take the crew to about 160 km above Mars. The spacecraft will use Mars' gravity to return to Earth without using extra fuel, as fuel efficiency is very important. The 2018 deadline is set because the next time Mars and Earth will be aligned for a launch is in 2031. It is a challenging task, but there is a race to develop new technologies. If these technologies are ready in time, the spacecraft might succeed. Even if it never leaves Earth, the efforts to reach these goals will still be valuable for future missions."
CPE_44,C2,"**AESTHETICS**
The existence of artworks, which are the basis for aesthetic theory, can actually hinder our understanding of them. This is because these artworks are physical objects, like buildings, books, paintings, or statues, that exist separately from human experience. The true essence of a work of art lies in how it interacts with our experiences, but this can make it harder to grasp its meaning.
Moreover, the high regard for certain artworks, due to their long history of admiration, creates established ideas that can block new perspectives. Once an artwork is considered a classic, it often becomes disconnected from the human experiences that led to its creation and the effects it has on our lives. When we separate artworks from their origins and their impact on our experiences, we create a barrier that obscures their broader significance, which is what aesthetic theory aims to explore. Art then exists in a separate world, detached from the materials and goals of other human activities.
A key challenge for anyone writing about the philosophy of fine arts is to reconnect the refined experiences that artworks provide with the everyday events and struggles that everyone recognizes as part of life. Just as mountains are not isolated but are part of the earth's processes, artworks should not be seen as separate from human experience. Those studying the theory of art must make this connection clear.
If we accept this idea, we may reach a surprising conclusion: to truly understand artistic products, we need to temporarily set them aside and focus on the ordinary experiences that we usually do not consider aesthetic. We must take a detour to arrive at a theory of art, as theory is about understanding and insight. For example, one can enjoy flowers for their beauty and scent without knowing about plants scientifically. However, to understand how plants flower, one must learn about the interactions of soil, air, water, and sunlight that support their growth.
To grasp the aesthetic in its most profound forms, we must start with it in its raw state—through the events and scenes that capture our attention and provide enjoyment. Yet, the ideas that elevate art to a distant status can make many people uncomfortable with the idea that they enjoy their everyday activities partly because of their aesthetic qualities. 
Today, the arts that resonate most with the average person are often not recognized as traditional art forms, such as movies, jazz, comic strips, and sensational news stories. When art is confined to museums and galleries, people seek enjoyment in their daily lives instead. Many who oppose the museum view of art still hold onto the mistaken belief that separates art from ordinary experiences, a belief that many theorists and critics also support. The times when special artworks are closely linked to everyday activities are when appreciation for them is strongest and most genuine."
CPE_22,C2,"**Observing Lions**
In popular culture, lions hunting for food are often seen as a remarkable display of teamwork. As the sun sets, a group of stealthy lions emerges from the shadows to surround their unsuspecting prey. They appear to be the perfect social animals, setting aside minor disagreements to work together for a common goal: their next meal. However, after many years of studying these animals in the wild, we have developed a different perspective. When we began our research in 1978, we aimed to understand why lions hunt together, raise cubs, and scare off rivals with their roars. If we measure an animal's success by how many offspring survive, then cooperation might not be beneficial. If one animal is too generous, it may end up helping its companions at its own expense. So, why do lions seem to ignore the rules of self-interest? We thought we could answer this question in two to three years, but lions are experts at being inactive. We would add them to the list of unreactive noble gases like krypton, argon, and neon. Therefore, it has taken various research methods to find clues about their behavior. Since wild lions can live up to 18 years, we are only now beginning to understand the answers to our questions.
**Pop Music Review**
The release of Bedrock's third album marked a significant moment in the career of a talented but previously unstable band. ""New Life"" started a movement that changed the direction of rock music in this country for the rest of the decade. Gone were the serious themes, dull clothing, and heavy guitars of the past; instead, a lighter mix of melodic local styles emerged. This album combined social commentary and strong emotions with sounds from fairground organs and brass bands. Humor and irony were prominent, and the singers proudly expressed their backgrounds. The album showcased Bedrock as skilled collectors and observers, as well as versatile songwriters. They playfully addressed traditional English themes like sunbathing and Sunday afternoons. However, the album's true strength lay in its deeper, more melancholic tracks, such as ""So Low,"" a beautiful song loosely based on weather, and ""To the Brink,"" a serious ballad. The beauty of ""New Life"" is its consistently high quality—16 tracks with no filler, an impressive achievement in an era of lengthy CDs.
**Extract from an Autobiography**
As a child, I was always intrigued by stories of 'The Sibyl,' the wise women who held great influence in the ancient world. Initially, I only knew of one from a story my mother told me. An old woman from Cumae offered Tarquin, the King of Rome, nine books for 300 gold pieces. When he refused, she burned three of them and offered him six for the same price. After he refused again, she burned three more books. He eventually bought the last three for the full price. Even then, I recognized a valuable lesson in the story about salesmanship and life. As an only child, I often felt lonely. I would ask to play with other children, but they would refuse. My mother advised me to do something so interesting that the other kids would want to join me. It worked, and it’s a lesson I’ve never forgotten. When I had the opportunity to write a travel book, I needed to find a topic that resonated with my life. I’m not an enthusiastic traveler; at the first chance, I sent my editor a long list of places I was unwilling to visit. Ultimately, I’m only interested in ruins, as I prefer to travel through time in my mind.
**What Happens to Your Manuscript?**
When you submit your manuscript, it will likely join a pile waiting for someone to review it—the so-called slush pile. This person is usually either a junior member of the editorial team (often under 18) or an experienced freelancer who works a few mornings a week. Neither has much power, but they are generally supportive and looking for something original. The junior member hopes to make a name for themselves and find a promising author, while the experienced freelancer aims to justify their ongoing employment. If they find your novel promising, they will pass it to a senior editor, and it will eventually be discussed in an acquisition meeting. The editor who champions your work must justify accepting it based on its quality and potential sales, as well as whether you seem like a long-term author. They will also consider how marketable you are, which is crucial when a new novel needs all the support it can get. For this reason, publishers often prefer to meet potential authors before finalizing an offer."
CPE_39,C2,"Advertising on Trial**
If you work in an advertising agency, the early 1990s were likely very challenging. The recession was worse than expected, affecting industrialized countries for thirty years. In Britain, 1991 saw a decline in gross domestic product (GDP), high interest rates, reduced consumer spending, job losses for over half a million people, and around 75,000 homes being repossessed. Every business was impacted, with some sectors, like vehicles and construction, seeing a 30% drop in activity. Many people and companies around the world faced difficulties.
While advertising professionals were not the only ones losing jobs, those who remained often felt intense pressure. They were seen as responsible for helping companies financially, which meant they were closely watched by their colleagues and bosses. Additionally, they were expected to do more with smaller budgets, being told that ""less is more."" Despite these challenges, the importance of marketing grew. Companies began to focus more on creating products and services that customers wanted, rather than just what was easy for them to produce. 
As a result, marketing received more attention from management, and some brands started to be genuinely marketed. This increased the status of marketing professionals but also added to their workload. Marketing was often mistakenly seen as a solution to all problems. Since about half of marketing budgets go to advertising, the pressure on advertising professionals increased. 
The early 1990s marked a downturn for the advertising industry, partly due to the economic situation. However, there were also deeper changes that would not simply disappear when the economy improved. The recession led clients to closely examine their advertising budgets and question the effectiveness of their spending. Many companies were unsure about the return on investment from their advertising, making the industry feel like it was on trial.
Client companies expressed a desire for better strategies, targeting, creativity, media placement, and overall thinking. They wanted the best talent from advertising agencies and expected them to work hard to produce excellent results. While this situation does not necessarily evoke sympathy for the advertising industry, it highlights that many advertising professionals faced the same challenges as their clients: how to achieve more with less.
Several factors made effective advertising even more difficult. Some were direct results of the recession, such as debates over production costs and a reluctance to take risks, which are often essential for good advertising. Other changes were happening regardless of the economy, including demographic shifts, the growing power of retailers, changing consumer needs, the rise of sponsorship, and stricter advertising regulations. Additionally, some companies faced the new challenge of advertising internationally.
These issues forced advertising professionals to reconsider the famous saying by Lord Leverhulme: ""Only half my advertising works. The trouble is I don't know which half."" The pressure to increase the effectiveness of advertising was greater than ever. Unfortunately, help for those seeking to improve their advertising was not readily available. Companies and agencies were too busy managing these challenges to discuss them, and those who succeeded often kept their strategies private. While conferences and seminars offered some insights, the available literature on advertising often did not provide practical guidance. Many books presented advertising as a flawless process, which was not true and did not assist the employees responsible for the results."
CPE_18,C2,"**The Allure of the Kitchen**
When I was in university, I decided I wanted to become a chef. This choice was unusual among my peers. Cooking was not a popular career; it seemed unattractive. Chefs often have tough lives: the work is long, stressful, repetitive, and poorly paid. However, these factors did not discourage me. I was unhappy at university. The studies were difficult, and the social life felt closed off and self-important. Becoming a chef appeared to be the perfect escape from the pretentiousness of college life. It offered a sense of seriousness and integrity that I felt was missing in my studies.
My desire to cook was not just a reaction to my university experience; it also reflected a deeper appreciation for food. This appreciation began when I had a meal at a well-known restaurant in London. It was a transformative experience. I still remember my starter vividly. After that meal, I felt an overwhelming urge to learn the secrets of this wonderful art. I turned my student life into preparation for a career in cooking. My history degree felt meaningless, distracting me from my true passion. I learned about cooking by reading cookbooks, exploring markets, and preparing elaborate meals.
**The Swimming Instructor**
The school's swimming instructor was a former drill sergeant, small and muscular, with tattooed arms. When I asked him to teach me how to dive, he instructed me to sit on the edge of the pool, raise my hands above my head, and roll forward, pushing off with my feet. I practiced this until the hour was over. On my next visit, he had me stand up and dive off the edge. He was strict, and every time I surfaced, he looked at me disapprovingly: ""Don't look down, look up!"" ""Keep your legs straight."" ""Point your toes!"" 
The following week, I climbed up to the high diving board. It was fixed and slightly bent at the front. It felt extremely high as I stood there, trying to gather my courage. Gradually, the noise around me faded, and I felt enveloped in silence. I waved my arms as I had been taught, tried to look up instead of down, and jumped into the air. For a brief moment, I felt like I was flying. When I hit the water, I landed awkwardly, and my legs flailed. The instructor looked at me with disdain and shook his head. But even he could not take away my joy. I thought, ""This is what they mean by 'free as a bird.'""
**The Traveller**
For those of us who value a comfortable bed, running water, and the likelihood of living until tomorrow, the idea of a traveller can seem both strange and fascinating. These are people who willingly take risks, climbing dangerous mountains, sailing alone on small boats through rough seas, and eating whatever they can find, even insects. They can live for months in uncertainty. 
It is easy to see such people as oddities, and we might dismiss them as eccentric: hermits, extreme divers, or writers. While they do exist, their unusual world is far from our daily lives, and we can easily ignore it, returning to our own comforts like microwave ovens and answering machines. We are relieved that the only risks we face are predictable, like crossing a busy street.
**Sailing**
Jonathan Raban is afraid of the sea, which is likely why he spends so much time on it. He does not claim to be an expert sailor, but he is skilled. His main reason for sailing is that, as a writer, he enjoys writing about his experiences on the water. Sailing provides him with stories to tell.
Raban's small boat has a device that shows sailors their exact location anywhere on Earth. While he appreciates this technology, he also believes that the invention of the compass was a mistake. He thinks it has created a disconnect between people and the sea. Since the compass was introduced, sailors have focused on it instead of observing the waves and feeling the ocean. The sea, once full of life, has become just a space to navigate. Because of this, the person steering the boat can often be replaced by an autopilot, which may be why Raban has time to observe the waves so closely."
CPE_62,C2,"**Holiday Reading**
Summer brings us two great joys: escaping home and reading books. These joys are closely connected. Books can help us feel more at home in the wider world. We can relate our own experiences to those in great books written long ago or in faraway places because there are fewer types of people than there are individuals. In the writings of others, we discover our own thoughts, embarrassments, and dramas. Authors can find the right words to describe feelings we thought we were alone in experiencing, or they can express our thoughts with a clarity we struggle to achieve. What is shy and confused within us is clearly and confidently expressed in their work, which is even more striking if the author is from a distant place or a different time. We feel thankful to these strangers for reminding us of who we are.
Through reading and travel, we escape the dullness of routine. Our eyes are most open during the first few days in a new place, and perhaps also when we read a great book, which reveals things we had previously overlooked. Our minds become like radar, picking up on details we hadn’t noticed before, such as the colors of the sky, the changing expressions on a face, the insincerity of a friend, or a sadness about a situation we didn’t know we could feel sad about.
**Author's Note**
These reflections on travel were published as articles in the Observer newspaper over seven years. I have restored some small edits made by the editor for space, but otherwise, I have added very little. I corrected a few obvious mistakes, but only if they were minor details I should have gotten right initially. With hindsight, I could have made more improvements, but that would have been endless. For example, in the second article about China, I thought the Hong Kong dollar would remain stable, but a year later it fell. If I rewrote it to predict this, it would no longer be a report from that time. Like any traveler in Southeast Asia or elsewhere, I was there in that moment, unaware of what would happen next, and focused on understanding what had already occurred. This is the true story of mass air travel: the world opening up to people who have no special qualifications to explore it except the price of a ticket. However, I have never believed that all my fellow travelers were completely unaware. Even a postcard can have a purpose.
**Ecotourism**
If there were awards for tourism phrases that have been misused, ""ecotourism"" would win first prize. The term first appeared in the early 1980s, reflecting a rise in environmental awareness and a realization by tour operators that many travelers wanted to ensure their presence abroad would not harm the environment. It quickly became a popular marketing term for holidays. Today, the ecotourism label includes everything from two-week tours with remote tribes to one-hour boat trips through an Australian gorge. Any tour that involves cultural interaction, natural beauty, wildlife, or a bit of adventure is likely to be labeled ecotourism. While the original intentions were good, the lack of regulations and a clear definition left many travelers confused in an ecotourism maze.
**Transylvanian Journey**
I lost my notebook from my journey in Transylvania for 50 years, but I found it again a few years ago by chance. It has helped me remember that time and write about it, but it hasn’t been as reliable as I hoped. In Transylvania, I had a much easier time than I expected, moving from one welcoming country house to another, often staying for weeks. When I settled down during those long stays, my writing stopped too; I thought there was nothing to record. I was often slow to start writing again when I moved on, and even then, quick notes sometimes replaced longer narratives. Worried that some details might be out of order when I began writing this book, I surrounded those sections with many qualifications. However, realizing that these pages were not a guidebook made me think it didn’t matter much, so I let the story unfold without unnecessary complications."
CPE_49,C2,"Fashion**
Fashion is often thought of as a modern idea, mainly influenced by capitalism in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. However, many fashion historians argue that fashion, especially in terms of style and design, has a long history. They often begin their studies with the growth of markets and trade in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. As societies have become more complex, populations have grown, and new technologies for making various types of clothing and accessories have emerged, the meanings associated with dress have also become more complex. Therefore, it is hard to determine what any piece of clothing or accessory truly means today. For instance, a man's suit, which is often seen as a symbol of uniformity, can have very different meanings depending on the context and the person interpreting it.
**Writer**
Reports about publishers competing for popular manuscripts can create a misleading image of life for most novelists. For those of us who are not best-selling authors, there are two main ways to make a living. The smartest writers work in the evenings and have other full-time jobs that will still be there if their book is not quickly published or made into a film. Others, like me, take on various writing-related jobs, such as teaching, leading workshops, and writing articles. I have heard of a writing job at a chocolate factory, but I have never found anything like that. Somehow, by balancing part-time jobs and using credit cards, and often thanks to the support of those mentioned in the Acknowledgements section of books, I manage to write my novel.
**Sudden Fame**
The small venues where we performed across the country were starting to sell out, and we needed extra security to manage the growing number of excited fans. We had to use secret entrances to avoid being overwhelmed by admirers at the village halls and ballrooms where we played. On the few nights we were not working, it was hard to leave the house without being followed by enthusiastic fans. In just a few days, we became celebrities. Our actions were closely watched by our fans, and our management took care of all our needs. Although my shyness never completely disappeared, it was replaced by a strange, naive confidence that only people who are naturally shy and suddenly find themselves in the spotlight can understand. In short, I felt completely out of my depth emotionally."
CPE_31,C2,"Music - The Challenge Ahead**
Technological advances are changing our lives at work, home, and during our free time. Susan Hallam discusses how these changes affect music in Britain. In the late 20th century, there was a rapid increase in ways to listen to music, such as through radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, videos, and new multimedia techniques. However, this has led to a decline in live music performances and full-time jobs for professional musicians. 
It is clear that access to music will continue to grow, as it meets many human needs. On a national level, no major state event is complete without music. For individuals, music offers many formal and informal activities. A society without music is hard to imagine. The real question is not whether there will be music in the 21st century, but what kind of music it will be and whether people will still feel the need to learn to play instruments.
I believe that there will still be a need for musical skills. The music industry is a major source of income in Britain, and musical talent will remain important for various professions, especially in the media. Additionally, there is evidence that playing an instrument can help develop skills early on. Research in the USA suggests that listening to or making music positively affects spatial reasoning, which is one measure of intelligence. While these results need further confirmation, studies in Europe show that group music lessons can improve social relationships in schools and help children focus, especially those with behavioral issues.
Current research is also exploring how playing an instrument might help develop transferable skills. For example, regular practice can lead to good study habits and concentration, while performing in concerts can teach punctuality and organization. For these reasons, there will likely be a continued demand for instrumental teaching in the near future.
What about the long-term future? Will there be a change in focus, and if so, what will it be? I believe two possibilities are likely. First, the types of music people listen to will become more diverse, with new genres combining different styles. Second, technology will play a larger role in composing and performing music, making it easier for more people to create music without needing advanced technical skills. However, this may also reduce the need for live performances and musicians focused solely on that.
At the same time, more people of all ages will want to participate in music-making, often in community settings that reflect their local musical traditions. If this vision for the future is to happen, the music profession must prepare. Instrumental teaching will need to change to help more people learn various instruments throughout their lives. This will require adjustments to the curriculum and assessment methods to stay relevant for a wider audience.
Training for musicians will be crucial. They must be able to motivate and teach learners of all ages, work with diverse groups, and develop skills in communication, social interaction, entrepreneurship, and management for community work. This represents a significant shift from traditional practices and will require a response to demands for public accountability. 
Positively, this change offers an opportunity for those in music education to showcase the high quality of music teaching available. Finally, we must work to raise the profile of music itself. Music is essential in our lives, but it is often taken for granted. Everyone in the music profession needs to collaborate to ensure that this perception changes."
CPE_58,C2,"**The Actor's Craft**
Actors sometimes face criticism and scorn. Much of this negativity comes from the actors themselves when they are asked to discuss their work in interviews. Instead of sharing their true feelings, they often resort to tired clichés or gossip. Paul Scofield once wrote to a friend that an actor's work is only alive when performed. He believed that discussing it makes it feel empty and theoretical. Each time an actor performs, they start anew, learning from the characters and the writer. After a play ends, they often feel empty until the next performance, and this emptiness is evident in discussions about acting.
**A Review of Hamlet**
Adrian Lester's portrayal of Hamlet captures the transition from boyhood to manhood with remarkable simplicity and confidence. His control over the text and his physical presence elevate him from a promising actor to a leading performer. Lester plays a young man filled with suppressed anger, using sharp wit and humor that make him both intimidating and endearing. His performance is skillful, evident in the way he holds his body, suggesting a character waiting to be brought to life. Similarly, Handy's portrayal of Horatio conveys a sense of being moved by an inner force.
**What is Acting?**
What does it mean to act? Is it merely copying behavior, or does it create something new? This question lies at the heart of theatre.
**One Director's Approach to Rehearsal**
This director's rehearsal process begins with a technique called ""dropping in."" The stage manager displays the script on a screen while the actors listen quietly. When it’s their turn to speak, they read the first line, reflect on its meaning, and wait for the impulse to speak. For example, if the line is, ""Queuing all night, the rain, do you remember?"" they take a breath and let the thought come to them. They might visualize a memory, like waiting in line for a concert. The director encourages actors to be open and trust that something will happen in the moment.
**The Perfect Theatre**
The ideal theatre should make you feel that your presence matters. Attending a live performance is a special event, and the staff should recognize this. It can feel isolating if the people working there seem indifferent. The theatre must create a connection between the performers and the audience. Everyone should feel engaged and not distant from the actors. The design of the auditorium is crucial; it should suit the human voice and body. If the space is too large, it can diminish the experience. Many theatres built in the late nineteenth century successfully created an intimate atmosphere. I appreciate theatres that show a sense of history, like worn stone steps in a church, reflecting layers of human experience. 
When it comes to plays, you cannot please everyone. You cannot predict what the audience will want to see. When you go to the theatre, you seek something unexpected; otherwise, you might as well stay home."
CPE_37,C2,"**Text:**
**Paul Simon**  
Rock and roll in the 1950s was mainly a music movement for young people, but it also had a significant effect on the middle class and older generations. It opened doors for the next wave of rock stars, who listened to this exciting and unusual music, knowing it would be an important part of their lives. For Paul Simon and many other young people in the US, the best way to hear this new music was through Alan Freed's radio show, Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party. Freed's show was essential listening for many young aspiring rock stars. Just like John Lennon, who was 3,000 miles away in Liverpool, listening to Radio Luxembourg—the only European station playing rock and roll—Paul Simon was captivated by the music from Freed's show. He was getting ready for the next big step for a teenager obsessed with rock and roll: moving from just listening to creating his own music.
**Snow**  
I couldn't see a clear path, but I thought I would be fine if I walked carefully. The wind was strong, pushing me over as I struggled on the icy ground. Suddenly, the snow that looked harmless gave way beneath me. I fell into a hole about four feet deep. The snow had formed a roof over a gap between two rocks, and when it melted, it left only a thin layer that I fell through. I managed to pull myself out, feeling shaken and worried about what would have happened if the hole had been much deeper. I leaned against a pine tree sticking out of the snow to think about my situation. After an hour, I had only gone about half a mile. It was clear that I would have to change my plans.
**Qualitative Research**  
There are many books that aim to help researchers understand qualitative research. While a lot has been said about how to collect data, these books often do not explain how to analyze that data. There is still a lot of confusion about how researchers go about analyzing their data. To address this, we invited various social scientists who have worked on qualitative projects to share the methods they used. The goal was to provide insight into the process of qualitative data analysis, rather than to create a guide for new researchers. This task involves making unclear processes clearer. Although this may seem easy, we have found it quite challenging. Therefore, we allowed our contributors to present their work in different styles, including personal stories and more formal approaches."
CPE_2,C2,"
**Screen Learning**  
Recently, I saw my six-year-old son eating noodles in a funny way. He was pulling them up with his teeth and pretending to be a dinosaur. He said, ""I'm a little dinosaur."" He was acting out a scene from a TV show, so I asked him what he remembered about dinosaurs. He didn’t remember much. There is a trend to use the internet and computers for learning, but is learning from a screen really effective? One writer shared his experience with an interactive program he tried with his son. The father read the words while the son played with the pictures. The father thought that if his son had spent ten minutes reading a book, he might have learned something. Research shows that learning happens best in an environment where there is conversation with teachers or parents. Technology can be useful for teaching our children, but traditional education is still very important.
**Hollywood**  
By 1918, most of the world’s film-making had moved to Hollywood. The local people were not happy, seeing their neighborhood in Los Angeles changed by these newcomers. However, they eventually accepted this change because of the American value of success, which is measured by box office earnings. Hollywood can recognize a good film, one that can create stars and make money. In less than a hundred years, Hollywood has transformed from a small village to a place as famous as New York, Rome, or Paris. Physically, it has changed a lot; a century ago, you would walk through orange groves to get to the village store. Yet, in some ways, it still feels like a small village, focused mainly on films: how much money they make, who is dating whom, and who is involved in which project. Many successful people try to leave Hollywood to live elsewhere, but it remains the main place for anyone in the entertainment industry.
**Photography**  
Photography was created by artists in the nineteenth century as a way to capture their surroundings. They wanted a lasting record of what they saw, and photography provided that. The combination of light, lenses, and special surfaces created images that were more detailed and realistic than what painters could create in a long time. This upset many artists, who initially enjoyed the new images but later claimed that photography could not be considered art. They believed that photography was too connected to reality and relied too much on machines to be a true expression of creativity. Despite this criticism, photographers recognized that they had discovered a new art form. They used photography like other artists use brushes and pencils to show their view of the world and its beauty.
**Book Illustration**  
During the time of black-and-white book illustrations, it was common for every children's book to have illustrations. This also applied to many novels for older children, which saw a decline in print runs. Although children's publishing was active, it often operated on a low budget, leading to many average-quality works. However, the best artists always submitted their best work. Therefore, the collection of black-and-white illustrations is a mix of both valuable and less valuable pieces, making it a great place for research and discovery. The best illustrations are likely to be shown to the public again, either through reprints of classic books or exhibitions of original works. There are signs that interest in this art form is growing again, and soon a publisher may create a series of classic children's book illustrations from this time, either by reprinting them or designing new editions using the original artwork."
CPE_68,C2,"Blogging: Sharing Our Lives Online**
Not long ago, a website warned about the dangers of public check-ins, which are online announcements of where you are. The message was clear: while you might think you are simply saying, ""Hey, I'm here,"" you are also letting many people know your location, including those you might not want to meet. This reflects a growing understanding that there can be negative consequences to the constant sharing that the internet encourages. 
The internet offers many exciting opportunities to share our lives with a global audience, which can lead to wealth and fame. However, as we dive into this online world, we often find ourselves overwhelmed and lost in the chaos of sharing personal stories and photos. This situation may seem discouraging, but there is hope. The path forward was laid out for us by early internet pioneers who explored these challenges long before social media existed.
In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started posting on the World Wide Web, which was mainly used by graduate students and scientists. The web was created at CERN, a physics lab in Switzerland, to help researchers share their work. Hall saw a different opportunity: to share his own life. He created a detailed online autobiography filled with personal stories, photos, and art. In January 1996, he began a daily blog, attracting many readers who were fascinated by his bold exploration of this new medium. Hall's approach was open; anyone who crossed his path could be featured on his site, and no topic was off-limits. While some might see this as exhibitionism, there was also a unique beauty to his work.
However, one day, visitors to Hall's site found it replaced by a single video titled ""Dark Night."" In it, he shared that he had fallen deeply in love, but when he wrote about it online, he was told, ""either the blog goes, or I do."" Hall felt that sharing his life online made people distrust him. The blog was removed, but the issue of sharing personal information remains. While sharing online can be enjoyable, expecting it to make people want to be close to you can lead to disappointment.
In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a young woman in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, an anonymous coworker shared her blog's address with the company's vice presidents, including some she had criticized, which led to her losing her job. Researchers studying online behavior have a term for this: the ""online distribution effect,"" which describes how people often feel they can say things online that they would never say in person. However, our online lives are connected to our real lives, and ignoring this can lead to serious mistakes.
Armstrong's story had a positive outcome. Although she was upset and stopped blogging for a while, she eventually got married and restarted her blog, focusing on her new family. Today, she is a well-known ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her household. Once a cautionary example of the risks of online sharing, she has now mastered the art of sharing her life carefully. Armstrong's experience teaches us an important lesson: just because the internet allows us to say anything, it doesn't mean we should."
CPE_23,C2,"Enough Sleep?**
Tiredness is often seen as a common issue in modern life. As wealthier and busier countries have developed, sleeplessness and anxiety have also increased. Research in the USA shows that 40 million Americans suffer from chronic sleep problems. Some popular novels in Britain even feature characters who cannot sleep or focus on sleep research. 
A key concern is that ""People need more sleep,"" says a sleep researcher. Many people reduce their sleep when they are busy, often waking up early to avoid traffic. Recently, a researcher conducted an experiment where participants were allowed to sleep for up to 14 hours a night for a month. After three weeks, they settled into an average of eight hours and fifteen minutes of sleep, showing a strong need for rest.
In Europe, a university sleep research lab in the English Midlands has studied various topics, including how fatigue affects sailors and the impact of airport noise on sleep. They recruit participants through student newspapers, offering £5 an hour and asking them to change their sleep patterns. Dr. Louise Reyner reassures participants who worry about electrodes on their heads, explaining that the lab focuses on physical aspects of sleep.
In a dark room, there is a motorway simulator where participants drive while answering questions. They are asked to come at 2 PM, a time when people naturally feel sleepy, especially after little or no sleep. As they drive, one participant tries hard to stay awake but begins to blink more frequently and eventually nods off, causing the car to drift off the road. Dr. Reyner suggests that drinking two cups of coffee can help someone stay alert for at least half an hour. She also recommends various products like energy drinks and caffeinated gum, especially for shift workers.
What do we know about sleep? Humans, like other mammals, follow a daily sleep cycle. When asleep, we go through four stages, from light sleep to deep sleep. Dreams usually happen during light sleep, and the brain temporarily paralyzes the body to prevent injuries. There are theories that sleep helps repair the body or restore muscles, but it is unclear if this happens faster during relaxed wakefulness. 
Scientists agree that women tend to sleep about half an hour longer than men, and older people generally need less sleep, though the reasons are unknown. Some researchers even suggest that sleep allows us to ""travel through time without injury.""
Historically, sleep patterns have changed. A history professor studied British sleep habits from 1500 to 1850 and found that people would go to bed early, wake up after midnight for a while, and then sleep again. This time was often used for reflection or even nighttime activities. However, by the 17th century, with the rise of artificial light, wealthier people began to adopt a more efficient sleep pattern. The industrial revolution further changed sleep habits, making people work longer hours in lit buildings.
In some non-western cultures, the old sleep patterns still exist. People may sleep for a few hours, wake up, and then sleep again. For some tribal societies, continuous sleep is difficult due to noise and the need to stay alert for dangers. It appears that people everywhere are in need of more sleep."
CPE_60,C2,"""We are talking about big cowboy boots. Really expensive boots. I stood in my 800-dollar designer cowboy boots on the rocks in the Arizona desert. Money was not a problem. I wore a complete cowboy outfit, and if you had the outfit, you might be a cowboy. But I was not. It wasn't working for me. I squinted into the morning sun, looking at the Arizona mountains, and I had to admit that I did not feel at home in the wild. After flying in from Denver just after dawn, I thought I might look like a cowboy arriving from the sky. But that feeling disappeared when I saw a real cowboy in the luggage area of Phoenix airport. He wore a sweat-stained t-shirt, needed a shave, and was lifting a dirty bag off the conveyor belt when he noticed my new cowboy boots. He raised one eyebrow and walked out without looking back.
There should be a suit of clothes that an ex-racing driver can wear without feeling out of place. Something that allows him to feel comfortable wherever he goes, without feeling like everyone else is moving at a slower pace. I loved being a racing driver and driving racing cars. I am addicted to it, and it is all I know how to do. But I don’t do it anymore. I couldn’t even if I wanted to. I wondered what I should do now. A racing driver should have one or two backup identities for when he stops racing. I thought I had some, but when I tried to reach for them, they vanished.
How about being a commentator at the racetrack? There were many former Indy and Formula One drivers wanting to be commentators. Or maybe I could partner with someone to sell classic cars? That idea lasted all winter with phone calls, lunches, lawyers, and meetings with bankers. But it was a bad year for selling old Ferraris, and in the end, I had to step back before I lost everything. Being an 'ex' anything is tough. Who wants to hear about how I almost became World Champion? Nobody wants to hear a story that ends with 'almost.' Even if I had been the champion, you would probably only want to listen for five minutes before getting bored. Last year’s champion is just that—last year.
Not that I want sympathy, which is good because I don’t get any. Why should I? I had a good career, made money, and saved enough. But I miss the thrill of getting into that powerful racing car with seven hundred horsepower. I miss going from zero to one hundred fifty miles an hour in 4.9 seconds. I even miss the danger of almost crashing every race. I miss the exciting people and the reporters who acted like my words mattered. Being somewhat famous has its perks. Businessmen and politicians liked to brag that they knew me. Little boys would sneak under fences to get my autograph. 
Now that I don’t drive anymore, I have a lot of free time. Just last week, the phone rang twice. I have time in the morning and afternoon, and tomorrow looks free too. I looked up at the clear blue sky. No buzzards flying above. Maybe Arizona doesn’t have buzzards. But a couple of small brown birds in a cactus nearby were warning me to leave their nest alone. I never thought the desert had songbirds. It made me realize that a fake cowboy in designer boots still has a lot to learn."""
CPE_1,C2,"Vancouver**
In the past ten years, many people from around the world have moved to Vancouver, a city in western Canada. In the evenings, residents walk through the city streets, and if you join them, you will likely hear different languages being spoken. People come to Vancouver for its mild weather, beautiful location between the ocean and mountains, clean and safe environment, and good educational and job opportunities. Although some locals may complain about the rapid construction of new buildings, it is clear that the new residents and growing tourism have contributed to a vibrant city life. Vancouver was once called 'Terminal City' because it served as a gateway to other places. Although this name is less common now, Vancouver is still a major gateway.
**Putting Pen to Paper**
Journalists like me often struggle with writing letters. Some say this is because we dislike writing for free, but I think it is more about how we aim for the best impact in our work, which makes writing a letter feel different. A true artist, who may rewrite their work many times, does not face this issue. I believe that understanding the impact of their words is a key sign of a real artist. When Shakespeare wrote his famous lines, he likely did not think about how the use of longer words made them powerful, even though it showed his talent as a writer.
**Supermarket Opening**
In Britain, the opening of a new supermarket used to be a big event. You could expect a celebrity, like a soap star or a member of the royal family, to come and cut the ribbon. Now, new supermarkets seem to open every day, and celebrities are no longer needed. Why pay a famous person when anyone can open it for free? Last week, waiting pensioners didn’t care who opened the new Superbuy store, as long as they were at the front of the line. According to one customer who knew someone working there, the first five men to enter would receive a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women would get a bunch of flowers. This news quickly spread through the crowd, making those at the front feel proud and causing envy among those who arrived later."
CPE_53,C2,"Citizen Kane**
When the film *Citizen Kane* was released in 1941, it created a lot of excitement, but it was not a financial success. The release was delayed because the distributors were worried about the possible reactions of William Randolph Hearst, who was thought to be the inspiration for the main character. Despite this, the film received very positive reviews. It was television that later brought the film back into the public's attention. *Citizen Kane* is often seen as the film that has motivated many people to become filmmakers. This is surprising because it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles believed that its success came from his lack of knowledge about the rules of filmmaking; he simply went ahead and created the film. He also had a talented team, including cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and special-effects expert Linwood Dunn. When Welles and Mankiewicz decided to create a story about a newspaper tycoon who was similar to Hearst but not exactly like him, Welles realized he had found a great opportunity for himself as both director and actor, and he took it with great enthusiasm.
**Dermot and Carmel**
That morning, Dermot thought Carmel seemed a bit strange. He had mentioned twice that he might be late and that he might stop by the golf club on his way home to talk to someone. Carmel had nodded politely, as if she didn’t really understand. ""Will you be okay? What are you planning to do today?"" he asked. She smiled and replied, ""It's funny you ask. I was just thinking I have nothing to do today, so I might walk downtown and look at the shops. I feel like it would be almost wrong to waste the day."" Dermot smiled back, saying, ""You deserve to enjoy yourself. And if I’m late, I won’t need any food, so don’t worry about it."" ""That’s fine,"" she said.
**Title Race**
""Tea boy? Do you mind? I’m a mobile lukewarm beverage resource facilitator."" Human nature often creates amusing situations. A recent study revealed that job titles are a major source of jealousy and dissatisfaction at work. A survey by a well-known recruitment firm found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees believe that job titles create divisions among coworkers. Surprisingly, 70% of office workers said they would give up a pay raise for a more ""motivational"" or ""professional"" job title. If our desire for status is so strong that it overcomes our basic need for money, we are in a troubling situation. In the early twenty-first century, no one wants to be called subordinate. The job titles being discussed focus on skills (like specialist or coordinator) but are really just fancy words."
CPE_55,C2,"**The Vienna Assignment**
I was in Vienna to take photographs, which was usually why I traveled. Photography was not just my job; it was a big part of my life. The way light fell on different surfaces always inspired me. I believed that a single photograph could capture the essence of a moment, a place, or a person. I often thought that at any moment, I could take the perfect picture, as long as I had film in my camera. My approach was simple: finish one roll, load another, and keep my eyes open. This had been my way of working for a long time.
Once, I had a brief moment of fame when a photo I took of a smoke plume from a burning oil well became popular worldwide. It was mostly luck, but they say you create your own opportunities, both good and bad. After that, I decided to work freelance, which seemed like a smart choice. However, life had other plans, and the mid-nineties were not as successful as I had hoped, especially after my photo made the cover of Time magazine. That’s why I found myself in Vienna instead of somewhere more exciting. But I was still taking photographs, and I was getting paid for it, which I thought was good.
The assignment came about by chance. I had previously taken photos for a coffee-table book called *Four Cities in Four Seasons*, which featured London, Paris, Rome, and Vienna. I had received a nice commission for capturing my city in different seasons. I had my own unique style, showcasing the beauty of Hyde Park in spring and the busy streets of Piccadilly in summer. I knew that some of my best work would be overlooked since it was just a picture book, not something meant to challenge people's views.
After a cold snap over Christmas, I submitted my winter photos of London and learned that the Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, had left his job in Vienna for unknown reasons. Instead of hiring someone new, they offered me his position. The Austrian publishers liked my work, and I was available, unlike the French and Italian photographers. I was eager to go because things at home were not going well. A week in snowy Vienna sounded like a great opportunity.
They arranged for me to stay at the Europa hotel in the heart of the old city. My last visit to Vienna had been a busy weekend with my wife, where we rushed through many palaces and museums. It had been hot and chaotic, and I hadn’t taken many photos. This time, being alone in the cold January weather would be different. I felt it the moment I arrived and saw the beautiful light over the snow-covered roofs of the city. I was excited to take great pictures.
On my first day, I didn’t rush to take photos. Instead, I rode the trams around the Ringstrasse, getting on and off to experience the city’s atmosphere. The weather was cold and still, reflecting the grand history of the city. I hadn’t seen what Schussner had captured in the other seasons, and I didn’t want to. This was going to be my Vienna, and I was ready to discover it.
A photograph captures a moment, but you have to wait for the right moment to come. So, I took my time, observing everything until I felt ready. The next morning, I woke up early. The fresh snow meant that Stephansplatz would be beautifully white and almost empty. I struggled to find a way to capture the cathedral in one shot. Its tall spire reached into the grey sky, while at ground level, it was massive and imposing. I realized I might have to focus on just part of it. In that weather and at that time, it could still be magical.
Photography has always had a sense of magic. Even the early pioneers felt this before they fully understood the chemistry behind it. You can watch a blank sheet of paper turn into a photograph in a dark room. Even when you know how it works, the mystery remains. Perhaps that’s why what happened at Stephansplatz that morning didn’t surprise me in a strange way."
CPE_50,C2,"Kinetic Art**
Exciting news: London's Hayward Gallery has changed into a place of wonder. This transformation is not due to a big-budget, flashy event, but rather a unique exploration of a lesser-known part of the last 60 years. A new exhibition looks at the history of kinetic art, which is art that involves movement, throughout the twentieth century. It shows that creating artworks that move on their own or explore the idea of movement has been a consistent, though often overlooked, theme in some of the most interesting creative work of this century. 
The exhibition features a wonderful collection of paintings, drawings, documents, and films about kinetic art, curated by Guy Brett, who has dedicated his life to studying this subject. The artworks are mostly presented without much text, allowing visitors to enjoy discovering connections and insights on their own.
**David Hockney**
David Hockney's art attracts many people who might not usually be interested in art. This could be because his work is figurative and easy to understand, or because it focuses on leisure and escape from daily life. Some people might even be drawn to Hockney's charming personality and his clever comments, making him popular for reasons unrelated to his art. However, this does not mean that his art lacks serious purpose. 
Some critics believe Hockney is an overrated minor artist. In response, one could argue that he seems minor only because it is often frowned upon to be so popular today, not because his work lacks depth. Hockney himself is realistic about his limitations and believes it is not important to dismiss his work just because it does not fit a certain idea of greatness. He does not claim to be a great artist and understands that only future generations can truly judge his importance.
**Window-shopping - an Art Exhibition**
In recent years, I have attended many contemporary art exhibitions, some brilliant and others mediocre. What frustrates me are shows that seem to push a specific agenda, suggesting a common viewpoint among certain artists. Sometimes this approach works, revealing new trends in seemingly unrelated works. More often, however, it highlights a questionable angle or a forced concept. 
As a curator, I wanted to create a show that opposed this trend. Along with seven artists, I took over a space in an empty warehouse. 'Window-shopping' was meant to be a collection of individual artworks that connected only by being labeled as art. For example, Sam Cole's knitted cats chased each other on a toy train track, while Matthew Crawley filmed a video camera, opened it, and poked around until it broke, creating flickering images on a monitor. 
These works did not fit into a specific theme and would not usually be shown together, but they complemented each other. I did not make grand statements about contemporary art, but I believe that art is fundamentally an individual activity where artists set their own rules.
**Art History**
People who enjoy paintings sometimes hesitate to analyze them, fearing it will ruin their enjoyment. Some believe that art historians, who focus on theory rather than practice, overlook the joy of viewing art and the special act of creating it. This idea is similar to thinking that knowing a recipe and cooking method takes away from the taste of a dish. 
Understanding the importance of enjoyment does not mean we cannot have a deep knowledge of the art we appreciate. In fact, knowing more about what we are viewing can enhance our pleasure. Additionally, pleasure is complex. How we sense and recognize pleasure is influenced by our history and society. Our preferences for certain characteristics in art are shaped not just by our genes or personalities, but also by the values of the society we live in. 
While we should not underestimate the importance of instinctive responses to art, the belief that intellectual understanding diminishes enjoyment is an outdated idea that once promoted art as an alternative to thought."
CPE_25,C2,"**Metals**  
Stone Age people may have been interested in metals because they wanted to decorate themselves. While sitting by a river, waiting for fish, one of our early ancestors might have found a shiny yellow stone and picked it up. It felt different from regular stones and was very attractive. This could be how gold became important to early humans. Because gold is easy to shape, it quickly became a popular material. Copper might have also been discovered by chance, and once people realized how useful copper tools were, they actively searched for copper ores and ways to extract the metal. This led to the development of metalworking, which improved the lives of our ancestors.
**St Ives**  
We walked down a narrow, cobbled street towards the town, struggling with our heavy bags against the strong wind and trying to avoid the cold waves crashing over the promenade. The streets were empty, and all the cottage shutters along the waterfront were tightly closed. We had seen the weather get worse as we arrived in St Ives on a small train. With the dark skies above, visiting Cornwall in the off-season without a car didn’t seem like a great idea anymore. I had convinced my friend to come with me by promising beautiful walks along the Cornish coast and cozy evenings by the fire.
**Computer Modelling**  
Studying the past is challenging because it is gone. The people who lived in times of peace and hardship are no longer here. The reasons they settled in certain places or formed families and communities have been forgotten. Archaeology gives us some clues, but we cannot test our ideas with experiments on past cultures. We cannot go back in time to see what happened. However, computer modelling allows us to recreate ancient landscapes and environments, filling them with virtual communities that have some needs and abilities like real humans. We can set rules for these communities and simulate social groups. Then, we can change the weather or increase the population and observe how these digital societies and their artificial people respond."

**Vervet Monkeys**  
Cheney and Seyfarth studied vervet monkeys and observed a dominant male in a group. One day, he saw a strange male nearby, who seemed interested in joining the group. If the stranger succeeded, the current male could lose his position. To keep the stranger away, the dominant male cleverly made an alarm call that vervet monkeys use to warn of a leopard. This scared the stranger back into the trees. He repeated this tactic whenever the stranger approached. However, the dominant male made a mistake. After using the alarm call several times, he called out while casually walking across the open ground, which could have revealed his trick.
**What Cats Catch**  
In a survey in the English village of Felmersham, residents recorded what their cats caught over a year. Seventy cats caught over 1,000 prey items. An American professor estimated that the cat population in Britain might kill 100 million birds and small mammals each year based on these numbers. However, this estimate is misleading. Most cats live in towns and catch fewer animals than those in the survey. The important question is whether these numbers are sustainable. The answer seems to be yes. In winter, many people feed birds, and gardens provide nesting sites, keeping bird populations above natural levels. The survey showed that while cats are significant predators, they are not destroying Britain's bird population.
**Buffalo's Day**  
Buffaloes are very important to the marshmen, who care for them deeply. Each morning, the buffaloes, after sleeping on platforms or near the fire with their owners, slowly leave for the reed beds beyond the water. They often groan about their tiredness before the leader finally steps forward and enters the water. Once in the water, they seem to forget their purpose and wallow there, making low sounds of complaint. Their movements away from the house are slow and almost unnoticed, but eventually, they swim, appearing to struggle to keep their noses above the water. They spend the day among the reeds, grazing on green shoots at their eye level.
**Picasso, Pablo**  
In 1940, Picasso painted several still lifes of fish while staying in the fishing port of Royan. One painting shows a fishmonger's slab with a crab and some soles. Despite being on the slab, the fish look alive. The painting is complex, with overlapping transparent shapes and delicate colors, creating a calm underwater scene. However, there is tension as the fish seem to be preparing for a fight with the crab. The sharp shapes in the painting, including a chain around one fish, add a sense of danger and hidden violence, giving the artwork a deeper meaning."
CPE_12,C2,"Photography**
Over the last 150 years, photography has been used to capture many aspects of human life and activities. In this relatively short time, photography has improved its ability to record moments in time and space, allowing us to see both large and small details. It has given us images from faraway places, distant parts of the solar system, and the complex social issues of modern life. Photography has become one of the most important ways to express what it means to be human.
However, the idea of recording events visually has a much longer history. The earliest forms of visual recording date back to the Upper Paleolithic period, around 35,000 years ago. We cannot be sure why early cave paintings were created. They might have recorded actual hunting events, served as magic to help with hunting, acted as religious symbols, or simply brightened daily life. Nevertheless, visual images are deeply connected to human culture.
Throughout history, people have questioned how accurate visual images are and what role they play in society. The saying ""seeing is believing"" has given special importance to visual images. When photography was invented in the mid-1800s, it seemed to promise a truthful visual record. It was seen as the peak of Western visual representation, with the camera working like the human eye to create fixed images that closely resembled what we see. The chemical process used to fix images allowed for the capture of what we consider natural phenomena.
At the same time, photography was viewed as a sophisticated cultural achievement, producing images that artists had long tried to create through skill and practice. Ironically, because photography seemed so realistic, it was thought that everyone could easily understand photographs. This led to the idea that photography might be a ""universal language."" For instance, in 1933, photographer August Sander suggested that even the most isolated person could understand a photograph of the sky, whether it showed the sun, moon, or stars.
However, as global communication increased in the late twentieth century, we must consider how well photographic images can cross cultural boundaries. Is photography limited by cultural conventions like any other form of communication, such as language? Has our familiarity with photographs led us to overlook the complex ways they convey vivid impressions of reality? Photography is often seen as providing convincing evidence, making it seem transparent and blurring the line between our perception of the world and its photographic representations. It is common for someone to show a photograph and say, ""This is my grandson.""
Since its invention in 1839, photography and the attitudes towards it have changed significantly. This change may be partly due to photography moving into what we might call ""mythic time."" Its original role as a record-keeper has evolved, and photographs, once closely tied to the photographer and subject, have become historical documents. These images often reveal as much, if not more, about the people and society that created them than about the subjects themselves.
I aim to show that the camera is not just a silent recorder of events. Photography does not merely reflect culture; it can also inspire social and political change. For example, it is hard to imagine the cultural shifts of the Italian Renaissance in the fifteenth century without acknowledging how the development of perspective changed visual representation. Similarly, photography has played a significant role in shaping the media culture of our time, while also bringing the harsh realities of the world into our everyday lives."
CPE_26,C2,"**How to Write Poetry**
Telling people how to write poetry can be tricky. While creativity is important, making one mistake can lead to confusion. I believe that for beginners, the best advice is to read a lot, write often, and let your imagination flow freely, as long as it doesn’t lead to chaos. Some people need a stable life to write poetry, while others find inspiration in their struggles. Some writers follow a schedule, while others wait for a moment of inspiration. All approaches are valid, as long as they don’t follow strict rules. The key is to find your own voice and nurture it, allowing it to grow until it can stand on its own.
**The Short Story**
In a short story, it’s important not to overcrowd it with too many characters or long descriptions. Flashbacks should be brief and only used when necessary to clarify a point. One effective way to include a flashback is through a character’s memory, which can help move the story forward at a critical moment, but it should not slow down the action. Dialogue is often more effective than lengthy explanations, as it can show different perspectives quickly and keep the reader engaged. Overwriting can ruin a short story, but being brief doesn’t mean it should feel incomplete. Both conflict and action need to be strong in a short story, but the challenge is to make every word count in a limited space.
**Screenplays**
Writing a screenplay is similar to playing chess. Most players make moves without knowing exactly what will happen next. They might see a few moves ahead, but often play without a clear plan. As players gain experience, they learn that chess is more about long-term strategy than short-term tactics. They start to see the game as a whole, recognizing patterns and strategies, such as openings and endgames. Similarly, the more you write screenplays, the more you understand their complexities.
**Looking at Writing**
Humans naturally learn to speak, as seen in young children, but writing is not instinctive. Charles Darwin noted that while language is a natural human ability, written language is not. All societies have language, and while languages evolve, they do not necessarily improve. Children learn to speak without formal lessons, and when they lack a common language, they create their own. In contrast, writing systems have been developed only a few times in history and often started as simple codes. Until recently, many children did not learn to read or write, and even today, some struggle with it. Children are naturally inclined to speak, but learning to write is a skill that requires effort and instruction. It is essential to understand how writing works and how to help children connect their thoughts with written language."
CPE_8,C2,"""I have never started a novel with so much uncertainty. If I call it a novel, it is only because I don't know what else to call it. I have a small story to tell, and I do not end with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave my reader hanging. This book is about my memories of a man I only met occasionally, and I do not know much about what happened to him in between our meetings. I could invent details to make my story more complete, but I do not want to do that. I just want to share what I know. To protect the privacy of living people, I have given the characters in this story names I made up, and I have taken care to ensure that no one can recognize them. The man I am writing about is not famous, and he may never be. When his life ends, he might leave no more trace of his existence than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the water's surface. If my book is read, it will be for its own interest. However, it is possible that his way of life and the unique qualities of his character may influence others, so that long after he is gone, people may realize that a remarkable person lived in this time. Then it will be clear who I am writing about, and those who want to know a bit about his early life may find something useful in this book. I believe my book, despite its limitations, will be a helpful source of information for my friend's biographers. I do not claim that the conversations I recorded are exact. I never took notes during our talks, but I remember well what matters to me. Although I have put these conversations in my own words, I believe they accurately reflect what was said. I mentioned earlier that I have invented nothing, but I have taken the liberty that historians take to create dialogues for characters that I did not hear. I did this to make the scenes more lively and believable, as they would be less effective if told plainly. I want to be read, and I think I am justified in making my book engaging. A thoughtful reader will easily see where I have used this technique and can choose to ignore it. 
Another reason I feel nervous about this work is that the people I mainly discuss are from a different culture. It is hard to truly know people, and I believe one can only really know their own countrymen. People are shaped by many factors: the place they were born, the home they grew up in, the games they played, the food they ate, the schools they attended, the sports they followed, and the poets they read. All these experiences shape who they are, and you cannot understand them just by hearing about them; you must live them. You can only know them if you are one of them. Because you cannot fully understand people from a different nation except through observation, it is challenging to give them authenticity in a book. I have never tried to write about anyone but my own countrymen, and if I have done so in short stories, it is because those allow for a more general treatment of characters. You can give the reader broad hints and let them fill in the details. In this book, I do not claim that my characters see themselves as they truly are; they are viewed, like my main character, through my own perspective."""
CPE_4,C2,"**POETRY RECITALS**
At any time in history, the world of literature can seem confusing to those experiencing it. However, later generations often find it easier to see clear patterns and important figures in literature. Currently, there is a complex mix of poetic styles, different types of poetry, and various opinions on how poetry should be presented, criticized, and taught. 
The main discussion in contemporary poetry is about the tension between serious 'literary' poets, who write poems meant to be read on the page, and 'popular' poets, who prefer to perform their work for an audience. This division is not strict. Over the last twenty years, public poetry readings have become more common in many forms. Small literary groups in towns hold readings in community centers or members' homes; schools and colleges invite poets to speak to students; and arts festivals often feature readings by well-known poets.
The impact of these events, where poets often have to perform in public, is varied and uncertain. For 'pop' poets, whose work is designed for live audiences, public performance is beneficial. Their poems are usually simple and can be understood easily in one hearing. However, when these poems are read on the page, their weaknesses in thought and technique may become apparent.
On the other hand, poets who are dedicated to their craft and aim to create deep and meaningful work may not be appreciated by audiences who are hearing their poems for the first time. The risk is that these poets might choose to read only their simplest work to connect quickly with the audience, which may not represent their best writing.
Attending poetry readings cannot replace reading poetry from a book, but it can be enjoyable and educational. Hearing skilled poets read their work, even if they are not great speakers, helps the audience understand the important parts of the poems. It is best if the audience has the text in front of them or knows the poems beforehand.
The main reason for popular poetry readings, which sometimes include music, is to help audiences enjoy poetry and see it as an art form for everyone, not just a select few."

Historians increasingly use oral evidence, but this approach has challenges. It is overly simplistic to think that a person's testimony is a clear reflection of their past experiences. In an interview, both the historian and the informant influence each other. The historian chooses the informant and the topic of discussion. Even if the historian only listens, their presence can change the way the informant remembers and shares their past. The final account is shaped by the historian's social position and their understanding of history, which may also affect how the informant views their own experiences. Thus, historians must acknowledge their role in creating new evidence. The challenges continue even after the interview. The informant's memories are not direct connections to the past; they can be influenced by other sources, such as the media. Memories may also be colored by nostalgia or feelings of loss that developed later in life. While emotions can make the testimony seem convincing, they may reflect later experiences rather than the actual past.
**Animal Science**  
Animal science has two main approaches: physiological and whole animal. Physiologists focus on how the body functions, including how nerves, muscles, and senses work together to create complex behaviors. Those who study the whole animal look at the behavior of animals in their natural state and the factors that influence it. Within this approach, there are psychologists and ethologists. Psychologists often conduct experiments in labs with a limited number of species, like rats and pigeons. Ethologists study natural, unlearned behaviors of animals in the wild. Although these distinctions still exist, there is now a beneficial merging of the two fields. Physiologists often claim that their methods are more fundamental. However, understanding how nerve cells work does not eliminate the need to study behavior at a broader level. Behavior has its own structure and units that must be considered. Trying to explain a bird's nest-building behavior solely through nerve cell activity would be like trying to read a book with a powerful microscope.
**The Social Sciences**  
Students studying social sciences for the first time face a dual challenge. They need to learn both the content of their new subject and the methods used to study it. This means they must understand not only the knowledge and research findings in textbooks but also the methods used to gather and organize that knowledge. These two aspects are closely connected. While we all have experience with social life, social sciences go beyond common sense. Each discipline focuses on specific aspects of social life, uses particular research methods, and has its own concepts. These concepts form the logical foundation of the subject, allowing social scientists to move beyond everyday understanding and differentiate one discipline from another.
**Classical Architecture**  
In the classical world of Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building structures. According to the Roman architect Vitruvius, architecture involves order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, propriety, and distribution. He also provides Greek equivalents for some of these terms, likely based on earlier Greek sources that are now lost. While utility and function are not part of his initial definition, Vitruvius later discusses the best forms and arrangements for different types of buildings. At the outset, the focus is on aesthetics, viewing architecture as an art. The origins of classical architecture are complex, with a long history of simple structures in Greece and Italy that did not meet Vitruvius' artistic standards. Although these early structures may seem basic, they contributed essential elements that influenced later architectural concepts. Despite its elaborate appearance, the classical temple essentially resembles a simple, single-room hut."
CPE_7,C2,"The two sisters kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for a while. She would drive around the gardens and the railway line, even jumping over a small bridge with all four wheels in the air, which was her only mistake. After that, they would pass the gasworks, which smelled of sulphur. Surprisingly, Chen found it funny that his wife was driving without him knowing. ""So you can really drive, Lily? Well done!"" he said. Mui thought it was strange that her brother-in-law was not upset. Instead, he was excited and made plans with Lily for a trip. They decided to go on a Monday at the start of next month, the quietest day of the week, leaving early in the morning and returning by midday to avoid losing customers. In the meantime, Lily would practice driving around the gardens. Despite her doubts, Mui bought a road map and got a ten percent discount, which impressed Chen, although Lily felt a bit insulted by Mui's lack of trust in her navigation skills.
Within an hour of leaving home, they were looking at the English Channel. Lily drove very well. Even Mui, who was in the back seat ready to give directions, had to admit this. On the road, Lily overtook a few slow cars with great skill, making Mui hold back her protests. Chen even applauded her. After passing the gasworks in the seaside town, they drove smoothly along the empty promenade. Lily parked in a small street off the seafront, where there were many empty spaces. She was unsure about the road signs and preferred to pay for parking rather than risk getting a ticket. 
Lily noticed her sister's worried face in the driving mirror and thought it best not to add to her worries. She locked all the van doors carefully. ""Don't worry,"" Chen joked. ""No one will want that old thing."" The sisters were offended. Lily accused Chen of being ungrateful, and Mui scolded him for being too quick to judge by appearances. Surprised, Chen took Man Kee ahead to look at the grey sea. He held his son on the railing, and Man Kee, a warm and responsive child, placed his tiny hand on his father's sleeve. In that moment, Chen decided to raise his son his way, giving him a good education in business, which was Chen's own weak point, so that he could own many restaurants one day.
The gloomy sea made Chen feel thoughtful as he planned Man Kee's future. He saw smoke on the horizon and then, sparkling in the morning sun, a ship appeared. Chen put a coin in a telescope and tried to find the ship. At first, he couldn't see it, but then he finally spotted it—a large, rusty tramp steamer. He lifted Man Kee to the telescope. ""Do you see the ship, Son?"" he asked gently. ""It’s a special ship for people like us. It may be small and old, but we know it will take us back home when we are done here. It will take you to your homeland, which you have never seen."" Chen kissed the top of Man Kee's head. Lily and Mui were behind them. Lily put her arm around Chen's shoulders. ""The little old ship,"" Chen said. ""Let your mother see, Son."" Man Kee didn't want to let go of the telescope, and when he finally did, the view was just a blurry circle of light. By the time Chen found another coin, the ship had disappeared over the horizon, leaving Lily with a view of seagulls flying over the water."
CPE_43,C2,"**THE WELL**
I had read that if you dig a deep enough hole, you can see the stars on a clear day. I convinced you to help me with my idea. You watched, eyes wide, as I pulled up the well bucket, steadied it on the wall, and then climbed in. I asked you to lower me down. I didn’t think about how heavy the bucket would be or that you might not be strong enough to hold it. You held the handle, trying to help as I pushed the bucket off the edge. As soon as it was free, I fell. You screamed and tried to stop it, but then you let go. I fell into the well and hit my head. At that moment, I didn’t realize I had achieved part of my plan. I saw strange lights, like the stars I usually saw in cartoons when a character got hurt. At first, I was dazed, then scared, then relieved, and finally angry at you for letting me fall and worried about what Mother would say.
You called down to check if I was okay. I opened my mouth to shout, but then I heard panic in your voice, and I couldn’t speak. I lay still, just able to see you through my eyelashes. You disappeared, calling for help. I waited a moment, then climbed back up and pulled myself over the edge, landing on the courtyard stones. I heard alarmed voices coming from the castle’s main door. I ran the other way, down to the passage leading to the moat bridge, and hid in the shadows. Mother and Father appeared with you and old Arthur; Mother was screaming and waving her hands. Father shouted for Arthur to pull on the winch handle. You stood back, looking pale and shocked. I was hidden in the shadows, feeling a rush of excitement. Then I noticed the drops of water I had left from the well to where I stood. I looked in horror at the dark spots of dirty water on the dry stones. At my feet, the water had formed a small pool. I looked back into the courtyard, where Father was shining a flashlight down into the well. The drops sparkled in the sunlight. I couldn’t believe no one had seen them. Mother was now screaming loudly, a sound I had never heard before. It shook me deeply. What was I to do? I had gotten back at you, but now things were more serious than I expected. What started as a fun prank had quickly turned into something that would lead to serious punishment, likely for me. I regretted not thinking this through. 
Suddenly, a plan came to me. I gathered my courage and left my hiding place, staggering out and blinking. I called out softly, one hand on my forehead, then yelled louder when no one responded. I stumbled a bit further and then fell dramatically on the stones. Sitting up, comforted by my crying mother, I sighed and said, “Oh dear,” smiling bravely. I claimed that I had found a secret tunnel from the bottom of the well to the moat, and that I crawled and swam through it until I got out and climbed up the bridge. I thought I was almost getting away with it until Father squatted in front of me. He asked me to repeat my story. I hesitated. His eyes narrowed. Thinking I was filling in gaps, I said the secret passage had collapsed after me; there was no point in sending someone down to look for it. I insisted the well was dangerous and that I had barely escaped with my life. 
Looking into my father’s eyes felt like looking into a dark tunnel with no light at the end. It was as if he was seeing me for the first time, and I was seeing how the world looked from an adult’s perspective. My words got stuck in my throat. “Don’t be ridiculous, boy,” he said, with more contempt than I thought possible. He stood up and walked away. Arthur looked down at me, his expression sad and troubled. He seemed to want to shake his head, not because I had a scary adventure and was unfairly disbelieved by my father, but because he could see through my desperate lie. He worried about the character and future of a child who lied so easily. His pity felt like a harsh rebuke, even more painful than my father’s words. It made me realize that this was the mature judgment of my actions, and it affected me deeply."
CPE_51,C2,"**Removal Day**
With her children now grown, Susan, who is a widow, faces the difficult task of leaving her family home. The van, labeled 'Removers of Distinction', was busy taking away everything that made the house special. Fred, the removal man, carefully packed fragile items with his large hands, while his team worked less gently. The house was beautiful, a four-story building overlooking a small harbor. Memories of her children growing up filled the air, like dust that stirs when disturbed. 
When they first bought the house, her son Robert, who was five at the time, had asked, ""Mum, how do you get a house home?"" It was easy to miss the little boy he once was, especially now that he was helping with the move, making sure Susan didn’t forget about the piano. Francesca, their daughter, was also there, insisting that only she could take care of the valuable Steinway piano.
Fred noticed Susan's calm demeanor and commented, ""She doesn’t look like she’s going to cry."" Susan was curious, asking, ""Do people cry?"" Fred replied, ""You’d be surprised. They seem happy while packing, but then they cry in an empty room. They’re fine once they reach the new place; it’s just hard to see everything taken apart.""
Susan could understand that feeling. If it were up to her, she would have warned the movers about the piano before they started. But Robert insisted it was the movers' responsibility to notice any issues. The piano stood alone in the best room of the house, and they planned to move it last.
Sitting on the bottom stair, with all the chairs gone, Susan remembered the day they moved in. Today felt like that day played in reverse—the piano had been the first item brought in, but it got stuck on the stairs. The removal team struggled for nearly two hours, while little Robert watched in fascination and Francesca cried, ""We can’t live in a house without a piano!"" They had to find a way to get it inside, and her late husband, Peter, had solved the problem. 
They left the piano outside while they moved in the other furniture. The next day, a builder removed the first-floor window, and a crane was borrowed to lift the piano through the opening. The children were overjoyed to see it finally inside. However, the process had cost a lot, and it took months before they could afford to have the piano tuned.
Peter had said, ""That’s there for ever."" But forever is a long time. The children became too busy to visit often, and Susan found it harder to move around the house. She thought about the stairs, remembering how the banister rails had never been perfectly fixed. She should have warned the movers about the piano, but it was too late now. 
Fred asked, ""Are you all right?"" as he reminded her that the piano was the last item to move. Susan felt panic rising. Robert and Francesca appeared in the hallway to watch. Fred casually asked, ""No tears then?"" Susan was close to crying. It was strange how moving items made them feel so important. 
Just then, the piano appeared at the top of the stairs, with Fred guiding it down. ""Easy does it!"" he called out as they carefully brought it down and placed it behind the van. Robert was the first to laugh, and soon they were all laughing together, relieved that it was over. As they walked down the path for the last time, the only tears Susan shed were tears of laughter."
CPE_11,C2,"Online Literary Criticism for Everyone**
**Do-it-yourself literary criticism: Is it just harmless fun?**
From the beginning, one of the main ideas behind the Internet was to allow open access. In theory, anyone could publish their thoughts or share music online. However, in the early days, some technical skills were needed. Still, there was one area that truly became accessible to everyone: literary criticism. By visiting Amazon.com, the first popular online bookstore, anyone could try writing book reviews. 
Amazon's approach to book reviews was simple: anyone could share their opinion and give a book up to five stars. Each book had its own page, and when a reader wrote a review, it appeared automatically. This allowed Amazon to fill its site with free reviews, and potential buyers could see what other readers thought, rather than just relying on publisher descriptions or professional critics.
Other online bookstores, which also had physical stores, offered similar features. However, Amazon was the largest, controlling over 80% of the online market. This meant it had the most customers and received the most reviews, which sometimes led to problems. Thousands of reviews were submitted daily, and Amazon did not disclose the exact number, making it hard to check them all. A team of editors reviewed the site to ensure that the reviews followed the company's rules. For example, one-word reviews or personal attacks on authors were not allowed, nor were reviews that revealed the ending or referenced other reviews. However, since reviewers could remain anonymous, inappropriate reviews were only removed if Amazon's editors noticed them. This created opportunities for mischief. 
For instance, authors could write positive reviews for their own books. One author, Lev Grossman, was upset by the negative reviews of his first novel, so he wrote several anonymous positive reviews to balance things out. His trick worked until he wrote an article admitting to it, and then the fake reviews were removed. Authors could also comment on their books by clicking a link that said, ""I am the Author, and I wish to comment on my book."" Most authors used this feature to encourage readers to buy and enjoy their books. Some even shared their email addresses for direct communication. However, while Amazon checked these comments, it did not verify that they were from the actual authors, except for well-known writers. 
In one case, a lesser-known writer pretended to be famous author John Updike in a comment, claiming to be an ""over-hyped middlebrow author."" Unsurprisingly, this was identified as a fake and removed. The real drama began with reader reviews, not author comments. When James McElroy's book, *We've Got Spirit*, about a small-town cheerleading team, was published, it received good reviews from the mainstream press. However, many people mentioned in the book felt hurt, and they used Amazon to express their anger through negative reviews. These reviews, however, disappeared after a few days. 
Despite this, Amazon saw the large number of people writing and reading reviews as beneficial for business. Reviews were meant to be a ""forum to talk about a book,"" not a chat room, so Amazon paid special attention to bestselling books to ensure that all reviews followed the rules. This meant that silly reviews were more likely to appear on pages for less popular books. For example, *The Story about Ping*, a classic children's book about a duck, inspired humorous reviews because ""ping"" is also a term used in Internet technology. One long review even compared the book's plot to Internet architecture, claiming it provided a ""good high-level overview"" of networking concepts. 
However, such silliness was rare. Most reviewers on Amazon took their contributions seriously, and overall, the reviews gave a good indication of whether a product was worth buying. The writer George Orwell once said that reviewing too many books required inventing feelings about books that one did not actually have. This makes the democratization of the review process a positive development."
CPE_14,C2,"Art in Modern Times**
In recent years, especially over the last two hundred years, we often think that every artist must challenge the art of their time. Art is celebrated for being unique, revolutionary, and sometimes shocking. We enjoy admiring artists whose work was not valued in the past. However, when it comes to contemporary art, we often hesitate and claim that some artists have gone too far, suggesting that their work is no longer art. The media often reflects this sentiment, and we tend to agree because we expect to be confused by the constant change in art. This expectation makes us overlook the traditional themes and techniques that still exist in modern art. We want artists to be different from us, with special talents that break the rules. In the past, people commissioned artists for specific purposes, and art was part of everyday life. Today, we leave artists to work independently and sometimes become frustrated if they try to connect with us.
**Picture This**
I will describe a situation and then ask an important question about it. An artist selects a piece of text from an art book that discusses the variety of pictures. The text asks, ""What are they all about?"" and concludes, ""There is no end to the different kinds of pictures."" This language may seem childish, but stay with me. The artist then asks someone to prepare a canvas and take it to a sign painter. He instructs the sign painter to write the chosen text on the canvas in simple black letters without any decoration. The sign painter follows these instructions. My important question is: is the final product a painting?
**Underground Encounters**
At the Mercury Gallery in London until June 26, there is an unspoken rule in the art world: once an artist finds success in a particular style, they should stick to it. Collectors expect artists to continue producing similar work, and if they try something new, it is often met with disappointment. I am not sure why this is the case. Gallery owners prefer to take safe risks, and perhaps art buyers feel more secure with familiar styles. However, some artists break this pattern and succeed, like Picasso and Hockney. Eric Rimmington is another artist who is trying something different. His new exhibition replaces the still lifes that made him famous with paintings inspired by the London Underground. Rimmington finds a unique charm in railways. His sketches from the 1980s of King's Cross Station led him to explore the underground world. This has resulted in ""Underground Encounters,"" an exhibition of 40 paintings and drawings that capture the fascinating atmosphere of this hidden world.
**Extract from a Novel**
I have come to this island with a few books. I use the word ""escape"" because the villagers jokingly say that only a sick person would choose such a remote place to recover. So, I have come here to heal myself. Besides an old peasant who comes daily on her mule to clean, I am quite alone. I feel neither happy nor sad; I am suspended in a mix of memories. I mentioned the uselessness of art but did not speak about its comforts. The true comfort of my work lies in the fact that, in the silence of a painter or writer, reality can be reshaped and revealed in a meaningful way. Our everyday actions often hide the deeper meaning of life. For artists, there is joy in using art to confront what has hurt us in life, not to escape from it, but to fulfill our true potential through imagination. Otherwise, why should we cause each other pain?"
CPE_63,C2,"**Family Business**
""Listen, this isn't good!"" said my Dad. We were driving back to London. My father, along with my brother Maurice, had just picked me up from the fancy girls' school I attended. He had also just been to Parent's Day, where I received the Latin prize and the award for the best results in my final exams. After a long talk with my headteacher, we were now heading home for the holidays.
""What isn't?"" I asked, although I had a feeling I knew what he was thinking because he was unusually quiet. Normally, he talked a lot. ""You can't fool me. You'll do what you want now,"" he said. ""With all those certificates, I heard you might get a scholarship to Oxford."" 
""So?"" I replied, trying to act tough. ""Couldn’t that be useful?"" 
""I also heard,"" he continued, and I knew a serious conversation was coming, ""that you want to be a barrister. A barrister!"" My father knew a lot about lawyers and the law. 
""I just mentioned that,"" I said. ""I couldn't think of anything else!"" 
""And apparently,"" he went on, ""you have the right personality. You can quickly understand complex information, you’re good at speaking, and you enjoy performing."" 
""I’m not sure about that,"" I said. ""All I know is what I see on TV."" 
""Regardless,"" he said, gathering himself, ""I feel like your heart isn’t in the family business anymore. You’ll go to Oxford, and after that, I doubt you’ll want to join us."" 
The truth was, like many children in family businesses, I felt trapped by my father's expectations. I saw many career options and wanted to explore them. At the same time, I didn’t want to upset my father. I wasn’t as scared of him as Maurice was—I was the favorite—but I still found him intimidating. 
""It’s too early to tell,"" I said weakly. 
""I’m telling you, you won’t want to join us,"" my father said, who often turned out to be right about these things. ""It’s a shame because you have the talent—the intelligence, the courage, the vision."" 
""There’s still Maurice,"" I said, feeling down. My father scoffed. We both knew Maurice disliked the business. 
""Anyway,"" I continued, ""you could always use me as a consultant."" My mother had passed away when I was young, and my father had raised me and Maurice. I was two years older than Maurice, and since he was motherless, I had taken care of him from an early age. It wasn’t a burden; I loved him. 
Because the business was successful, we lived comfortably—in a large house in London, attended good schools, wore nice clothes, and enjoyed parties, theaters, and operas. My father knew many interesting people—politicians, actors, and businesspeople—and our home was always lively with great conversations. 
""I have an idea,"" my father said. ""You can help us during the holidays until you leave Oxford, and then if you decide not to join us, you can. It will give you some pocket money and really help me."" 
""Okay,"" I said, relieved to avoid making immediate choices and especially to avoid the sadness my father would feel if I disagreed with him. This was how he controlled us. 
So, it happened. In my last term at school and during university breaks, I helped out, never more than twice a year and always with the easier tasks. I became one of the top students, had a small house, a nice car, designer clothes, and a black dress from Paris that I planned to wear for my final exams. 
In my last term, my father visited me and took me to a village for a meal and a chat. With only a few weeks left, my tutor predicted I would earn a First Class degree in Law. I knew that if I focused and organized my thoughts, he might be right. I felt ready and confident. 
But then my father told me that he needed me to do one last important task for the family business, the biggest project they had ever attempted, and he promised it would be worth my while. 
""But Dad,"" I protested, ""I have my final exams coming up, and I need to focus on that. It’s really important that I do well, and I don’t want to think about anything else right now."" 
I could tell my father didn’t understand the pressure I was under (or maybe he was jealous of my life away from him), and he would see my refusal as a betrayal. As he explained the task, I realized more than ever how determined he was—the clarity and skill with which he approached his work, his energy, and his self-control. In his own way, he was a genius, and I respected that in him. It made my own dreams seem less significant. 
""Fine,"" I said. ""I’ll do it."""
CPE_56,C2,"Simon Costello realized that buying the house in Pembroke Square was a mistake within a year of moving in with Lois. Owning a home that requires strict budgeting is often not worth it. At first, it seemed like a smart and desirable choice. He had been winning cases regularly, and Lois had returned to her job at the advertising agency shortly after their twins were born, receiving a salary increase to thirty-five thousand. Lois strongly advocated for the move, and Simon did not resist her arguments, which seemed convincing at the time: their flat was not suitable for a family, they needed more space, a garden, and separate accommodation for an au pair. They could have found these in a suburb or a less trendy part of London, but Lois wanted more than just extra space. Mornington Mansions was not a suitable address for a rising barrister and a successful businesswoman. Even saying the name made her feel it lowered her social and economic status.
Lois decided that one of them should use public transport to save money, and it was clear that Simon would be the one to do so since her office was on the other side of London. The crowded tube ride became a frustrating thirty minutes of resentment and reflection on their problems. He often thought of his grandfather's house in Hampstead, where he had spent time as a boy, remembering the smell of dinner and his grandmother's care for the tired breadwinner returning from work. She had been a supportive lawyer's wife, active in legal causes and content with her role. But that world was gone. Lois had made it clear before they married that her career was just as important as his. This was a modern marriage, and both of their jobs were crucial for their lifestyle, which relied on two incomes.
Now, their fragile situation could be threatened by Venetia, who had come to their office in a furious mood. Something had clearly upset her. The word ""upset"" felt too mild for the intense anger she directed at Simon. He regretted not leaving his room earlier; if he had, their confrontation might not have happened, and she could have had time to think things over. He remembered her angry accusations clearly. She had defended Brian Cartwright that day, who claimed that when Simon was his lawyer four years ago, he knew about jury bribing and did nothing. Simon denied it instinctively, but his response felt unconvincing even to him. He felt guilty, recalling the fear of punishment from his school days. Looking into Venetia's eyes, he saw her disbelief.
He wished he had said, ""Cartwright told me after the trial, but I didn't believe him then, and I don't believe him now. He will say anything to make himself look important."" Instead, he had told a more dangerous lie, and she recognized it. But why was she so angry? What did his past actions have to do with her? Who appointed Venetia as the moral judge of their legal practice? Was her own conscience so clear? Did she have the right to ruin his career? He was uncertain about what she could do, but if this rumor spread, it would be disastrous for him."
CPE_36,C2,"I chose this place to live because I thought I would be anonymous among people who didn’t mind if their rented homes were falling apart or if their gardens were messy. However, I was wrong. The shopkeepers, who are living their real lives, soon start to recognize me. The beautiful roses from next door remind me that gardens were once cared for. Usually, I stay inside to forget about the summer outside, but tonight, I am watching the swifts flying between the trees and roofs. I have trimmed the rosemary and lemon balm to make space for a chair, and my arms are stinging from scratches. It is a small London garden where plants must grow tall or spread out to survive.
“Been doing some clearing, I see,” says my upstairs neighbor, Jaz, leaning out of her window. She has written several unpublished manuscripts, and I sometimes have to pretend to know about them as an English teacher. I have her latest manuscript with me now. “How’s the work going, Jaz?” I ask. “For goodness sake! In no other job do people have to explain themselves so many times a day,” she replies, her voice trailing off before she continues, “I have something to drink in the fridge. I’ll bring it down.” I don’t want Jaz in the garden, and I realize it looks messy and sad. The only way to access the garden is through my flat, and Jaz is knocking on my door. 
“So, you’re on holiday now, you lucky person,” she says as she sits in the chair while I drop a cushion onto what used to be a small lawn. “Cheers,” she says, acting young. “I should have become a teacher—writers don’t have holidays. But you know what they say, those who can, do, and those who can’t, teach.” And then there are those who can do neither. “So, what are your plans for the holidays?” All my worries about the end of the school year come rushing back. Empty days. Hot sidewalks covered in melting gum. The walk to the shops and back. The little park with its fountain, and loneliness sitting beside me on the bench. “Actually, I’m going to Stonebridge tomorrow. I need to ask if you could feed the cats.” My heart races as I say this. “Of course I will,” Jaz replies, knowing she will be around. “Where will you stay? Some fancy bed and breakfast?” “No, I’ll be staying with my oldest friend, Ruby, at the Rising Sun. We’ve known each other since we were eight.” This isn’t true, but I often deal with fiction.
“Going back to your roots. So, what do you think of my work so far?” My silence makes Jaz ask about her manuscript, The Cruelty of Red Vans, which is only half-read on my desk. I like the title and tell her so. I can see how red vans could be cruel, always bringing gifts to other houses and delivering rejected manuscripts to hers. Something makes me speak honestly for once. “Let me give you a little tip,” I say. “What?” she asks, looking offended. “Try writing about nice people for a change, people who want to be good: a little less self-centeredness, a bit more fiction…” “Teachers!” Jaz responds like a rebellious student about to take back a poorly graded paper. “I keep a journal, and I write down something good, no matter how small, about each day.” My words sound as old-fashioned as my dress. “Keep a journal! Nice people! Get a life, Ann.” Oh, I have a life. I have my work, and I go out sometimes, reading on the tube. When we finally go inside, my calm kitchen gives me a moment of comfort, but suddenly I remember my school geography teacher, Miss Tarrantine, who must have been my age now, closing one eye in a strange wink as she said, “I’ve had my moments.” We nearly died laughing."
CPE_6,C2,"**Heritage**
Heritage is important because it connects people and communities to their past. We often feel linked to our personal heritage, knowing about our grandparents and hearing stories about their lives. However, there is also a broader need to understand our history to help us make sense of our individual and national futures. Heritage represents a desire for continuity; knowing about the past can give us confidence about the future. Just as we inherit our genes, we also inherit a culture passed down through generations. There may be parts of our national heritage that we do not like, but it is still a part of us, and it can be comforting to feel connected to something larger. Heritage teaches us a lot and is essential for our well-being, influencing everything from traditions to material culture. Traditionally, we learned about our past through stories and legends from our ancestors. However, in modern Western society, many of these oral traditions have been lost due to the breakdown of communities and families. Now, we often rely on places and buildings to remind us of our history. It is crucial to preserve and restore these connections as a tribute to our ancestors' identities.
**The Fens**
Some time ago, I started writing a novel called *Waterland*, where the landscape of a region in England known as the Fens became very important. After the book was published, people often asked why I, a Londoner with no personal ties to the area, chose to write about it. The simple answer is that I found the Fens interesting because they seemed plain and empty, providing a blank canvas for my story. However, I soon realized that the Fens are not flat or empty at all. They are uniquely English yet also strangely captivating. It is surprising that there is still a part of England that many people find foreign, especially since many other distinct areas have become part of the national culture. The Fens are both empty and full, cultivated yet wild, seemingly simple but deeply mysterious. My own research while writing was not extensive; I have not yet visited places like Wisbech or Prickwillow. As a fiction writer, I prefer to create imagined worlds rather than seek strict evidence. However, trying to ""imagine"" the Fens has its own logic, as shown in Edward Storey's scholarly work, which suggests that the Fens are not just a landscape but also a state of mind.
**Museums**
Museums need to make their collections easy to access. In the past, this meant simply putting items in display cases with long labels that were hard for the average person to understand. Today, accessibility should involve more than that. Displays can be engaging and use creative techniques to attract visitors and evoke emotions. However, museums should be about more than just displays; they should reach out to the widest community possible. For example, some museums provide loan boxes of objects for teachers, and recently, this idea has expanded to include materials for elderly people experiencing memory loss. Museums focus on real artefacts and specimens, not replicas. They exist to provide an authentic experience, showcasing items that have historical significance. This authenticity is what sets them apart from heritage centers, theme parks, books, and CD-ROMs. Museums that embrace this challenge and offer exciting, accessible displays and outreach programs will find that their competitors in ""virtual history"" can actually help create a desire for the real experiences that only museums can provide.
**Architecture and Environment**
The desire to preserve things is not new, but changes in our towns happen so quickly and on such a large scale that they affect most of us. This rapid change can make some people very focused on preservation, while it encourages others to think more deeply about the nature of our towns today and their future. It can be argued that people who have lived through significant events, like world wars, are more inclined to value preservation than previous generations, as anything that represents stability becomes important. If there is a psychological need for preservation, it is important for planners to consider it. Change is not necessarily bad if we learn how to manage it. Physical changes in our towns reflect social changes, including shifts in population, welfare, and demands."
CPE_33,C2,"Einstein**
If you stop anyone on the street and ask them to name a scientist, they will likely say Albert Einstein. His image is often used to promote products that suggest intelligence, like computers and encyclopedias. Most people know little about Einstein's work, except that he created complex theories called 'relativity', which are famous for being hard to understand and for making strange predictions that seem to go against common sense. Einstein was part of a major shift in scientific thought, a revolution that marked the beginning of modern science in the twentieth century. Physicists and mathematicians were trying to develop a new, more logical way to describe the universe by examining the relationships between matter and natural forces. Einstein made significant contributions by rethinking the basics: time, space, matter, and energy. Earlier theories were based on Isaac Newton's idea of a universe where stars and planets moved in a fixed space and time. Einstein changed this idea, arguing that time and space are not fixed but relative.
**Young Readers**
As children, Lydia and I often distrusted any book that won awards because we thought it would be 'worthy', which we interpreted as 'boring'. Our mother disapproved of our attitude, while our father would give us small coins as rewards for reading better books. He sometimes included a few good books in our Christmas and birthday gifts, marked clearly with 'This Book is NOT Literature'. Although we often dismissed his choices as 'boys' books', he did introduce us to some shorter works of good fiction and, once, to a famous collection of poetry.
**Language**
Jacob Grimm wrote in 1851, ""The origin of human language is truly secret and marvellous."" This mystery has led to many unusual ideas. For example, Charles Caller suggested in 1928 that early humans made sounds like ""meuh"" when they sensed danger. This sound is quite sad. The early human who traveled through dangerous lands filled with frightening animals might have made desperate sounds, and some words have kept a trace of this, like 'malaria', which means ""fever"", or the Latin word 'mors', which means ""death"". Many people avoided discussing the origin of language, thinking it was a topic for odd theories, but recently, the study of how language began and evolved has become very important. Language likely started in East Africa about 100,000 years ago. Initially, speech was mainly used for friendly communication and was a key tool in struggles for power. Sharing information was probably not the main purpose of early language, which goes against the ideas of philosopher John Locke, who described language as a 'great conduit' for sharing knowledge."
CPE_20,C2,"Writing Reviews**
Frank Kermode discusses the art of writing reviews from a practical perspective. Most reviews are created and shared in ways that limit their lifespan. They often have strict deadlines and length restrictions, and once published, they are only relevant for a short time—usually a day, a week, or at most a month. The temporary nature of reviews often affects how they are viewed, both by the public and by the writers themselves. Many believe that reviewing is a task people only do for financial reasons, or because they cannot spend all their time on a novel or serious book.
However, writing reviews is a skilled and complex task. Writing a concise review of six to eight hundred words for a newspaper is different from crafting a detailed review of six to eight thousand words for an international journal. The fifteen hundred words allowed in weekly magazines present challenges from both short and long formats. Reviewers must consider their audience, which can range from casual readers to those deeply interested in the subject.
Additionally, a reviewer needs to have knowledge about various topics and must write in a way that is clear and enjoyable for intelligent readers. It is common for reviewers to also write other types of work. For example, American novelist John Updike, who is not fond of criticism, still engages in some reviewing while writing his novels. He collects all his reviews, no matter how brief, into books with modest titles.
Some might think that less prominent writers should accept the temporary nature of their reviews, but it is understandable if they wish to have a lasting record of their work, especially if they feel their best writing is hidden in reviews. I share this sentiment about my own writing. My main work has been academic, and my serious books are typically academic in nature, which is what professors are expected to produce.
In the English-speaking world, there is no strict separation between reviewing and literary study, unlike in some other cultures. It is common for the same individuals to engage in both activities. The past criticism of academic reviewers for showing off or wasting time has decreased, as there is now more reviewing available, allowing many people to participate. Additionally, the financial rewards for reviewers are often minimal.
I believe this situation benefits both readers and professors. Readers can trust that reviewers have some expertise, and professors can maintain their sanity through this work. It also serves as a reminder for professors to communicate clearly with non-professors. While they may use complex language among themselves, they need to ensure they are understood by a broader audience.
Ultimately, despite its value, reviewing is often a secondary occupation. It is something that can only be done well if one is also engaged in another primary activity."
CPE_40,C2,"Ralph unlocked the door to his apartment and, as he stepped into the dark, quiet hallway, he felt a brief sense of ownership that still surprised him after three years. When he first bought the flat, he would come home excited and curious, wondering what had happened while he was away. The flat felt like a welcoming space where he could focus without distractions. He thought he should worry about possible intruders or broken pipes, but his flat always seemed to wait for him, either looking independent or neglected, depending on how tidy he had left it.
Over time, he began to see it as an extension of himself, a place where his thoughts and feelings spilled out. He grew frustrated with its inability to change. There were always a few letters piled up by the door and the answering machine blinking with messages when he returned. He was thankful that his windows were intact and that nothing had been stolen, but he often wondered what the flat would look like if something had happened.
From his dull office on the third floor, Ralph looked forward to his quiet evenings at home. After leaving the busy office, he felt a sense of himself returning during his bus ride, but he still struggled with the need for solitude, which he often miscalculated in social situations. At his desk, he longed for isolation and time alone with his belongings, but once he escaped, he felt drained and waited in vain for a sense of identity to return. Instead, he faced a deep emptiness, making him suspect that the unfulfilling work had changed him, moving him away from who he thought he was.
He would often read or listen to music as night fell, but he began to question for whom or what he was doing these things. His sense of direction had faded, and thoughts would come and go without finding a connection. He remembered a time when he felt more in control, when he might have recognized his own worth and escaped his situation. However, he had been so eager to find something that he followed the first opportunity that came his way, as if it was meant to be.
After university, he tried to create a plan for a better life, but he was not surprised to find that his true ambition was simply to survive. He applied for jobs he had heard about from friends, attaching himself to their futures while struggling to believe he could find a role that would also bring him happiness. He attended one interview with gratitude, not thinking to evaluate the job itself—a vague editorial position at a local free newspaper. After a pleasant conversation with Neil, his boss, he was relieved and did not consider the long-term implications of the job. Neil offered him the position on the spot, telling him he was the only graduate who had applied, which Ralph took as a compliment at the time."
CPE_45,C2,"**Goat Racing**
I was about to see goat racing on Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. I pushed my way through ice-cream vans, large crowds, food stalls, and loud music. Although everyone was moving towards the racecourse, I tried to find a good spot to watch. An area was blocked off to create a course for the goats. It wasn’t as fancy as regular racecourses, but the idea was similar: spectators lined both sides of a stretch of ground where the goats would run. Keeping a few selected goats in line was not easy, especially since goats are known for eating almost anything they find.
**Canoe Trip**
As the day ended, I began to worry about the night ahead. The canoe was too wet to sleep in, there were no places to stop, and we hadn’t seen any villages or huts since early morning. In the dim moonlight, we could barely see the cliffs. Our torch batteries were dying, so we replaced them, but the new ones didn’t work. Clearly, we wouldn’t find a camping spot. A few miles later, Lesley shouted that she saw a distant flickering light, and we felt hopeful. However, the light was just the moon reflecting on the waves. Soon, we heard the loud sound of rushing water, but we couldn’t see what was happening. Time seemed to stop as we continued on.
**How to be Presentation Perfect**
I am not naturally good at making presentations, but as managing director, I often need to present to my colleagues and major shareholders. How can I improve my presentation skills and confidence? You are not alone. Giving a presentation requires different skills than running a company, but many senior executives are expected to be good at it. To convince your audience, you must first believe in what you are saying. Show your belief through the passion and enthusiasm you bring to your presentation. This means you need to prepare well. Test your ideas in advance and ask colleagues to help identify the tough questions your audience might ask. You should also create a positive atmosphere from the beginning. Start with something everyone can relate to and gradually lead to the conclusion you want to reach."
CPE_64,C2,"
Some activities cannot be rushed; they take the time they need. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you are impatient with mayonnaise and add the oil too quickly, it will spoil. If you pull on a tangled fishing line in frustration, the knot will only get tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some functions happen very quickly, while others take seconds, minutes, hours, days, or even years. We can speed up some tasks, like solving crossword puzzles or doing math, but others cannot be rushed. If we try to hurry them, they may fail, just like the mayonnaise or the fishing line.
The idea of ""Think fast; we need results"" can sometimes be as unhelpful as trying to shorten a night's sleep. We learn, think, and understand in various ways, and these ways work at different speeds and are suitable for different tasks. There are three main processing speeds of the mind. 
The first is faster than thought. Some situations require an immediate reaction. For example, when my motorbike skidded on a wet road, my body and brain quickly coordinated movements to keep me safe, and only afterward did my conscious mind catch up. A concert pianist or an Olympic fencer also does not have time to think about their next move. This quick response can be called our ""wits.""
The second speed involves actual thinking. This is when we analyze situations, weigh options, and solve problems. A mechanic figuring out why an engine won’t start, a scientist interpreting an experiment, or a student working on an assignment are all using this logical thinking, often referred to as ""intellect."" People who excel at these tasks are often called ""bright"" or ""clever.""
The third speed is slower and less direct. It is more relaxed and can be playful or dreamy. In this mode, we reflect or meditate. For instance, sitting on a rock by the sea, listening to the waves, or being on the edge of sleep puts us in a different mental state than when we are planning a meal or writing a letter. This slower way of thinking is just as valuable as the faster ones. Allowing our minds to wander is essential, especially when life gets busy. We need both the ""tortoise mind"" and the ""hare brain.""
Some everyday problems are better solved with a slow mind. Certain mysteries can only be understood with a relaxed attitude. Recent studies show that patient, less deliberate thinking is especially good for complex or unclear situations. Deliberate thinking works well for straightforward problems. For example, deciding where to go on holiday may have clear options. But when we are unsure about what to consider or which questions to ask, we need the tortoise mind. 
If the issue is how to manage a difficult team at work or whether to change careers, it may be wiser to sit and think rather than rush for answers. This type of intelligence is linked to creativity and wisdom. Poets have long understood the limits of conscious thinking and have tried to develop these slower ways of knowing. Philosophers have discussed the parts of the mind that go beyond conscious thought. Recently, scientists have begun to study these slower, less deliberate ways of knowing. The field of cognitive science is showing that the unconscious mind can successfully handle many complex tasks if given enough time. It can recognize patterns that our conscious mind might miss, understand complicated situations, and solve difficult problems more effectively than our active thinking."
CPE_29,C2,"Surviving in a Foreign Land**
I have been welcomed warmly. This place is a friendly and well-equipped base camp in a very isolated area. At any time, there are about forty people here—scientists, students, weather experts, and satellite trackers—forming a close community where everyone helps each other. My basic French is just enough to communicate, but not to have casual conversations. I miss the subtle meanings in conversations, and my phrasebook is not helpful during breakfast. While this is not a practical problem, I initially struggled with my self-confidence. I found myself feeling anxious about mealtimes. I would hesitate, unsure of which table to choose, and I felt nervous when I spoke, recalling the anxiety I felt during my first weeks of school. I still smile awkwardly or feel panicked when people talk to me. I think this occasional sadness comes not from missing company or communication, but from losing the social confidence that my ability to speak well has always given me.
**Elliot**
When I first met Elliot, I was just a young author, and he did not pay much attention to me. However, he always remembered faces. When I saw him occasionally, he would shake my hand politely but did not seem interested in getting to know me better. If I saw him at the opera with someone important, he would often ignore me. Then, I had a surprising success as a playwright, and I noticed that Elliot started to look at me more warmly. One day, he sent me a note inviting me to lunch, and I thought he was testing me. After that, as my success brought me many new friends, I began to see him more often.
**Alfred Hitchcock**
The film director Alfred Hitchcock always claimed that he did not care about the story of his films or the acting, but he did care about the visuals and the sound. For Hitchcock, it was not a message or a great performance that moved the audience; he believed that people respond to the pure experience of film, regardless of their cultural background. Therefore, if a film is made well in terms of emotional impact, the audience in Japan should react the same way as the audience in India. Hitchcock was always precise and rational in his self-assessment. He was a man of reason and a brilliant craftsman who enjoyed hearing the audience react. He did not focus on speculation or complex ideas, and his view of his characters was straightforward. He concentrated on film itself and the clear, measurable beauty of what film can do to an audience."
CPE_57,C2,"**Amateur Astronomy**
Astronomy has changed a lot in the last fifty years. Until about thirty years ago, there were not many charts and catalogues available. Telescopes were limited, and there were few practical astronomy books. Today, there is a wide variety of telescopes and equipment available for everyone. Electronic calculators and computers have transformed how we create almanacs and charts, analyze observations, and publish results. This could be seen as the golden age of amateur astronomy. However, some things have been lost. Now, you might have to travel 80 kilometers to find a dark sky, unlike the skies in urban areas fifty years ago. Daytime skies are often filled with airplane trails that can last for hours and spread out, making it hard to observe the sun and stars at night.
**Too Much Choice**
Society is facing a problem of ""overchoice."" There are too many options and opportunities available. In today’s economy, the desire for new products and services has become an addiction, and technology speeds up this change. New products appear quickly, and just as one is released, another is on the way. This constant change can be overwhelming and tiring, leading to a feeling of disconnection from life. While choice is celebrated in the new economy, having more choices can lead to more stress, less time, and greater complexity. As a result, people are looking for ""simplexity""—the simple things that bring meaning to our complicated lives. However, simplifying life is challenging in a time of excess. There are more basic brands of products than we could ever need, along with countless software updates and plans that are hard to keep track of.
**McAndrews Hotel**
Every summer, my family spends two weeks at McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. This tradition started with my grandmother and has become very important to us. Nothing can disrupt this ritual. We are a specific type of guest at McAndrews: perhaps old-fashioned or even snobbish. I dislike the rudeness of shop assistants, which some people see as equality today. I also dislike overly friendly waiters who seem to struggle to keep their hands to themselves. I know the names of many other guests, as they have been coming here since childhood like me. However, I appreciate that when I see them in the hotel, we only exchange polite greetings, allowing for personal space and dignity, which is rare in today’s commercial world."
CPE_9,C2,"Othello**
The move of a remarkable production of Shakespeare's play Othello from Stratford to London gives me a chance to correct an unfair review I wrote when the show first opened last spring. At that time, I criticized Ray Fearon for being too young for the title role and I was wrong to downplay his acting. I still believe that changing the age difference between Othello and Desdemona distorts the tragedy, but I take back my negative comments about Mr. Fearon's outstanding performance. The entire cast is excellent. Memorable scenes include the one where Cassio's competitive games with other young officers become dangerously intense, and the moment when Iago starts to lose control and struggles to regain it. I challenge anyone not to be moved to tears during the scene where Emilia helps Desdemona prepare for bed. The pace and tension throughout the play are fantastic. Do not miss this production.
**Lake Vostok**
In the center of Antarctica, there is complete stillness. On the edges of the continent, there are many penguins, seals, and birds. However, in the vast white interior, life does not exist. Except for a large hidden body of freshwater called Lake Vostok, which lies beneath nearly 4 kilometers of ice, directly under the coldest place on Earth. The water has been cut off from air and sunlight for up to 25 million years. Biologists are eager to explore its mysterious depths and find out what unusual organisms may be there. Geologists and glaciologists are also very interested. For two years, researchers around the world have been planning ways to uncover the lake's secrets, and if they succeed, we will soon enter the decade of Lake Vostok.
**Scientists**
Last week, I heard something interesting on the radio. A group of scientists is debating what motivates them to be scientists; the phrase ""because it's there"" comes to mind. We all know it is the long-standing quest for knowledge, the wish to understand everything from atoms to black holes. But these scientists want to know why we have this desire for knowledge in the first place and why science cannot explain this desire. I believe it is more important to determine whether what we scientists are doing is right, rather than getting caught up in discussions about the purpose of it all. I think the key issue is not why we pursue science, but to understand that science is a tool, and we should decide how, where, when, and why to use it."
CPE_42,C2,"
**Food**  
Our relationship with food is very basic and fulfilling. Many people who enjoy cooking buy cookbooks like this one, but often we think that unless it’s a special occasion or a complicated dish, it’s not worth making. This is not true. By simply adding some chopped carrots, a leek, celery, and herbs to water, you can create a delicious soup. This is much more satisfying than buying a pre-made one. Instead of purchasing a sweet chocolate mousse filled with preservatives, you can quickly make a tasty dessert that both adults and children will enjoy. Cooking is also a way to show care and love by sharing your own creation, no matter how simple. Sharing food symbolizes our basic human needs, which is why we celebrate events like birthdays and anniversaries around tables. No one would choose to have takeout for a wedding or anniversary party, nor would many want to discuss a business deal over canned soup.
**In the Elevator**  
This morning, Alistair tried to tidy up his office, but papers were still everywhere. Tax forms were overflowing from drawers and boxes, waiting for a day when he felt like organizing them. He also had a lot of paperwork from owning an apartment building. The many books and journals were close to the new bookshelves. As the elevator took him to his floor, he knew Mallory would arrive on time for their meeting. She would knock on his office door exactly on the hour. She was very punctual and neat. How would she react to the mess? She might think someone had broken in. He could walk in behind her and pretend to be shocked. Mrs. Wilson, his cleaning lady, had come while he was trying to clear some space on the floor. When he peeked out of his office as she was unlocking his apartment, he smiled at her, hoping for a good response. But her expression was cold. She seemed to think there was no way she would go in there, as she disappeared into her own space, which she was responsible for. He knew Mrs. Wilson saw him as someone from another world, not from her familiar Brooklyn streets.
**KAREN**  
Karen had a simple wish: not to be like her mother. This desire led her to create her own story, a story of difference and strength. In her tale, there were important moments, like when she was twelve and her brother accidentally hit her in the eye with a golf club. At that moment, she thought she would go blind. But the bone protected her, as the doctor later confirmed. The club had missed her eye, and she only needed a few stitches that healed into a reminder of her past pain. When she opened her eyes in the doctor’s office, she saw her mother, who was predictably talking about miracles and small blessings. In that moment, she realized she was saved for a reason.
**Miss Fogerty**  
Miss Fogerty was both excited and sad as she walked briskly across the wet grass of the village green. It was thrilling to be the first to learn something important, especially in a small community where her life was usually quiet. However, she felt deep sorrow for Dr. Bailey’s condition. He had been her doctor for many years, and she appreciated his care during her frequent laryngitis episodes, which were her only health issues. Miss Fogerty valued his ability to make patients feel like there was always enough time to talk about their worries. This quality made him very beloved in the village. He was always willing to share his time, knowledge, and humor, and in return, he received great loyalty and affection from the community."
CPE_59,C2,"**Joanna's Lessons**
Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist. So, why has she decided to write books for young children learning the piano? Even someone who cannot hear music well would be moved by her performances. Watching her play the piano, especially when she performs complex pieces, is impressive. However, during a recent concert for children, one small boy surprised her. After watching her play various styles of music, he asked, ""Can you play Match of the Day?"" This request made Joanna laugh. She realized that, in his eyes, she had to play that piece to prove she was a real pianist. Of course, she played it and enjoyed the moment.
Joanna is unique among top concert pianists because she cares about how young children learn to play. She has just published her own beginner piano book for children called *Joanna MacGregor's Piano World*, despite her busy schedule. This summer, she is performing at many festivals and collaborating with young composers and artists. She also runs her own recording label, Sound Circus, and loves to suggest new projects whenever she meets other artists.
So, why take on the extra work of writing a book? Joanna explains that the first lessons in music are very important. Many music teachers focus on talented children, but she believes that most people's interest in music is more ordinary. She finds this everyday interest much more fascinating. 
In writing her first three books, Joanna draws on her own experiences. From ages 18 to 25, before she became a concert pianist, she taught many beginners. Growing up, she was surrounded by children of all backgrounds who wanted to play different types of music. She believes that everyone should have the chance to learn the piano, just like learning to swim or speaking a little French. Some children learn quickly, while others take their time and may give up. This can happen at any stage. Some find the beginning too hard, while others feel pressured to perform like the talented children they see on television.
Joanna worries that some parents use music, like sports, to push their children to achieve rather than to enjoy it. She thinks that children often quit because they feel they cannot meet their parents' expectations. When asked if she thinks existing piano books are not good enough, she is careful not to criticize others. She acknowledges that her colorful books are not the only ones designed to make learning enjoyable. 
To engage young beginners, she includes stories in her books and CDs. The challenge is to make learning fun. From the first lesson, there are accompaniments in different styles for teachers or parents to play along with the child. For those whose parents do not play the piano, the accompaniments are available on the CDs. Joanna insists that learning should be fun. She encourages children to improvise and explore the piano freely.
As children progress, they need to learn to read music instead of just playing by ear. Joanna understands this struggle because she relied on her ear when she was young. However, she believes that practice is the most important factor in learning. She knows it can be hard to motivate children to play a piece multiple times. Joanna admits that she did not practice seriously until she attended the Royal Academy of Music, where she developed a challenging repertoire that required dedication. Now, she enjoys practicing and considers it the most important part of her musical life, even more than performing.
Joanna empathizes with those who find practice difficult. She believes that people do not talk about this enough. The key to practice, whether for twenty minutes or five hours, is to have a clear goal. Other tips include rewarding yourself by playing through a piece, even if there are mistakes, and mixing difficult pieces with easier ones."
CPE_54,C2,"Writing by Hand and on Screen**
Dr. Johnson believed that ""what is written without effort is usually read without pleasure."" This means that good writing often requires hard work. When I look back at my handwritten school essays, I notice they had very few corrections. Today, I would rewrite them many times. I think this is because writing by hand was physically challenging. The slow pace of writing helped me think carefully. When using a computer, it is easy to be careless. Many writers find that the time spent fixing mistakes in digital drafts is about the same as the time spent on handwritten work. 
Also, emails, unlike handwritten letters, often lack emotional depth. However, they have revived the art of the love letter, with millions of these messages now being sent, replacing casual conversations. At least these emails are written in a form of English and grammar. But words on a screen can feel dull. Writers may not fully understand the impact of their words and often exaggerate their meaning. Words typed quickly can lack the care and personality of handwriting.
**The CD Experience**
I put down my cup and looked at the CD. The case was disappointing, but the shiny disc inside looked interesting. ""Wonderful little things, aren't they?"" Mr. Warriston said as he entered the room. I agreed, carefully handing the disc to him. ""It's amazing they can fit seventy minutes of music on these,"" he continued, turning on the hi-fi. Lights lit up, and he pressed a button to open a small drawer. He placed the disc inside, pressed the button again, and the drawer closed. ""Some people say they sound sterile, but I think they..."" 
""Do you have to turn them over, like records?"" I asked. 
""What? No,"" Mr. Warriston replied, surprised. ""You only play one side."" 
""Why?"" I asked. He looked puzzled and then thoughtful. ""You know, I have no idea. I don't see why you couldn't make both sides playable and double the capacity..."" He stared at the machine. ""You could have two lasers, or just turn it over by hand... hmm."" He smiled at me. ""Yes, good point."" He gestured to my wooden chair. ""Anyway, come on, let's get you sitting in the best spot for the stereo effect, okay?"" I smiled, happy to have asked a technical question that Mr. Warriston couldn't answer.
**Books vs. Electronic Text**
Malcolm Bradbury made a good point when he said that if matches had been invented after cigarette lighters, we would have admired the improvement. Many people claim that electronic text is as significant as the invention of printing and that it is almost complete. However, they overlook the fact that changes in how we think take generations. This thinking is often egocentric, believing that our generation is at a crucial moment in history. 
For example, a book from 1979 predicted that ""the 1980s will see the book as we know it begin to fade away."" So far, this has not happened. Reading long texts on a screen is often frustrating, so most people avoid it. Additionally, the way information is organized on computers encourages people to skim rather than read deeply. Some advocates of technology argue that this leads to new forms of storytelling. However, non-linear reading is not new; many books, like religious texts and poetry collections, have never been read from start to finish. What is different now is that computers do not encourage the deep thinking that comes from reading a complete text.
**The Office**
Charles walked into the office and saw a perfectly organized space. The carpet was clear of papers, and the dark wooden desk looked just as he remembered from the Sotheby's auction five weeks ago. Neat file holders were being placed in their drawers, and twelve years of trade journals filled one wall's shelves. Kathleen struggled to close the filing cabinet and then turned to him. ""You have to use computers, Charles. This is just too much."" 
""Hello, Kathleen. Oh, this is amazing,"" he said, admiring the room's antique furniture. He was not thinking about computers or any mechanical devices, not even a pencil sharpener. ""Simply amazing,"" he said, avoiding the topic of computers. Over the two years he had known her, they had discussed this many times. She could never understand why he resisted technology, especially since he was skilled with computers and had published an important paper on computer-related talent. She had inspired that paper. Through the keyboard, she could manipulate any software and create something new that could ""sit up and bark at the moon"" if she wanted."
CPE_32,C2,"""You don’t take sugar, do you?"" shouted his secretary, not really asking but stating a fact, as she had been making Lancelot coffee for many months. She often forgot details like this because he usually wasn’t supposed to be there. However, he had started coming to work all the time, realizing that staying away only caused more problems. He thought about how he had gone from being a respected advisor, meeting authors and playwrights over lunch, to being overwhelmed with tasks and struggling to find parking in the mornings.
""This came,"" she yelled, waving a manila folder before placing it in front of him. ""From that guy in Los Angeles. You wanted to see it."" A label on the folder read: ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert,"" and below it, ""An Expanded Synopsis."" Lancelot felt uneasy about the word ""synopsis."" He preferred to see a label that said ""A First Draft."" He had already seen a synopsis of this book and didn’t want to see another one, even if it was revised. Ian Cuthbert had received a large advance for this book when Lancelot had bought the company. Ian was one of several old friends Lancelot had mistakenly commissioned books from. Ian was a clear example of how someone with a difficult personality often becomes even harder to manage when given a chance.
Lancelot skipped the introduction he had read many times and looked at the synopsis. He recognized almost every phrase. He closed the folder and pushed it aside. Clearly, at this rate, Ian's manuscript would never arrive. The synopsis lacked the brilliance Ian was known for, and beneath its playful tone, it felt empty of real ideas. Lancelot remembered stories about a famous author whose last book was published incomplete after his death, written chapter by chapter for payment. In that case, the payments were small parts of an advance that had never been given. Ian had received a huge advance, which went against the usual business rule that authors must deliver a manuscript to get paid later.
Lancelot, who studied modern languages at Oxford, recalled when Ian Cuthbert was seen as a promising talent in a Cambridge full of potential. Ian's peers aimed to take over British theatre, and they succeeded quickly. But Ian seemed lazy compared to them. He wore his overcoat like a cape and spoke about a famous French writer as if he had been there. Yet, for some reason, Ian's creative talent remained hidden. While less talented people succeeded, Ian withdrew further. At the peak of his influence, he was already known to be difficult to work with. Officially appointed to edit a major arts magazine, he was like a general stuck on the beach with too many resources but no results. The magazine used up the budget for many issues without being published. Similarly, his renewed contract with a fashion magazine led to stories about his high salary, which was increased in hopes of getting him to produce more, and then even more to get him to produce anything at all.
At editorial meetings, where there were always famous photographers present, Ian would criticize others' ideas harshly. Ten years later, he could hardly be counted on to show up for his own funeral. Lancelot was beginning to accept that ""A World History of the Short"" had been a mistake from the start."
CPE_65,C2,"England's Breakfast Revolution**
Health experts agree that a good breakfast is very important. However, in history, breakfast is a relatively new concept in England. There are few mentions of breakfast in medieval literature. Some travelers did eat a meal at dawn before long journeys, and sick people sometimes had breakfast for health reasons, but most people did not eat breakfast unless they were kings or nobles.
In the sixteenth century, breakfast started to become common for everyone, not just the wealthy. Some writers believe this change happened because food became more available. However, they may not have considered other important social changes. For instance, new work patterns meant that more people had jobs with set hours, often starting very early in the morning. As a result, eating a meal in the morning became necessary and was no longer just for the rich."
CPE_61,C2,"**Photography**  
When a photographer takes a picture, they choose visual information based on their technical skills, personal views, and experiences, as well as social and cultural norms. Throughout this book, we will explore how these factors influence the style, content, and expression of a photograph, and how viewers perceive and react to these images. For instance, a casual newspaper reader may have an implicit understanding of the photographs printed on the page. However, instead of accepting the photograph as it is, we might ask whether it truly represents the scene as it appeared at that moment. Alternatively, does it express the photographer's perspective? Is the exact moment captured particularly significant, or should the photograph be seen as a symbol representing a situation in the world?
**More than a Game**  
For me, sport has always been more than just a game. The most successful athletes have complete self-belief. To succeed in sports, you need to focus intensely and set aside everything else. The world of sports is tough, and no one will do the hard work for you. It’s a matter of survival. Sport has taught me discipline and determination, but it also shows the value of teamwork. My sport allows me to excel individually, yet it is still a team effort, and I must balance both aspects. This is similar to life – you can achieve as an individual, but you must remember the people around you. Sport has given me a lot, not just financially. It has opened doors and broadened my perspective, allowing me to see things around the world that many will never experience. However, you also have to sacrifice a lot for these rewards.
**Tuning In**  
Some experiences are so vivid that they create clear memories. For me, such a moment happened one night in California many years ago when I lay awake, listening to the beautiful song of a mockingbird from an unseen spot in one of the tall trees in the neighborhood. I don’t have insomnia; it was the bird’s exquisite singing that kept me awake. As I listened to its complex melodies, I found myself in an unexpected artistic experience. To appreciate the bird's patterns, I drew on my knowledge of jazz and Indian classical music. The bird made me feel as if I was enjoying an incredible improvisational performance. I reacted with groans and cheers as one surprising musical variation followed another through the open window until I finally fell asleep."

""People have always had strong feelings about birds, whether it's love, fear, or admiration. But what does this reveal about us? Paul Evans explores this idea. 
In a greenhouse, a little brown bird, a wren, is bumping against the glass. This bird is often seen as a symbol of important messages or omens. Is it trying to tell me something from a world beyond my understanding, or is it just a bird trapped inside? Depending on how you look at it, both ideas could be valid. 
Wrens have been part of British culture for a long time. In medieval times, people believed that the direction in which wrens flew could predict their luck. Today, images of wrens can still be found in many British homes. Although some old beliefs may have faded, the wren still holds a special place in our hearts. A place without wrens feels empty and lacking. 
This connection to birds is rooted in folklore, which dates back to when people were more connected to nature for survival. As people relied on the natural world, they developed a way to communicate the importance of other creatures. However, cultural changes can alter how we view these animals. 
Take the red kite, for example. In the early 1500s, visitors to London were amazed to see red kites swooping down to take food from children. These birds were appreciated as helpful scavengers. But soon, they were seen as pests and nearly disappeared from most areas, except for Wales. Over time, red kites became symbols of conservation efforts in Britain, and they are now protected and reintroduced to help them thrive again. 
Our relationship with birds goes back to our early human history. The first birdwatchers likely paid close attention to birds because they signaled danger, bad weather, or food sources. Birds also connected them to their dreams. When we wonder why birds matter to us, we are also exploring what it means to be human. The ability to fly, sing, and be free captivates us and reflects our own identity in relation to nature. 
Some may think these feelings are outdated, remnants of our past. But like certain body parts that we no longer need, these feelings are still part of us, and losing them would be painful. This is likely why birds have become symbols of environmental change, serving as indicators of ecological health. In Britain, conservationists highlight the endangerment of 30 bird species, which is troubling not only because we are losing these unique creatures but also because it represents a significant cultural loss. 
Birds carry deep cultural meanings. For instance, the skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing represent spiritual love, romantic love, and magic. Anyone familiar with the poetry of Shelley, Shakespeare, or Robert Graves will feel a sense of loss for these once-common birds. However, the disappearance of other birds that are not part of literature or folklore often goes unnoticed. 
Folklore is vital. The stories and legends that endure over time create a stronger connection to their subjects than scientific terms do. This connection evokes feelings and attitudes that are often hidden beneath the complexities of modern life. Whether we watch wildlife documentaries or observe birds in our gardens, the joy we experience cannot be fully explained by science. Birds engage us in ways that are difficult to understand or express, and the stories we share about them help us interpret their messages. 
The wren in the greenhouse creates a link between the present and a distant past, holding onto its song and moving into the future—a mystery that keeps me intrigued."""
CPE_28,C2,"Maps**
The purpose of a map is to visually show the relationships between points and features on the Earth's surface. These relationships are based on distance and direction. In ancient times, distance was often described in terms of time, such as ""a few hours' walk"" or ""a day's journey by river."" These descriptions provided more information about how easy it was to travel through local areas rather than the actual distance. Direction was also important, but for most travelers, the main questions were ""Where do I go from here?"" and ""How far away is it?"" Therefore, precise direction was not always crucial. For a long time, written directions were as popular as maps. Even today, some maps, like those showing train routes, do not always represent true directions. 
Landmarks along a route were initially marked by signs, which could be realistic or symbolic, and their size indicated their importance. The conventions used in maps varied based on their purpose and location, so understanding these conventions is essential when studying early maps. The history of map-making, or cartography, is mainly about improving the accuracy of distance and direction and expanding the content of maps. 
To achieve this, cartography has incorporated knowledge from other sciences. For instance, instead of determining direction by observing shadows or stars, people began using the magnetic compass and developed tools to measure angles accurately. The application of astronomy and exploration helped map the known world. Astronomers later discovered that the Earth is not a perfect sphere but slightly flattened at the poles, leading to further improvements in mapping large areas.
Over time, the needs of map users changed. Travelers and merchants were no longer the only users of maps. Soldiers, especially after the introduction of artillery, required accurate representations of the land's features. This need led to the invention of contour lines. Other users, like archaeologists, historians, and modern geographers, also had specific requirements. To meet these needs, today’s cartographers have developed methods to map various distributions, such as geological layers and land use.
The current recognition of the map's value in many scientific fields has sparked a modern revival of cartography. However, it is important to note that the development of cartography has not been a smooth process. There have been times of decline or stagnation, interrupted by periods of rapid progress, where old ideas coexisted with new ones. Cartographers have often understood the theoretical basis for improvement but had to wait for better tools to implement their ideas. Since copying old maps is the easiest way to create new ones, and because map publishers have sometimes resisted change, maps should not be accepted blindly as evidence of current knowledge and techniques.
The many thousands of maps we have today are the result of significant human effort and thought. They provide an invaluable record for those studying human history. This aspect makes the study of historical cartography both fascinating and educational."
CPE_35,C2,"
I was taken into a young man's living room, which was a calm and cultured space surrounded by a messy collection of rooms where the less ambitious family members lived. Moving from the kitchen to his room felt like going from economy to business class. This young man, Andrew Lloyd Webber, had the largest collection of records I had ever seen, the first stereo record player I had encountered, and he had even bought Georgian wine glasses, pictures, and furniture. He had received a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford, to study history, and he had nine months before starting, during which he wanted to become England's version of the composer Richard Rodgers. My own dreams were just as unrealistic; I wanted to be a pop star for the usual reasons: women, money, and fame. However, my dreams were not as crucial to me as Andrew's were to him. When Andrew suggested that I try to become a famous lyricist like Oscar Hammerstein, I was open to the idea. This was partly because, within ten minutes of meeting him, he played me three of his own tunes, and I could tell he was very talented. As he played selections from the many shows he had created at school, I was reminded of the best show albums from my parents' collection. He needed a new lyricist, and I had little to offer him except praise for his music and a single I had written with an unknown pop group that had not done well. We agreed to meet again and write something together. I was still more interested in pop music than in musical theatre, but I realized I had met someone with rare talent and determination, and I would be foolish to miss the chance to work with him. Even if we did not succeed in becoming top composers, we could try to compete with the Beatles and Rolling Stones later in the summer. 
The next day, back at my desk in the office where I was training to be a lawyer, the excitement I had felt about a life in show business with Andrew had faded a bit. I would still look for ads in Melody Maker for groups needing a singer and write more simple songs, but it was likely that I would finish my exams and become a respectable lawyer by twenty-five. My father believed I would outgrow pop music by twenty-one, which worried me because that meant I only had a few months left to enjoy it. However, I felt I had nothing to lose by seeing Andrew again. It would be fun to go to a musical with him and write lyrics for musicals instead of pop songs. Andrew was an interesting person who talked about good food and Victorian architecture and supported the Leyton Orient football team. I was not sure about the musical idea he had been working on for a year, but in 1965, I was rarely sure about anything. His talent was clear, and he claimed to have many contacts. I soon found myself back in his living room. The idea was about Dr. Thomas Barnardo, a nineteenth-century philanthropist who started orphanages. His story was important, but it did not excite me. The hero seemed too perfect in Andrew's version, and the idea felt unoriginal, too similar to Lionel Bart's hit show, Oliver. However, Andrew's strong belief in his music was contagious and somewhat justified. What did I know about musicals? As David Land, who would later be my agent for over twenty-five years, often said, if there is a demand for one hamburger place, there is room for two. We could be the second hamburger place. I began working with great enthusiasm, especially on the funny songs. Andrew explained the plot, played me the tunes, and often gave me the titles, many of which had likely been thought up by his school friend. I even skipped a day at the law office, pretending to be sick, to write my first set of theatrical lyrics. I did not realize it then, but I had changed my career."
CPE_5,C2,"**Text:**
**Language**  
You and I are part of a species with a unique ability: we can influence each other's thoughts with great accuracy. Language is so deeply connected to human life that it is hard to imagine living without it. If you see two or more people together anywhere in the world, they will likely start talking to each other. When there is no one to talk to, people often speak to themselves, their pets, or even their plants. I like to think of language as an 'instinct.' This means that people know how to communicate in a way similar to how spiders know how to spin webs. Web-spinning was not created by a brilliant spider and does not require special education or skills in building.
**Climate and Weather**  
Climate and weather, which are mainly influenced by the air around us, greatly impact the lives and locations of animals and plants. Climate can strongly shape the appearance of landscapes. For instance, warm and wet conditions throughout the year allow tropical jungles to thrive, which are rich in diverse species. In contrast, cold and windy areas can only support a limited variety of life. The daily weather patterns that contribute to the overall climate are caused by large air masses rising and mixing, as the atmosphere is always in motion. Some of this movement is due to the fact that the layer of gases sits on a spinning planet. Because air is light, it does not move at the same speed as the Earth and tends to lag behind. However, a more significant cause of air movement is the sun.
**Coffee**  
As a bar-person, my job included serving drinks, but more importantly, I was responsible for making coffee. In Lygon Street, Melbourne, a restaurant's success can depend on its coffee quality. I underwent several days of intense training in coffee-making, learning more than I ever wanted to know about cleaning and maintaining the restaurant's shiny espresso machine. I also learned the key principles for making the perfect rich, frothy cappuccino. By the end of the first week, I realized that making a good cup of coffee was not as simple as it seemed, and I feared I would be sent back to cleaning ashtrays. Fortunately, my boss was patient. ""Making coffee is both an art and a science,"" he said, ""and you need time to develop the skill."""
CPE_41,C2,"Art on TV**
Why does television often struggle with programs about visual arts? Painting and sculpture are perfect for the camera, which can show an entire artwork and zoom in on details. However, there are few TV series that truly capture the joy and complexity of viewing art. A clear example of this issue is Robert Hughes's eight-part series on American art, titled *American Visions*. Hughes is a respected critic with a strong presence, and he has nearly eight hours to introduce British viewers to an art movement that is often overlooked in British galleries. I expected the series to highlight great artworks, but instead, it focused on how American history and culture are reflected in its art and architecture.
**Dealing in Metals**
For 20 years, I worked as an international metals dealer and gained a reputation as a speculator. The metals market is less regulated than others. With some luck, a willingness to take risks, and a good understanding of the market, it is possible to earn a lot of money. Risk-taking is essential in this industry, which fits well with a free-market global economy. However, free-trade economists who believed that the market would keep the prices of scarce metals stable have discovered the opposite is true. More minerals are being extracted, and the cost of raw materials is falling. When considering inflation, the prices of most metals are now about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to investigate claims against a multinational company that benefits from these low-cost raw materials.
**Extract from a Holiday Brochure**
Abaco and its offshore cays are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas, stretching from Florida to Cuba. Each island has its own character and attractions. To explore the islands and cays of Abaco, a boat is essential. If a boat is not included with your accommodation, don’t worry. There are many ferries and water taxis available. You can also rent boats if you prefer to explore on your own. Sailing is the most popular way to get around here. Abaco is known as 'The Sailing Capital of the World' for good reason. The calm, protected waters are also perfect for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The cays and their beaches stretch for 200 miles like a string of pearls. At night, the lights of the restaurants and cafes in Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay shine brightly."
CPE_69,C2,"Build Your Own Bamboo Bike at the UK’s First Workshop**
Join a course at the Bamboo Bike Club, led by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan, where you can create your own custom bike frame and enjoy a fun weekend of bike-building. It’s Saturday morning in Hackney Wick, east London, and the Bamboo Bike Club is busy with activity. This is the only place in Britain where you can learn to build bamboo bikes.
Bamboo is becoming a popular material for bike construction. Companies like Calfee Design from California and Bamboo Bikes from Yorkshire have brought back this method, which dates back to 1894. However, many cyclists find ready-made bamboo frames too expensive, costing around $2,995 or £1,868. This high price motivated James and Ian to spend years working in a shed in Brecon, Wales, to create a more affordable bamboo bike business. They wanted to share the joy of making something unique and sustainable, rather than just selling bike frames.
Now, the Bamboo Bike Club offers monthly courses at a reasonable price, which includes a computer-designed custom bike frame and a fun weekend of building. As someone who struggles with DIY projects, I was curious about the quality of the bikes. On the first day, James and Ian teach us how to choose strong bamboo and create sturdy joints. We start by assembling the front triangle with 40 mm diameter bamboo, followed by the thinner seat and chain assembly. Alloy tubes are added for parts that need extra strength, like the handlebars and wheel forks.
James and Ian are very supportive, helping us with every cut and joint. Many participants are engineers, but Ian assures everyone that mistakes are normal. If you mess up, just try again with a new piece of bamboo. Each bamboo length is checked for quality, allowing us to choose the look of our frames: plain bamboo, black, or mottled.
On Sunday, we focus on building the lugs, which are the joints of the bike. We wrap them with hemp bindings and glue them with epoxy resin to create a strong bond. After adding a waterproof coating, the bike is ready for wheels, brakes, gears, and personal touches. James and Ian claim that their bamboo bikes are just as strong as metal ones. Ian has been riding his bike for over a year, and James has tested his bike off-road for three months without breaking it.
While bamboo bikes may not look as polished as professional ones, they are unique. I believe that bikes made from bamboo should be enjoyed for leisurely rides rather than racing. I choose a 'Classic English' frame for a comfortable ride. When I test James’s bike, I find it light, stiff, and smooth, thanks to bamboo’s ability to absorb vibrations.
James says, “Some people love the building process, but for me, the real joy comes when the bike is on the road. They are so light and fun to ride.” And the best part? The price is less than £500."

**Self-Help Books**  
Diane Reverend was an editor at Random House in New York when she first saw a manuscript by an unknown psychologist, Dr. John Gray. ""I knew it would be a bestseller,"" she says, and she was right. Dr. Gray is now very wealthy, and Diane has her own company. Dr. Gray's book about improving communication between men and women has become a symbol of a growing self-help industry that claims to meet many American desires for self-improvement. This industry also creates new desires and supports the New York publishing world. In Britain, people are discovering that this genre can produce many books that are questionable in quality, but there are even worse examples. For every self-help book published, thousands are rejected for being too similar or too specific. This is a good thing. As new editors search for the next big hit, the quality of writing is often overlooked. What matters most is how marketable the book is. ""How promotable is the author? What's the 'hook'? Is it universal enough?"" Diane lists the important questions, then admits, ""If someone comes to me with a catchy title, that's a big part of the success.""
**Autobiographies**  
There should be an understanding between an autobiographer and the reader that the truth is being shared. However, this understanding is often not fully respected. Writers may choose to leave out certain actions or thoughts because they feel ashamed or think they are not important. There are also more complex reasons for breaking this understanding. An autobiographer might believe that telling a more interesting story, even if it is not entirely true, serves the purpose of revealing the truth about themselves better than sticking strictly to the facts. Alternatively, they may decide from the start not to follow this understanding. They might label their book an autobiography to gain the reader's trust, which can help them tell their story, even if it is mostly fictional. This can happen without any intention to deceive.
**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**  
Scholars of detective stories say that this genre reflects the conflicts of society in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The detective story often symbolizes deeper human desires like lust or greed, and its resolution represents the return of order to society. In Hammett's stories, society is shown to be corrupt and false. The detective and the criminal are two sides of the same character. The detective understands the criminal and feels a strange connection with them. He is seen as too honest by criminals and too shady by the law. The detective's mission is influenced by his awareness of this duality, which can either soften his approach or make him more eager to punish.
**Science Writing**  
Stephen Jay Gould is considered one of the best scientific essayists today. To discuss his writing, I met him at the Grand Hotel while he was promoting his new book. Neither of us felt comfortable in such a fancy place. Gould said he couldn't write well in such an environment because understanding the culture is essential for a successful writer. Science is its own world, and only those who are part of it can effectively communicate it. If you don't understand the community and its rules, you will struggle. One of Gould's key beliefs is to never talk down to the reader. ""Make no concessions,"" he advises. ""You can simplify the language, but never change the core argument. If readers feel patronized, your writing will fail."""
CPE_17,C2,"**Air-conditioning**  
At Cannons Gym, a popular spot for City of London workers during lunch, the air is quite cold. To cope with this summer's high temperatures, the gym has used a lot of air-conditioning. At times when it is not busy, the gym feels very cold, almost like the Arctic. This shows how we often misuse air-conditioning in today's world. It has become a common part of our lives, symbolizing our ability to control the climate. However, many buildings with air-conditioning could use other cooling methods. They could use natural light and ventilation, and have thicker walls that keep heat out during the day and release it at night. These ideas may seem simple, but they can be very effective and would greatly reduce the need for air-conditioning.
**Sundials**  
It is interesting that as we enter a new millennium, there is a growing interest in sundials, which are tools that measure time based on the sun's position. A hundred years ago, sundials were essential for keeping accurate time. As clocks and watches improved, sundials became less important and were seen mainly as garden decorations. Now, they are being appreciated again. David Harber, a maker of sundials, believes their charm comes from their connection to the planets. He says there is a special moment when a sundial starts to work after he delivers it. They are calm and beautiful objects that remind us of our place in the universe.
**Paint Your Own China**  
My idea of china-painting came from a visit to an arts and crafts exhibition long ago, where serious-looking older women showed how to paint delicate flowers on teacups with skillful brushstrokes. It was fascinating to watch, as each stroke created a perfect petal or leaf. Their hands were steady, and the paint never smudged. I thought these women must have practiced for years or had a special talent. With this in mind, I wondered what kind of people would join a china-painting class. Would beginners have a natural talent? However, the atmosphere in the class was very welcoming. Everyone was there to enjoy themselves, and even the teacher did not want to paint with the same speed and precision I had seen before."
CPE_47,C2,"The Wrong Country**
Uncle chose a package holiday for Keith and Dawne at a good price: a flight from Gatwick Airport, twelve nights in Venice, the beautiful city, at the Pensione Concordia. When they went to the travel agency to book, the clerk told them that the other travelers were a school group from the south coast, all learning Italian. However, something went wrong. Either at the travel agency, the check-in desk, or in a computer, a small mistake happened. Dawne and Keith ended up in a hotel called the Edelweiss, in Room 212, somewhere in Switzerland.
At Gatwick, they gave their tickets to a girl in a yellow-and-red uniform. She checked their tickets and said everything was fine. An hour later, they were surprised to hear older people on the plane speaking with accents from the North of England. Keith thought there might have been a cancellation or that the Italian class was on another plane. They ordered drinks, and then more drinks. 
When they landed, a stout woman with glasses said, ""The coach will take us on. Stay together now."" There was no mention of an overnight stop in the brochure, but when the coach arrived at its destination, Keith realized that this was clearly an unexpected stop. It was close to midnight, and tired from traveling, they did not question the beds they were offered. However, the next morning, when they learned they would be staying there for their holiday, they became worried.
""We have the lake and the water birds,"" the receptionist explained with a smile. ""And we can take the steamer to Interlaken."" 
Keith calmly told the man, ""There has been a mistake. We were supposed to be in Venice, at the Pensione Concordia."" 
""I do not know that name, sir. This is Switzerland,"" the receptionist replied. 
""A coach is supposed to take us on. An official said so on the plane,"" Keith insisted. 
""Your group is booked for twelve nights at the Edelweiss Hotel. If you have changed your minds—"" 
""We haven't changed our minds. There has been a mistake,"" Keith repeated. The receptionist shook his head, saying he did not know about any mistake. 
Dawne then said, ""The man who made the booking was bald, with glasses and a moustache."" She mentioned the name of the travel agency in London. 
""Is there a problem?"" a woman said cheerfully to Keith. She was the stout woman he had seen at Gatwick. 
""My name is Franks,"" she said. ""I'm married to the man with the bad leg."" 
""Are you in charge, Mrs. Franks?"" Dawne asked. ""We are in the wrong hotel."" 
Again, Dawne described the bald clerk and the travel agency. Keith interrupted, ""It seems we got into the wrong group. We reported to the Your-Kind-of-Holiday girl and left it to her."" 
""We should have known when they weren't from Dover,"" Dawne added, mentioning that they heard the older people talking about Darlington. 
Keith was impatient and wished she would let him speak. ""We noticed you at Gatwick,"" he said. ""We knew you were in charge."" 
""I counted you, although you probably didn't see me,"" Mrs. Franks replied. ""Let me explain. Your-Kind-of-Holiday sends clients to many places, with different holidays at different prices. There are villa holidays for adventurous people under thirty-five, and treks to Turkey and the Himalayas."" 
""What I am trying to say is that all tickets and labels look similar, yellow with two red bands,"" Mrs. Franks laughed. ""If you just followed others with the yellow-and-red label, you might think you could end up anywhere!"" 
""But we are not supposed to be in Switzerland,"" Keith insisted. 
""Let’s see,"" Mrs. Franks said unexpectedly, and then she walked away, leaving them standing there. The receptionist was no longer at the desk, and they could hear typing. 
""She seems quite nice,"" Dawne whispered. Keith was not listening. He tried to remember everything that had happened: giving the tickets to the girl, waiting, and then the girl leading them to the plane. 
""Nice to have some young people along,"" an elderly man said, interrupting Keith's thoughts. ""Nottage is the name."" His wife was with him, and they both looked very old. She said they had the best sleep they had in years, thanks to the lakeside air. 
""That's nice,"" Dawne replied. Keith walked out of the reception area, and Dawne followed him. Outside the hotel, they did not mention the irony of their situation. On their first holiday since their honeymoon, they found themselves in a package tour with elderly people, when the whole point of the holiday was to escape the demands of the elderly. Uncle had said so himself when they tried to persuade him to join them."
CPE_48,C2,"'HE WAS A PEOPLE PERSON'**
American business leaders are looking to the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a model for good management. Eluned Price reports.
Most people in Britain know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and have a general idea of his achievements. However, America has only recently discovered him. The Wall Street Journal described Shackleton as ""an Antarctic explorer whose feats went largely unnoticed for most of the 20th century,"" which is an exaggeration. Now, Americans are enthusiastically learning about him. Biographies and stories about the voyage of the Endurance are being published quickly, and the American Museum of Natural History is organizing a major exhibition. Columbia Tristar is also making a film about Shackleton's life.
Some American managers have adopted Shackleton as a role model. They share stories of his actions with admiration and draw lessons in leadership and communication from his experiences. They even refer to each other as ""speaking Shackleton."" Shackleton, known for his determination and resourcefulness, has become a symbol for modern management consultants.
Jim MacGregor, the managing partner of Abernathy MacGregor Frank in New York, has looked up to Shackleton for years. His firm focuses on communication during mergers, acquisitions, and corporate crises. For example, they handle situations like ""this firm's plant exploded"" or ""half the workforce must be laid off."" While it may be hard to see how Shackleton's experience of surviving in extreme conditions relates to managing a financial crisis, MacGregor believes Shackleton is a great model for management because of his leadership qualities. Shackleton had clear values and was at his best when he and his team had a lot at stake, including their lives.
One of Shackleton's most interesting decisions was to turn back when he was only 97 miles from the South Pole. This choice showed his credibility for future decisions, as the safety of his men was his top priority. In a crisis, people want to know who is in charge. While many managers today may avoid responsibility, Shackleton was willing to take charge and accept the consequences.
His 1914 expedition became legendary. His ship, the Endurance, was trapped in ice for nine months before it was finally crushed. When the ship sank, Shackleton told his men, ""We should all eventually reach safety if you do your best and trust me."" From the accounts and diaries kept during the expedition, it is clear that Shackleton was always in control. 
MacGregor notes that Shackleton thought carefully, planned for every situation, kept his men informed, and valued their opinions. He was flexible and willing to change plans when necessary. ""We've developed effective principles based on Shackleton's example. Clients can relate to his story without feeling criticized,"" he says.
Shackleton believed that an explorer needs optimism, endurance, and patience. ""One of the hardest things to do in tough situations is to wait, especially in America, where there is a strong desire to fix things quickly,"" MacGregor explains. ""If you invest in bonds and make a wrong guess about interest rates, it's better to hold on and wait for your money to come back rather than sell and take a big loss. Similarly, don't hesitate to change your plans if they aren't working. If a new product isn't selling, don't keep pushing it.""
Shackleton led by example. On the return journey from the Endurance, he noticed Hurley, the expedition photographer, without gloves. He insisted that Hurley wear his gloves, threatening to throw them overboard if he didn't. Another crew member recalled Shackleton doing something similar with a biscuit during a previous expedition when they were near starvation: ""He said he would leave it in the snow. Millions of pounds couldn't have bought that biscuit.""
As Caroline Alexander, author of *Endurance*, the human account of that expedition, states: ""The public's interest in heroic efforts is growing. Shackleton highlights the lack of heroism in today's world. He stands out as a true embodiment of the ideals we long for today."""
