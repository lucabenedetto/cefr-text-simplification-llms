**Garbage in, garbage out**
Charging families for each bag of rubbish they throw away seems like a good idea for the environment and for money. But it might not be. In many developed countries, people have a regular service to collect their rubbish. Rubbish bags or bins are taken away by a special truck to a dump. This service is usually free. Families pay for it through local taxes, but a family that throws away a lot of rubbish pays the same as a couple that throws away very little. 
However, collecting rubbish is not free. The more rubbish people throw away, the more trucks and workers are needed. This costs local governments more money. If rubbish disposal is free, people will throw away too much rubbish. A solution is to make families pay for the rubbish they throw away. This could encourage them to throw away less and recycle more, if local governments help with recycling.
Two American economists, Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman, studied this idea in some American towns. They looked at a system where families had to buy stickers to put on their rubbish bags. Only bags with stickers would be picked up. In Charlottesville, Virginia, families paid 80 cents for each sticker. This seemed like a good idea, but the costs of running the program were higher than the money made from the stickers. 
The number of bags thrown away did go down by 37%. But many people just packed more rubbish into each bag instead of buying more stickers. This is not as good as using machines to compact rubbish at dumps. The total weight of rubbish collected only fell by 14%. In other towns without this sticker system, the weight of rubbish also fell, but by only 3.5%. 
Some people even started to dump their rubbish illegally instead of paying for collection. This illegal dumping might be responsible for 30-40% of the drop in collected rubbish. On a positive note, recycling increased by 15%, which means people chose to recycle instead of paying for rubbish collection. But many people were already recycling before the sticker system started.
In a later study, Fullerton and Kinnaman looked at rubbish in more detail. They found that charging for rubbish does reduce the amount thrown away, but not by much. For example, if sticker prices go up by 10%, the amount of rubbish only goes down by 0.3%. This is less than in other studies. To throw away much less rubbish, people would need to buy less of everything. A small fee for rubbish is not likely to change much.
It is also important to think about other factors like income and education. In richer towns, people throw away more rubbish and have less time to recycle. So, is charging families for rubbish a bad idea? Not really, because free disposal is too cheap. But simple ideas can have complicated results. We often need detailed studies to understand them, and sometimes the results are not good."
CPE_19,C2,"**Work and Change**
Theodore Zeldin talks about how our work life could change. Do you feel respected and appreciated at your job? Success in a career is not enough anymore. Many people feel their work is not valued or understood. Even famous people can feel unhappy despite their success. 
Loving your job used to be enough to be admired, but now you should think about how your job affects you as a person. This is an important question. If your skills make you boring and you cannot talk to others outside your job, then no amount of money or status will make you happy. 
I want to find out how work can help us feel fulfilled and happy, instead of just making us work for companies. Work should not just be about making money; it should help us live better lives and discover new talents. 
However, just creating more jobs is not enough. As people learn more, they want jobs that are interesting and meaningful. Work should be seen as a beautiful journey, with happy people at its center. Even jobs that used to be exciting, like being a doctor or an architect, can now be very stressful. Many workers feel unhappy and unfulfilled.
I am studying different jobs to see how they affect people. I want to understand what makes us happy, loved, and respected. I am now looking for better ways to earn a living. Many experts focus on making companies richer, but we also need to think about ourselves as people and who we want to work with.
How many of us feel truly alive at work? Many people feel like they are stuck in their jobs, unable to leave because of their skills and careers. For example, many hotel workers are smart and lively but have low pay and long hours. Hotels could be more than just places to sleep; they could be cultural centers where people from different countries meet and share experiences.
Hotel workers often do not have deep connections with guests. If hotels listened to their staff's dreams, they could offer many more services. But often, they focus only on making money. 
It is time to think about work in a new way. Work is about relationships. Many people want to feel independent at work and should be able to create their own jobs and choose their colleagues. This means they need to learn to talk to people from different backgrounds.
Good communication is important, but it is not the same as real conversation. Real conversation helps us understand each other better and creates respect. When we have these meaningful conversations, we can change the world, even if just a little bit."
CPE_24,C2,"**BROADCASTING: How Technology Affects Society**
The word 'broadcasting' originally meant to spread seeds widely by hand. This idea is not just about farming; it also represents hope for growth and success. It suggests that if we plan well, we can have a good outcome. The idea of broadcasting assumes that there are resources available to help spread information.
We need to think about why a new technology that sends words and pictures electronically was set up in a way that fits this farming idea. Television, which is a technology for communication, is connected to other forms of communication like the telegraph and telephone. However, from the beginning, television was seen as a way to reach many people at once from a central place. This way of broadcasting matched the social and economic structures of modern societies.
There were some attempts to create different ways of using television. In the early 1930s, radio enthusiasts in Britain tried to make two-way television, which could replace regular telephones. Many science magazines wrote about how to build television equipment, and many people experimented with it. But in 1938, big companies made rules for television that pushed these amateur efforts aside. This meant that the chance for a more equal and community-based form of television was lost in Britain.
Broadcasting was not only about money; it was also connected to the structure of modern societies. In the early 1930s, television was mostly used for public shows in the USA and was seen as competition for movies. Many people watched television in public places, especially in Britain and Germany.
The idea of community-based television was not successful. Instead, companies saw a chance to sell television sets to homes. As working-class people began to earn more money in the 1920s, having a home with entertainment became possible for many people in Western countries. Now, this is happening all over the world.
There is a clear link between social changes and how broadcasting is organized. As societies modernized, power and money became more centralized, and traditional communities broke apart. People became more mobile, which made them feel more isolated compared to earlier, stable communities. Centralized broadcasting helped governments share important information with all citizens and created a sense of community in the nation.
However, broadcasting can also be seen positively as a way to support democracy. During the time between the World Wars, many countries recognized the importance of broadcasting for giving everyone equal access to information needed for participating in society.
Television is changing now, and the term 'broadcasting' may not fit as well as before. In the future, it might only refer to a specific way of using audio-visual technology during a certain time of social change."
CPE_13,C2,"**Clutter**
Sometimes, it feels like no matter how many things you own, you still do not feel safe. It is normal to want a home that meets your needs, but sometimes we want too many things. Advertisements make us feel insecure. They often tell us that if we do not have certain things, we are not good enough. 
To see how much advertisements affect you, try not to look at any ads when you walk down the street. We see many ads on TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, t-shirts, and the internet. All of these tell us to buy more things.
**Caves**
Many researchers and universities study caves. They look at where caves come from, how water moves in them, and the plants and animals that live there. Caves are small but interesting parts of nature. They make us curious and want to learn more. Because caves are important, many people study them, especially in places where caves affect our lives. 
However, visiting caves can be hard for some people. This means that many cave studies are done by both scientists and people who visit caves for fun.
**Weather Watch**
Many people have watched the weather for a long time without any special tools. This helped create the science of meteorology, which studies the weather. Since the 17th century, this science has become very advanced. Now, we use satellites and electronic tools to get weather information quickly. Computers can solve complex math problems much faster than people can.
Meteorology uses many difficult words that are hard to understand. But human experience is still very important for making weather forecasts. What people observe can help scientists understand the weather better."
CPE_16,C2,"**MUSIC AND THEATRE**
Not long ago, I thought that opera was mainly theatre. Now, I think differently. After working at a national opera house, I learned that music is the most important part of opera. This is how it should be. But I come from the world of theatre, where words and actors are very important. In theatre, there is no one directing the action once it starts, and the audience usually understands the language of the actors.
At music performances, like concerts or operas, many people do not know much about music. Some feel embarrassed about this. Most people are amazed by the talent of the musicians. A great singer or a good orchestra is easy to admire. Even a good musician shows us years of hard work. Watching great music is like watching a sports match. We know athletes do something similar to what we do when we run, but they do it much better.
Theatre audiences have different expectations. They often do not understand how hard acting is and may not be impressed by an actor's long speech. They often ask, ""How do you learn all those lines?"" This does not mean theatre audiences are less demanding than music audiences. Many people enjoy both theatre and music. In theatre, audiences and performers are more equal, no matter how difficult the play is.
Does music need to learn from theatre? I think yes. I have seen how a different approach can make the experience better for concert-goers. Live music is very emotional and can connect with the audience. However, the way music is often presented, with strict dress codes and a focus on conductors and soloists, can make it feel like there is a big difference between the performers and the audience.
Sometimes, music audiences clap between songs or after a great performance. This is a way to show appreciation, but it can also interrupt the flow of the music. 
Many people are working to bring new audiences to concerts and operas. They want to make people feel that ""serious"" music is for everyone. I remember a special event called ""In Search of Angels,"" where the performance moved from a cathedral to the town. It was a wonderful experience, and many audience members felt they were part of it.
I wish music could be more adventurous like the best theatre. Sometimes, using unusual places for performances can surprise both performers and audiences. It might not be comfortable, and the sound might not be perfect, but theatre audiences are used to following artists into different spaces. 
I know that many plays are performed in a traditional way, similar to concerts. However, I believe that music performances can change for the better. I love both theatre and music, and I want more people to enjoy them like I do."
CPE_21,C2,"**Sand**  
I think sand is amazing because it can be changed into useful things like glass and concrete. But I do not like it when it is on the beach. To me, sand is a problem. It gets in my face, my food, and it can even take my car keys and coins. When I am wet, sand sticks to me and is hard to wash off, even with a strong hose. But when I step on a towel, get in a car, or walk on a clean carpet, the sand falls off easily. For days, I find sand everywhere when I take off my shoes and socks. Sand stays with you for a long time. I would rather not have sand at all.
**Lock and Key**  
People have always wanted a safe home. A long time ago, they used simple locks, but now we have electronic locks that use cards. However, many people still prefer to use a real key. They feel safer when they can turn a key in a lock. One company made a new electronic lock but included a real metal key because people like that better.
**Modern Art**  
I was nervous to visit the new Tate Modern gallery because I do not understand modern art very well. I like some pieces, especially furry things, bright light sculptures, and big photos. I think if I knew more about art, I would have more opinions. But art is not just about understanding; it is about feeling something. This gallery tries to help visitors understand the art better. I noticed that they have good labels that explain what the art is about. These labels helped me understand the art instead of just looking at it without knowing what it means."
CPE_46,C2,"**Every Picture Tells a Story**
**Making Movies from Books**  
When a book is made into a movie, many parts of the story are often cut out. This can be hard for the writer, but it can also help them see things in a new way. While writing a movie script, I noticed that I could remove a lot of the dialogue and descriptions from the book and still tell the same story. This does not mean that the original words were not important. It is about how people pay attention to stories in books and movies. In a book, some things are repeated to help readers remember characters and their traits. For example, we often see phrases like ""he said"" to show who is talking. This makes it easier to read. In plays, the dialogue often sounds like real conversations, but sometimes it can be too much and not clear.
**Watching Movies**  
When we watch movies, we can feel like we are part of the story. It takes us away from our everyday lives for a while. But when the movie ends and the lights come on, we are back in the real world. Some people think that watching movies is just for fun and not real art. Many older people, like our parents and teachers, enjoyed movies but did not see them as serious art.
**The Film Studios**  
The Leiper Film Company studios were made up of many different buildings. It was hard to find your way around because there were many small rooms that looked the same. There were three main entrances, but none of them helped people know where to go. Most people who worked there knew how to get around, but it could be confusing for visitors. The workers created stories of romance and adventure that took people away from their everyday problems for a few hours.
**Becoming a Filmmaker**  
Many people want to make movies. There are many books and courses about how to write scripts and make films. Some competitions even give away cameras to help new filmmakers. Robert Rodriguez made a famous film called El Mariachi for only $7,000. He became well-known quickly. He wrote about how he wanted to make a great film before he turned 26, just like famous directors did when they were young. In the past, filmmakers had to work for a long time before making their first movie. They learned by working in different jobs in the film industry. For example, John Huston was 35 when he made his first film. Today, many new filmmakers have to find their own way without the help of big studios."
CPE_3,C2,"In the past, there were many council houses on the western side of the city. These houses were small and not very nice, made of orange brick or white plaster. In the summer, a bad smell from a factory nearby filled the air. In the mornings, you could often see a paperboy making a face because of the smell as he walked to deliver papers.
I don’t remember much from my early life, but I do remember sitting by a window and looking at the houses far away. I also have memories of my mother. She was a small woman who often seemed angry, and I never really understood why. When I went with her to small shops or around the city, I noticed that she was very lonely, even when there were many people around her. She cared a lot about behaving properly, which was not common in our neighborhood. This sometimes led to her cleaning the house a lot or telling me to ""behave properly."" I didn’t really understand her rules, which included not going into neighbors' gardens and sitting quietly at the dinner table.
My mother had a few friends, like Mrs. Buddery, who loved the Royal Family, and Mrs. Winall, who didn’t say much. There was also Mrs. Laband, who was more lively. Looking back, I see that these women often talked about their problems, like bad legs and cold weather, and I sometimes felt like I was one of the problems.
Growing up in West Earlham was not easy. Until I was five, I stayed at home and played while my mother sat in a chair. After my fifth birthday, I went to a school half a mile away. Some kids were lucky to have a mother with a bike to take them, but my mother usually let me walk with other kids.
I remember summer holidays when I saw a little of the world outside West Earlham. There was an old man next door who told stories about his life at sea. Once, there was a charity event where a kind woman gave out lemonade, but my mother didn’t like it and thought they just wanted money. She often talked about how people were only after money, and she didn’t trust politicians at all.
My mother did care about my education. Sometimes, she took me to the Norwich Castle Museum on Sundays. We would look at paintings together. She didn’t mind this, and once she even made a joke about a painting of a Roman soldier, saying she wouldn’t want to meet him at night. This was a rare moment of fun with her."
CPE_10,C2,"**Philadelphia Avenue**
I walked down Philadelphia Avenue on the side with odd numbers. It was getting dark, and the air felt wet and sticky. This side of the street was familiar to me. I remembered our neighbors, the Matzes and the Pritchards, and Han Kieffer's grocery store. I also thought of the Krings and the Pottses, where my first friends, all girls, lived. 
Even though I did not know everyone by name, I could picture the houses. I remembered the little channels in the cement that carried rainwater from the roofs to the street. I used to skate and ride my scooter there. As the street went down, the houses looked simpler. The porches were lower, and the front yards were smaller. 
Over the years, things changed. Wooden railings were replaced with iron ones. In Shillington, some houses became stores, and some stores, like Pep Conrad's and Han Kieffer's, became homes again. I wondered how people lived in these places that used to be shops. 
**Bachelor Fads Furniture Designer Rick Gilbert**
Rick Gilbert lives in a flat that used to be a curtain warehouse. It has big doors and exposed brick walls. He did not want his flat to be completely open. In his last home, it was hard to relax because his living space and work space were together. 
To make his flat better, he used a big piece of plastic to separate the office from the entrance. This created a hallway and led to the kitchen. He wanted the kitchen to be a place where he could cook for friends or make coffee for clients. 
To make the flat feel warm, he put light wood on the floors. He also mixed modern furniture with sentimental pieces from his parents or markets.
**Bruce Chatwin**
Bruce Chatwin was a writer who loved to travel. His life was full of secrets and stories. He wrote a famous book called *In Patagonia* in 1977. This book changed travel writing. It was exciting and imaginative, like a thriller or a romantic story. 
Chatwin sometimes changed facts to make his stories better. He believed that traveling could help people discover amazing histories.
**Swimming**
One summer day, it rained heavily. I ran across the lawn behind my house and jumped into the pool. I swam back and forth, watching the raindrops splash in the water. The best moments were when the rain got stronger, and the sound of birds disappeared. 
During this time, I thought about swimming across Britain. I wanted to follow the rain as it flowed to the sea. I felt tired of swimming in circles, like a tiger in a cage. 
Many places today have signs and labels. This makes the world feel less real. Walking, cycling, and swimming help us feel free and discover the wild parts of our world. A swimming journey would let me explore the mysterious places that still exist."
CPE_67,C2,"**Crying**
Charles Darwin thought that crying did not have a clear purpose for humans. But he was probably wrong. Scientists today say that crying is important for social reasons. For example, psychiatrist John Bowlby said that crying helps create a strong bond between a mother and her child. Many people believe that children cry because they feel helpless.
It is harder to understand why adults cry. The sound of crying is not as important as what we see when someone cries. In early human groups, crying may have helped people trust each other and feel close.
People cry for different reasons. We might cry to show sympathy for someone who is suffering. Sometimes, we cry without meaning to when we hear beautiful music or see a touching speech. We may also cry when we watch a sad movie, and this happens more often when we are with other people than when we are alone.
Crying has a social purpose, and scientists are still studying it."
CPE_27,C2,"**The Heat is On**
We all know about global warming, but how much warmer will the Earth get? How will it change our lives? Many people have some idea about global warming, but not everyone knows what will happen because of it. A warmer climate will change the weather everywhere in the world. Since the atmosphere affects everything on Earth, these changes will also impact plants, animals, water, and soil.
Humans use natural resources to help us live. We grow food, build cities, and support billions of people. So, any changes to these resources are very important. The problem is that we do not know exactly how the world will change or what is causing these changes. 
Over the last 100 years, human actions have increased the amount of certain gases in the air. These gases are connected to global temperature. It seems that these gases are already affecting the climate, but we do not fully understand how everything works together. 
Scientists have found that the Earth has warmed by about 6°C in the last century. Most scientists believe this warming is not just natural and is partly caused by human pollution. Many scientists are trying to predict what will happen because of higher global temperatures. They use special computer programs called general circulation models (GCMs) to help them. These programs look at how temperature, pressure, and sunlight interact to predict the climate. However, these models are not perfect and can be slow and expensive to use.
Despite these challenges, most people agree that climate change will happen faster than before. The predictions from GCMs suggest that by the year 2100, the average global temperature will rise by 1°C to 3.5°C. Sea levels are expected to rise by 15 to 95 cm, and there will be changes in rainfall patterns. Scientists also think that extreme weather, like heatwaves, floods, and droughts, will happen more often in some places.
These changes will affect the environment and people. Climate change can change where forests and grasslands are located, the types of plants and animals in these areas, and the resources we need to survive, like food and water. Some effects may be very bad, but not all changes will be negative. For example, in Australia, warmer temperatures have helped increase wheat production.
However, small changes in climate can also lead to water shortages, especially in dry areas. In the Mediterranean region, there has been less rain in some places, and rain is falling more in autumn and winter instead of spring. 
Another problem is that glaciers are changing. This affects ice in the mountains and oceans, which can harm plants, animals, and human buildings. The Arctic ice is melting, which makes it easier for ships to travel but also increases the risk of icebergs.
One of the biggest effects of global warming will be rising sea levels. Warmer water takes up more space, and melting ice adds to this. Many people live in coastal areas, so rising sea levels can cause serious problems. Cities like London, New York, and Tokyo could face flooding, and many people could lose their homes. 
Small island countries are at the greatest risk. If sea levels rise too much, these islands could disappear, which would be devastating for their people and cultures."
CPE_66,C2,"'Mission to Mars
Wanted: a married couple for a 501-day trip to Mars. The couple should be healthy and strong. This will be the first group of astronauts to go to Mars if Dennis Tito's plans work. He wants to send a spacecraft on 5 January 2018. 
The spacecraft will go to about 160 km above Mars. It will use Mars' gravity to come back to Earth without using much fuel. Saving fuel is very important. The trip must happen in 2018 because the next time Mars and Earth are close is in 2031. 
This is a big project, and new technology is needed. If everything is ready in time, the spacecraft might go. Even if it does not leave Earth, the work will help future missions to Mars.'"
CPE_44,C2,"**AESTHETICS**
Art is important, but sometimes it is hard to understand. This is because we often think of art as just a building, a book, a painting, or a statue. We forget that art is also about how people feel and experience it. When we only look at the art itself, we miss its true meaning.
Some art is very famous and admired. This can make it hard for us to see it in a new way. When art becomes a classic, it seems separate from the people and the feelings that created it. This makes it difficult to understand its importance in our lives.
To understand art better, we need to connect it with our everyday experiences. Just like mountains are part of the earth, art is part of our daily lives. People who study art should help us see this connection.
To really understand art, we might need to forget about it for a moment. We should look at the simple things in life that we usually do not think of as art. For example, we can enjoy flowers without knowing much about plants. But if we want to understand how flowers grow, we need to learn about soil, air, water, and sunlight.
Many people enjoy things like movies, music, and comics, but they do not always think of these as art. When we think of art as only what we see in museums, we miss out on the joy in our everyday experiences. 
Art is best appreciated when it is connected to our daily lives. When we see art as part of our normal activities, we can enjoy it more."
CPE_22,C2,"**Observing Lions**
Many people think that lions hunting for food is amazing. They imagine lions working together like a team to catch their prey at sunset. Lions seem to be very social animals that cooperate to get their next meal. However, after studying lions in the wild for many years, we have a different view. 
When we began our research in 1978, we wanted to understand why lions hunt together, raise their young, and scare off other animals with their loud roars. We thought that if animals work together, they would have more baby lions that survive. But sometimes, if one lion helps too much, it can lose out. So, why do lions work together? We thought we would find the answer in two or three years. But lions are very good at resting and doing nothing. 
Because wild lions can live up to 18 years, we are only now starting to understand their behavior.
**Pop Music Review**
The third album by Bedrock was very important for the band. The album, called *New Life*, changed rock music in the country for many years. It moved away from the serious and dark music of the past and brought in a lighter and more fun style. 
The songs mixed social ideas with humor and had sounds from fairground organs and brass bands. Bedrock showed that they were good at collecting ideas and writing songs. They wrote about everyday things like sunbathing and relaxing on Sundays. But the best songs had deeper feelings, like ""So Low,"" which was about the weather, and ""To the Brink,"" which was very emotional. 
*New Life* is great because it has 16 high-quality songs with no bad ones, which is rare for long albums.
**Extract from an Autobiography**
As a child, I loved stories about 'The Sibyl,' wise women from ancient times. I first heard about one from my mother. An old woman from Cumae offered the King of Rome nine books for a lot of gold. When he refused, she burned three books and offered him six for the same price. He still said no, so she burned three more. Finally, he bought the last three for the full price. I learned a valuable lesson from this story about selling and life.
I was often lonely as a child. I wanted to play with other kids, but they would say no. My mother told me to do something interesting so they would want to join me. It worked, and I never forgot that lesson.
When I got the chance to write a travel book, I looked for something that mattered to me. I don’t like to travel much, so I gave my editor a long list of places I didn’t want to go. I prefer to explore ruins because I enjoy traveling in my mind through time.
**What Happens to Your Manuscript?**
When you send your manuscript (your written work), it will probably go into a pile of other manuscripts waiting to be read. This pile is called the slush pile. Usually, a junior editor or an experienced editor will look at it. They want to find something new and interesting.
If they like your work, they will show it to a senior editor. This editor will decide if your book is good and if it can sell well. They will also think about whether you, as an author, can be successful in the future. Publishers often want to meet authors before they make an offer."
CPE_39,C2,"**Advertising on Trial**
In the early 1990s, working in an advertising agency was very hard. There was a big recession, which means many businesses were not doing well. This recession lasted a long time and affected many countries, including Britain. In 1991, many people lost their jobs, and many homes were taken away because people could not pay for them. Businesses, especially in the vehicle and building industries, lost a lot of money.
People who worked in advertising also faced problems. They felt a lot of pressure because they had to help their companies make money. They had to do their jobs with smaller budgets, which made things even harder. Even though they had less money to spend, the importance of marketing grew. Companies started to understand that they needed to make products that customers wanted, not just what was easy for them to make.
Because of this, marketing became more important, and marketing workers gained more respect. However, they also had more work to do. Many people thought that advertising could solve all problems, but this was not true. About half of the money spent on marketing went to advertising, so advertising workers felt responsible for the results.
In the 1980s, advertising was very successful, but in the early 1990s, it faced many challenges. The bad economy made companies think carefully about how much they spent on advertising. They wanted to see clear results for their money, but many were not sure if advertising was worth it. This made advertising workers feel like they were on trial.
Companies wanted better advertising strategies, better targeting, and better creativity. They wanted the best people from advertising agencies to work for them and to be very motivated. Advertising workers had to find ways to do more with less money, which was very difficult.
There were also other challenges. The economy was not the only problem. Changes in society, the power of retailers, and new laws about advertising made things harder. Some companies also had to learn how to advertise in other countries.
Because of all these challenges, advertising workers had to find ways to make their advertising more effective. However, help for them was not easy to find. Many companies were too busy dealing with their problems to share their ideas. The books and seminars available did not always provide useful information. They often made it seem like all advertising was perfect, which was not true. This did not help the workers who needed to create better advertising."
CPE_18,C2,"**The Kitchen and Cooking**
When I was in university, I wanted to be a chef. This was not a common choice among my friends. Most people wanted different jobs. Cooking is often seen as a hard job. Chefs work long hours, and the work can be very stressful and not well paid. But I still wanted to be a chef. I was not happy at university. The work was difficult, and the social life was not fun. Being a chef seemed like a good escape from my university life. It felt serious and honest, which I missed in college.
My wish to cook was not just because I was unhappy. I also loved the beauty of cooking. I first felt this when I ate at a famous restaurant in London. The food was amazing. I remember my first dish very well. After that meal, I wanted to learn all the secrets of cooking. I changed my life as a student to prepare for becoming a chef. My history degree felt unimportant to me. I learned to cook by reading cookbooks, visiting markets, and making special meals.
**Learning to Dive**
The swimming teacher at my school was a tough man with strong muscles and tattoos. When I asked him to teach me how to dive, he told me to sit on the edge of the pool, put my hands above my head, and roll forward into the water. I practiced this until my time was up. The next time, he made me stand up and dive from the edge. He was strict, and every time I came up from the water, he told me what to do better: ""Don't look down, look up!"" ""Keep your legs straight!"" ""Point your toes!""
The following week, I went to the high diving board. It was very high, and I felt scared. I stood there, trying to be brave. I waved my arms like he taught me, looked up, and jumped. For a moment, I felt like I was flying. But when I hit the water, I fell awkwardly, and my legs were everywhere. The instructor looked at me with disappointment. But I still felt happy. I thought, ""This is what they mean by 'free as a bird.'""
**The Traveller**
For many people, having a comfortable bed, clean water, and safety is very important. But some people, called travellers, choose to live differently. They take risks, like climbing dangerous mountains or sailing alone on the ocean. They might eat strange food if they have to and can live for a long time in unknown places. 
Some people think these travellers are strange. They are different from us, and we might not understand them. We can go back to our normal lives with microwaves and phones, happy that our risks are small, like crossing a busy street.
**Sailing**
Jonathan Raban is a writer who is afraid of the sea, but he spends a lot of time on it. He does not say he is a great sailor, but he can sail well. He likes to write about his sailing experiences. Sailing gives him stories to tell.
Raban has a small boat with a device that tells him exactly where he is on the ocean. He likes this device, but he also believes that using a compass was a mistake. He thinks it changed how people connect with the sea. Now, sailors look at the compass instead of feeling the waves and the ocean. The sea, which used to be full of life, is now just a space to cross. Because of this, a sailor can use a machine to steer the boat for a long time. This is why Raban has time to watch the waves carefully."
CPE_62,C2,"**Holiday Reading**
Summer gives us two great joys: leaving home and reading books. These joys are connected. Books can help us feel at home in the world. We can relate our own experiences to those in books written a long time ago or in faraway places. In books, we find our own thoughts and feelings. Authors can express what we feel but in a clearer way. They can say what we are shy or confused about, and this can be surprising, especially if the author is from a different time or place. We feel thankful to these authors for helping us understand ourselves.
When we read or travel, we can escape our daily routines. Our eyes are wide open when we first arrive in a new place. This is also true when we read a great book. It helps us notice things we usually ignore. We start to see the colors of the sky, the changes in a person's face, or feelings we didn’t know we had.
**Author's Note**
These travel thoughts were published in the Observer newspaper over seven years. I have made some small changes to fit the articles better, but not much else. I corrected a few mistakes, but I could have made more changes if I had more time. For example, in my article about China, I thought the Hong Kong dollar would stay strong, but it fell a year later. If I changed my writing to show this, it would not be the same story. Like many travelers, I was there at that time, not knowing what would happen next.
**Ecotourism**
If there were awards for tourism words that have been misused, ""ecotourism"" would win. This word started in the early 1980s when people became more aware of the environment. Tour operators realized that many travelers wanted to travel without harming the places they visited. Now, ""ecotourism"" can mean anything from living with remote tribes for two weeks to a short boat trip in Australia. Any tour that includes culture, nature, or adventure can be called ecotourism. The original idea was good, but without clear rules, many travelers feel confused about what ecotourism really means.
**Transylvanian Journey**
I lost my notebook about my trip to Transylvania for 50 years, but I found it again a few years ago. It helped me remember that time, but it was not perfect. In Transylvania, I had a better time than I expected. I moved from one friendly house to another and often stayed for weeks. When I stayed in one place for a long time, I stopped writing because I thought there was nothing to record. I was slow to start writing again when I moved on, and sometimes I only wrote short notes instead of full stories. I worried that some details were out of order when I started writing this book, but then I realized it didn’t matter much, so I let the story flow naturally."
CPE_49,C2,"**Fashion**
Fashion is often thought of as something new, but it has a long history. Many experts say that fashion started to grow in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries when trade became more important. As societies grew and new ways to make clothes were invented, the meanings of clothing also became more complex. Today, it is hard to know what a piece of clothing really means. For example, a man's suit can mean different things to different people.
**Writer**
Many people think that all writers are famous and make a lot of money, but this is not true for most. Some writers have other jobs to support themselves while they write. They often write in the evenings after their full-time jobs. Others, like me, do different small jobs, such as teaching and writing articles. I have heard about a writing job at a chocolate factory, but I have never found one. Still, by working part-time and using credit cards, and with help from friends, I manage to write my novel.
**Sudden Fame**
When we started performing at small places, many people came to see us. We had to use secret doors to avoid being overwhelmed by fans. On our days off, it was hard to go outside without being followed by fans. In just a few days, we became famous. Our fans watched our every move, and our management took care of us. Even though I was still shy, I felt a strange confidence that comes to shy people in these situations. I felt very out of my comfort zone."
CPE_31,C2,"**Music - The Future Ahead**
Technology is changing our lives at work, home, and in our free time. Susan Hallam talks about how this affects music in Britain. In the late 20th century, there were many new ways to listen to music, like radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, and videos. However, fewer people are performing live music, and there are fewer full-time jobs for musicians.
More people can access music now, and this is likely to continue because music meets many human needs. In Britain, music is important for national events and personal activities. A world without music is hard to imagine. The question is not if there will be music in the 21st century, but what kind of music it will be and if people will still want to learn to play instruments.
I believe that people will still want to learn instruments. The music industry is a big part of the economy in Britain, and musical skills are important for many jobs, especially in media. Also, playing an instrument can help develop skills in children. Research in the USA shows that making music can improve thinking skills. Studies in Europe suggest that group music lessons can help children make friends and focus better in school.
Research is also looking at how playing an instrument can help with other skills. For example, practicing regularly can help with good study habits, and playing in concerts can teach punctuality and organization. Because of this, there will likely be a continued need for music lessons in the near future.
What about the future? There are two likely changes. First, people will listen to more types of music, mixing different styles. Second, technology will be used more to create and perform music. This will make it easier for people to compose music without needing a lot of technical skills, but it may also mean fewer live performances.
More people of all ages will want to make music together in their communities, reflecting their local musical traditions. To prepare for this future, music teachers need to change how they teach. They should help more people learn different instruments throughout their lives. This means music lessons will need to adapt to be relevant for more people and include a wider range of musical skills.
Musicians will need training to inspire and teach students of all ages. They should learn to work with different groups and develop skills in communication and management for community work. This is a big change from traditional teaching, and it will also require accountability to the public. 
This is a chance for everyone in music education to show the high quality of music teaching available. Finally, we need to make music more important in our lives. Music is essential, but we often take it for granted. Everyone in the music profession should work together to change this."
CPE_58,C2,"**The Actor's Craft**
Sometimes, people do not respect actors. This is often because actors talk about their work in interviews. Instead of sharing their feelings, they use boring phrases or gossip. The actor Paul Scofield once wrote that acting is only real when it happens on stage. Talking about it makes it less interesting. Each time an actor performs, they start fresh and learn new things. After a play ends, they feel empty until the next performance.
**A Review of Hamlet**
Adrian Lester plays Hamlet, a character between being a boy and a man. His performance is simple but very strong. He shows great control and confidence. Lester plays a young man with hidden anger, but he also has a sharp sense of humor. His acting is impressive. You can see how he moves his body, waiting to act. Another actor, Handy, plays Horatio in a way that shows he is moved by something inside him.
**What is Acting?**
Acting is about showing feelings and behaviors. It raises questions about what makes a character come alive on stage.
**A Director's Rehearsal Process**
One director has a special way to start rehearsals called ""dropping in."" The stage manager shows the script on a screen. While one person speaks, the actors listen carefully. When it is their turn, they think about the words and what they mean. They take a breath and remember something related to the line. For example, if the line is about waiting in the rain, they might think of a time they waited in line. The director wants actors to be open and trust their feelings.
**The Perfect Theatre**
A perfect theatre makes you feel important. Going to see a live performance should feel special. The staff should care about the audience. The audience should feel close to the actors and understand what is happening on stage. The size of the theatre is important too. It should fit the human voice and body. If the theatre is too big, it feels wrong. Many theatres built in the late 1800s were good because they made the audience feel connected to the stage. 
When you go to the theatre, you want to see something surprising and new. If it is not special, you might as well stay home."
CPE_37,C2,"**Paul Simon**
Rock and roll music in the 1950s was very popular with young people. It was important because it changed the lives of many adults too. This music helped create new rock stars who were inspired by it. Paul Simon, like many young people in the US, listened to a famous radio show called Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party by Alan Freed. This show was very important for many young musicians. 
In another part of the world, a young John Lennon in Liverpool also listened to rock and roll on Radio Luxembourg. Paul Simon loved the music from Freed's show and wanted to make his own music one day.
**Snow**
One day, I was walking in the snow. I thought I would be okay if I was careful. The wind was very strong, and I slipped on the ice. Suddenly, I fell into a hole that was about four feet deep. The snow had covered the hole, and I did not see it. I climbed out, feeling scared and worried about what would happen if the hole was much deeper. I sat against a tree to think. After an hour, I had only walked half a mile. I realized I had to change my plans.
**Qualitative Research**
Many books help researchers understand qualitative research. They talk a lot about how to collect data, but not much about how to analyze it. Analyzing data can be confusing. To help with this, we asked different social scientists who have done qualitative research to share their experiences. We wanted to explain the process of analyzing data, not just create a guide for new researchers. This is not easy, so we let our contributors share their work in different ways, including personal stories and more formal writing."
CPE_2,C2,"**Screen Learning**
A few days ago, I saw my six-year-old son eating noodles in a funny way. He was pulling them up with his teeth and pretending to be a dinosaur. He said, ""I'm a little dinosaur."" He was acting out a scene from a TV show. I asked him what he knew about dinosaurs, but he didn’t know much.
Many people think that learning on a screen is good. One writer tried an interactive program with his son. The father read the words while the son played with the pictures. The father thought that if his son had spent ten minutes reading a book, he might have learned something. Research shows that learning is better when there is a conversation with teachers or parents. Using new technology to teach children is good, but traditional education is still very important.
**Hollywood**
By 1918, most of the world’s movie-making was in Hollywood. People living there did not like this change. They thought Hollywood was becoming a place for rude people. But in the end, they accepted it because success is important. Hollywood knows which films will be popular and make money. 
In less than a hundred years, Hollywood changed from a small village to a famous town, like New York or Paris. It has changed a lot; a hundred years ago, you would walk through orange trees to get to the store. But in some ways, it is still a small village. People in Hollywood mostly talk about movies: how much money they make, who is dating whom, and who is working on which project. Many successful people want to live somewhere else but still work in Hollywood. It is the place where many people in show business want to be.
**Photography**
Photography was created by artists in the 1800s. They wanted to make a lasting record of what they saw. The new tools they used made pictures that were more real and detailed than paintings. This surprised other artists. Some art critics said photography could not be art because it depended on machines. 
But photographers believed they had found a new way to express themselves. They used their tools like other artists use brushes and pencils. They wanted to show the world and nature in their own way.
**Book Illustration**
In the past, every children’s book had pictures. This was also true for many novels for older readers. During this time, children’s publishing was mostly low-budget, which meant some work was not very good. However, the best artists always did their best work. 
The collection of black-and-white illustrations is a mix of good and not-so-good work. It is a great place to find interesting things and learn about a creative time. Many of these illustrations will be shown to the public again, either through new books or exhibitions. There are signs that this is starting to happen, and soon, a publisher will likely create a series of classic children’s book illustrations from this time."
CPE_68,C2,"**Blogging: Sharing Your Life Online**
A while ago, a website talked about the dangers of telling everyone where you are online. When you say, ""I am at this place,"" you are also showing your location to many people, not all of whom you may want to see. This shows that sharing everything online can have bad sides.
The internet gives us many chances to share our lives with a lot of people. We can share our stories, photos, and feelings. But sometimes, we can get lost in this big online world. It can be scary, but we should not give up. There are people who have gone through this before us.
In the early days of the internet, some brave people started sharing their lives online. They faced many problems, like losing jobs and friends, but they learned important lessons. One of these early bloggers was Justin Hall. In January 1994, he was a 19-year-old student who began sharing his life on the web. At that time, the internet was mostly for scientists and students. Hall wanted to share his personal stories and created a blog where he wrote about everything.
In 1996, he started posting every day. Many people read his blog because he shared everything about his life. But one day, his blog disappeared, and he posted a video called ""Dark Night."" He had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it, his partner said he had to choose between the blog and their relationship. Hall felt that sharing his life online made people not trust him. 
In 2002, another blogger named Heather Armstrong wrote a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job. One day, a coworker sent her blog link to the bosses at her company, and she lost her job because of it. This shows that what we say online can have real-life consequences. 
Armstrong was sad and stopped blogging for a while, but later she got married and started a new blog about her family. Now, she is very popular as a ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing helps her family. 
The lesson we can learn from these stories is that while the internet lets us say anything, we should think carefully before we share."
CPE_23,C2,"**Enough Sleep?**
Many people today feel tired. In rich and busy countries, not getting enough sleep and feeling anxious are common problems. In the USA, research shows that 40 million people have trouble sleeping. Some popular books in Britain have characters who cannot sleep or are about sleep research. 
A sleep expert says, ""People need more sleep."" When people are busy, they sleep less. They wake up early to avoid traffic. One researcher did an experiment. He let people sleep for up to 14 hours a night for a month. After three weeks, they started to sleep about eight hours a night. This shows they needed more sleep.
In Europe, a university in England studies sleep. They look at how tiredness affects sailors, how noise at airports disturbs sleep, and how tired drivers can be dangerous. They ask students to help with their research. Students are paid £5 an hour and change their sleep patterns as instructed. 
Dr. Louise Reyner helps the students feel better. Some are worried because they wear electrodes on their heads. They think the researchers can see their dreams. But the researchers are more interested in how the body works. 
In a dark room, there is a driving simulator. The students come in the afternoon when they usually feel sleepy. They drive while answering questions. The road looks endless, and the sun is bright. The young men say they will not fall asleep. But Dr. Reyner has a video of one student trying hard to stay awake. At first, he sits up straight, but then he starts to blink and nod off. He wakes up suddenly, but the car goes off the road. 
Dr. Reyner says that drinking coffee can help. Two cups can make someone a safe driver for a while. She suggests energy drinks and chewing gum with caffeine for people who work at night. 
Scientists know that humans sleep in a daily cycle. When we sleep, we go through four stages, from light sleep to deep sleep. We usually dream during light sleep. Our brain keeps our body still to prevent injuries while we dream. 
Scientists are sure that women sleep about half an hour longer than men, and older people need less sleep, but they do not know why. Some researchers say sleep helps us travel through time safely. 
In the past, people had different sleep patterns. A history professor studied British life from 1500 to 1850. People went to bed early, woke up after midnight, stayed awake for a while, and then slept again. This time was good for thinking and remembering dreams. Poor people enjoyed this quiet time away from their daily work. 
By the 17th century, with more artificial light, rich people changed their sleep habits to sleep more efficiently. Later, during the industrial revolution, most people worked longer hours in light. 
In some non-western cultures, people still do not have strict bedtimes. They sleep for a few hours, then wake up again. For some tribes, noises and the need to watch for danger make it hard to sleep all night. It seems that people everywhere need more sleep."
CPE_60,C2,"We are talking about very big cowboy boots. I stood in my expensive cowboy boots in the Arizona desert. I wore a full cowboy outfit, but I was not a cowboy. I looked at the mountains and realized I did not belong there. I flew in from Denver early in the morning. I thought I looked like a cowboy, but that changed when I saw a real cowboy at the airport. He was dirty and looked tired. He saw my new boots and raised an eyebrow, then left without saying anything.
I used to be a racing driver, and I loved it. But now I don’t race anymore. I wondered what I should do next. A racing driver should have other jobs ready for when they stop racing. I thought I had some ideas, but they didn’t work out. I tried to be a commentator for races, but there were many other drivers who wanted the job. I also tried to sell classic cars, but that didn’t work either because nobody was buying them.
Being an ""ex"" racing driver is hard. Nobody wants to hear about how I almost became a champion. Even if I had won, people would only listen for a short time. Last year’s champion is not important anymore. I don’t want sympathy, and I don’t get any. I had a good career and made money, but I miss racing. I miss the excitement of driving fast cars and the attention from fans and reporters. 
Now, I have a lot of free time. I looked up at the blue sky and saw some small birds in a cactus. They seemed to be telling me to leave their nest alone. I didn’t know there were songbirds in the desert. I realized that I, a fake cowboy in fancy boots, had a lot to learn."
CPE_1,C2,"**Vancouver**
In the last ten years, many people from all over the world have moved to Vancouver, in western Canada. In the evenings, residents walk around the city, and if you join them, you will hear many different languages. People come to Vancouver for its nice weather, beautiful views of the ocean and mountains, clean and safe places, and good schools and jobs. Some people complain about how fast new buildings are being built, but many agree that new people and tourism have helped the city grow. 
Vancouver was once called 'Terminal City' because it was a place where many journeys began. Now, it is still a gateway to many other places.
**Writing Letters**
Journalists, like me, are not very good at writing letters. Some say this is because we do not like to write for free, but I think it is more about wanting to make our writing perfect. In our work, we try to make our words very effective, so writing a letter can feel different. Real artists, who write without thinking too much about the effect, do not have this problem. They understand how their words work together. For example, when Shakespeare wrote his famous lines, he did not think about how the words sounded together; he just wrote.
**New Supermarket Opening**
Opening a new supermarket used to be a big event in Britain. A famous person, like a soap star or a royal family member, would come to cut the ribbon. Now, new supermarkets open all the time, so there is no need for a celebrity. Last week, people waiting to enter the new Superbuy store did not care who opened it, as long as they were first in line. A customer said that the first five men to enter would get a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women would get flowers. This news spread quickly, making those at the front feel proud and those who arrived late feel jealous."
CPE_53,C2,"**Citizen Kane**
The film *Citizen Kane* came out in 1941. Many people talked about it a lot before it was released. They were worried about what William Randolph Hearst, the man the film was about, might do to them. Even though the reviews were very good, the film did not make a lot of money at first. Later, it became popular again because of television. This film has inspired many people to become filmmakers. This is surprising because it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles said that the film was successful because he did not know what he could or could not do. He just made the film the way he wanted. He had a great team with him, including cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and special-effects expert Linwood Dunn. When Welles and Mankiewicz decided to tell the story of a newspaper owner who was like Hearst but not exactly him, Welles knew he had a great chance to show his skills as a director and actor. He took this chance with a lot of energy.
**Dermot and Carmel**
That morning, Dermot thought Carmel was acting a bit strange. He had told her twice that he might be late and that he might stop at the golf club on his way home. He wanted to talk to someone, and the golf club was a good place for that. Carmel nodded her head but seemed like she did not really hear him. Dermot asked her, ""Will you be okay? What are you going to do today?"" She smiled and said, ""It's funny you ask. I was just thinking that I have nothing to do today, so I will walk downtown and look at the shops. I feel like it is almost wrong to waste the day."" Dermot smiled back and said, ""You deserve to enjoy yourself. And if I am late, I won’t need any food, so don’t worry about it."" Carmel replied, ""No, that’s fine.""
**Title Race**
Do you mind if I call myself a ""mobile lukewarm beverage resource facilitator""? A recent study shows that job titles can cause problems at work. A survey by a big recruitment company found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees think job titles create problems between coworkers. Most surprisingly, 70% of office workers said they would give up a pay raise for a better job title. This shows that people care a lot about how they are called at work. In the early 21st century, no one wants to be called ""subordinate."" The job titles people want sound nice (like ""specialist"" or ""coordinator""), but they often mean the same thing as ""lower level."""
CPE_55,C2,"**The Vienna Assignment**
I was in Vienna to take photographs. This was usually why I traveled. Taking photos was not just my job; it was my passion. I loved how light fell on different surfaces. A single photo could show the beauty of a place, a city, or a person. I always hoped to take the perfect picture. As long as I had film in my camera, I could keep trying. I had a simple rule: finish one roll of film, load another, and keep looking for great shots.
Once, I took a photo of smoke from a burning oil well. It became very popular, and many newspapers wanted it. It was a lucky moment. They say you create your own luck, both good and bad. After that, I decided to work freelance. I thought it was a smart choice, but life had other plans. The mid-nineties were not as successful as I had hoped. That is why I was in Vienna instead of a more exciting place. But I was still taking photos, and I was getting paid. That felt good to me.
My assignment in Vienna happened by chance. I had taken photos in London for a picture book called ""Four Cities in Four Seasons."" I took pictures of London in spring, summer, autumn, and winter. I enjoyed capturing the beauty of flowers in Hyde Park and the busy streets of Piccadilly. But I knew that many of my best photos would not be used because it was just a picture book.
After I finished my London photos, I learned that the Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, had left his job in Vienna. Instead of hiring someone new, they asked me to take his place. The publishers liked my work, and I was available. I was happy to go because things were not good at home. A week in snowy Vienna sounded great.
They put me in a hotel called the Europa, in the center of the old city. I had visited Vienna before with my wife, but it was a busy trip, and I didn’t take many photos. This time, I was alone in January, and I knew it would be different. When I arrived, I saw the beautiful pink-grey dome over the snowy roofs of the city. I was excited to take great pictures.
On my first day, I didn’t take any photos. I rode the trams around the Ringstrasse, getting on and off to enjoy the city. The weather was cold, like the old buildings around me. I didn’t want to see what Rudi had done in spring, summer, or autumn. This was going to be my Vienna, and I wanted to discover it myself.
A photograph captures a moment, but you have to wait for the right moment. So, I took my time and looked carefully. The next morning, I woke up early. It had snowed overnight, and Stephansplatz was covered in fresh white snow and almost empty. I wanted to take a picture of the big cathedral, but it was hard to fit it all in one shot. Its tall spire reached into the sky, but at the bottom, it was very large. I knew I would have to find a different way to capture it.
In that beautiful weather, I felt the magic of photography. Even in the past, when people didn’t understand how it worked, they felt the same magic. You can watch a blank piece of paper turn into a photo in a dark room. Even when you know how it happens, it still feels mysterious. Maybe that is why what happened at Stephansplatz that morning did not surprise me."
CPE_50,C2,"**Kinetic Art**
Great news! The Hayward Gallery in London has changed into a wonderful place. This change is not because of a big, expensive show, but because of a special exhibition about kinetic art. Kinetic art is art that moves or is about movement. This exhibition shows the history of kinetic art over the last 60 years. It shows that making art that moves or talks about movement has been an important part of art in the twentieth century. 
The exhibition has many paintings, drawings, documents, and films about kinetic art. The curator, Guy Brett, has studied this art for a long time. Visitors can enjoy the art without too many explanations. They can discover and connect ideas by themselves.
**David Hockney**
David Hockney is a popular artist. Many people like his work, even if they do not usually like art. People might like his art because it shows real things and is easy to understand. His art often shows fun and relaxing moments, which helps people escape from their daily lives. Some people might even like Hockney because of his fun personality and clever words in interviews.
However, some critics think Hockney is not a great artist. They say he is overrated. But others believe he is popular because people today do not always accept artists who are very popular. Hockney knows his art has limits, and he does not think it is important to compare his work to ideas of greatness. He does not say he is a great artist and believes that only time will tell how important his art is.
**Window-shopping - an Art Exhibition**
In recent years, I have seen many art exhibitions. Some are amazing, and some are not so good. I often feel frustrated when exhibitions seem to push a certain idea or message. Sometimes this works, and we see new trends in art. But often, it feels forced or not genuine.
As a curator, I wanted to create a show that was different. I worked with seven artists in an empty warehouse. The exhibition was called ""Window-shopping."" It was a collection of individual artworks that were connected only by the fact that they were all art. 
For example, Sam Cole made knitted cats that chased each other on a toy train track. In another piece, Matthew Crawley used a video camera and broke it while exploring inside. These artworks did not fit into a specific theme, but they worked well together. They did not get in each other's way and, I hope, they helped each other shine.
**Art History**
Some people love paintings but are afraid to think too much about them. They worry that thinking will ruin their enjoyment. Some art historians focus on theory and forget the joy of looking at art and the creativity of making it. 
This is like knowing how to cook a dish. Knowing the recipe and the cooking method does not take away from the taste of the food. In fact, knowing more about the art we enjoy can make it even more enjoyable. 
Enjoying art is not simple. What we like about art can change over time and is influenced by the society we live in. While it is important to feel and enjoy art, thinking about it is also valuable. The idea that thinking about art takes away from enjoyment is an old belief. Today, we can appreciate both the feelings and the thoughts about art."
CPE_25,C2,"**Metals**  
A long time ago, people in the Stone Age became interested in metals. One day, while sitting by a river and waiting for fish, an early human found a shiny yellow stone. This stone was not like other stones; it was beautiful. This is how gold may have come into the lives of these early people. Gold is soft and easy to shape, so it became very popular. Copper was also found, maybe by accident. When people saw how useful copper tools were, they started to look for copper and ways to get it from the ground. This is how metalworking began.
**St Ives**  
We walked down a narrow, cobbled street to the town of St Ives, carrying our bags. The wind was very strong, and we tried to avoid the cold waves that hit the walkway. The streets were empty, and all the windows in the houses by the water were closed. We had seen the weather get worse as we arrived in St Ives on a small train. The dark clouds made me think that visiting Cornwall without a car was not a good idea. I had invited my friend to come with me, promising nice walks along the beautiful coast and warm evenings by the fire.
**Computer Modelling**  
Studying the past is hard because it is gone. The people who lived in times of peace and times of trouble are no longer here. We cannot know exactly why they moved or how they lived. Archaeology gives us some clues, but we cannot test our ideas on people from the past. We cannot go back in time and see what happened. However, with computer modelling, we can create pictures of old landscapes and make virtual communities. These digital people can have some of the needs and abilities of real humans. We can set rules for them and see how they live. We can change things, like making it rain less or having more people, and watch how these virtual people react."
CPE_34,C2,"**Vervet Monkeys**  
Cheney and Seyfarth studied vervet monkeys. One day, the main male monkey saw a strange male monkey nearby. The strange monkey wanted to join their group. If he did, the main male might lose his place. To keep the stranger away, the main male made an alarm call that means a leopard is near. The strange monkey ran back to the trees. This happened many times. But then, the main male made a mistake. He called out the alarm while walking across the open ground.  
**What Cats Catch**  
In a small village in England called Felmersham, people counted what their cats caught. In one year, seventy cats caught over 1,000 animals. A professor in America thought that all the cats in Britain might kill 100 million birds and small animals each year! But this number is not realistic. Most cats live in towns and catch fewer animals than the cats in the village. The important question is: can the bird population survive? The answer seems to be yes. In winter, many people feed birds, and there are many places for birds to nest. So, the cat population is not destroying the birds in Britain.  
**Buffalo's Day**  
Buffaloes are very important to the marshmen. Every morning, the buffaloes leave their sleeping place slowly. They make sad sounds as they walk to the water. They stand at the edge for a long time, tired, until the leader goes into the water. Once in the water, they seem to forget what they were doing and relax. They move slowly away from the house and swim, looking tired. They spend the day in the reeds, eating green plants.  
**Picasso, Pablo**  
In 1940, Picasso painted fish while he was in a fishing town called Royan. The painting shows a fishmonger’s table with a crab and some soles. The fish look alive, but the painting is hard to understand. Picasso used flat patterns and soft colors to make it look calm, like underwater. But there is also a feeling of danger, as the fish seem to be ready to fight the crab. The painting shows both peace and a hint of violence."
CPE_12,C2,"**Photography**
For the last 150 years, photography has been used to show many parts of human life. It helps us see moments in time and space, from small details to big places. Photography gives us pictures from faraway places, different parts of space, and important events in our lives. It is a very important way to express what it means to be human.
However, people have been making pictures for much longer. The first pictures were made about 35,000 years ago in caves. We are not sure why these early paintings were made. They might have shown hunting events, been used for magic to help with hunting, been religious symbols, or just made homes look nicer. But pictures have always been a part of human culture.
Throughout history, people have asked if pictures are always true. The saying ""seeing is believing"" has made people trust images. When photography was invented in the mid-1800s, it seemed to promise a true record of what we see. The camera works like our eyes and can capture images. This was seen as a big achievement because it was thought to show reality.
Some people believed that everyone could understand photographs, no matter their culture. For example, in 1933, photographer August Sander said that even a very isolated person could understand a picture of the sky. But as communication grew in the late 20th century, we need to think about how much photographs can be understood across different cultures. Is photography as influenced by culture as language is?
Today, photography is seen as a strong way to show evidence. People often show photos to say something about their lives, like ""this is my grandson."" Since photography was invented in 1839, it has changed a lot. It started as a way to keep records, but now photographs are often seen as historical documents. They can tell us about the people and society that made them.
I want to show that the camera is not just a tool that records events. Photography can also inspire social and political change. For example, the changes in art during the Italian Renaissance were connected to new ways of seeing. Similarly, photography has played a big role in our media culture today, showing us the hard truths of the world."
CPE_26,C2,"**How to Write Poetry**
Writing poetry is not easy. It can be fun, but it can also be hard. If you want to write poetry, the best way to learn is to read a lot and write a lot. You should also let your imagination be free. Some people need to feel safe before they can write a poem. Others write when they are sad. Some people write poems on a schedule, while others wait for a good idea to come to them. All of these ways are okay as long as you find your own style. 
**The Short Story**
In a short story, you should not have too many characters or long descriptions. Flashbacks should be short and only used when they help the story. A memory can help the main character and move the story forward, but it should not slow down the action. Dialogue, or conversation between characters, is very important. It can show different sides of a story quickly. Too many words can make a short story boring, but it should still have enough detail to be interesting. In a short story, every word matters.
**Screenplays**
Writing a screenplay for a film is like playing chess. When you play chess, you make moves without knowing what will happen next. You learn to see the whole game, not just one move at a time. The more you play chess, the better you understand it. The same is true for writing screenplays. 
**Looking at Writing**
People naturally learn to speak, but writing is different. A long time ago, Charles Darwin said that speaking is a human instinct, but writing is not. All children learn to speak without lessons. If children do not have a language, they can create their own. But writing systems are not easy to invent. Most children in the past did not learn to read or write. Even today, some children find it hard to learn. Writing is something that takes time and practice to learn. We need to understand how writing works and how children learn to help them become better writers."
CPE_8,C2,"I have never started a book with so much doubt. I call it a novel, but I am not sure if that is the right word. I do not have a big story to tell, and I do not end with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave the reader wondering. This book is about my memories of a man I met only a few times, and I do not know much about his life in between our meetings. I could make up stories to fill in the gaps, but I do not want to do that. I just want to write what I know.
To protect the people in this story, I have given them made-up names, and I have changed some details so no one can recognize them. The man I am writing about is not famous. He may never be famous. When he dies, he might not leave any mark on the world, like a stone thrown into a river. If people read my book, it will be for its own interest. But maybe the way he lives and his special character will influence others, and after he is gone, people will realize he was a remarkable person. Then it will be clear who I am writing about, and those who want to know about his early life may find something useful in my book.
I think my book will help those who want to write about my friend. I do not say that the conversations I wrote down are exact. I did not take notes, but I remember well what was important to me. I have put these conversations in my own words, but I believe they show what was really said. I mentioned before that I have not invented anything, but I have taken the freedom that historians take to write words for the characters that I did not hear. I did this to make the scenes more lively and interesting. I want people to read my book, and I think it is okay to do what I can to make it enjoyable. 
Smart readers will see where I have done this, and they can choose to ignore it if they want. Another reason I feel nervous about this book is that the people I write about come from a different culture. It is hard to really know people, and I think you can only truly know your own countrymen. People are shaped by where they were born, the homes they grew up in, the games they played, the food they ate, the schools they went to, the sports they liked, and the poems they read. All these things make them who they are, and you can only understand them if you have lived through those experiences. 
Because you cannot know people from another country except by watching them, it is hard to make them believable in a book. I have only written about my own countrymen before, and if I have tried to write about others in short stories, it is easier because you can give broad ideas and let the reader fill in the details. In this book, I do not say that my characters see themselves the same way I see them; they are seen through my eyes."
CPE_4,C2,"**POETRY RECITALS**
Poetry recitals are events where poets read their poems to an audience. In history, people often find it hard to understand the different types of poetry and poets. Today, there are many styles of poetry and different ways to present it. Some poets write poems to be read on paper, while others like to perform their poems in front of people.
There is a debate between these two groups. The first group, the ""literary"" poets, write poems for reading. The second group, the ""popular"" poets, enjoy performing their poems. Many events for poetry readings have become popular in the last twenty years. Small groups in towns hold readings in community centers or homes. Schools invite poets to read to students, and arts festivals often have well-known poets read their work.
For ""pop"" poets, performing is good for them. Their poems are usually simple and easy to understand. People can enjoy them right away. However, serious poets, who work hard to create deep and thoughtful poems, may not be understood by new audiences. These poets might choose to read their easiest poems instead of their best work.
Listening to poetry readings is not the same as reading poems on paper, but it can be fun and helpful. Hearing poets read their work can show the audience how to understand the poems better. It is good for the audience to have the text in front of them or to know the poems before the reading.
One reason for popular poetry recitals is to help people enjoy poetry. When poetry is mixed with music, like jazz, it can make people feel that poetry is for everyone, not just a few special people."
CPE_30,C2,"**Oral History**  
Historians often use oral history, which means they listen to people's stories about the past. However, this can be tricky. When someone talks about their past, their memories can be influenced by the person asking questions. The historian chooses who to talk to and what to ask about. Even if the historian just listens, their presence can change how the person remembers things. The historian's background and ideas can also affect the stories they hear. This means historians help create new evidence. But the person telling the story is also not always completely connected to the past. Their memories can be mixed with things they learned from other places, like TV or books. Sometimes, they remember the past with feelings of happiness or sadness that come from later experiences. These feelings can make their stories seem more real, but they might not always reflect what really happened.
**Animal Science**  
There are two main ways to study animal science: the physiological approach and the whole animal approach. Physiologists look at how the body works, like how nerves and muscles help animals behave. The whole animal approach studies how animals act in their natural environment. Within this approach, there are psychologists and ethologists. Psychologists usually work in labs and study a few types of animals, like rats and pigeons. Ethologists study animals in the wild and how they behave naturally. Although these two groups are different, they are starting to work together more. Physiologists believe their methods are very important, but understanding behavior also needs to be studied at a different level. For example, explaining how a bird builds a nest by only looking at nerve cells is not enough. We need to look at the behavior itself.
**The Social Sciences**  
When students start studying social sciences, they have to learn two things at once. They need to understand the subject and also learn how to study it. This means they must know the facts and research in their textbooks, as well as the methods used to gather this information. These two parts are connected. We all know about social life from our daily experiences, so it might seem like social sciences are just common sense. But each social science looks at different parts of society and uses special methods and ideas. These ideas help social scientists understand more than just everyday thinking and make each field unique.
**Classical Architecture**  
In Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building structures. The Roman architect Vitruvius said that architecture includes order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, and distribution. He also used Greek words for some of these ideas. While he talked about how buildings should look, he did not focus on their function. However, he did explain how to design buildings for different uses. The roots of classical architecture are complicated. Before classical times, there were simple homes made of basic materials in Greece and Italy. These early structures did not meet Vitruvius' artistic standards, but they still influenced later designs. Even though classical temples may look complex, they are essentially simple, like a one-room hut."
CPE_7,C2,"The two sisters, Lily and Mui, kept a secret from Chen for a while. Lily was learning to drive. She drove around the gardens and the railway, even going over a small bridge with all four wheels in the air. After that, they passed the gasworks, which smelled bad. Chen found it funny that Lily was driving without telling him. He said, ""So you can really drive, Lily? Good job!"" Mui thought it was strange that Chen was not upset. He was excited and made plans with Lily to go for a drive on a Monday next month. They chose this day because it was usually quiet, and they wanted to leave early and come back by noon to not lose any customers. Lily would practice driving around the gardens before then. 
Mui bought a road map, which made Chen happy because she got a discount. But Lily felt a bit hurt because she thought Mui did not trust her to find the way. Soon, they were at the English Channel. Lily drove very well. Even Mui, who was in the back seat, had to agree. Lily passed some slow cars with confidence, and Chen even clapped for her. 
After driving through the gasworks and past some boats, they parked in a quiet street near the sea. Lily was not sure about the parking signs, so she decided to pay to avoid problems. She noticed Mui looking worried in the mirror but thought it was better not to add to her worries. Lily locked the van doors carefully. Chen joked, ""Don’t worry, no one will want that old van."" The sisters were not happy with his joke. Lily told him he should be more grateful, and Mui said he was too quick to judge things by how they looked. 
Chen took their son, Man Kee, to see the sea. He held Man Kee close and thought about how he wanted to raise him. Chen wanted Man Kee to learn about numbers and one day own many restaurants. As he looked at the sea, he felt a bit sad but also hopeful about Man Kee's future. 
Chen saw a ship far away and wanted to look at it through a telescope. At first, he could not find it, but then he did. It was a small, old ship. He lifted Man Kee to see it and said, ""Do you see the ship, Son? It is special for us. It will take us back home when we are done here."" Chen kissed Man Kee's head. Lily came over and put her arm around Chen. 
Chen wanted Man Kee to see the ship, but when he let go of the telescope, it stopped working. By the time Chen found another coin, the ship was gone, and all Lily could see were seagulls flying around."
CPE_43,C2,"**THE WELL**
I read somewhere that if you dig a deep hole, you can see the stars when it is clear. I asked you to help me with my idea. You watched with big eyes as I pulled up the well bucket, put it on the wall, and then climbed in. I told you to let me down. I didn’t think about how heavy the bucket was or that you might not be strong enough to hold it. You held the handle while I pushed the bucket away from the wall. Suddenly, I fell into the well. I hit my head. At that moment, I saw strange lights. Later, I remembered that in cartoons, characters see stars when they hit their heads.
At first, I felt confused, then scared, and finally angry at you for letting me fall. I was also worried about what my mother would say. You called down to me, asking if I was okay. I wanted to shout back, but then I heard panic in your voice, and I stopped. I lay still and peeked at you through my eyelashes. You ran away to get help. I waited a moment, then climbed back up and pulled myself over the edge. I landed on the courtyard stones. I heard loud voices from the castle. I ran away to hide in the shadows.
My mother and father came with you and old Arthur. My mother was screaming. My father told Arthur to pull on the winch handle. You looked pale and shocked. I was hiding in the shadows, feeling excited. Then I saw the drops of water I had left from the well to where I was standing. I looked in horror at the dark spots on the dry stones. I saw a little pool of water at my feet. I looked back at the courtyard, where my father was shining a flashlight into the well. I couldn’t believe no one had seen the drops.
My mother was screaming loudly now, a sound I had never heard before. It scared me. What should I do? I had played a trick on you, but now it was serious. I realized this was worse than I thought. I felt bad for not thinking about it more. My fun plan had turned into a big problem very quickly. I needed a new idea. I took a deep breath and left my hiding place, coming out slowly. I called out softly, then louder when no one heard me. I stumbled a bit and then fell on the stones.
I sat up, feeling comforted in my mother’s arms. I said, “Phew” and “Oh dear,” and smiled bravely. I told them I had found a secret tunnel from the bottom of the well to the moat. I said I crawled and swam through it until I got out. I thought I was almost getting away with it until my father came to me. He asked me to repeat my story. I did, but I hesitated. His eyes looked serious. I said the secret passage had fallen in after me and that the well was dangerous. I had barely escaped with my life.
When I looked into my father’s eyes, it felt like looking into a dark tunnel. It seemed like he was seeing me for the first time. My words got stuck in my throat. “Don’t be ridiculous, boy,” he said, sounding very disappointed. He stood up and walked away. Arthur looked at me with a sad face. He seemed worried, not because I had a scary adventure, but because he could see I was lying. His pity felt like a strong lesson about my actions. It made me feel even worse."
CPE_51,C2,"**REMOVAL DAY**
Susan is a widow with grown children. She is leaving her family home. A van with the words ""Removers of Distinction"" is taking her things away. Fred, the removal man, is carefully packing her belongings. The house is beautiful, with four floors and a view of a small harbor. Susan remembers the years she spent there with her children. 
When they bought the house, her son Robert, who was five years old, asked, ""Mum, how do you get a house home?"" Now, Robert is an adult and is helping her move. He is making sure they take care of the piano. Francesca, her daughter, is also helping. She is very bossy and wants to make sure the piano is safe. 
Fred notices that Susan is not crying. He tells her that some people cry when they move. They are happy while packing, but when they see the empty house, they start to cry. Susan understands this feeling. 
She thinks about the piano. Robert said it was the movers' job to be careful. The piano is in the best room of the house. They will move it last. Sitting on the stairs, Susan remembers the day they brought the piano into the house. It got stuck on the stairs for almost two hours. Robert watched with excitement, while Francesca cried, ""We can't live without a piano!"" 
Peter, Susan's late husband, helped solve the problem. They left the piano outside while they moved in the other furniture. The next day, a builder took out a window. They used a crane to lift the piano through the window. The children were so happy to see it come in. 
Now, Susan thinks about how her children are busy and do not come home often. She is also having trouble going up the stairs. She worries about the piano and if the movers will notice something wrong with it. 
Fred asks if she is okay. He tells her they will move the piano soon. Robert and Francesca come to watch. Fred talks to Susan, and she feels like crying. Moving things makes her feel sad. 
Just then, the piano comes down the stairs. Fred is guiding it carefully. They take it outside and put it down by the van. Robert laughs first, and soon they are all laughing together. As they walk down the path for the last time, Susan realizes she is not crying; she is laughing."
CPE_11,C2,"**Online Book Reviews for Everyone**
Anyone can write book reviews online. At first, the Internet was open for everyone to share their ideas. People could publish their thoughts or create music channels. But in the beginning, you needed some technical skills to do this. 
One area that became open to everyone was book reviews. Amazon.com was the first popular online bookstore. On Amazon, anyone could write a review about a book and give it up to five stars. This was a great idea because it allowed readers to see what others thought about a book, not just what the publisher said or what professional critics wrote.
Amazon had many customers and received a lot of reviews. However, it was hard to check all the reviews because thousands were submitted every day. Amazon had a team of editors to make sure reviews followed their rules. For example, one-word reviews or personal attacks on authors were not allowed. But since reviewers could stay anonymous, some people wrote fake reviews. 
For instance, a writer named Lev Grossman was upset by bad reviews of his first book. He wrote some good reviews under a fake name to make his book look better. This worked until he wrote an article about it, and then Amazon removed his fake reviews.
Authors could also comment on their own books. They could write messages to encourage readers to buy and enjoy their books. Some even shared their email addresses for readers to contact them. However, Amazon did not always check if the comments really came from the authors.
Sometimes, readers wrote angry reviews. For example, when James McElroy's book about cheerleaders was published, some people mentioned in the book felt hurt and wrote many bad reviews. These reviews disappeared after a few days, but Amazon still liked that many people were writing reviews.
Most reviews on Amazon were serious. They helped other readers decide if a book was worth buying. The writer George Orwell once said that writing too many reviews was hard because you had to pretend to feel something about books you didn’t care about. This is why having everyone write reviews is a good thing."
CPE_14,C2,"**Art in Modern Times**
In the last two hundred years, people often think that artists must go against the art of their time. We like to say that art is special, new, and sometimes shocking. We feel proud to like artists whose work was not appreciated in the past. But when we see art today, we sometimes think it is too strange and not real art. The media often say this for us, and we agree because we expect art to be very different. We forget that today’s art still has old ideas and methods.
In the past, people asked artists to create art for specific reasons, and art was part of everyday life. Now, artists work alone, and we can get upset if they try to connect with us.
**Picture This**
I want to describe a situation and ask an important question. An artist picks a text from an art book. The text talks about different kinds of pictures and says there are many types of pictures. This sounds simple, but it is important. The artist then asks someone to make a canvas for him and to write the text on it in plain letters. My question is: is this finished piece a painting?
**Underground Encounters**
At the Mercury Gallery in London, there is a rule that artists should stick to one style if it sells well. Collectors want artists to keep making the same type of art. If an artist tries something new, people may not like it. Some artists, like Picasso and Hockney, can change styles and still be successful. Eric Rimmington is another artist who is trying something new. He is moving from still life paintings to paintings about the London Underground. He finds the underground interesting and has created 40 paintings and drawings that show this hidden world.
**Extract from a Novel**
I have come to this island with some books. I say ""escape"" because the villagers joke that only a sick person would come to such a quiet place. I am here to heal myself. I am alone except for an old woman who comes from the village to clean my house. I feel neither happy nor sad; I am in a mix of memories. I talked about how art seems useless, but it can also bring comfort. Art helps us see the important parts of life. For artists, creating art helps us deal with the pain of everyday life. It allows us to fulfill our true potential through imagination. Otherwise, why would we hurt each other?"
CPE_63,C2,"**Family Business**
""Look here, it's no good!"" said my Dad. We were in the car going back to London. My father, with my brother Maurice, had just picked me up from the fancy girls' school I went to. He had also just been to Parent's Day, where I got a prize for Latin and another prize for doing well in my exams. He talked a lot with my headteacher, and now we were going home for the holidays.
""What isn't?"" I asked, but I already knew what he was thinking because he was quiet. My dad usually talks a lot. ""You can't fool me. You'll do what you want now,"" he said. ""With all those certificates, I heard you will get a scholarship to Oxford.""
""So?"" I replied, trying to act brave. ""Mightn't that be useful?""
""I also heard,"" he continued, and I knew he was going to confront me, ""that you want to be a barrister. A barrister!"" My father knew a lot about lawyers and the law. ""I just said that,"" I explained. ""I couldn't think of anything else to say!""
""And apparently,"" he went on, ""you have the right personality. You can understand a lot of information quickly, you are good at talking, and you like performing.""
""I don't know about that,"" I said. ""I only know what I see on TV.""
""Anyway,"" he said, trying to stay calm, ""I feel like you won't want to join the family business. You will go to Oxford University, and after that, I can't see you wanting to do this.""
The problem was that, like many children in family businesses, I felt trapped by what my family expected. I saw many jobs I could do, and I wanted to explore them. But I didn't want to upset my dad. I wasn't as scared of him as Maurice was - I was his favorite - but I still found him intimidating.
""It's too soon to know,"" I said weakly.
""I tell you, you won't want to join us,"" my father said, and he often turned out to be right. ""It's a pity because you have the skills - the brains, the courage, the vision.""
""There's still Maurice,"" I said, feeling down. My father laughed. We both knew Maurice didn't like the business.
""Anyway,"" I continued, ""you could always use me as a consultant."" My mother had died when I was young, and my father raised me and Maurice. Maurice was two years younger than me, and I took care of him because he didn't have a mother. I loved Maurice, and because the business was successful, we lived well - in a big house in London, went to nice schools, wore good clothes, and went to parties and shows. My father knew many interesting people.
""I tell you what,"" my father said. ""You can help us during the holidays until you leave Oxford. Then if you want to leave, you can. It will give you some money and help me.""
""OK,"" I said, happy to avoid making big decisions right now, especially because my father would be upset if I disagreed with him. This was how he controlled us.
So, I helped out during my last term at school and during university breaks, but only a few times a year and with easier tasks. I became a smart student, had a small house, a nice car, and designer clothes, including a black dress for my final exams.
In my last term, my father came to see me and took me to a village for a meal. There were only a few weeks left until my exams. My teacher said I would get a First Class degree in Law, and I wanted to focus on studying.
My father told me that he needed me to do one last important job for the family business. He said it was the most important work they had ever done and that it would be worth my time.
""But Dad,"" I said, ""I have my final exams soon, and I need to focus on that. It's really important, and I don't want to think about anything else right now.""
I could see that my father didn't understand how important my exams were. He would think that if I said no, I was betraying him. As he explained the job, I saw how focused and determined he was. He was very good at his work, and I admired that in him. It made my own plans seem less important.
""All right,"" I said. ""I'll do it."""
CPE_56,C2,"Simon Costello realized that buying the house in Pembroke Square was a mistake within a year of moving in with Lois. They could only afford the house by being very careful with their money, and maybe they should not have bought it at all. At first, it seemed like a good idea. Simon had been doing well at work, and Lois had returned to her job after having twins. She even got a raise, making thirty-five thousand a year. Lois wanted to move because their flat was too small for a family. They needed more space, a garden, and a place for an au pair. They could have found these things in a cheaper area of London, but Lois wanted to live in a nice place. 
Lois thought one of them should take public transport to save money, and Simon ended up being the one who had to do it. The crowded tube ride made him feel unhappy and jealous. He remembered his grandfather's house where he felt safe and cared for as a child. His grandmother always took care of the family and was proud of her husband, who was a lawyer. But that time was gone. Lois had made it clear that her job was just as important as Simon's. They needed both of their salaries to pay for the house and their lifestyle.
One day, a woman named Venetia came to their office in a bad mood. She was very angry about something. Simon wished he had left his room earlier to avoid her. He remembered her accusations. She said that a man named Brian Cartwright claimed Simon knew he had bribed jurors in a trial four years ago and did nothing about it. Simon denied it, but he felt guilty. He remembered feeling scared when he was a child and had done something wrong. 
When he looked into Venetia's eyes, he saw that she did not believe him. He wished he had said something different to defend himself. He felt that Venetia was being unfair and wondered why she was so angry. He was worried that if people heard these rumors, it could ruin his career."
CPE_36,C2,"I chose this place to live because I thought I could be alone. I wanted to be around people who did not care about broken houses or messy gardens. But I was wrong. People in the shops soon start to recognize you. The beautiful roses from next door remind me that gardens can be nice. Usually, I stay inside to forget about summer, but tonight I am watching the birds flying between the trees and roofs. I have cut some plants to make space for a chair, and my arms are a bit scratched. 
It is a small garden in London, where plants have to grow tall to survive. My upstairs neighbor, Jaz, leans out of her window. She is a writer, and I sometimes help her with her work because I am an English teacher. I have her latest story with me. ""How is your writing going, Jaz?"" I ask. She complains about how people always ask her about her work. 
Jaz offers to bring me a drink, but I don’t want her in the garden. It looks messy now. She comes down and sits in the chair while I put a cushion on the ground. She talks about how writers don’t have holidays like teachers do. I feel worried about the long summer ahead. 
""Actually, I’m going to Stonebridge tomorrow. Can you feed my cats?"" I ask Jaz. My heart races as I say this. ""Of course,"" she replies, knowing she will be around. ""Where will you stay?"" she asks. ""I’ll stay with my friend Ruby at the Rising Sun,"" I say, even though it is not true. 
Jaz asks about her story, The Cruelty of Red Vans, which I have not read much. I tell her I like the title. I think red vans can be cruel because they bring gifts to other people. I decide to give her some advice. ""Try writing about nice people,"" I say. She gets upset and tells me to get a life. 
I have my work and sometimes I go out and read on the tube. When we go back inside, my kitchen feels calm. But then I remember my old geography teacher, Miss Tarrantine, who used to wink at us and say, ""I've had my moments."" We all laughed."
CPE_6,C2,"**Heritage**
Heritage means the connection people have with their past. We often feel close to our personal heritage because we know about our grandparents and their lives. But we also want to learn about our wider history to understand our future. Heritage helps us feel secure about where we come from, which is important for our identity. Just like we inherit our genes, we also inherit our culture from past generations. Some parts of our national heritage may not be good, but it is still a part of us, and it feels good to belong to something bigger. Heritage teaches us many things and is important for our well-being. It affects our customs and culture. In the past, we learned about our history through stories from our ancestors. However, many of these stories have been lost because of changes in society. Now, we can learn about our past through places and buildings. It is very important to keep these connections to honor our ancestors.
**The Fens**
I once started writing a novel called *Waterland*. I did not know then that the Fens, a flat area in England, would be important in my story. People often ask me why I chose to write about the Fens since I am from London and do not know this area well. I chose the Fens because they seemed simple and quiet, a good place for my story. But I learned that the Fens are not just flat and empty. They are very interesting and a bit strange. It is surprising that in the middle of England, there is a place that many people find unusual, especially when other areas have become part of England's culture. The Fens are both empty and full, both farmed and wild, and they seem open but are also mysterious. I have not visited some places in the Fens, but as a writer, I like to imagine things rather than just look for facts. The Fens are not just a place; they are also a way of thinking.
**Museums**
Museums should make their collections easy for everyone to see and understand. In the past, they just put items in display cases with long labels that were hard to read. Now, museums should be more creative and interesting to attract visitors. They should also reach out to the community. For example, some museums lend boxes of objects to teachers and even help elderly people who are losing their memory. Museums show real items from history, not copies. This is their strength and what makes them different from other places like theme parks or books. Museums that create exciting displays and programs will find that they can work with technology to make people want to see real history.
**Architecture and Environment**
The desire to keep things safe is not new, but changes in our towns happen very quickly now. This can make some people want to protect old buildings and encourage others to think about what towns are like today and in the future. People who have lived through big events, like wars, may want to preserve things more than others. Anything that shows stability is important to them. If we need to preserve things, planners should consider this. Change is not bad if we learn how to manage it. Changes in our towns reflect changes in society, like our population and needs."
CPE_33,C2,"**Einstein**
If you ask people on the street to name a scientist, many will say Albert Einstein. His picture is used to sell many things, like computers and books. Most people do not know much about what Einstein did, except that he created some complicated ideas called 'relativity'. These ideas are famous for being hard to understand and for making strange predictions that do not match our everyday experiences.
Einstein was part of a big change in science. Scientists wanted to understand the universe better by studying how matter and natural forces work together. Einstein made important contributions by looking closely at basic ideas: time, space, matter, and energy. Before him, people followed Isaac Newton's ideas, which said that stars and planets moved in a fixed space and time. Einstein changed this idea, saying that time and space are not fixed but can change.
**Young Readers**
When we were children, my sister Lydia and I did not like prize-winning books because we thought they were boring. Our mother did not like this and often showed her disapproval. But our father would give us small coins for every chapter we read to encourage us to read better books. He also gave us some special books as gifts, marking them with ""This Book is NOT Literature"" to make them sound less boring. Even though we thought most of his books were for boys, he helped us read some good stories and even a famous book of poems.
**Language**
Jacob Grimm wrote in 1851 that the beginning of human language is a wonderful secret. This secret has led to many strange ideas. For example, Charles Caller said in 1928 that early humans made sounds like ""meuh"" when they were scared. This sound is sad. Early humans who faced dangerous animals made desperate noises, and some words we use today, like ""malaria"" (meaning ""fever"") and the Latin word ""mors"" (meaning ""death""), come from these sounds.
Many people thought these ideas were silly, but now, studying how language started and changed is very important. Language likely began in East Africa about 100,000 years ago. At first, people used speech to be friendly and to help in power struggles. Sharing information was probably not the main reason for language, which is different from what philosopher John Locke said, who thought language was mainly for sharing knowledge."
CPE_20,C2,"**Writing Reviews**
Frank Kermode talks about how to write reviews. Most reviews are written quickly and do not last long. They have deadlines and strict rules about how long they can be. When they are published, they are only in the newspaper for a short time, like a day or a week, maybe a month. Because of this, many people think that writing reviews is not very important. Some believe that people only write reviews because they need money. Others think it is because they cannot spend all their time writing a book.
However, writing reviews is a skilled job. It is different to write a short review of 600 to 800 words for a newspaper than to write a longer review of 6,000 to 8,000 words for a magazine. A reviewer must think about who will read their work. Some readers just want a quick summary, while others want a detailed review.
A good reviewer needs to know a lot about different topics and must write in a way that is easy for smart people to understand. Most reviewers also write other things, not just reviews. For example, the American writer John Updike does some reviewing while he writes his novels. He collects all his reviews into books, even if they are short.
Some people think that less famous writers should accept that their reviews will not last long. But if they believe their best writing is in reviews, they should be able to keep them. I feel this way about my own work. I mostly write academic books, which are serious and for professors. In English-speaking countries, it is common for the same people to write both reviews and academic work. 
In the past, some academics did not like professors who wrote reviews. They thought it was a waste of time. But now, there are many reviews, and almost anyone can write one. This is good for readers because they can trust that the reviewer knows what they are talking about. It is also good for professors because it helps them remember to write clearly for everyone, not just for other professors.
In conclusion, writing reviews is important, but it is usually a secondary job. You can only write good reviews if you are also doing something else well."
CPE_40,C2,"Ralph opened the door to his flat. When he walked into the dark hallway, he felt a quick moment of pride. Even after three years, he sometimes felt this way when he came home alone at the end of the day. When he first bought the flat, he was always excited to come back. He wondered what the flat had been doing while he was away. It felt like a warm welcome to him, a place where he could relax.
He thought he should worry about things like break-ins or leaks, but his flat always seemed to be waiting for him. It looked either clean or messy, depending on how he left it. Over time, he started to see it as part of himself, a place where his thoughts and feelings spilled out. He became frustrated that he could not change it.
Sometimes, letters would pile up by the door, and the answering machine would blink when he got home. He was thankful that his windows were not broken and that nothing bad had happened to his flat. From his small office on the third floor, Ralph often looked forward to his quiet evenings at home. After leaving the busy office, he felt a little more like himself on the bus ride home. But once he was home, he realized he didn’t want to be alone anymore, even though he thought he did.
At his desk, he wanted to be alone with his things, but when he got home, he felt empty. He worried that his job was changing him and taking him away from who he really was. He would read or listen to music at night, but he started to wonder why he did these things. His thoughts became confused, and he felt lost.
There was a time when he felt stronger and believed in himself. He wanted to improve his life, but he just wanted to get by. He applied for jobs that his friends talked about, following them as they moved forward. He went to one job interview for a local newspaper. He was happy to have a nice chat with Neil, his future boss, and he didn’t think about what the job would really be like. Neil offered him the job right away, saying he was the only graduate who applied. Ralph took this as a compliment at the time."
CPE_45,C2,"**Goat Racing**
I was about to see goat racing. It was Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. I was moving through ice-cream vans, many people, food stalls, and loud music. Everyone was going to the racecourse, but I pushed through the crowd to find a good spot. They had made a special area for the race. It was not like a big racecourse, but people were standing on both sides of the ground where the goats would run. They were trying to keep a few goats in order. This is not easy because goats can eat almost anything!
**Canoe Trip**
As the day ended, I started to worry about the night. The canoe was too wet to sleep in, and we could not find a place to stop. We had not seen any villages or huts since early morning. In the dim moonlight, we used our flashlight to see the cliffs, but the flashlight batteries were dying. We changed the batteries, but they did not work. We could not find a place to camp. A little later, Lesley saw a flickering light, and we felt hopeful. But the light was just the moon shining on the waves. Soon, we heard the loud sound of rushing water, but we could not see what was happening. We kept moving on.
**How to Be Presentation Perfect**
I am not good at making presentations, but as a managing director, I have to present to my colleagues and important shareholders. How can I get better at this and feel more confident? You are not alone. Making a presentation is different from running a company, but many leaders need to be good at it. If you want to convince your audience, you must believe in what you are saying. Show your passion and enthusiasm during the presentation. This means you need to prepare well. Test your ideas before the presentation. Ask your colleagues what tough questions the audience might ask. You should also create a positive atmosphere from the start. Begin with something everyone can relate to and then lead to your main point."
CPE_64,C2,"Some activities take time and cannot be rushed. For example, if you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you try to make mayonnaise too quickly, it will not work. If you pull hard on a tangled fishing line, it will get tighter. Our minds also work at different speeds. Some things we think about happen very fast, while others take a long time, like days or even years. 
We can get better at some tasks, like solving puzzles, but some things cannot be rushed. If we try to hurry, we might make mistakes. For example, saying ""Think fast; we need results"" can be unhelpful, just like trying to sleep for a short time when we need more rest. 
There are three main speeds of thinking. The first is very fast. Sometimes we need to react quickly without thinking. For example, if you fall off a bike, your body knows what to do before you think about it. This quick reaction is called our ""wits."" 
The second speed is thinking carefully. This is when we solve problems or make decisions. For example, a mechanic figuring out why a car won’t start is using this kind of thinking. We often call this ""intellect."" People who are good at this are called ""clever"" or ""bright.""
The third speed is slower and more relaxed. This is when we think about things in a calm way, like when we are daydreaming or enjoying nature. This slower thinking is also important. It helps us understand complex problems better. 
Recent studies show that taking time to think slowly can help us solve difficult problems. For example, if we are unsure about where to go on holiday, we might need to think slowly to understand all the options. 
In some situations, like managing a difficult team at work, it is better to sit and think rather than rush to find answers. This slower way of thinking is connected to creativity and wisdom. Poets and philosophers have known for a long time that slow thinking can be very valuable. Scientists are now studying how our minds can do important tasks when we give them time."
CPE_29,C2,"**Surviving in a Foreign Land**
I have been welcomed warmly. I am in a friendly place with many people. There are about forty people here, including scientists, students, and weather experts. We all help each other. My French is okay for talking, but I cannot have fun conversations. I miss some small details, and my phrasebook does not help me at breakfast. This is not a big problem, but at first, I felt unsure of myself. I was a little scared of mealtimes. I did not know which table to sit at, and I felt nervous when I spoke. I still smile a lot or feel scared when people talk to me. I think I feel a bit sad because I am not as confident as I used to be when I could talk easily.
**Elliot**
When I first met Elliot, I was a young writer, and he did not notice me. He remembered faces, and when I saw him, he would shake my hand but did not want to be friends. If I saw him at the opera with important people, he would not see me. Then, I became successful as a playwright, and I noticed that Elliot started to be friendlier. One day, he invited me to lunch, and I thought he wanted to get to know me better. After my success, I made many new friends and saw him more often.
**Alfred Hitchcock**
Alfred Hitchcock was a famous film director. He said he did not care about the story or the acting in his films. He cared about the pictures and the music. He believed that people feel strong emotions from the film itself, no matter where they come from. If a film is made well, people from Japan and India should react the same way. Hitchcock was very smart and knew what he was doing. He wanted to make people scream with excitement. He focused only on the film and how it could affect the audience."
CPE_57,C2,"**Amateur Astronomy**
Many things have changed in astronomy in the last 50 years. About 30 years ago, there were not many charts and books about astronomy. Telescopes were not very good, and there were few practical guides. Now, there are many types of telescopes and equipment available. Electronic calculators and computers have made it easier to create charts and analyze observations. This is a great time for amateur astronomy. 
However, some things have also gotten worse. Now, you may have to travel 80 km to find a dark sky, unlike 50 years ago when it was easier to see stars in cities. During the day, the sky is often filled with trails from airplanes, which can last for hours and make it hard to see the sun or stars at night.
**Too Much Choice**
Today, there are too many choices in life. People have many options for products and services. This can feel overwhelming. Technology makes things change quickly, and new products come out all the time. This can make people feel tired and disconnected from life. 
Having more choices can lead to more stress and less time. Because of this, many people are looking for ""simplexity,"" which means finding simple things that make life meaningful. But it is not easy to simplify life when there are so many products and options available.
**McAndrews Hotel**
Every summer, my family stays for two weeks at McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. This is a family tradition started by my grandmother, and it is very important to us. We do not want anything to change this tradition. 
The guests at McAndrews Hotel are often old-fashioned and a bit different. I do not like the rude behavior of some shop assistants today. I also do not enjoy when waiters act too friendly. I know many of the other guests because we have been coming here since we were children. When I see them in the hotel, we usually just say hello and do not talk much. This respect for privacy is hard to find in hotels today."
CPE_9,C2,"**Othello**  
A great show of Shakespeare's play Othello is now in London. I want to say sorry for a bad review I wrote when the show started last spring. I said that Ray Fearon was too young for the main role, and I was wrong about his acting. I still believe that Othello and Desdemona should have a bigger age difference, but I take back my words about Mr. Fearon's amazing performance. The whole cast is wonderful. Some memorable scenes are when Cassio plays games with other young officers, and things get out of control. Another strong moment is when Iago starts to lose control. The scene where Emilia helps Desdemona get ready for bed is very emotional. The show has great pace and tension. Don’t miss this production!
**Lake Vostok**  
In Antarctica, there is very little life. On the edges, you can see penguins, seals, and birds. But in the middle, there is a huge hidden lake called Lake Vostok, which is under almost 4 kilometers of ice. This lake has been cut off from air and sunlight for up to 25 million years. Scientists are excited to explore this lake and find out what strange life might be there. For two years, researchers from around the world have been trying to learn the secrets of this lake. If they succeed, we will see many discoveries about Lake Vostok in the next few years.
**Scientists**  
Last week, I heard something interesting on the radio. Some scientists are thinking about why they want to be scientists. They often say it is ""because it's there."" We know that they want to learn about everything, from tiny atoms to big black holes. But these scientists want to understand why we want to know these things. They wonder why science cannot explain our desire to learn. I think it is more important to know if what scientists do is right, rather than argue about why we want to know things. Science is a tool, and we should decide how and when to use it."
CPE_42,C2,"**Food**  
Food is very important in our lives. Many people who love cooking buy cookbooks. Sometimes, we think cooking is only for special occasions or fancy dishes. But that is not true! You can make a tasty soup by just putting chopped carrots, leeks, celery, and herbs in water. This is much better than buying soup in a packet or a can. Instead of buying a sweet chocolate dessert full of chemicals, you can make a delicious treat in just five minutes that everyone will enjoy. Cooking is also a way to show care and love. Sharing food is special, and that is why we celebrate important events like birthdays and anniversaries with meals. No one wants to have takeout for a wedding or a business meeting over canned soup!
**In the Elevator**  
This morning, Alistair tried to clean his office, but it was still messy. Papers were everywhere, and he had many tax forms and other documents to organize. As he took the elevator to his floor, he knew Mallory would arrive on time for their meeting. She was always very punctual and liked things to be neat. He worried about how she would react to the mess. She might think someone had made a mess in his office. Alistair saw his cleaning lady, Mrs. Wilson, and smiled at her, hoping she would help. But she looked unhappy and did not want to go into his messy office.
**Karen**  
Karen wanted to be different from her mother. She created her own story about strength. One important moment in her life was when she was twelve years old. Her brother accidentally hit her in the eye with a golf club. At first, she thought she would go blind. But the doctor told her that her bone protected her eye, and she only needed a few stitches. When she opened her eyes in the doctor's office and saw her mother, she felt grateful and knew she was saved for a reason.
**Miss Fogerty**  
Miss Fogerty was walking quickly across the village green. She felt both excited and sad about something she had just seen. It is always thrilling to learn something new in a small community, but she was also worried about Dr. Bailey's health. He had been her doctor for many years and always cared for her when she was sick. She appreciated how he made her feel like he had time to listen to her problems. This is why everyone in the village loved him so much. He always gave his time, knowledge, and humor to his patients, and they were very loyal to him."
CPE_59,C2,"**Joanna's Lessons**
Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist. She plays music for many people. But she also writes books for young children who want to learn the piano. Joanna plays the piano very well. She can play many styles of music, like classical, jazz, and blues. 
At one concert for kids, a small boy asked her, ""Can you play Match of the Day?"" This surprised her, but she thought it was funny. She played it, and the boy was happy. Joanna cares a lot about how children learn to play the piano. She has written a book called *Joanna MacGregor's Piano World* to help them.
Even though she has a busy schedule, she wants to help children learn music. She believes that the first lessons are very important. Many people think only about the best musicians, but Joanna thinks everyone should be able to enjoy music. 
When she was younger, Joanna taught many children how to play the piano. She remembers how much fun it was to play different kinds of music with them. She wants all children to have the chance to learn the piano, just like they can learn to swim or speak a little French.
Some kids learn quickly, but others take more time. Some children stop learning because they feel too much pressure from their parents. Joanna worries that some parents want their children to be perfect instead of just enjoying music.
Joanna's books are colorful and fun. They have stories and music to make learning easier. She wants children to have fun while they learn. She believes it is important for kids to play around on the piano and try different sounds.
As children learn, they need to practice reading music. Joanna understands that this can be hard. She thinks practice is very important. She did not practice a lot until she went to music school, but now she loves it. 
Joanna says that whether you practice for a little or a long time, it is important to know what you want to do. She also suggests playing through a piece of music, even if you make mistakes, and mixing easy songs with harder ones."
CPE_54,C2,"**Writing by Hand and on Screen**
Dr. Johnson said that ""what is written without effort is usually read without pleasure."" This means that good writing is hard to do. When I look at my old school essays, I see that I did not cross out many words. Today, I would change them many times. I think this is because writing by hand was hard work. Writing slowly helped me think better. When we write on a computer, it is easy to make mistakes. Many writers spend just as much time fixing their work on a computer as they did writing it by hand. 
Emails are different from handwritten letters. Many people now write love letters by email. This is good because at least they are writing. But words on a screen can feel flat. People often do not think carefully about what they write, and their messages can become confusing. Writing quickly on a computer can lose the care and style of handwriting.
**The CD**
I put down my cup and looked at the CD. The case was not very nice, but the shiny disc inside looked interesting. ""Wonderful little things, aren't they?"" Mr. Warriston said when he came back. I agreed and handed the disc to him carefully. ""It’s amazing that they can fit seventy minutes of music on them,"" he said, turning on the music player. Lights turned on, and a small drawer opened. He put the disc inside and closed the drawer. ""Some people say they sound cold, but I think they..."" 
""Do you have to turn them over, like records?"" I asked. 
""What? No,"" Mr. Warriston said. ""You only play one side."" 
""Why?"" I asked. He looked surprised and then thought for a moment. ""I don’t know. You could make both sides playable and double the music,"" he said. He smiled at me. ""Good point."" He pointed to my wooden chair. ""Come on, let’s get you sitting in the best place for the sound, okay?"" I smiled, happy to have asked a question he could not answer.
**Books vs. Electronic Text**
Malcolm Bradbury said that if matches were invented after cigarette lighters, we would think they were better. Many people say that electronic text is as important as the invention of printing. They think it will replace books soon. But big changes take a long time. Reading long texts on a screen is not enjoyable, so many people do not do it. Computers make it easy to read only parts of a text. 
Some people say that this new way of reading is good because it creates new stories. But many books have always been read in parts, like religious texts and dictionaries. The real problem is that computers do not help us read everything from start to finish.
**The Office**
Charles walked into the office and saw everything was neat. The carpet was clean, and the desk was dark wood, just like he remembered. Files were in their right places, and twelve years of trade journals filled the shelves. Kathleen was trying to close a filing cabinet and then looked at him. ""You have to use computers, Charles. This is too much,"" she said. 
""Hello, Kathleen. This is amazing,"" he replied, admiring the room. He did not want to think about computers. They had talked about this many times. She did not understand why he did not want to use technology, even though he was good with computers and had written an important paper about them. She could use any software and make it do new things."
CPE_32,C2,"""You don’t take sugar, do you?” shouted his secretary. She was not really asking; she was stating a fact because she had been making coffee for Lancelot for many months. She forgot things because he was not usually there. But now, he was there all the time. He learned that staying away only caused more problems. 
He thought about how he went from being an important helper, meeting authors and playwrights for lunch, to being very busy and always in a rush at work. “This came,” she yelled, waving a folder before putting it in front of him. “From that guy in Los Angeles. You wanted to see it.” The label said: “A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert.” Below that, it said “An Expanded Synopsis.” Lancelot did not want to see the word “synopsis.” He wanted to see “A First Draft.” He had already seen a synopsis of this book and did not want to see another one.
Ian Cuthbert had received a lot of money for this book when Lancelot bought the company. Ian was a friend who Lancelot had made a mistake by asking to write a book. Ian was known for being unpredictable. Lancelot skipped the introduction he had read many times and looked at the synopsis. He recognized almost every phrase. He closed the folder and pushed it aside. It seemed that Ian’s manuscript would never come. The synopsis was not as good as it should be, and it felt like Ian had lost his passion for the book.
Lancelot remembered a famous author who had published an incomplete book after his death. That author had been paid little by little for each chapter. But Ian had received a lot of money upfront, which was not how things should work. Lancelot remembered when Ian was a promising writer in Cambridge. His friends wanted to take over British theatre, and they did. But Ian seemed lazy compared to them. He wore his coat like a cape and talked about famous writers as if he had met them.
For some reason, Ian’s creative talent stayed hidden. While others became successful, Ian became harder to work with. He was supposed to edit a magazine about the arts, but it never got published. His contract with a fashion magazine was renewed three times, but he still did not produce anything. At meetings, he was rude and critical of others’ ideas. Ten years later, he was not even reliable enough to show up for his own funeral. Lancelot was starting to think that asking Ian to write “A World History of the Short” was a mistake."""
CPE_65,C2,"**England's Breakfast Revolution**
A good breakfast is very important, according to health experts. But in history, breakfast is a new idea in England. In medieval times, people did not often write about breakfast. Some travelers ate a meal at dawn before long journeys, and sick people had breakfast for health reasons. But most people did not eat breakfast unless they were kings or nobles.
In the sixteenth century, breakfast became more common. Some writers say this happened because food was easier to get. However, there were also big changes in society. For example, more people had jobs with set hours. Many of these jobs started very early in the morning. So, eating breakfast became necessary for everyone, not just for rich people."
CPE_61,C2,"**Photography**  
When a photographer takes a picture, they choose what to show based on their skills, personal views, and experiences. They also think about social and cultural ideas. In this book, we will see how these things affect the style and meaning of a photograph. We will also look at how people see and react to these images. For example, when someone reads a newspaper, they understand the photos in a certain way. But instead of just believing the photo, we can ask if it really shows what happened at that time. Does it show the photographer's opinion? Is the exact moment in the photo important, or does it represent something bigger in the world?
**More than a Game**  
For me, sports are more than just a game. The best athletes believe in themselves completely. To be the best, you need to focus and put everything else aside. Sports can be tough, and no one will do the work for you. You either succeed or fail. Sports have taught me discipline and determination, but they also show the importance of teamwork. My sport lets me shine as an individual, but it is also a team game, and I must balance both. This is like life – you can do well alone, but you must remember others are around you. Sports have given me a lot, not just money. They have opened doors for me and shown me things in the world that many people will never see. But I have also had to give up a lot for these rewards.
**Tuning In**  
Some experiences stay in our memory very clearly. For me, one special moment happened many years ago in California. One night, I was awake listening to a mockingbird singing from a tree in my neighborhood. I don’t have trouble sleeping, but the beautiful singing kept me awake. As I listened to the bird's songs, I felt like I was in a special musical world. To understand the bird's music, I thought about jazz and Indian classical music. The bird made me feel like I was hearing an amazing live performance. I cheered and groaned as the bird sang different tunes through my open window, until I finally fell asleep."
CPE_52,C2,"
People have always talked a lot about birds. They love them, fear them, and even worship them. But what does this say about us? 
In a greenhouse, a little brown bird called a wren is bumping against the glass. Is it trying to tell me something, or is it just stuck? Depending on how you see it, both could be true. 
Wrens have been part of British culture for a long time. In medieval times, people believed that the way wrens flew could tell them about their luck. Today, you can still see wrens in pictures and decorations in many British homes. Even if old beliefs about wrens are not as strong now, people still care about them. A place without wrens feels sad. 
People used to connect more with nature for their survival. They created stories and meanings about birds. These meanings can change over time. For example, the red kite bird was once seen as a helpful bird in London, taking food from children. But later, people thought of them as pests and they almost disappeared. Now, red kites are protected again and are important for conservation in Britain. 
Our connection with birds goes back to when humans first appeared. Early humans watched birds closely because they could warn them about danger or bad weather. Birds also connected them to their dreams. 
Birds are important to us because they represent freedom and beauty. Some people think our feelings about birds are not needed anymore, but they are still part of who we are. Losing this connection would be hard for us. 
In recent years, birds have shown us how the environment is changing. In Britain, 30 bird species are in danger. This is sad because it means we are losing not just birds, but also part of our culture. Birds like the skylark and turtle dove have special meanings in love and magic. Many poems and stories mention these birds, and losing them makes us feel sad. 
However, we often ignore the loss of other birds that are not in stories or poems. Folklore, which includes stories and legends, is very important. These stories connect us to birds in a way that science cannot. They help us feel emotions that are hidden in our busy lives. 
Whether we watch birds on TV or in our gardens, the joy we feel cannot be explained by science. Birds are fascinating in ways we do not fully understand. The wren in the greenhouse connects our present with a long history and holds a mystery that keeps us thinking."
CPE_28,C2,"**Maps**
A map shows how places and features on the earth are related to each other. This is done by showing distance and direction. In the past, people often talked about distance in time, like ""it takes so many hours to walk"" or ""a day's journey by river."" This way of measuring helped people understand how easy it was to travel, but it did not give exact distances.
Direction is also important, but for many travelers, the main questions were ""Where do I go from here?"" and ""How far is it?"" So, having the exact direction was not always very important. Because of this, written directions were often used instead of maps. Even today, some maps, like those for train systems, do not show true directions.
In the past, important landmarks were shown on maps with signs that could be realistic or simple. The way maps were made changed depending on their purpose and location. To understand old maps, it is important to know how they were made.
The history of map-making, or cartography, is about making maps more accurate in showing distance and direction. Over time, cartographers used other sciences to help them. For example, instead of using shadows or stars to find direction, they started using compasses and tools to measure angles accurately.
As people explored the world, they wanted to make better maps. Astronomers found out that the earth is not a perfect sphere, which helped improve maps of large areas. The needs of map users also changed. Soldiers, especially after the invention of cannons, needed accurate maps to understand the land better. This led to the creation of contour maps.
Other people, like archaeologists and historians, also needed maps for their work. Today, cartographers make maps for many different uses, like showing geology, climate, and land use. This shows how important maps are in many sciences.
It is important to know that the development of maps has not always been steady. There have been times of slow progress and times of quick change. Sometimes old ideas stayed alongside new ones. Cartographers often had good ideas but had to wait for better tools to use them. Since it is easy to copy old maps, many map publishers have been slow to accept new ideas.
Because of this, we should not always trust maps as the best information. The many maps we have today show a lot of human effort and thought. They are valuable records for studying our past. This is what makes learning about historical cartography interesting and important."

I went into a young man's living room. It was a nice place, very different from the messy rooms where his family spent time. Moving from the kitchen to his room felt like going from a cheap seat to a better one. In this room, I saw the biggest collection of records I had ever seen, the first stereo record player I had ever met, and amazing things like wine glasses and furniture. The young man’s name was Andrew Lloyd Webber. He had a scholarship to study history at Magdalen College, Oxford, and he had nine months before starting school. He wanted to be a famous composer like Richard Rodgers.
I also had big dreams. I wanted to be a pop star for good reasons: women, money, and fame. But my dreams were not as important to me as Andrew’s were to him. When Andrew suggested I try to be a famous lyricist like Oscar Hammerstein, I was happy to try. He played me three of his songs on the piano, and I could tell he was very talented.
He needed a new lyricist, and I didn’t have much to show him except for a song I had written that a small pop group had recorded. We said we would meet again and write something together. I was still more interested in pop music than in theater, but I knew I had met someone special who would be very successful in musical theater.
The next day, back at my office where I was training to be a lawyer, I felt less sure about my chance in show business with Andrew. I would still look for ads for groups needing a singer and write more simple songs. But I thought I would probably finish my exams and become a lawyer by twenty-five. My father thought I would stop liking pop music by twenty-one, and that worried me. I wanted to enjoy it for a while longer.
I decided to see Andrew again. It would be fun to go to a musical with him and write lyrics for musicals instead of pop songs. Andrew was interesting; he talked about good food and old buildings, and he liked the Leyton Orient football team. He had an idea for a musical about Dr. Thomas Barnardo, a man who started orphanages. I thought the story was good, but not very exciting. The hero seemed too perfect, and the idea reminded me too much of the musical ""Oliver.""
But Andrew believed in his music, and I wanted to help. I started working hard, especially on the funny songs. Andrew told me the story, played the music, and even gave me some titles. I skipped a day at the law office, pretending to be sick, to write my first lyrics for the musical. That day, I didn’t know it, but I was starting a new career."
CPE_5,C2,"**Language**  
You and I are part of a special group of living things. We can share thoughts and feelings with each other using language. Language is very important in our lives. If you see two or more people together, they will probably be talking. When people are alone, they might talk to themselves, their pets, or even their plants. I think of language as a natural skill. Just like spiders know how to make webs, people know how to talk. No one teaches spiders how to spin webs; they just do it.
**Climate and Weather**  
Climate and weather are made by the air around us. They have a big effect on animals and plants. Climate can change how a place looks. For example, warm and wet weather all year helps tropical jungles grow. These jungles have many different kinds of plants and animals. In cold and windy places, there are not many living things. The weather changes every day because of big air movements. The air moves because the Earth spins. The sun also helps to move the air.
**Coffee**  
As a bar-person, my job was to serve drinks, but I also had to make coffee. In Lygon Street, Melbourne, a restaurant's success can depend on its coffee. I had several days of training to learn how to make coffee and clean the espresso machine. I learned how to make a good cappuccino. By the end of the week, I realized that making coffee was harder than it seemed. I thought I might have to go back to cleaning ashtrays. Luckily, my boss was patient. He told me, ""Making coffee is both an art and a science, and you need time to learn it."""
CPE_41,C2,"**Art on TV**
Why does television often not do well with shows about art? Painting and sculpture are good subjects for TV because the camera can show the whole artwork and then zoom in to see the details. But there are not many TV series that show the joy and complexity of looking at art. 
A good example is Robert Hughes's series called *American Visions*. Hughes is a trusted critic with a strong personality. He had almost eight hours to show British viewers a type of art that British galleries do not show. I thought the series would focus on famous artworks. Instead, it was about how American history and culture are shown in its art and buildings.
**Dealing in Metals**
For 20 years, I worked as a metals dealer and became known for taking risks. The metals market is not as controlled as other markets. With some luck, a willingness to take risks, and a good understanding of the market, you can make a lot of money. Taking risks is part of this business. This adventurous culture fits well with a free global economy. 
But now, the free-trade experts who said the market would keep metal prices high have found the opposite is true. More minerals are being taken from the ground, and the cost of raw materials is going down. If we think about inflation, the prices of most metals are about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to look into claims against a big company that benefits from these cheap raw materials.
**Extract from a Holiday Brochure**
Abaco and its small islands are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas. They stretch from Florida to Cuba. Each island is unique and has something special to offer. To get around the islands, you need a boat. If a boat is not included with your room, don’t worry. There are many ferries and water taxis. You can also rent a boat if you want to explore on your own. 
Sailing is the most popular way to travel here. Abaco is called 'The Sailing Capital of the World' for a good reason. The calm waters are perfect for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The islands and their beaches stretch for 200 miles like a string of pearls. At night, the lights of the restaurants and cafes in Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay shine brightly."
CPE_69,C2,"**Build Your Own Bamboo Bike in the UK**
You can build your own bamboo bike at the Bamboo Bike Club in the UK. This workshop is run by two engineers, James Marr and Ian McMillan. You will get a custom bike frame designed by a computer and have a fun weekend building your bike.
It is Saturday morning in Hackney Wick, east London. The Bamboo Bike Club is the only place in Britain where you can learn to build bikes from bamboo. I went to see how it works. There is a lot of energy and fun in the workshop.
Bamboo is becoming popular for making bikes. Some companies, like Calfee Design from California and Bamboo Bikes from Yorkshire, have been making bamboo bikes since 1894. But many cyclists find bamboo bikes too expensive. A ready-made bamboo frame can cost about $2,995 or £1,868. 
James and Ian wanted to make bamboo bikes more affordable. They spent years working in a shed in Brecon, Wales, to create a business that everyone can enjoy. They wanted to share the fun of making something special and eco-friendly. Now, the Bamboo Bike Club is more about community than just business. James works on wind turbines, and Ian is a civil engineer. They run monthly courses where you can build your own bike frame at a good price.
On the first day of the course, James and Ian teach you how to choose strong bamboo and how to make strong joints. You will glue the bamboo tubes together to make the bike frame. They use alloy tubes for parts that need to be very strong, like the handlebars and wheel forks. 
James and Ian help everyone with their work. They check every cut and joint to make sure it is right. If you make a mistake, it is okay! You can just try again with another piece of bamboo. Each piece of bamboo is checked for quality, so you can choose how your bike will look: plain bamboo, black, or mottled.
On Sunday, you will spend time building the lugs, which are the parts that connect the frame. You will wrap the joints with hemp and glue them to make them strong. After adding a waterproof coating, your bike will be ready for wheels, brakes, gears, and a seat.
James and Ian say their bamboo bikes are very strong. Ian has used his bike for over a year, and James has tested his bike off-road for three months without breaking it. They use thicker bamboo and strong bindings to make sure the bikes last.
How do bamboo bikes look? They might not look as neat as metal bikes, but they are unique. James and Ian believe that the special look is part of the charm. I think bamboo bikes are great for relaxing rides, not for racing. I chose a 'Classic English' frame for a smooth ride.
I tried James's bike, and it was light and smooth to ride. James says the best part of the workshop is when you ride your bike. Bamboo bikes are fun to ride and cost less than £500."
CPE_38,C2,"**Self-help Books**
Dione Reverend worked as an editor at Random House in New York. One day, she found a book by a new pop psychologist, Dr. John Gray. She thought the title was great and knew it would be very popular. She was right! Dr. Gray became very rich, and Dione started her own company. Dr. Gray's book helps men and women understand each other better. This book is part of a big self-help industry in America. Many people want to improve their lives, and this industry helps them. However, it also creates many new problems and supports the publishing world in New York.
In Britain, people see that there are many self-help books, but some are not very good. For every self-help book published, many others are not accepted because they are too similar or too specific. This is a good thing. Editors are always looking for the next big book. They care more about how popular a book will be than how well it is written. Dione says that if someone has a catchy title, it is a big step towards success. 
**Autobiographies**
When someone writes an autobiography, there is an agreement between the writer and the reader that the truth will be told. But this agreement is often not kept. Writers may leave out things they feel are too shameful or not important. Sometimes, they may change the truth to make their story better. They might call their book an autobiography to make readers believe it is true, even if it is not. This can happen without any bad intentions.
**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**
People who study detective stories say that these stories show the problems of society in the late 1800s and early 1900s. In a detective story, a crime represents a human desire, like greed. Solving the crime helps society return to normal. In Hammett's stories, society is shown to be corrupt. The detective and the criminal understand each other and are connected in a strange way. The detective is part of both worlds: he is too honest for criminals and too shady for the law. His job is complicated because he feels connected to both sides.
**Science Writing**
Stephen Jay Gould is a famous science writer. I met him at the Grand Hotel while he was promoting his new book. We both felt out of place there. Gould said that writing in such a fancy place is hard. He believes that only scientists can write well about science because they understand it. If you do not know the science community, it is difficult to write about it.
Gould has a rule: never write down to the reader. He says you can use simpler words, but you must keep the main ideas clear. If readers feel that you are talking down to them, they will not enjoy your writing."
CPE_17,C2,"**Air-conditioning**  
At Cannons Gym, a popular place for City of London workers, it is very cold inside. This summer has been very hot, so the gym has used a lot of air-conditioning. Sometimes, it feels like the Arctic when it is quiet. This shows how we often use air-conditioning too much. It is now a big part of our work and play. Many buildings with air-conditioning could use other ways to stay cool. They could use sunlight and fresh air, and have thicker walls that keep heat out during the day and let it go at night. These ideas are simple but can help a lot and reduce the need for air-conditioning.
**Sundials**  
It is interesting that more people are looking at sundials again. Sundials are tools that tell time by the sun's position. A hundred years ago, they were very important for keeping time. But as clocks and watches got better, sundials became just decorations in gardens. Now, people are taking them seriously again. David Harber, who makes sundials, thinks they are special because they connect us to the planets. He says there is a magical moment when a sundial starts to work. They are calm and beautiful objects that remind us of our place in the universe.
**Paint Your Own China**  
I remember seeing china-painting at an art show a long time ago. Older women painted flowers on teacups very carefully. It was amazing to watch them. Their hands were steady, and the paint was perfect. I thought it would be hard to learn this skill. I wondered if beginners would be good at it. But when I went to a china-painting class, it was not scary at all. Everyone was there to have fun, and even the teacher did not want to paint like the women I had seen before."
CPE_47,C2,"**The Wrong Country**
Uncle chose a holiday for Keith and Dawne. It was a good price: a flight from Gatwick Airport and twelve nights in Venice, a beautiful city, at the Pensione Concordia. When they went to the travel agency to book the trip, the clerk told them that other people in the group were students from the south coast learning Italian.
But something went wrong. They ended up in a hotel called the Edelweiss in Switzerland, not Venice. At Gatwick, they gave their tickets to a girl in a yellow-and-red uniform. She checked their tickets and said everything was fine. An hour later, they heard older people on the plane speaking with accents from the North of England. Keith thought there might have been a cancellation or that the Italian class was on another plane.
When they landed, a woman with glasses told them to stay together. The brochure did not say anything about an overnight stop, but when they arrived, Keith realized they were not going to Venice. It was close to midnight, and they were tired, so they did not question the beds they were given. 
The next morning, they found out they were supposed to stay in the hotel for their whole holiday. The receptionist smiled and said they could enjoy the lake and take a boat to Interlaken. Keith calmly told him there was a mistake. They were meant to be in Venice at the Pensione Concordia. The receptionist did not know that place.
Dawne said the man who booked their trip was bald, wore glasses, and had a moustache. She gave the name of the travel agency in London. A woman named Mrs. Franks, who they had seen at Gatwick, came over. She said she was in charge. Dawne told her they were in the wrong hotel. 
Keith explained that they had followed the girl in the yellow-and-red uniform and ended up in the wrong group. Dawne added that they should have known something was wrong when they heard people talking about Darlington, not Dover. 
Mrs. Franks explained that there are many different holidays with the same yellow-and-red labels. She laughed and said if they followed others with the same labels, they might end up in a wildlife park, but that could never happen. 
Keith insisted they were not supposed to be in Switzerland. Mrs. Franks then walked away, leaving them confused. The receptionist was gone, and they could hear typing. Dawne whispered that Mrs. Franks seemed nice, but Keith was not listening. He thought about everything that had happened: giving the tickets, waiting, and getting on the plane.
An old man named Mr. Nottage spoke to them. He and his wife were happy and said they had the best sleep in years because of the fresh air by the lake. Dawne replied that was nice. 
Keith and Dawne left the hotel and did not say anything to each other. They found it funny that on their first holiday since their honeymoon, they were with a group of older people when they wanted to escape from that. Uncle had said the same thing when they tried to get him to come with them."
CPE_48,C2,"**He Was a People Person**
American business leaders are looking to Ernest Shackleton, a famous polar explorer, as a good example of management. Many people in Britain know who Shackleton was and what he did. However, Americans are just starting to learn about him. This year, the Wall Street Journal called Shackleton ""an Antarctic explorer"" who was not well-known for most of the 20th century. Now, Americans are very interested in him. 
Books and stories about Shackleton's journey on the Endurance are being made. The American Museum of Natural History is planning a big exhibition, and a film about Shackleton's life is in the works. Some American managers see Shackleton as a role model. They talk about his actions with great respect and learn lessons about leadership and communication from him. 
Shackleton is known for being determined and resourceful. He had a special sleeping bag and a stove made from animal fat. Jim MacGregor, a manager in New York, has looked up to Shackleton for many years. His company helps with communication during business changes and crises. MacGregor says that even if a company handles a crisis well, it can still hurt itself by not communicating properly. He believes Shackleton is a good model for management because he was a strong leader and communicator. Shackleton always put the safety of his men first.
One important decision Shackleton made was to turn back when he was only 97 miles from the South Pole. He had to make this tough choice because they were running out of supplies and time. In a crisis, people want to know who is in charge. While some managers today avoid responsibility, Shackleton was ready to take charge. 
In 1914, Shackleton's ship, the Endurance, got stuck in ice for nine months and was eventually crushed. When the ship sank, Shackleton told his men that they would be safe if they worked hard and trusted him. He always kept his men informed and asked for their opinions. Shackleton was flexible and ready to change plans if needed. 
MacGregor says that Shackleton believed an explorer needs to be optimistic, strong, and patient. He points out that in America, people often want quick solutions. For example, if you invest money and make a mistake, it is better to wait and see than to sell and lose a lot of money. Shackleton also led by example. When he saw a team member without gloves, he gave him his own, saying he would throw them overboard if he didn’t wear them. 
Caroline Alexander, who wrote a book about Shackleton's expedition, says that people today are looking for heroes. Shackleton shows that true heroism is rare now, and he represents the ideals that many people wish for today."
CAE_15,C1,"**Finding Food in Madagascar**
In the forests of Madagascar, there is a special animal called the aye-aye. The aye-aye is a primate, and it has a way of finding food that is similar to a woodpecker. Both the aye-aye and the woodpecker look for insects in wood. The woodpecker uses its beak to make holes in the wood and its long tongue to get the insects. The aye-aye uses its sharp teeth to make holes and its long finger to reach inside and get the insects.
Scientists have studied how aye-ayes find insects. Dr. Carl Erickson from Duke University studied three aye-ayes: two males named Nosferatu and Poe, and a female named Samantha with her baby, Annabelle. He wanted to see if they could find insects by looking for signs, like holes in the wood where insects might be.
Dr. Erickson made logs with small holes. Some holes had food inside, and some were empty. The aye-ayes went straight to the holes with food. They did not need to see the holes to find the mealworms inside. They might have used their sense of smell or sound, but tests showed they did not need these either. They could find food even when the smell was blocked or when the mealworms were quiet.
So, how did the aye-ayes find the food? Dr. Erickson found that they could feel the empty spaces in the wood. When looking for food, an aye-aye taps the wood with its long finger and listens carefully. It seems to be able to hear the sound of the hollow wood and the movement of insects inside.
The aye-aye is interesting because it acts like both a woodpecker and a bat. It also has some behaviors like a squirrel. Its teeth keep growing, just like a squirrel's teeth. Recently, scientists saw an aye-aye in the wild eating nuts by gnawing through the shells and using its long finger to get the nut inside."
CAE_19,C1,"**Ordinary People, Ordinary Lives**
Many of us have pictures of our grandparents, but how many of us know what their lives were like? We might have some old diaries or family stories, but they often do not tell us everything. And what will our grandchildren know about us? We want to write things down, but we often forget to do it. Sometimes we make videos instead of taking pictures, but videos are still not the same as real life.
Hannah Renier has a solution. She writes life stories for other people. She makes a book with at least 20,000 words and pictures if needed. These books are not about famous people, but about ordinary people. Hannah got this idea when she talked to her family and saw that many stories from the past were being lost.
""When I started, I didn’t think it was very important,"" she says. ""But then I met people who have interesting stories to tell. They want to share their lives for their children and for future generations, but they also enjoy it.""
People feel safe to share their stories with Hannah. A 62-year-old man said, ""I felt I could be honest. I talked about my divorce and the pain I still feel."" He wrote his story for his family, but he hasn’t let his children read it yet. He thinks some parts might hurt them. He wants them to read it after he is gone.
Hannah has noticed that many people are affected by their childhood. ""Many people repeat the same mistakes they made when they were young,"" she says. ""They often marry people their parents liked or choose partners to rebel against their parents.""
Many people still feel sad about things that happened with their parents many years ago. They try to impress parents who were never happy with them. Some people even want to say, ""I can’t stand my mother.""
Hannah listens to people’s stories without judging them. ""I am not here to be nosy,"" she says. ""People sometimes tell me things and then worry if I should include them. I usually do, but they can take things out later if they want.""
Hannah’s books are not just for showing off. They help people remember their past. Today, life moves very fast, and we often forget our history. These books help people feel connected to their family history. 
Each book takes about 30 hours of interviews. Hannah uses these talks to write the life story, changing the order of events if needed. She can create everything for the book except the binding, which has gold lettering. People can choose the color and title of their book. 
Hannah’s books are well-made and cost nearly £3,000, with extra copies costing £25 each. She gets about 10 requests each week, but the price stops many people from buying. ""I thought more people would want this,"" she says. ""But the people I have worked with are often wealthy and like to read certain magazines."""
CAE_24,C1,"**A. The University Museum of Classical Archaeology**  
The Museum of Classical Archaeology has many copies of Greek and Roman sculptures. There are over six hundred pieces in total. It is important to know that these sculptures are not real. They are copies made from the original sculptures, mostly made in the late 1800s and early 1900s. The Museum has a special gallery with good natural light. The plaster copies are useful because they allow people to see groups of sculptures that are now in different museums in Europe. You can see many famous Greek and Roman sculptures in just one afternoon.
**B. Cambridge Darkroom**  
Cambridge Darkroom is a place for photography. It has darkrooms for developing photos and a gallery for showing different photography works. We offer courses and workshops for everyone, including a Beginner's Course and special classes with guest photographers. Members can use the darkrooms. We also have a program for young photographers aged 12 to 16 to help them improve their skills. We sell photography books and materials.
**C. Sedgwick Museum of Geology**  
The Sedgwick Museum has a great collection of fossils, rocks, and minerals from all over the world. It also has the oldest geological collection in Britain, started by Dr. John Woodward. There are nearly 10,000 interesting specimens in old cabinets from the early 1700s. Adam Sedgwick was a professor of geology who helped grow the collection. The items are organized by age, so you can see how life on Earth has changed over time. The new Whewell Gallery shows beautiful minerals and gems, with labels that explain what they are and how they are used today.
**D. The Cambridge University Collection of Air Photographs**  
The collection has over 400,000 air photographs taken by university staff over the last 45 years. The university has its own aircraft at Cambridge Airport and takes photos all over Great Britain. These photographs show the landscape and how it has changed from ancient times to now. There is a small display in the entrance hall, and the library staff can help with questions. You cannot borrow the photographs, but you can buy copies, which usually take about a month to make.
**E. Cambridge Medieval Brass Rubbing Centre**  
The Cambridge Brass Rubbing Centre is one of the oldest and most unique tourist attractions in the area. Visitors can have fun making wall hangings by rubbing over one of the more than one hundred brass plates from the tombs of medieval knights and ladies. The centre makes resin copies to protect the original plates while allowing people to enjoy brass rubbing. These brass plates were used in Europe as memorials, but many were destroyed during revolutions. Most of the remaining plates are in Britain, and you can see many examples at the Cambridge Centre."
CAE_13,C1,"**From Here to Fatherhood**
A. **The Theatre Director**  
I have had a strange personal life, but I have enjoyed 35 years with small children. I loved feeding the baby this morning. For me, being a father is about love. I am very lucky with my children. We all enjoy the same things: opera, theatre, books, and music. This brings us close, especially now that they are older and I feel more like a friend than a father. I do not believe in hitting children. I have done it when I was angry, but I do not think it is right. I may not have been the best father, but I always tried to be there for them. I wait for them to call me. If I ask them why they do not call, it makes them feel guilty. My parents did that to me, and I will not do it to my children.
B. **The Advertising Executive**  
I was young when my children were born, about 25 years old. I found the responsibilities hard, but they also kept me young. As they became teenagers, they showed me new things like music and fashion. This helped me in my job. I missed some important events when they were young, like concerts and sports days, and I feel sad about that. But now, I can take them on holidays to nice places. They get along well with my friends and come to parties and work events without feeling scared. I think it is good that my job is interesting to them.
C. **The Politician**  
My first child was born just before I started my political career. My wife and I promised to spend time with our children, but my job takes a lot of time. I only go to meetings on weekends if my kids can come with me. This way, they can see what I do and do not feel like I am disappearing. I have noticed more politicians bringing their kids to work. Maybe we all want to include our children in our lives more.
D. **The Writer**  
My first marriage ended when my daughters, Kate and Bonnie, were young. I had to think a lot about being a father. I tried hard to stay close to my children. My ex-wife and I even lived next to each other for a while, so they could visit easily, but I think it confused them. Kate has said I was always there for her, but I am not sure I was a good father. I was around a lot, but I treated my kids like adults too soon. Kate said we were too relaxed with rules. I wish I had been stricter. I still worry about my older daughters just like I do about my youngest. In that way, you never stop being a parent.
E. **The TV Presenter**  
I was ready for kids when I turned 30. I met my wife, and we had a nice home, so we thought, ""Why not have a child instead of just buying new things?"" Having my daughter, Betty, made me think about who I am. It feels special to have a child, but it also makes you just one of many parents. Sometimes I feel annoyed, but when I see her smile, all my irritation goes away. A baby's smile is very powerful."

CAE_46,C1,"**Science and Weightlessness**
Journalist Tom Mumford writes about students who are testing their ideas in weightlessness. The plane looked normal from the outside. The pilot said it was built in 1964 and was a Boeing KC-135, which is based on the Boeing 707. But inside, it was very different. The inside was a long white tunnel with few windows and bright lights on the walls. Most of the seats were taken out, except for a few at the back where the 13 students sat, looking nervous.
For a year, these students from Europe and America worked hard to join this special flight. The European Space Agency asked them to come up with creative experiments to do in weightlessness. The students with the best ideas got to go on this amazing flight, which felt like a big roller coaster.
For two hours, the plane flew up and down like a bird. The pilot turned off the engines at 3,000 meters, and the plane went higher for a moment before falling back down. During this time, everything inside the plane became weightless. The students felt like they were closer to the moon than to the Earth.
The plane took off smoothly, but things changed quickly when the pilot made the plane climb steeply. The engines roared, and the students felt heavy. Then, the engines stopped, and they floated in the air for 20 seconds. It felt like jumping on a trampoline. They floated around, and it was hard to know which way was up or down.
After 10 seconds of falling, the pilot pulled the plane up again. Gravity came back, and some students landed hard. They had 30 curves to go through, giving them 10 minutes of weightlessness for their experiments. The Dutch students studied their robotic cat, Leonardo, to see how cats always land on their feet. They released a device to help with this, and one student managed to turn it over.
Another team from Germany looked at how metal joins change without gravity, which is important for building space stations. A team from Utah State University tried to make solar sails from thin films in microgravity. They think these sails could help satellites use the sun's energy like a yacht uses wind.
After two hours of flying, the students felt excited, not sick. One student said, ""It was an unforgettable experience. I wanted to be an astronaut before, but now I want it even more."""
CAE_3,C1,"**With the Trees, I Planted My Stake in New Zealand**
**JONATHON PORRITT TALKS TO DANNY DANZIGER**
Jonathon Porritt is the author of *Seeing Green - The Politics of Ecology*.
I had a strange time in my life when I did not have any summers. I went to New Zealand every summer, which is actually winter there. So, I had nine winters in a row, which was great because I like winter. My parents had an idea to buy a small piece of land for my brother, sister, and me to take care of. My mother said, ""If you plant trees on it, you can have it."" The idea was that we would always have a connection to New Zealand, which is nice because my father grew up there. They found a piece of land about 20 miles north of Auckland in a place called Rangitoupuni. The land was not very good, but it was good for planting trees.
I have always liked land. I spent a year in Australia working on farms, so planting trees sounded like a nice idea, and I was excited. My family also became excited as we went along. I started planting in 1968, and by the end of 1972, we had planted the whole 70 acres together.
In New Zealand in 1968, it rained a lot during that winter. It is funny to think of it as a happy time because it rained almost every day we were planting. I don’t think I have ever been so wet and cold for so long. Every morning was a challenge: getting ready to plant again. I would come out of the Land Rover warm and dry, but the rain would be falling, and my clothes were still wet from the day before. My hands would struggle with slippery shoelaces. 
In that first year, I had a helper who was good at planting trees, which was helpful because I had never done it seriously before. You wear a planting bag around your neck and fill it with trees. When the bag is full, it is heavy, but when it gets lighter, it is easier to work. The hardest part was getting the lines straight for planting. You decide how far apart to plant the trees, then you line up three poles to help you. Once you are in line, you plant all the way down and then come back.
I enjoy hard work, and it made me fit. After a while, you can plant trees almost automatically. You get used to a rhythm and use fewer movements to dig the hole. This rhythm is important in many farming jobs. You learn to take the tree out of the bag, dig a hole, put it in the ground, stamp it down, and move on. 
While planting, I had many thoughts about life and nature. A lot of my ideas about the natural world started during those days. I have been back to New Zealand four times since then and watched the trees grow, which is very satisfying because I planted them. I always worry when I read news about strong winds or droughts in New Zealand. Such news makes me feel anxious. But everything worked out well, and those trees are now 20 years old and healthy.
I should add that I took a break from teaching and went back in 1984 for three months by myself. I wrote my first book there, *Seeing Green*. There is a simple cabin on the tree farm with just a bed, a table, and a chair. In the mornings, I wrote; in the afternoons, I pruned the trees; and in the evenings, I did research. My connection to that area is still very strong. It is the place I feel most connected to in terms of the bond between people and the earth."
CAE_10,C1,"**Taking Care of Badger Cubs**
One day, I was surprised when one of my helpers brought me a cardboard box. My husband Derek and I have a farm in Somerset where we take care of orphaned animals. I heard strange noises from the box, so I looked inside. I saw three small grey badger cubs, each about eight inches long. They had soft fur and looked up at me with their milky eyes. I had never seen badger cubs before.
Most badger cubs are born between January and March and stay underground. If they lose their mother, they often die from hunger. These three cubs were found by builders who accidentally dug into their home. Their mother was dead, but the cubs were alive. They were cold and crying. I took them to my kitchen to keep them warm. I named the two girls Primrose and Bluebell, and the boy Willow.
At first, I fed them with a syringe. I had to wipe them with a warm cloth to help them feel like their mother was licking them. This helped them go to the bathroom. For the first few days, I fed them every four hours. After a week, they learned to drink from a bottle and started to move around. They were happy with each other and a warm pad that acted like their mother.
Three weeks later, I noticed Willow was not as active, but he was still eating. I should have acted quickly, but I didn’t. The next morning, I found him dead. The vet said he had a lung infection. It was important to feed him slowly, but I didn’t do that. I felt sad about losing him, but I continued to care for the other two cubs.
Then, a local farmer came to see me. He found another male cub that had been left by its mother. He brought the new cub, Willow II, to me. He was younger than Primrose and Bluebell. Feeding him was very hard. I had to move the bottle around to get him to drink. After a week, he learned to eat sausages, and soon he was eating other foods too.
By five months old, all the cubs were eating cereals, meat, vegetables, fruit, nuts, cheese, and eggs. Badgers usually eat a lot of earthworms, but my badgers were doing well. The summer was hot, and it was hard for other badgers to find food.
By August, the cubs started to be active at night. We took walks in the orchard, and they loved to play. They would chase each other and have fun. I learned to avoid their playful bites, but Derek sometimes got caught and had colorful bruises.
One night, I saw other badgers in our field. They were looking for food because they had to move to new areas. Badgers are very protective of their homes, so we put metal over the gate to keep them safe. The local newspaper took pictures of me walking the badgers, and many people wanted to help build a home for them.
With help from our son Daniel, we designed a new home for the badgers. It had tunnels and a special gate. Many local businesses helped us with materials. Finally, the badgers moved into their new home. I watched them settle in and soon saw them sleeping in their chambers.
Now, I don’t walk with them as often because they stay awake until midnight. Primrose has moved to another home, but Bluebell and Willow II still come to say hello before they run off into the night. This is their home now, and they are happy."
CAE_67,C1,"**In Search of True North - The Man Behind Halley's Comet**
Dr. Toby Clark is a researcher at the British Geological Survey. He wants to follow the journey of Sir Edmund Halley, who studied compass variations. Anjana Ahuja reports.
Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is famous for the comet named after him. But he also did important work by studying how compasses work. He used his sea trips on a warship called Paramore to find out about the ""variations of the compass."" These variations are now called ""declination."" Declination is the angle between magnetic north and true north. Sailors needed this information to correct their compasses and navigate the oceans.
Halley was one of only two people in England paid to do scientific research at that time. He sailed to the Cape Verde Islands to study declination in the North and South Atlantic. However, he had to stop the trip because of problems with his crew. Later, he went on another journey that took him to Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, Newfoundland, and back to England. In 1701, he published a map called ""New and Correct Chart showing the Variations of the Compass in the Western and Southern Oceans."" This map helped sailors for many years until changes in the Earth's magnetic field made it less accurate.
Dr. Clark wants to celebrate the 300th anniversary of Halley's trip by retracing the route of the Paramore. He needs to raise £70,000 before he can start. Sir Vivian Fuchs, who led the first expedition across Antarctica, is helping him.
Dr. Clark became interested in Halley while he was at Halley Station in Antarctica. He read about Halley's life and said, ""Halley led a remarkable life. He was a respected scientist and led expeditions. He was not just an astronomer; he also studied geophysics."" Halley created a diving bell and helped Sir Isaac Newton with his famous book, Principia Mathematica.
Dr. Clark believes that recreating Halley's journey will give him the recognition he deserves. His expedition, called ""In the Wake of the Paramore,"" will also have scientific value. He will take measurements like Halley did, but with better tools. These measurements are important because the Earth's magnetic field is always changing.
Dr. Clark explains, ""It is common to measure the size of the magnetic field, but not the direction. You need to know true north to measure the direction."" On this trip, they will use satellites to find true north. The British Geological Survey and the United States Navy will provide instruments for the measurements. A Danish satellite will also be taking similar measurements, and Dr. Clark hopes his work will help fill in any gaps in the data.
Halley's journey was very important. It was the first scientific expedition at sea, and Halley was the first civilian to be a naval captain for this kind of work. 
Dr. Clark has the experience to make his trip successful. He spent two years in Antarctica and has worked at the British Geological Survey. He has already sailed the 13,000 kilometers from Rio de Janeiro to England. He plans to complete the expedition in four stages with different crews.
When asked if he is obsessed like Halley, Dr. Clark said, ""I am ready to give up my life for eight months to do this. Some people might think I'm obsessed, but I want to have a good reason to sail across the Atlantic again. Halley and his fascinating life have given me a real sense of purpose."""
CAE_27,C1,"**POWER DRESSING**
Every summer, peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show their beautiful feathers to the peahens. This behavior makes people think about a question that Charles Darwin wondered about: how can birds have such fancy feathers in a world where survival is tough? 
Darwin believed that animals change over time through evolution, not by special creation. He thought that the strongest animals survive and have babies. But he also thought that the peacock's tail was not useful for survival. So, he suggested another idea called ""sexual selection."" This means that female birds choose males based on their beauty.
Darwin's friend, Alfred Russel Wallace, had a different idea. He believed that if peahens liked the males with the most beautiful tails, there must be a good reason for it. The tail might show something important about the male's ability to survive.
Now, 100 years later, scientists are still studying this. At Whipsnade, there are 200 peacocks that live like wild birds but are used to people. Researchers, led by Marion Petrie, want to answer two main questions: Do peahens really choose the males with the most beautiful tails? And do these males have other qualities that help them survive?
The scientists watch the peacocks and peahens closely. They found that peahens do prefer the males with the most eye-spots on their tails. Males with more eye-spots attract more mates. However, it is still unclear if these males are better in other ways.
William Hamilton from Oxford University thinks that male birds with beautiful feathers might be healthier and have fewer parasites. This idea has some support in other bird species, but the researchers have not yet tested this in the peacocks at Whipsnade.
This year, Dr. Petrie is studying the babies of attractive and unattractive males. She wants to see if the babies of the attractive males grow faster and are healthier. If they are, it would support Wallace's idea that females choose males for good reasons.
There is also an interesting idea from a mathematician named R A Fisher. He suggested that if a female chooses a male with a slightly better tail, her sons will have long tails, and her daughters will like long tails too. This could lead to more and more males with long tails over time. This idea shows that females might choose beauty for its own sake, just as Darwin thought."
CAE_66,C1,"**THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS**
Tom Cunliffe says the best boat design should mix old and new ideas. He made this idea real with his own boat, called 'The Westerman'. This week, the Summer Boat Show in London is full of beautiful yachts with new technology. Most of these boats come from a big change in boat design that happened 25 years ago. 
In contrast, my boat is quiet and sits in a tidal creek on the south coast. It was designed last year, but it looks like it is 100 years old. Some people might think I am a romantic for owning it. Maybe I am, but I don’t think so. My boat uses the best parts of old boat design, but it also uses modern technology to make it easier to build.
However, modern technology can sometimes keep sailors away from the real life at sea. Many sailors want to feel the sea and the wind, not just use machines. I don’t think sailors should go back to having a hard life, but I believe that some challenges, like dealing with sails, are part of sailing. 
A boat should feel like a boat, not a big house on the water. When I had my first boat, Hirta, I sailed around Britain for a TV show. The person I bought it from said it had comfort but no luxury. I learned he was right. Hirta had heavy sails and no modern comforts like running water, electricity, or a fridge, but she was easy and kind to sail.
On land, classic boats need a lot of care. When I hurt my back, I knew I had to stop sailing Hirta. I looked for a younger boat but couldn’t find one, so I decided to build a new boat from scratch. 'The Westerman' has never let me down. 
The designer, Nigel Irens, and his assistant, Ed Burnett, are good with computers, but Irens first drew the boat on a paper napkin. Then he made a model like boat builders did in the past. We worked together to improve the design. The final boat is perfect. 
'The Westerman' has crossed the North Atlantic and won four out of six races. It looks timeless, sails beautifully, and feels peaceful inside. This is because it was designed just for sailing, not for extra furniture. 
Made from special wood, it does not take in water. So, it has the good parts of a fiberglass boat but looks and feels like a real boat. This shows that you don’t need to follow trends to be happy, and sometimes it is good to learn from the past."

Health farms and country hotels with spas are very popular now. Five journalists visited some of these places.
**A. HENLOW GRANGE**  
I went to Henlow Grange for six days because I was tired and needed to relax. My room in the big 18th-century house was very comfortable. On the first day, I did nothing and slept a lot. From the second day, I started to join classes like yoga and body conditioning. The teachers were very good. I felt more flexible as the week went on. They have many treatments, like aromatherapy, seaweed baths, manicures, and pedicures. The facial treatment made me feel like a new person. The staff were very friendly and professional. Henlow is planning to make some big changes this year, including a swimming pool. You can also ride bicycles around the grounds. If you want to relax, you can read a magazine or take a walk in the garden. I felt great when I left and I want to go back again. This is a perfect place for busy women. 
**B. SHRUBLAND HALL**  
Shrubland Hall is a calm and relaxing place. When I arrived, I saw a big staircase and a nice library. Everyone gets a medical check-up when they arrive. They check your weight and blood pressure. I felt a bit strange being called a patient because I am healthy. They found a shoulder problem and helped me with it in group and individual sessions. Each person gets a special diet. I lost weight but felt hungry on the second day. My meals included grapefruit for breakfast, salads for lunch, and fruit and yogurt for dinner. If you don’t want to follow a diet, you can eat in the main dining hall, where the food is tasty. You can also have massages or water therapy on different days.
**C. CAREYS MANOR**  
Careys Manor is not a health farm, but it is a nice old manor with cozy fires and a big lounge. If you want to lose weight, you might not enjoy the gourmet food. The French chef makes rich sauces and creamy desserts. The hotel has a gym and a pool to help you stay fit. There is also a spa, steam room, and treatment rooms. I got help for an old shoulder injury from a physiotherapist. Careys is comfortable and relaxing, and there is beautiful countryside to explore.
**D. CLIVEDEN**  
Cliveden is a beautiful country home and a five-star hotel. It treats guests very well. They offer health and beauty treatments, a gym, saunas, a swimming pool, tennis, and horse riding. There are lovely walks and gardens around the estate. The restaurant, Waldo's, has amazing food. I enjoyed my meal, especially the sticky-toffee pudding with banana ice cream. The next morning, I spent time in the gym before my next meal. I had a facial and an aromatherapy massage. Cliveden has many fitness and beauty options if you want them.
**E. SPRINGS HYDRO**  
At Springs Hydro, the best and worst thing is the carrot cake. It is very delicious but has a lot of calories. The second best thing is the aromatherapy massage. I felt so relaxed that I fell asleep during the massage. The place is modern and well-organized, with many therapists and beauty rooms. There are many treatments available, like manicures and facials. The guests are a mix of people, from football teams to friends and families. I would love to visit here every month."
CAE_22,C1,"**NATURAL TALENTS**
In the last seven million years, humans and chimpanzees have changed very little. We are still more than 98% similar to chimps. This means that the differences between humans and animals are very new. Our ability to create art and other things we think are special to humans comes from just a small part of our genes. 
Studies of animal behavior show that many things we thought were only human are also found in animals. For example, chimpanzees use sticks to eat and as tools, and sea otters use rocks to open clams. Monkeys also have a simple form of language with different sounds for different dangers, like 'leopard' or 'snake'. This means that besides art, there are not many clear differences between humans and animals.
But if our ability to create art comes from our genes, why did our ancestors not make art for almost seven million years? The first art might have been wood carvings or body painting, but these materials do not last long. We only have clear evidence of human art from about 35,000 years ago, like cave paintings and musical instruments.
Some people say that human art is different from animal art in three ways: 
1. Human art is not made for a purpose.
2. It is made for beauty and pleasure.
3. It is learned, not instinctive.
First, Oscar Wilde said, ""All art is quite useless."" This means that human art does not help us survive like animal behaviors do. While some human art communicates ideas, it is not the same as passing on genes. Bird songs help birds find mates and protect their territory, which helps them survive.
Second, it seems that only humans create art for beauty. We cannot ask birds if they enjoy their songs, but they mostly sing during mating season, so they might not sing just for fun.
Third, human art is learned. Different human groups have their own art styles. For example, songs in Tokyo are different from songs in Paris. People can learn each other's songs. In contrast, some birds are born knowing how to sing their species' song, even if they have never heard it before.
Human art changes quickly. For example, people can tell when a painting was made just by looking at it. In 1957, two chimpanzees named Congo and Betsy had an art show in London. Congo made many paintings and seemed to enjoy it. Their paintings were sold, which is something many human artists cannot do.
These chimpanzee paintings show that the line between human art and animal behavior is not so clear. Like human art, the chimpanzee paintings were not made for a specific purpose; they were created for the joy of painting. Some might argue that human art is different because it is meant to communicate, while the chimps did not care about sharing their art. However, some famous human art was also made just for the artist's own happiness."
CAE_39,C1,"**An Awfully Big Adventure**
The Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last places on Earth that people have not explored. It is also very dangerous. Charles Blackmore crossed this desert and lived to tell his story.
In the past, stories for children were about brave explorers. These explorers had sunburnt skin and squinted their eyes to see far away. Today, we do not see such heroes in stories or in real life. But then I met Charles Blackmore.
Charles Blackmore led a group to cross the Taklamakan Desert. The name means ""once entered, you never come out,"" but local people call it the Desert of Death. He remembered the dangers and excitement of this amazing journey while sitting in his family home.
His team had four British people (one was a doctor), an American photographer, four Chinese experts, 30 camels, and six camel handlers. It turned out that the camel handlers had never worked with camels before; they were truck drivers. This mistake could have been very dangerous for everyone.
The team set out to cross 1,200 kilometers of the desert. Charles Blackmore wrote a fascinating story about their journey. At that time, he was leaving the Army after 14 years. He wanted to have fun and find out who he really was outside the Army. His wife, Tina, was worried he might not come back because no one had ever crossed that route before.
It took them 59 days to cross the desert, and Charles said the desert was very kind to them. But anyone who reads his story will wonder why he used the word ""kind."" The team faced many problems: they got sick, felt very hot and very cold, and lost some of their water. 
Charles said, ""When we were very tired and the camels had not had water for seven days, we found some. We did not have the famous sandstorms of the Taklamakan. And we did not feel the freezing cold that could have stopped us."" 
They had to fight against many challenges. The fine sand got into their wounds, and climbing the high dunes was hard for both the people and the camels. Charles said, ""What pushed me to keep going was the need to survive. We had no backup plan. We were completely alone in the sandhills.""
He was scared about whether he could finish the trip. On the first day, he sat at the edge of the desert and thought it was so hot he could not breathe. He felt very scared.
After walking 1,000 kilometers, he and his team could not give up. They were very thin but strong. Charles said, ""My legs were like pistons. I could walk over anything.""
In the middle of his story, Charles described lying in the desert and looking at the full moon while thinking of his family. He wondered how hard it was for them. He said, ""Inside me, I am trying to find peace. When I have doubts, I think of the desert and how we did it. I feel prouder of that trip than anything else I have done. But when I think of my family and our happiness, the desert does not compare.""
Has Charles Blackmore found peace? He said, ""I long for the challenge and the open spaces. We felt a strong purpose. Now, it is hard for me to be part of normal life."""

Susan Harr is tired of technology. She decides to unplug her gadgets and enjoy doing things by hand. Many people love technology because it makes life easier. We think we need all these gadgets, but Susan is not so sure. 
One day, her word processor broke. She had to pay a lot of money to fix it. This made her think that gadgets can be more trouble than they are worth. She wonders if we really need technology to save time. Sometimes, it seems like we just use that time to buy more gadgets.
When her word processor started making strange noises, she put it outside. Now, she can take her time doing things by hand. She feels free and enjoys sewing. She used to be scared of electric sewing machines, but now she likes sewing by hand. 
Susan knows there are some gadgets that are helpful, like a washing machine. But she also found joy in not using some gadgets. For example, she returned her color TV and now watches a small black-and-white TV. This helps her spend more time walking her dog, reading, and talking with family.
Sewing by hand is relaxing for Susan. She can listen to the radio or talk with friends while she sews. She feels good sitting by the fire with a cup of tea. She used to think sewing by hand was hard work, but now she finds it enjoyable. 
Doing things by hand helps her slow down and enjoy life more. She also likes washing dishes by hand and daydreaming while she does it. Now, she looks around her house and wonders if she really needs all her gadgets, like the freezer or microwave. She thinks they might not be necessary and that she could save money by not using them."
CAE_62,C1,"'Charles Hurst is a cabinet-maker who makes beautiful furniture. Joanna Watt meets him. When I arrive at his workshop in East London, he shakes my hand quickly and says, ""Well, fire away then!"" He seems busy, and his workshop is full of furniture pieces and wood in many colors. Hurst has been making furniture for ten years and is well-known for his work. He has many orders and does not need to advertise. People say that if you want a good cupboard, table, or bookcase, you should go to Hurst.
It is not hard to find a furniture-maker, but it is harder to find one who makes high-quality furniture. Hurst says, ""There are few real cabinet-makers now. Many people just call themselves furniture-makers."" He is often disappointed with the quality of modern furniture. He does not like cheap, mass-produced furniture and wants to make perfect pieces. This desire for perfection helps him succeed.
Hurst is confident in his skills. He says, ""I have a huge natural ability. I have always been good at making things."" He learned by asking questions and practicing. Most of his work comes from private clients, and some come back for more. He enjoys doing complete projects for their homes. However, he finds it frustrating when clients do not know what they want.
Hurst is also kind and praises others when they deserve it. He says, ""There are people far better than me."" He does not like it when craftsmen take too long to make one piece or when students try to make their work look fashionable. He believes furniture should be useful, not just a statement.
Hurst is confident but also humble. As I leave, he says, ""After all, I am only making furniture."" This shows his down-to-earth attitude towards his work.'"
CAE_49,C1,"**Three Theories About Sleep**
People spend about one-third of their lives sleeping. This shows that sleep is very important. But, scientists do not agree on why we need to sleep. There are three main ideas.
The first idea is that sleep helps our bodies stay healthy. When we sleep, our bodies fix any damage from the day and get ready for the next day.
The second idea is about learning. This idea says that sleep helps us understand and remember what we learned during the day. Without sleep, it would be hard to learn new things.
The third idea is about energy. This idea says we need sleep to recharge our energy. When we sleep, we get ready for the next day and have enough energy to do our activities."
CAE_31,C1,"**ECCENTRICS**
An eccentric is a person who acts differently from most people. They do not follow the usual rules of society. This makes us think, ""What is normal?"" Many of us have our own strange habits. For example, someone might love to enter contests in newspapers, collect beer mats, or write letters to the newspaper about many topics. Being eccentric shows our uniqueness.
Inside us, there is often a struggle between wanting to be ourselves and wanting to fit in. It is like having two trains on the same track, pushing against each other. One train is called individualism (being yourself) and the other is conformity (fitting in). Most of the time, we want to fit in more than we want to be different. We want to be accepted and liked by others.
People with unusual hobbies or strong opinions often find each other. They create clubs and hold meetings to talk about what they enjoy or their problems. They want to be with others who understand them, even if others think their interests are strange. Being in a group can make us feel better.
We all feel a mix of wanting to be ourselves and wanting to fit in. Even when we follow the crowd, we might not like it if someone says we are doing that. For example, a man at a bar might say, ""I say what I think,"" to show he is different. 
Anyone can choose to be more individualistic at any time. Many people succeed in their jobs by being themselves. Bob Dylan, a famous American singer, said, ""When you feel what you are doing and go after it, you will surprise many people."" But being different does not always mean being eccentric. 
For example, if a pop singer wears strange clothes just to get attention, that is not eccentricity. But if they keep doing it until it becomes part of who they are, then they are eccentric. The key to being eccentric is being natural. Eccentrics do not try to be strange; they just are.
True eccentrics do not care much about what others think. They act based on who they are. This makes them different from people who want to impress others or escape from society. Eccentrics live their lives happily, no matter what others think."

She is a small, frail woman, but she has done a lot for environmental issues in Europe after the war. She combined her experiences from different environmental movements into her own strong ideas. When I was a young journalist, she helped me understand everything better. Choosing her book was harder. It could have been ""Only One Earth"" or ""Progress for a Small Planet."" But I think her most important book is ""The Home of Man."" This book talks about the fast growth of cities in the world and important themes she cared about. It is a strong call for what we now call ""sustainable human development."" I have read many books since, but none are as good as this one.

When I read ""Signals for Survival"" by Niko Tinbergen, I can hear the calls of seagulls and remember the smell of their droppings in the sun. This book explains very well, with words and pictures, how animals communicate. If you read ""Signals for Survival"" and then watch a group of seagulls, you will see how their busy activity is actually a well-organized social structure. You can see which birds are partners and recognize families later in the season. Niko Tinbergen was a great scientist who wanted to share his findings with everyone. He worked with a talented wildlife artist, Eric Ennion, to create this book. Eric's paintings show how one gull can be aggressive and how another can be calm. This is the work of a true nature expert.
**C. Lee Durrell**  
The book that has influenced me the most is ""My Family and Other Animals"" by Gerald Durrell. This book not only led me to a wonderful husband but also to a great career in conservation. It made me love the natural world. I was doing research on animal sounds in Madagascar when I first read this book. I had been there for two years and was feeling sad because of many problems. But when I opened ""My Family and Other Animals,"" I felt happy again. The book shows animals and people together, creating a beautiful world worth saving. Some people say humans are bad because of what we have done to nature. But I remember Gerald as a boy in the book, seeing all living things as a family. This is an important idea for everyone to understand.
**D. Bruce Pearson**  
I found ""The Shell Bird Book"" by James Fisher in my school library soon after it was published in 1966. I was immediately attracted to it, especially to the 48 colorful bird pictures by Eric Ennion. These beautiful images caught my attention. I already had other bird books and had spent holidays learning to identify birds. They inspired me to start drawing what I saw. But ""The Shell Bird Book"" had so much more. It included wonderful paintings, chapters about bird migration, the history of birds in Britain, and even a chapter about birds in music and art. This book helped me appreciate birds and nature in a broader way. It showed me that my feelings and creativity about nature are just as important as scientific knowledge. Since art was my stronger subject, I began to see new opportunities for myself."
CAE_37,C1,"**Do Reviews Sell Books?**
We asked five British publishers if book reviews help sell books. Here is what they said.
**Publisher A**  
Reviews are very important for publishers. They look at reviews first in newspapers. A study showed that many people buy a book because of reviews, more than because of ads or displays in shops. Authors feel sad when there are no reviews. Publishers also feel bad about bad reviews, but they think any review is good because it gets people talking about the book. Sometimes, both good and bad reviews can help sell books because readers want to see for themselves. Publishers like reviews that match their own feelings about a book.
**Publisher B**  
Publishers and newspapers both want good book reviews, but they have different needs. Newspapers want to entertain their readers, while publishers want their books to be reviewed well. Book reviews are better now than 40 years ago, but many paperback books still do not get enough attention. Publishers need reviews to help readers find out about books and authors. A good review from a trusted source can really help sell a book.
**Publisher C**  
Reviews are very important for publishing. Without them, we would struggle. Many of the books we publish are not by famous authors, so we rely on reviews to help sell them. Good reviews are often more valuable than ads because they show the reader that the review is honest. Publishers say they want big reviews, but the real effect of reviews on sales is hard to understand. Good reviews can help a book and an author become popular, but they need help from other things like recommendations and good marketing.
**Publisher D**  
I am not sure how publishing and reviewing work together in Britain. In the United States, a single review can make or break a book. In Britain, bookshops often do not pay much attention to reviews. Sometimes, it takes many years of good reviews for people to notice a good writer. Some books that get bad reviews still sell very well. It is hard to predict what will happen. Non-fiction books allow reviewers to talk more about the subject than the book itself.
**Publisher E**  
All publishers and writers want great reviews. But do they help sell books? I once published a biography that got great reviews, but it did not sell well because people thought they could just read the reviews instead of buying the book. Does the name of the reviewer matter? Thirty years ago, if certain reviewers liked a book, people listened. Now, sometimes an unexpected reviewer or a clever review can make people want to buy the book."
CAE_2,C1,"**WEATHERVANE MAKER**
Making weathervanes is an old skill that started in ancient Egypt. Today, Graham Smith continues this craft in his workshop. He is one of the few people in the country who makes weathervanes by hand. Graham creates special designs for his customers. He says, ""This way, I can make a unique gift."" Many of his customers are women who want to buy special presents for their husbands. They look for gifts that show the man's job or hobbies.
Graham's first weathervane was not a cockerel, which is the most common design. It was a witch on a broomstick. His friends liked it and asked him to make weathervanes for them. He realized he could make many different designs. So, he decided to start a weathervane business.
Before this, Graham worked as a precision engineer for 15 years. Then, he and his wife, Liz, changed their roles. Liz went to work, and Graham stayed home to take care of their children and grow the business. This was five years ago, and he is happy with his choice. He says, ""My old job was not creative, but this work is exciting and artistic. I love designing.""
Graham has made over 100 original designs. He pays attention to detail and always asks the customer to approve the design before he starts cutting it by hand. He also keeps some traditional designs because they are still popular. Graham believes people like handmade items because they are different.
He does not want to grow his business too much because he wants to keep it as a rural craft. He says, ""I have found my place in the market. People enjoy unique items, and I feel good when I see a simple shape become something special.""
For many years, weathervanes have helped people understand the weather by showing changes in the wind. Now, more people are moving to the countryside and want to add special touches to their homes. This has helped crafts like Graham's.
Graham is now very busy, sending weathervanes to customers all over the world. He has many buyers from America and Denmark. He explains that the price depends on how detailed the design is. His latest request was for a weathervane shaped like a curly-coated dog. No matter the occasion, Graham can create a special gift."
CAE_68,C1,"**Beginner Takes All**
Before it was published, *The Horse Whisperer* was the most talked-about book of the year. It is the first novel by British writer Nicholas Evans, and it made him a lot of money. He shares his story about how he got inspired and became successful.
At the start of the year, Nicholas Evans was not doing well. A film he had been working on called *Life and Limb* fell apart very quickly. He was sad and worried because he had not earned money for two years. He needed that film to help him with his bank problems. A smart person in his situation would have found a job. He could have gone back to working in television. But instead, he did something many people would think was crazy. He bought a ticket to America to research his first novel for three months.
Nicholas had an idea for his story from a farrier he met while visiting a friend. The farrier told him about a calm horse that suddenly became very wild. The owners were worried until they heard about a gypsy who could calm the horse just by talking to it. These special people are called ""horse whisperers."" This story inspired Nicholas. He wanted to write a movie about it, but after his film project failed, he decided to write a book instead.
During the spring, he drove around the US, visiting ranches and learning about horses and the people who work with them. He felt alone and worried about his life. He had tried for ten years to be a filmmaker, but now he was in debt and unsure how to support his family.
By the end of August, he returned home and had written the first half of the book. His bank manager was becoming very strict, and he needed to know if he should continue writing. He showed his work to a friend who was a literary agent. The friend said it was ""fine"" and thought Nicholas could get $30,000 for the book. Nicholas needed more money to pay off his debts. He had spent seven months on *The Horse Whisperer* and still had two months of work left.
In October, he sent the first two hundred pages of his book to seven publishers in the UK. Soon, his agent called to say that they had turned down the first offer of $75,000. Nicholas was shocked. His agent felt something good was going to happen.
A week later, after a lot of interest, the book was sold for $550,000 in the UK and $3.15 million in the US. These were record amounts for a first novel. Nicholas and his team could not believe it. They had not even sent the book to New York, but soon major film studios wanted to make a movie from it.
Nicholas was surprised when his agent said they could get $3 million for the movie rights. He and his team laughed in disbelief. That October night, four famous filmmakers called him one after the other, asking to pay $3 million for his unfinished book.
Nicholas shared this story while we drank coffee on his porch at home. He said he turned down an offer to write the movie script for *The Horse Whisperer*. He felt it was like a fairy tale and did not want to ruin it. Writing for movies is hard work, and he did not want to be just an employee. He wanted to stay involved but keep some distance.
The success of his novel also brought new interest in making *Life and Limb*, but now he was not sure if he wanted to do that. He said, ""I think I would be foolish not to write another novel."""
CAE_23,C1,"**Young Masters**
Bobby Fischer is trying to come back to chess, but he is not as young as before. Chess is now a game for younger players. After being away from chess for 20 years, Bobby Fischer is playing against his old rival, Boris Spassky. Fischer won the first game, and it was a great game. But he is now 49 years old, not in good shape, and not used to playing. Spassky is also older.
Chess has changed a lot in the last 20 years. Bobby Fischer helped make chess popular, and now there are many professional players. Today, the main goal for players is to win. In international chess, a player needs to be strong mentally and physically. The game is very intense. Players have a chess clock to make sure they finish their moves in time. If they do not, they lose the game. Now, games can last longer, and players often do not take breaks. This makes it harder for older players.
In the last 30 years, every new world champion has been younger than the last. Most of the top ten players in the world are under 30. The way chess is played has also changed. Many players prepare before their matches. Computers help players study many games and find weaknesses in their opponents. In one recent match, players had teams of helpers looking for mistakes in each other’s games. The start of a chess game is very important, and being well-prepared can decide the winner.
Today, there are more great chess players than ever before. Many grandmasters compete for small prizes around the world. Playing chess is hard work. A game can last up to eight hours, and players must stay focused. If they lose concentration, they can lose the game. The chess clock adds to the pressure. At the end of a game, players often rush to make their moves in a “time scramble.” They have only a few seconds to move, and it can be very stressful.
For top players, losing is very painful. Winning feels great, but one win is not enough to win a tournament. Players must be ready to compete again the next day. Most chess tournaments last 9 to 11 days, with games every day. World championship matches are even harder. In 1984, a match between Anatoli Karpov and Gary Kasparov had to stop after several months because both players were too tired. Karpov lost a lot of weight during the match.
Can Bobby Fischer succeed again? He once said, ""All I want to do is play chess."" This makes his long break from chess surprising. If he is back for the money, he will earn a lot. No matter what happens in his match with Spassky, they will both make millions of dollars. But if Fischer believes he can still be the best player, he might be very disappointed in the end."
CAE_60,C1,"**Fame and Fortune**
Imogen Edwards-Jones talks to some new British talents, from poets to pop stars, who are becoming famous.
**A** Nick Grosso is a man in his early 30s. He has written three plays that many people like. Now, he is turning his first play, called *Peaches*, into a movie script. He says, ""It is a low budget, but I don’t know how low. It will not be over £30 million, but it could be £30."" Nick is very talented, but the surprising thing is that before he wrote *Peaches*, he had never been to a play or read one. He says, ""When I wrote the play, I never thought it would be performed. It is set in a car. I probably wouldn’t do that now because I know it is hard to do."" He left school at 16 but went back a year later. After finishing A-levels, he joined the Young People's Theatre. He realized he wanted to write for actors. He wanted people to hear his writing because of its rhythm and rhyme. He says, ""I was finally with people who thought like me. It was the first time I enjoyed learning.""
**B** Simon Pegg is 28 years old and has worked hard in his career since studying drama at Bristol University. He is now writing a comedy series for television and has just finished a tough tour with comedian Steve Coogan. Simon has always worked hard. Even in Bristol, he practiced his comedy in clubs. He remembers, ""University was very theoretical. I realized I didn’t want to be a serious actor; I was more interested in comedy. People think comedy is the hardest job, but it isn’t. If you have courage and good material, it is great to make people laugh."" He has worked with the comedy group Funny Business, but his best work has been with Steve Coogan. Simon says, ""He saw my show, and I was a big fan of his. He could see I was copying him.""
**C** Ciaran McMenamin is 24 years old. He became famous when he danced on TV in the show *The Young Person's Guide To Becoming A Rock Star*. People liked his performance, and now he can choose what work he wants to do. He says, ""It has been a great chance for me. I can pick and choose what I do, which is what I always wanted."" Ciaran has only just finished school, but he has been acting for a long time. His mother encouraged him to act, and he went from school plays to the Ulster Youth Theatre for four years. He laughs and says, ""I used acting to avoid doing homework. But then I decided I wanted to be serious about it because I loved it."" Now, he is waiting for more praise, but he thinks about fame and says, ""When you are 18, you think you will love the photos and interviews, but you realize it is not why you act. It is about getting respect for good work.""
**D** Neil Taylor is 25 years old and is the lead singer of the pop band Matrix. They have just signed a deal to make three albums. Neil and his bandmate, Rick Brown, are expected to be very popular when their single, *Chimera*, comes out soon. Neil says, ""The record company has different ideas about success than I do. They want a big hit, but I just want two people to buy it."" Neil has worked hard for his success. He left school at 16 and tried to get into music for many years. He says, ""It is funny how things happen. I was doing student gigs for eight years and was about to give up when I met Rick Brown, who had connections in the music industry."" This meeting was very important for him. He says, ""There were times when I was very sad, and I was in some bad bands. But I hope it will all be worth it.""
**E** Stephen Richards is 27 years old and has won many awards for his poetry. He is well-known in the poetry world and has been giving readings for six years. His first novel, *Hidden*, will be published in March. He says, ""It is a story about obsessive love. It was a strong idea that I could not write as a poem."" Stephen loved creative writing in school but later did not like school. He decided not to go to university but later got bored with a job at a theatre and changed his mind. After university, he published his first book, a children's book, in 1992. He says, ""My parents did not think I would be a writer; they thought I would just read because that is all I did as a child."" Now, with his poetry being praised, he is brave to write novels. He explains, ""Poetry has a structure, but a novel can be any length. There are more chances to write bad words. My main goal is to not just write a lot without caring about quality."""

Isabel wants to find the right man, but she worries that her knees are not nice enough. Still, she has hope, which helps her and others in the story. The author writes in a fun and lively way, using chapter titles like ""Our Hero Feels Inspired.""
B. This story is about a local radio station in America. It is told from the view of a smart child named Francis With. Francis works for WLT Radio, which was started by two men, Roy and Ray, to promote their sandwich shop. The station plays music and has different people talking. The author uses humor and simple writing to take readers back to the 1940s and 1950s, a time of old stores and classic cars.
C. In this story, a second husband talks to his wife's first husband. Richard Vaisey, a professor, falls in love with a Russian poet. The poet writes bad poetry, which makes Richard feel guilty. She also wants his help for her brother, who is in prison. The author tells this story in a funny and clever way, making it enjoyable to read.
D. In 1960s London, two sets of best friends, two women and two men, are connected for 25 years. At the start of the story, James Hudson, a rich American, is starting a newspaper with his friend Richard Blake. This is important, but so is the fact that a woman they both loved was killed years ago. The story has murder, love, and jealousy, and the writing is good. It is a long book where you can really get to know the characters.
E. This story is written by a great American author. It is about Ian Bedloe, who feels guilty about something he did. To make up for it, he takes care of his brother's three orphaned children. At 40, he is becoming a strange bachelor. The story shows the strong bond he forms with the youngest child, Daphne. It is a warm and funny book that balances sadness and laughter."
CAE_53,C1,"**Volunteer Tourism**
Four writers talk about international volunteer work.
A. It is hard to say that volunteer work helps a lot. Volunteer tourists can help build homes or schools, but they usually pay a lot of money to do this work. If this money went directly to a local community, it could pay for more help than one volunteer can give. This is especially true for gap years, where volunteers often do not need special skills or experience. Many studies ask if young people volunteer to help others or if they want to improve their own careers. However, these projects can help people learn to act kindly towards those who have less.
B. Volunteering can help people understand each other better. It can also help solve problems and create connections between people from different countries. When this happens, both the volunteers and the communities they help can benefit. But if only rich people can volunteer, it may help them in their careers but not help the communities that need it most. Volunteers may use their experiences to get ahead in life.
C. Sometimes, international volunteering can be seen as a way for rich people to feel good about themselves without really helping. It can also be a way to give real help to communities. At its best, volunteering can help both the volunteers and the communities. It can also make people more aware of the problems of poverty and injustice in the world.
D. Volunteer tourism fits with the idea of helping others. This idea can seem good, especially when people do not trust big governments or businesses. However, it can also ignore the need for real change in poor communities. While volunteering is often a good thing, when it is sold as a way to help develop communities, it can make people forget about the real issues of poverty and inequality in the world."
CAE_55,C1,"**Sound the Alarm**
Stuart Harris reports
Many people listen to the radio in the morning. Most of us need an alarm to help us get out of bed. This is why we have clock radios. But how do you choose a good one?
A group of us, including the inventor Tom Granger and broadcaster Paul Bridges, tested five clock radios. One model has a 'dual alarm function'. This means you can set two different wake-up times, one for work days and one for weekends. But who really needs two alarms? This model costs about the same as another one we tested. It has a cassette player, so you can listen to your own music and wake up to a quiet morning. We all liked the radio quality, but it is very big, like a rugby ball. Paul Bridges said, ""I need space on my bedside table for my keys, wallet, glasses, and phone. I always book a wake-up call just in case the alarm doesn’t work.""
This model was voted the best. Paul Bridges loved it, but the clock sometimes got stuck at 4:00 PM. I liked the digital display with nice grey numbers on a soft green background. The snooze button is wide, so you can hit it easily when you are still half asleep. However, the buttons felt nice to touch, and I ended up pressing them too much, which made it hard to understand the instruction booklet.
The clock has a backup battery, so you don’t have to reset it if the power goes out. We all liked this feature. But setting it up was tricky. Tom Granger thought another model with a built-in lamp was poorly made. He had to read the instructions twice to get it to work. The light was hard to adjust, and you couldn’t read by it.
Paul Bridges found the lamp funny but agreed that tuning the radio was difficult. The buzzer sounded like a submarine alarm, which made me want to throw it across the room. Still, this model is very popular with young people because it looks bright and fun. Tom Granger said, ""I would choose this one because it stands out."" This model was the easiest to set up without reading the instructions. But the alarm could go off 10 minutes early or late, which Paul Bridges thought was silly. He said this model was ""very annoying"" and ""useless.""
The simplest and cheapest model was liked by Tom Granger because it was small and easy to use. It has old-fashioned dial tuning, which is easier to set up. He said, ""With modern buttons, you are never sure if you pressed them right."" We all agreed that the radio quality was good. The buzzer on this model worked well; it got me out of bed in just two beeps!"
CAE_50,C1,"Hedgehogs
A hedgehog is a small animal with sharp spines on its body. You can find hedgehogs in many parts of the world, but they are not in America or Australia. All hedgehogs can roll into a tight ball when they are in danger. Their spines point outwards to protect them. How well this works depends on how many spines the hedgehog has.
Some hedgehogs that live in the desert have fewer spines. They are more likely to run away from danger instead of rolling into a ball. Hedgehogs are mostly active at night and sleep during the day. They like to sleep under bushes or in holes in the ground. 
All hedgehogs can hibernate, which means they can sleep for a long time in winter. But not all hedgehogs do this. Some will stay awake all year if the weather is good."
CAE_25,C1,"**Great Sportswomen Winning Awards**
It is hard to be good at any sport, even for men, but women have to work even harder. Training and competitions take a lot of time, so they must make sacrifices. Despite this, they are proving people wrong and breaking records. Here are some amazing British sportswomen who are reaching their goals.
A. **Jill, 27, Skier**  
""I love skiing! It feels great to jump in the air and land safely, but it can be scary. Sometimes I don’t feel well or the weather is bad, but I keep going. I train for ten months each year, so I don’t have much time for friends. There are six men and three women on the British team, and we all compete together.""
B. **Caroline, 22, Cyclist**  
""Two years ago, I borrowed a bike for a charity race and I won! I was surprised because I had never cycled before. Now, I earn good money as a professional cyclist. I train for at least four hours every day, plus I do some stretching, swimming, and running. My boyfriend is also a cyclist, so he understands how much time it takes.""
C. **Annabel, 26, Rower**  
""Rowing is hard for girls because not many schools have rowing teams. Most girls start when they are 19 or 20, which makes it harder to compete internationally. We often have new coaches, so it can be confusing. But I enjoy it and like being fit, plus I have fun with my teammates.""
D. **Ffyona, 24, Long Distance Walker**  
""When I was 13, I wanted to walk around the world. I didn’t know how big it was! Walking across Australia was very painful. I walked 50 miles a day with little sleep and many blisters on my feet. But I set a record! Some people think women are less likely to succeed, so it is harder to get sponsors.""
E. **Lisa, 26, Saloon Car Racer**  
""Some men think they are better drivers. When I do well, they ignore me. Being a woman in racing can be tough. Men often want to beat me, and I have had many accidents. It is hard to earn money, and I spend what I make on racing. More women are starting to race now, which is great!""
F. **Alison, 28, Triathlete**  
""I wake up at 5:30 AM three days a week to swim. I need to sleep more on other days. In the evenings, I cycle or run. Sometimes I feel very tired! Racing is exciting, but it can be stressful. Men and women usually compete together, but the news often talks more about the men. The prize money for women is not as good, but we are working to change that."""
CAE_34,C1,"**The Day I Met Picasso**
Richard Cork remembers the day he met Picasso. He was 78 years old and saw Picasso while he was eating lunch at a restaurant in Cannes. Even from far away, Picasso was easy to recognize. 
At that time, I was an 18-year-old student. I was traveling around Europe and Morocco in an old van. I had run out of money, so I found a job painting boats. But I spent a lot of time drawing. I was lucky to have my sketchbook with me when I saw Picasso.
Picasso was known to stay away from people and work in the hills. So, I was surprised to see him sitting at a table with his wife and friends. I was nervous, but I asked him for his signature. To my surprise, he agreed. He wrote his name on my paper and then drew some lines on it. The lines might have looked like clouds or waves in the sea.
I thanked him and tried to talk to him. Picasso did not speak much English, and I did not speak much French. An American woman at the table helped us talk. She called him ""the Maestro,"" which made it hard for me to speak. But I told Picasso that I loved art and admired his work.
After a while, I went back to my boat and showed my friend the signature. He asked, ""Is that all?"" He told me to go back and talk to Picasso again. So, I took my sketchbook and returned to Picasso's table. I didn’t ask if I could draw his portrait because I was afraid he would say no. Instead, I just started to draw.
When Picasso saw me drawing, he smiled and made funny faces to distract me. He rolled his eyes and stuck out his tongue. It was hard to draw him, but I felt like he wanted to see how determined I was. After a few minutes, he stopped making faces and let me draw him quietly.
I noticed how strong and alert he looked, wearing a blue-and-white striped shirt. He looked much younger than 84 years old. His dark eyes were very bright and full of life. Even though he was with friends, he seemed to be in his own world, quietly thinking.
The American woman told me that Picasso wanted to see my drawing. I felt shy and said it wasn’t good enough. But Picasso insisted, so I showed him my sketch. He nodded and then said it was his turn to draw. I quickly gave him my crayon, and he drew a face in just a few seconds. His drawing was very different from mine. He made my eye look like it was on my nose and drew my smile with one quick line.
I looked like a character from one of his fun drawings. I thanked Picasso and asked him to sign my drawing. The American woman said he said I already had his signature. So, he didn’t want to give me another one. 
I think back to that day and feel very lucky. Meeting Picasso and having his attention meant a lot to me."
CAE_12,C1,"**Shopping Tricks**
Have you ever gone into a store and bought more than you planned? Here are some tricks that shops use to make you spend more money.
**A. Freshness First**  
Supermarkets know that people like fresh food. They often put fruits and vegetables at the entrance of the store. They might also have a bakery that makes the smell of fresh bread fill the store. The colors in the store, like green, can make you think of fresh food. But most of what supermarkets sell, like frozen food and cleaning products, is not fresh.
**B. Smart Placement**  
Where products are placed in the store is very important. Supermarkets use computers to find out where shoppers look for items the most. They put popular products in these places. Items at eye level are more likely to be bought. Special offers in big bins can also attract shoppers. Sometimes, stores place items that go well together, like ice cream and dessert toppings, near each other.
**C. Spreading Essentials**  
Supermarkets often place basic items like bread, tea, and sugar far from the entrance. This way, shoppers have to walk past other tempting products. Stores may also put popular items far away, hoping that loyal customers will look for them and see other products on the way.
**D. Less is More**  
Some chain stores have changed how they display their products. For example, Next stores show fewer clothes on the shelves, making them seem special. Even though they sell many clothes, their store design makes them look unique.
**E. Total Costs**  
Shoppers often care more about the total cost of their shopping than the price of each item. Supermarkets mix cheap and expensive items to attract customers. They sometimes sell basic items at a loss to bring people in, which is called ""loss leaders."" They also get discounts from manufacturers by buying in large amounts.
**F. Price Tags Matter**  
In chain stores, shoppers usually buy fewer items and pay more attention to prices. For example, pricing a blouse at £14.99 instead of £15 can make a difference. This also helps reduce theft because staff must ring up sales to give change.
**G. Lighting**  
Both supermarkets and chain stores think carefully about lighting. Chain stores try to use natural light so shoppers can see the true colors of clothes. Supermarkets use special lights to make fresh fruits and vegetables look better.
**H. Store Layout**  
Many chain stores use different carpets to guide shoppers. One pattern shows the paths through the store, and another shows sales areas. This helps shoppers move through the store, but some may not want to explore the sales areas.
**I. In-Store Ads**  
When you enter a supermarket, you often see big pictures of delicious food. In some places, supermarkets are trying out ""video trolleys"" that show ads while you shop. These trolleys aim to catch the attention of shoppers and can increase sales by about 30%."
CAE_26,C1,"**Sea, Ice & Rock**
Chris Bonnington is a famous mountaineer. He is 58 years old and is best known for climbing Mount Everest in 1985. He has also made new climbing paths in Britain and the Alps. Chris has written many books, like ""Quest for Adventure"" and ""Everest the Hard Way.""
Robin Knox-Johnston is 53 years old. He started his career at sea in the Merchant Navy. In 1968-1969, he was the first person to sail around the world alone in his boat called Sunhaili. He also set a record for sailing from New York to England in just 10 days.
Chris and Robin worked together to sail and climb in Greenland. They wrote a book about their trip called ""Sea, Ice and Rock."" In 1979, Chris was working on ""Quest for Adventure."" He called Robin for an interview, and Robin invited him to go sailing. Chris could teach Robin some climbing skills, and Robin could teach Chris about sailing. This was Chris's first time on a yacht.
They sailed for a while and then stopped. Robin's wife and daughter stayed on the boat while Chris and Robin went to the shore to practice climbing. The climb was hard, but Chris was impressed with how steady Robin was. When they reached a big drop, Chris asked Robin if he had ever climbed before. Robin had not, so Chris showed him how to do it. Robin wanted to climb down using ropes like on his boat, but Chris wanted him to use his legs. Robin did it safely, but Chris felt a bit worried.
During this trip, Chris and Robin became good friends. Robin suggested they go on a bigger trip to Greenland together. Robin was a good leader. He asked everyone for their opinions before making decisions. Chris found sailing boring and hard. He liked being on land more than being at sea. Robin, however, loved sailing and fixing things on the boat.
When they reached Greenland, Chris had to lead the climbing expedition. He felt nervous about keeping Robin safe. Climbing the highest mountain in Greenland, called the Cathedral, was very hard. They tried to reach the top for 24 hours. On the way down, they were very tired and almost fell asleep on steep slopes. Robin trusted Chris and followed him. When it became too difficult, they decided to turn back. Robin was also worried about their boat and if it would be okay.
The only time they had a problem was on the way home. They took turns watching the boat. Chris was supposed to wake up at 4 am, but Robin did not wake him. Robin thought he could handle it alone. Chris felt that Robin did not trust him, and he told him so. Robin quickly reassured Chris that he was wrong to think that.
They enjoyed their trip to Skye, but they really got to know each other during the Greenland expedition. Chris learned that Robin was a kind and sensitive person, even if he seemed tough on the outside."
CAE_8,C1,"**A Simple History of the Apple**
Apples have been around for a very long time. They come in many colors, shapes, and sizes. But today, we might lose some of the old types of apples.
**Early Apples (8,000 BC)**  
People have eaten apples since ancient times. In Britain, they threw away apple seeds. About 10,000 years ago, people left apple parts near lakes in Switzerland and Italy. In these places, ancient people stored wild apples for winter. These apples were small and different from the apples we eat today.
**Learning from the Normans (1000 AD)**  
The French learned how to grow fruit from the Romans. They brought this knowledge to Britain. Some apples, like the dessert apple called Decio, came from the Romans. But many Roman apples did not grow well in Britain. British monks started to grow new types of apples.
**Popular Apples in the Middle Ages (1200)**  
In the 1200s, many apple types became popular in Britain. The Old English Pearmain was a common dessert apple. The Costard was a cooking apple sold in markets. But bad weather and diseases made it hard to grow apples, so people started to import them. In the 1500s, King Henry VIII sent a man to France to learn more about growing apples. This man brought back many new apple types.
**Apples in New Lands (1750)**  
By the 1600s, apples were very popular in Britain. When people moved to Canada, Australia, the US, South Africa, and New Zealand, they took apples with them. Captain Bligh took apples to Australia, and the Pilgrim Fathers took them to America. A man named Johnny Appleseed planted many apple trees in North America and became famous for it.
**New Apples (1850)**  
In Iowa, a farmer named Jesse Hiatt found a new type of apple from a dead tree. He named it 'Hawkey'. At a fruit show, a judge tasted it and said it was 'Delicious'. This apple became very popular. 
Another famous apple, the Granny Smith, was found in Australia by Maria Anne Smith. She worked hard on her family’s farm and discovered a small tree growing from old fruit. She took care of it, and soon it produced green apples that became famous.
**Modern Apples (1950)**  
Today, apples are grown all over the world. However, most apples come from just a few types that are chosen for their looks and how well they travel, not for their taste. Many old apple types are disappearing. In the UK, some gardeners keep old apples alive, but in the US, many types are lost forever. People want more variety in apples. We should all help to keep different types of apples safe for everyone."

CAE_30,C1,"Richard Nerurkar is a long-distance runner from Britain. He is one of the best 10,000-metre runners in his country. He visits a training camp in Kenya, which is ten miles south of the equator. There is a mountain path that starts from a quiet road in Nairobi. This path leads to Mount Kenya, the highest mountain in Kenya. The place is called Nanyuk, and it has been Richard's training base for three years. 
On his fourth trip to Kenya, Richard decided to train with Kenyan runners. He ran in his first race in Kenya, where the air has less oxygen. He stayed at the national team training camp, where the best Kenyan runners prepare for competitions. Richard was invited by the national team coach after he finished fifth in the World Championship 10,000 meters race.
Training at high altitude helps runners because it makes more red blood cells, which helps carry oxygen. Many Kenyan runners have been successful because of this. Richard's first race in Africa was in Nairobi. It was the first international cross-country race in Africa. He finished behind 41 runners, most of whom were Kenyan. He felt he ran well, but he knew that Kenyan runners are not just successful because of the altitude. They have a simple and relaxed way of running and enjoy competing.
Richard learned how Kenyan runners train at their camp. The camp is at St Mark's College, 6,200 feet up Mount Kenya. The athletes live with regular students in simple rooms. Their daily routine includes three workouts: a morning run, interval training in the middle of the day, and a steady run in the afternoon. They start their day at six in the morning. The coach tells them to run easy because they have a hard day ahead. They run about 40 kilometers each day, except on Sundays when they run 20 kilometers.
Life at the camp is simple. They wash their faces and brush their teeth before breakfast. Breakfast is tea, bread, and boiled eggs. Lunch and dinner are similar, with ugali (a maize dish), stew, cabbage or spinach, and tea. After running, they drive to a stream to wash off in the evening.
By the end of his stay, Richard understood more about why Kenyan runners are so successful. It is not just because of their genes or the altitude. He thought that the simple life in the mountains, hard training, and their love for running are important reasons for Kenya's success in long-distance running."
CAE_7,C1,"The Problems of Advertising**
Many people know that advertising is not doing well. This is not just because of the economy. Advertising started to go down in 1989, before the economy got bad. The problems with advertising are serious and happen all over the world. 
Advertising has not changed with the economy. Advertisers think about big groups of people and big media, but now there are many brands and types of media. Because of this, the groups of people they want to reach are smaller. Even big brands should try to reach smaller groups, but they usually do not.
Think about your shopping. When you go to a supermarket, you might buy 30, 40, or even 50 items. Most of these items are not from advertised brands. You might buy a few brands that you see in ads, but you will not buy many different brands in a year. You might only buy about 400 different brands in a year, even though there are many more brands advertised.
For example, there are about 32,500 brands and services that are advertised. But most people only buy a small number of them. This means that a lot of advertising is not effective. When you watch TV, count how many ads are for brands you buy. Most people find that they only buy about 1 out of every 16 brands they see in ads.
Many people think they are different and that they do not pay attention to ads. But the truth is, most people do not buy the brands they see advertised. There is always waste in advertising because not everyone will buy the products they see. 
Even though advertising can be expensive, it can still work. Advertisers need to reach many people to find the few who will buy their products. They cannot know in advance who will respond to their ads. 
With better targeting, advertisers can reach more people who will respond, but they can never know for sure who will buy. This is different from selling face-to-face, where a salesperson can talk to each person directly. 
If an advertiser can get one million new customers, that is a good result. For many products, getting just 2% of the population to buy is a big success. To make advertising work better, it needs to be more focused on the right people."
CAE_43,C1,"
Charles Clover visits a very eco-friendly home in Southwell, Nottinghamshire. This town has some interesting places. One is Southwell Minster, a little-known old cathedral. It has special carvings of 'green' men made by craftsmen in the 1200s. The second surprise is the 'autonomous house,' built by Robert and Brenda Vale. 
The Vales use rainwater for washing and drinking. They recycle their waste into compost for their garden. They also heat their home using heat from their appliances and their own bodies, along with their three teenage children and two cats, Edison and Faraday. The house looks traditional with a clay tile roof and is located 300 yards from the Minster. It was designed to match the old buildings in the town and was approved by planners.
When you ring the solar-powered doorbell, it is very quiet inside. The house is well-insulated with special windows, so you cannot hear anything. Inside, it is calm and peaceful. On a sunny summer day, the windows are closed, and the conservatory warms the air before it goes into the house. Robert opens special windows to let in fresh air. They have made sure there are no drafts, even for their cats.
The Vales teach architecture at Nottingham University and have cared about the environment for a long time. They wrote a book about green architecture in the 1970s called The Autonomous House. They wanted to build a house that does not produce carbon dioxide. They also decided to not use mains water. They created special toilets and have rainwater tanks in the cellar. They use copper gutters to keep the drinking water clean, which they filter before using. Water from washing goes into the garden, and they do not use a dishwasher because they think strong detergents are bad for the environment.
Robert says they want to show that it is possible to build a house that is good for the environment without living in darkness. The only old-fashioned part of the house is the hall, which has a fireplace and a staircase that goes up to the top. The Vales do not pay for water, and last winter, they used only nine units of electricity a day, which costs about 70p. This is much less than what other four-bedroom houses use.
Soon, they will add solar panels to generate more electricity. The house will still use some electricity from the mains for cooking and appliances, but it will make extra electricity. One day, they hope to charge an electric car with it. The only heating is a small wood stove in the hall, which they only use when it is very cold. 
When Charles visited in February, Robert said it was too warm to light the fire. The temperature was 18C, which is lower than usual, but Robert said it felt comfortable because there were no drafts. He explained that people in the past were comfortable at lower temperatures because of their warm clothing. 
The house is simple and easy to maintain. Most materials were bought from local shops and installed by local workers, making it cheap to build. It cost the same as low-cost rental housing. Because of this, big building companies do not like this idea."
CAE_51,C1,"'The Camera Never Lies
Arthur Conan Doyle was the writer of the Sherlock Holmes stories. He thought he was a rational man and a scientist. In 1920, he saw photographs of fairies in a garden. He believed these photos were proof that fairies really existed. He published the photos with an article, saying fairies are wonderful creatures.
In 1939, the two women who took the photos said they were fake. They cut out pictures of fairies from a book and placed them among flowers. The photos looked very nice, but the trick was simple. This goes against a common idea that cameras always show the truth. 
Today, we can use computer programs to change our digital photos. It is a myth that photography has always been completely honest. From the beginning, when cameras started taking pictures, the reality was changed.'"
CAE_11,C1,"**Blacksmiths**
For a long time, iron has been very important to people, and blacksmiths, who work with iron, have been seen as more than just skilled workers. Before the Industrial Revolution, blacksmiths were as respected as doctors and astrologers because they made weapons, armor, and farming tools. They were also seen as artists. In the 1700s, blacksmiths created beautiful ironwork for places like St Paul's Cathedral. The lovely metalwork in French and Belgian buildings was also made by talented blacksmiths.
However, by the late 1960s, there were not many blacksmiths left in Britain because heavy industry did not need them anymore. Modern architects often did not use beautiful ironwork like handrails. In the last 10 years, there has been a small comeback for blacksmiths because more people are interested in decorative buildings and new styles of interior design. Still, much of the work looks similar, with many companies calling their products ""classical"" or ""Victorian-style."" You can find many trendy stores selling rusty candlesticks with extra pieces.
Fortunately, there are new events to support blacksmiths. The first event is an exhibition of ironwork by members of the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA). It opened last week at the Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey. Alan Dawson, the secretary of BABA, says, ""We might be starting a new Iron Age because both the public and blacksmiths are seeing things differently now."" Power tools have made it easier for blacksmiths to work with metal. They can now bend, twist, and weld metal more easily. Dawson says, ""These artists can now use metal to show their creativity.""
About 250 pieces of work are in the show, including bookends and a spiral staircase. Prices start at £90 and can go much higher. Most of the money will go to the artists, but some will be kept by the Association to help promote good ironwork. Dawson has made an eight-foot gate and a lamp with a glass shade. He says, ""My style comes from letting steel bend and shape when it is hot. It’s like drawing with metal.""
Many artists love working with iron. Unlike other metals, iron is hard and strong. Susan May, a jeweler, says, ""It’s magical because it is soft when hot, but when it cools, it becomes hard again."" Ann Catrin Evans makes door knockers and handles that look like they belong in scary castles. One design looks like a ball and chain, and another looks like a Celtic cross. She says, ""I love that steel is cold and hard, and it feels like it will last forever."" Iron has given people a lot of beauty and a sense of safety. It is likely that iron will be used for decoration for many years to come, as long as we do not have to see any more rusty candlesticks!"
CAE_14,C1,"**The Day I Stopped Smoking**
I thought my friends would be happy when I stopped smoking, but one of my coworkers was very angry. She asked, ""What do you mean? If it was easy, why didn’t you stop before?"" I found it hard to explain how I went from smoking a lot every day to not smoking at all in just a few hours. 
Two months and three weeks ago, I went to a stop-smoking session. I did not plan to stop smoking, and I did not really want to. I felt pressure from people who do not like smoking, and I still feel that way. I also have low blood pressure and a healthy family. I did not feel sick or cough like some of my friends who try to be very healthy.
On that Thursday afternoon, I went to the session in Birmingham to write an article about people trying to quit smoking. I said, ""I will not try to stop. I am here to write, not to quit."" I thought this was a good reason. I enjoyed smoking and it made me happy.
During the session, we could smoke as much as we wanted. The room was full of smoke, and we had to open the windows. I noticed that when I was told to smoke, I did not want to. The messages about stopping smoking started to make sense to me. The idea of not being a smoker began to feel good. I felt strong and powerful. 
Stopping smoking was not very hard. The desire for nicotine went away after a few minutes and only lasted for four or five days. I thought working without cigarettes would be hard, but it was not a problem at all. I was surprised that the hardest part was doing things at home on weekend mornings. I realized that smoking helped me not feel bored. 
I do miss smoking a little, but not too much. Now, I have to deal with new experiences as a non-smoker, like eating out, waiting for a plane, checking into a hotel, or during a break at the theater. These are moments when I would have smoked before."

Dorothy Hodgkin is an important British woman scientist. She won the Nobel Prize, but many people in Britain do not know her name. For four years, I have asked my friends if they know about her. If they do, they pass my test. 
Dorothy Hodgkin is special because she is the only British woman scientist to win a Nobel Prize. If someone in literature won a Nobel Prize, everyone would know their name. Dorothy died in 1994, and she was a very interesting person. Her life shows important changes in the 20th century, like better education for women and the growth of science around the world.
When I started to learn more about her, I wanted to read biographies of other scientists. A friend told me about a biography of Linus Pauling, who was a friend of Dorothy. He was also a famous scientist and won Nobel Prizes for chemistry and peace. I went to a bookshop, but I could not find any books about him. I was surprised that people did not find him interesting, even though he was very important.
Some scientists think that biographies are not interesting. Peter Medawar, another Nobel Prize winner, said that the lives of scientists are often boring. If scientists think this way, it is not surprising that publishers and bookshops feel the same. Many scientists do not want to share their personal lives, which makes it hard for people to connect with them. 
However, some scientists are now showing their personalities. For example, Professor Richard Dawkins gives prizes on TV, and geneticist Steve Jones advertises cars. These activities help people see scientists as real people, not just researchers.
The way we write about scientists is also changing. In the past, biographies were often boring and focused only on their work. But now, books like Richard Feynman's ""Surely You're Joking, Mr Feynman?"" show that scientists can have interesting lives outside of their work. 
Dorothy Hodgkin worked hard in science. She discovered the structure of penicillin and vitamin B12, which won her the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1964. She also helped find the structure of insulin in 1969. She had three children and a husband who was often away for work. Her personal life is important, and we can learn from how she balanced everything.
Dorothy loved science, and this was the most important part of her life. It can be hard to explain scientific ideas to people because they may not know enough about science. But understanding science is not harder than reading Shakespeare or learning a new language. 
It is sad that many educated people do not know about great scientists like Dorothy Hodgkin, even though they would feel embarrassed if they did not know famous writers or artists."
CAE_56,C1,"**Margaret and Her Water Finding Skills**
Margaret Wilkins has a special ability. She can use a forked hazel stick to find water underground. Many farmers need her help because their wells have dried up. Margaret and her husband have a well-drilling business. They use machines like drilling rigs, but Margaret only needs her hazel stick to find water. They are very successful, with a success rate of over 90%.
This ability to find water is called dowsing. Some people think it is a special skill, while others think it is a natural ability. One idea is that everything on Earth vibrates, and water vibrates more than other things. Some dowsers say they can feel or smell water when they are above it.
Recently, many farmers have needed Margaret's help because of dry weather. Most of her customers are farmers with dry wells. She says, ""We see customers only once in a lifetime because wells last a long time."" Some customers have holiday homes far from water pipes, and others are building golf courses.
Margaret looks for water between 50 and 70 meters deep. She must be careful to avoid any waste getting into the water. The water she finds is usually clean, but she has to be careful because some areas have minerals like iron.
To find water, Margaret first looks at a map of the area. She uses a pendulum, which is a weight on a string. She holds it over the map, and it swings when she is above water. After that, she walks in the fields with her hazel stick. When she is above water, she feels a strange sensation. She uses the stick to find the exact spot to drill.
Margaret holds the stick with both hands. If water is below, the stick rises. It is very important to drill exactly where the stick points. If they are not sure, she and her husband will keep looking until they agree on the spot.
Margaret's ability is not just a local tradition. Many people are interested in how she finds water. She calls it an ""intuitive perception of the environment."" This means she has a special way of understanding her surroundings. Thanks to her skill, she and her family can continue their well-drilling business year after year."

Have you ever thought about living someone else's life for a day? It could be fun to try something new! We helped four people do this. Here are their stories.
**A. Amanda's Story**
Amanda is 23 years old and has two daughters. She swapped lives with her friend Cindy, who is 30 and works as a waitress in a busy restaurant in London. 
Amanda had never been in a place like this before. It was dark, loud, and full of people. It was very different from her hometown, and she felt nervous. Being a mother is busy, but waitressing was even harder! She had only fifteen minutes to learn how to carry drinks on a tray. Other waitresses made it look easy, but Amanda dropped the drinks on the floor. She felt embarrassed, but the other waitresses laughed and said it was okay. 
When the restaurant opened, there was already a line of customers. Amanda worried about remembering their orders, but the computer helped her. After a few hours, her feet hurt, and the loud music was hard to handle. She often had to say ""Pardon?"" when customers spoke to her, which made her feel shy. By the end of her shift, she was very tired and wanted to relax her feet. One waitress told her it was a ""quiet"" day, and Amanda was surprised how tiring waitressing was. She thought it was an easy job, but it was not! She realized she could not handle the busy Saturday nights. She was happy to go back to her children because being a mother felt easier after her day as a waitress.
**B. Cindy's Story**
Cindy is 30 years old and swapped lives with Amanda. She was nervous about being a mother for a day but also excited. She knew Amanda's daughters were playful, but she thought she could manage. 
When Amanda left for the restaurant, Cindy had to get the two girls ready for the day. After dropping off Sophie at school and Katie at nursery, she thought she would have some quiet time. But she was wrong! Amanda reminded her to clean the house and do the laundry. 
After picking up Katie, Cindy went shopping and then took her home for lunch. When Sophie came home from school, things got wild! The girls jumped on the couch and screamed loudly. Cindy tried to stay calm, thinking they would tire out, but they didn’t! She finally got them to bed at 8 pm, but then they kept asking for water to come downstairs and watch TV. 
Cindy learned that taking care of two small children is very tiring. She had no time for herself and felt a lot of responsibility. But she enjoyed the day, too.
**C. Rosemary's Story**
Rosemary is 42 years old and runs a dairy farm. She swapped lives with Hilary, who is 30 and a teacher. 
On the farm, Rosemary wakes up at 5:30 am, but today she could sleep until 7 am. She was nervous about looking different at school. At assembly, she saw about 400 students and hoped she blended in. 
In class, the children worked in groups, which was different from when she was in school. She helped with a nature project about snails. By lunchtime, she was tired but only had five minutes to eat. There was a lot to do before the next classes. 
She attended a meeting and helped with sports trials. After lunch, she had a reading lesson and then a French lesson, where the kids wanted to practice with her. Finally, they had Physical Education, and she was very tired. Speaking in front of the class was hard for her. Even though teachers have more holidays, she prefers farming.
**D. Hilary's Story**
Hilary is 30 years old and went to White House Farm at 8:30 am. She found out that Rosemary had been working for three hours already! 
Rosemary's farm has many animals, including cows and sheep. Hilary spent the morning in the ice-cream shop, filling containers with milk and making ice-cream. It was hard not to eat the treats! 
At lunchtime, she checked the sheep and helped one that had fallen. If a sheep is not helped quickly, it can die. After feeding the calves, she started milking the cows, which took two and a half hours. Rosemary does this every day, twice a day! 
Hilary felt lonely and missed the children because animals do not talk back. She learned that farming is hard work. It seems nice, but it is very different in reality. The pay is not steady, and it is hard to take time off."
CAE_6,C1,"A trumpet isn't just for Christmas. It is interesting that many musicians come from families without music. Hakan Hardenberger is a special trumpet player from southern Sweden. He is 30 years old and is known around the world. He plays old music and new music. When you see him, he looks young and friendly, just like the sound of his trumpet. 
Recently, he played the Hummel Trumpet Concerto in a big concert hall in London. He also had a TV show about his work, filmed in London and Sweden. Hakan was born near Malmo. When he was eight years old, his father, who did not play music, gave him a trumpet for Christmas. His father wanted to give him a real trumpet, not a toy. Hakan loved the trumpet and started to play it all the time. 
His mother found a trumpet player from the Malmo Symphony Orchestra to give him lessons. This teacher, Bo Nilsson, saw that Hakan had a natural talent. Hakan is thankful for having such a good teacher. Bo loved the trumpet and always looked for new ways to play it. 
Hakan explains that the trumpet is a simple instrument, and it is not perfect. Each trumpet is a little different. He learned to accept these imperfections and work with them. From a young age, people could recognize Hakan's unique sound. Unlike another famous trumpet player, John Wallace, Hakan always wanted to be a solo artist. He admired the French trumpeter, Maurice Andre, and bought all his records. 
Hakan's parents supported his dream to be a trumpet player. When he was 15, they decided he should study in Paris instead of America. In Paris, he studied with Pierre Thibaud, who told him that playing in an orchestra was not for him. Hakan knew he played better than many other young players. 
At 17, he entered a competition in Paris. He only prepared for the first round but made it to the second round. He knew most of the pieces for that round too. In the final round, he faced a difficult piece. He did not win first prize, but he enjoyed playing and realized that people listened to him. 
Hakan is realistic about his talent. He does not want to explain how he connects with people through music because he believes it might ruin the magic of it. He thinks music has the power to move people."

""I wake up at 6:30 am, go to the gym at 7 am, and get to work by 8 am. I start surgery at 8:30 am. I do surgeries all day on Monday and Wednesday, and sometimes on Friday afternoons. Most surgeries take about three hours, but some can take all day. Sometimes, I work for ten hours without eating or taking a break. Deciding when to do surgery can be stressful. I don’t feel stressed while I operate, but I worry about the next day. Brain surgery is very important for patients, and when it goes well, it feels great. From 10 am to 1 pm, I meet with patients to explain their surgeries. I like talking to them, but I have to be quick sometimes. I leave work between 6 pm and 8 pm. Some nights and weekends, I am on call, and I carry my beeper. When I am on holiday, I think about my patients for the first few days.""

I work with a team of four people. My job is mostly about managing projects. I spend three to four weeks designing and developing ideas for clients. After that, I show my ideas to the clients. If they like them, we plan the budget and I hire photographers and illustrators. I also work with printers to make sure everything is done on time. I have to talk to many people, and it can be stressful. I usually have lunch at 1 pm for an hour. I like it when clients like my designs, but it’s disappointing when they don’t.

At 11 am, we go to a cafe for breakfast. In summer, I may work until 10 pm; in winter, until 4:30 pm. I work from home in the office too. If someone wants a new garden, I meet them in the evening.

I wake up at 6 am and get to the office by 7:30 am. I help customers who use our credit cards. I work on a program called Membership Rewards in Europe. I talk to current card users, find new ones, and work with partner companies. I spend the first 45 minutes planning my day and then check my emails.

I leave home at 6:00 am for my early shift. I start work at 7:00 am and take control of aircraft movements. I work in a team with other controllers. In winter, we manage about 1,000 flights a day. Night shifts are quieter, and I can read about new rules. This job is stressful, and I take sick days if I feel unwell. I want to become a watch manager or general manager of the airport in the future.
**E. Shop Manager**  
If I work early, I leave home by 8:00 am. I start the electronic sales system and make sure someone is at the cash register. I help customers find and order books.

CAE_45,C1,"**Career Power: Take Control at Work**
A. **What makes a good leader?**  
A good leader inspires others and helps them change for the better. Being a leader is not about being tall or very smart. Pat Dixon, who wrote a book about men and women at work, says that leadership is about making things happen with people who are excited and interested. A good leader should speak clearly and confidently. They should say ""I believe"" instead of ""I think.""
B. John van Maurik, who teaches a course on leadership, says that many people can be great leaders if they see their own talents and use them. We all have the ability to be leaders; we just need the right situation to grow. It is easy to see famous leaders like Emmeline Pankhurst or Mahatma Gandhi, but it can be harder to see leadership in our own jobs. However, being a good leader is very important for good management.
C. Think about the best and worst boss you have had. They might have been good at setting goals and meeting deadlines. But how did they do it? The best boss motivated you and supported you. The worst boss made you feel unimportant and blamed you when things went wrong. The first boss led well; the second one managed badly.
D. Leaders and managers are different. Managers like to work within set rules. Leaders create new ideas. Micheal Shea, who wrote about leadership, says a good manager can keep a company running, but a good leader can change a sad company into a happy one.
E. Whether you are the boss or a middle manager, you can improve your leadership skills. Here are some tips:  
- Leadership works best when you choose to do it. Find what you are passionate about. When you feel inspired, use that energy to take action.  
- Start thinking of yourself as a leader. Your ability to lead is important.  
- Sometimes you need to lead firmly. Try different styles. If you usually ask others for their opinions, try taking the lead yourself. See how this changes the results.  
- Set goals and try to achieve them. Look at your job and see where being a leader can help you do better.
F. Leadership does not just happen. It grows when you take the lead, take risks, and learn from mistakes. Learn to delegate tasks, motivate others, organize well, and give praise.  
- Don’t think everyone will like your way of leading right away. Keep improving your communication skills. You don’t have to be liked, but your ideas should be respected.  
- Be visible and available to important people.  
- Remember, you don’t have to lead all the time. Know when your help is needed and how you can help others become leaders too."
CAE_64,C1,"**Films on Video: Reviews by Nick James**
**A. Abyss**  
Before Titanic, director James Cameron made a tense movie about oil workers and navy experts trying to save a nuclear submarine deep underwater. The main character, Bud, and his team remind us of tough heroes in older movies. The special effects are very good, but the dialogue and characters are not strong. The story feels like a simple B-movie.
**B. The Thin Red Line**  
This movie is based on a book about the battle for Guadalcanal. It is different from Terrence Malick's version, which is more poetic. Director Andrew Marton made a more traditional war movie that focuses on one soldier and his tough sergeant. Marton's film has some good moments, especially when the soldier dreams of his wife.
**C. On Guard**  
This fun movie is based on a book from 1875. It is better than many other musketeer films. The villain, played by Fabrice Luchini, is a sneaky politician causing trouble. Vincent Perez is a lively hero, and Daniel Auteuil plays a moody character who is also a swordsman. The film is full of clichés, but it is entertaining.
**D. Character**  
This film is set in Rotterdam at the turn of the century. The detailed costumes and sets make it look like a museum. Jan Decleir plays a harsh bailiff named Dreverhaven, who is cruel to his tenants. The story focuses on his bad relationship with his son, but the film spends too much time on details instead of the dark story.
**E. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly**  
This re-released film shows the skill of director Leone. The sound is very clear, making every noise stand out. The story is harsh, and the music by Morricone makes it exciting. The three main characters, the good (Clint Eastwood), the bad (Lee van Cleef), and the ugly (Ell Wallach), all act in selfish ways in the post-Civil War West.
**F. The Longest Day**  
This war movie features many international stars and has four directors and 23,000 extras. The early parts of the film, where soldiers wait for news about an invasion, are slow. While the movie is impressive in size, it is better to watch on a big screen. Watching it on video does not give the same experience."
CAE_29,C1,"**BOOK A** Steve Martin's *Compelling Evidence* is a very interesting story. The main character is a lawyer who is trying to start a new job after leaving a big law firm. He has to defend his boss's wife when she is accused of killing her husband. The trial scenes are exciting, and the ending is surprising. This is a great first book in a popular genre.
**BOOK B** *Curtains for the Cardinal* starts with a lot of action. The main character, Sigismondo, helps rich people in Italy during the Renaissance. He gets involved in politics and a murder case, but we believe he will find out who is guilty. The story is complicated and a bit long, but it is still very good.
**BOOK C** *File Under: Deceased* is a new detective story by Sarah Lacey. The main character, Leah Hunter, is a tax inspector. She starts to investigate when a strange man dies near her. Leah is brave and smart, and she does not let anyone stop her, even if some people do not like her. She is a great character.
**BOOK D** *Double Deuce* by Robert B. Parker features Spenser, a smart private investigator. He helps his friend Hawk to get rid of drug dealers in a poor area of Boston. The dialogue is quick and clever, and there is more thinking than usual. It is always good entertainment from Parker.
**BOOK E** *False Prophet* by Faye Kellermann has detectives Pete Decker and Marge Dunn solving a case about an attack and robbery at a famous actress's daughter’s house. The author writes in a simple way and shows interesting human behavior, making this a fun mystery.
**BOOK F** *Blood Red, Snow White* is written by husband and wife team Diane Henry and Nicholas Horrock. It features another lawyer and a female client, but most of the action happens outside the courtroom. The lawyer becomes a victim as the story unfolds. It has romance, money, and violence, making it a gripping suspense novel.
**BOOK G** *Dead for a Ducat* by Simon Shaw shows actor Philip Fletcher in a new role as a target. A funny group of characters comes together to film a Robin Hood story, but Philip feels this is not the right path for his career. Simon Shaw usually entertains well, but this time it is not as good as his other works.
**BOOK H** *Fall Down Easy* is the best book by Lawrence Gough in a while. Canadian police are looking for a clever bank robber who targets female bank tellers. The story builds tension slowly and shows the smart but troubled robber, making it better than an average detective novel."
CAE_57,C1,"I might be too old for this, but here I go! Tim Pozzi is 34 years old. He left his good job to go backpacking. He thinks about why he and others his age want to travel. This summer, he quit his job, rented out his flat, and decided to travel in South East Asia for a year. Some people might think he is lucky, but he feels nervous. He has traveled before. After university, he spent two years backpacking in North and South America. When he came back, he wanted to travel again. But then he fell in love, started a career, and got used to earning money. He realized he was not happy just working for money. When he quit his job, he felt like he was in control of his life again. 
Many of his friends are now married with children. They do not want to change places with him, but they envy his freedom. Tim is not in a relationship and does not have big career goals. He feels he should enjoy his freedom, especially for his friends. But he is nervous. He has to make many plans. He worries about having someone else live in his home and how to rent it out. He also needs to decide where to go. He is a big procrastinator and is already behind on his plans. He thought about enjoying the summer in England and waiting for the football season to start.
Tim is also worried about leaving his comfortable life. He wonders if he can still backpack. Will he fit in with younger backpackers? He finds that more people in their late twenties and thirties want to travel and escape their daily lives. Jennifer Cox from Lonely Planet says that many people are realizing they can have adventures if they are brave and organized.
Danny, a 30-year-old accountant, and his girlfriend Tammy, a 28-year-old teacher, bought a round-the-world ticket for a year. Danny says he is ready to give up job security for this trip. He knows he might return to the same job, but he thinks it is a risk worth taking. He even threw his calculator into the river when he left his job!
Matt, who just left the Army, says traveling helped him change his life. He needed to break away from the strict way of doing things in the military. There are many reasons why people travel at this age. Angela Baron from the Institute of Personnel Development says more people work on short-term contracts, so they have nothing to lose when their contract ends. Some big companies even allow employees to take breaks and come back later.
Dan Hiscocks, who runs a company about travelers, says many people in their thirties are thinking about their lives. If they are not happy, they know they can change things. Traveling gives them a chance to think about what they want in life. 
Jennifer Cox believes that wanting to travel is not a sign of not wanting to grow up. It shows that people are better educated and want a balanced life. Ben, a 32-year-old picture researcher, is going to Central America for a year. He does not think he is running away; he wants to find new things for himself. But he is also nervous about leaving his comfortable routine.
I feel the same way as Ben. I am not sure I would travel if I had not found my boss so difficult to work with. Jennifer Cox says that often something happens, like a breakup or losing a job, that pushes people to travel. 
Even though it took a push for me to start, I am excited about the next year. No matter what happens, I will be happy that I took this chance. I think many older backpackers feel the same way."
CAE_42,C1,"**Plugging in the Home**
Georgina McGuiness took a long break from her job as a journalist. She felt lost because of new technology. In this story, she shares how she changed her home into a good place to work.
The Christmas before last, I turned 37. I realized I needed to get back to my journalism career. I felt like my skills were old-fashioned, stuck in the 1980s. Back then, I used a typewriter, and now everyone uses computers. I was worried that no one would want me in a newsroom because I didn’t know how to use a computer. Many job ads asked for experience in desktop publishing, which I didn’t have. I thought it would be easier to learn nuclear physics than to use a computer. I was not good with technology; even calculators confused me, and I didn’t know how to use the timer on the video.
I knew I had to change quickly. I thought leaving home before my kids would be hard. But then, I entered a competition in a local newspaper and won a computer package! We got a laptop for my husband and a personal computer for the family. We jumped into this new world of computers and learned words like Internet and surfing. We started chatting online with people from different countries. My kids stopped watching TV, and I made a small office in the kitchen with a phone, a fax machine, a CD-ROM, and a modem to connect to the Internet. I had everything I needed to work from home and still take my kids to school. My children were already good with computers from school, but I was nervous. I thought I would lose my work if I pressed the wrong button. I was wrong! I learned the basic skills I needed. It was logical and easy. Every day, I learned a little more.
Now, I write articles for a magazine, about two each month. I feel proud because I have the best of both worlds. The computer has helped me a lot. Before, my desk was always messy, and I lost important papers. Now, I am more organized. I use spreadsheets to keep track of money, and I save time with ready-made invoices and letterheads. As a journalist, the Internet helps me find information and talk to other writers from around the world.
But working from home has some downsides. I can feel lonely without seeing people. There are also distractions at home, like chores, and my kids sometimes argue about who gets to use the computer. Many people in my neighborhood have bought computers, not just for learning but also for fun and entertainment. 
A report called PC Usage in UK Homes says that most home computer users are 38 years old and well-educated. Many own personal computers and have printers and modems. I feel like I am doing well with my computer skills. One day, I might even send an article to a newspaper in Melbourne or publish my own magazine from home. The possibilities are endless!"
CAE_59,C1,"**The Tartan Museum**
The Tartan Museum is in Edinburgh, Scotland. It has modern buildings that look like cheese wedges. The outside of the museum is very big and easy to see. It has a tall yellow tower and a garden hanging from the roof. 
Last winter, people had different opinions about the museum's design. Some people thought it was beautiful, while others were not so sure. Now, the inside of the museum is almost ready to open. 
The museum tells many stories about Scotland's history. It has important objects, like jewels from Mary Queen of Scots. The museum wants to show these treasures without too much national pride. 
Dr. David Clarke is in charge of the exhibitions. He wants the museum to be fun and easy to understand for everyone, not just experts. He believes that the museum should show the truth about the past. 
Visitors will see many interesting objects, but the museum also uses panels and computers to explain the stories. There are about 30 computers in the museum. 
When you enter the museum, you will notice the different spaces. The galleries connect to each other, and the walls look like big stone blocks. Light comes in through special windows, making it bright inside. 
There is also a Discovery Centre for children, thanks to a group of kids aged 9 to 12 from all over Scotland. They wanted to have fun activities, and now there is a special area for children to explore. 
On the top floor, there is a gallery that changes every three years. It shows objects that are important to Scotland in the 20th century. People suggested items like electric guitars, televisions, and toys. 
Overall, Dr. Clarke believes that objects can tell stories about the past better than anything else. The museum's modern design is impressive inside, but some people wonder if it is in the right place."
CAE_54,C1,"The Future of Newspapers**
The change from print newspapers to online news is happening slowly. Some people are scared of this change, but it is a normal part of moving from one thing to another. Many people think that print newspapers will eventually disappear because fewer people are buying them. For example, sales of newspapers like The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian have dropped by 8% to 10% in the last year. At the same time, more people are visiting their websites.
However, not everything is clear. A recent survey showed that the total number of newspapers sold around the world actually went up by 1.1% last year. In some places, like Asia, sales increased a lot. Also, magazines about news and current events saw a 5.4% increase in sales. This shows that while some types of print media are struggling, others are doing well.
E-books are becoming very popular, and many people are buying e-readers like Kindle. But when bookstores looked at their sales of physical books, they found that sales only dropped by 0.4%. This means that people are still buying both e-books and physical books.
Many people think that young people are not reading newspapers anymore, but this is not true. The latest survey shows that nearly 5 million people aged 15 to 35 still read the main newspapers in the UK. Different countries have different trends. For example, in Britain, newspaper sales have dropped by 10.8%, but in Germany, the drop is only 7%. In France, it is just 3.1%.
In the past, experts thought that online advertising would help newspapers make money. But now, online ads are actually going down. Many newspapers in the US have started charging for online access. The best way to get people to pay for online news is to offer both a print copy and online access together. This means that print newspapers are still important for selling online subscriptions.
However, keeping both print and online versions is hard and expensive for newspapers. Print newspapers still have a strong presence, but it is harder for them to be noticed online."
CAE_32,C1,"**Photographing People**
People are very interesting to photograph. A photo with a person is usually better than one without. But taking good photos of people can be hard. The photographer must pay attention to how people move, their gestures, and their expressions. Sometimes, just having a camera can make people act differently.
**A. Grouping People**  
When taking pictures of groups, avoid straight lines. Ask people to stand at different angles and distances. You can have some people sitting or kneeling in front so you can see all their faces.
**B. Posing for Pictures**  
People often feel stiff in front of a camera. Help them relax by suggesting they find a comfortable position, like folding their hands or putting them in their pockets.
**C. The Right Approach**  
Do not pretend you are not taking a picture when it is clear you are. This can make people feel tense. Most people will agree to have their picture taken, but they might feel shy. You may need to guide them. A picture can be less interesting if the person is looking away.
**D. Eye Contact**  
A photo looks better if the person seems to look at the viewer. Ask them to look into the camera lens. They do not have to smile. If they look away, remind them just before you take the picture. You can also say something funny to get a real reaction.
**E. Candid Concentration**  
Instead of looking directly at the camera, the person can focus on something else in the picture. This can make the photo feel more natural. Candid shots can be very interesting, and the person's expression is important.
**F. Expressions and Gestures**  
Expressions and gestures tell us a lot about a person. A laughing child can make us smile, while a sad face can make us feel sad. Look for common expressions like smiles, frowns, or thumbs-up. They are a quick way to show feelings.
**G. Situation Interest**  
A picture can be more interesting if the background tells us something about the person. Make sure the background does not take attention away from the person. A wide-angle lens can help make the person look bigger compared to the background.
**H. Interaction**  
Good pictures often happen when people are talking, laughing, or working together. Look for moments of connection, like eye contact or a handshake. These moments can show emotions and reactions.
**I. People and Places**  
Many pictures of people are taken on trips. To show people with a nice background, step back to include the whole scene. Ask people to stand close to the camera but not block the view of the background. A higher camera position can help with this. A good picture shows both the people and the place equally.
**J. To Pose or Not to Pose?**  
Decide why you want to take the picture. If you want a clear photo of someone you met on holiday, ask them to pose in front of a nice background. Family pictures can be boring if everyone is just posing. Candid photos of events are often more lively and can bring back memories better than posed ones."
CAE_65,C1,"**Under Sarah's Spell**
Sarah Janson is an artist who creates trompe-l'oeil paintings. These paintings look real but are actually tricks for the eyes. Joanna Watt interviews her.
Not many artists do not sign their work unless someone asks them to. Sarah Janson is one of these artists. She does not think the artist is important; she believes the work is what matters. She says, ""It's not the artist who is important, but the work."" Sarah is very humble and makes it seem like her paintings create themselves. This makes the interview a bit difficult. She says, ""I just don't like to shout about myself,"" and she gets nervous when asked to take a photo.
After 30 minutes, Sarah feels more comfortable. The interview becomes fun and interesting. Sarah has been a trompe-l'oeil artist for sixteen years. She studied drawing for two years at art school, got a degree in graphic illustration, and worked at a publishing house. But she was not happy with illustration. She started working with a decorator named Jim Smart, who asked her to create one trompe-l'oeil painting. After that, she knew this was her path. She left to work on her own, not knowing exactly what would happen, but feeling it was the right choice.
Sarah's skills in observing details helped her become a good trompe-l'oeil artist. She says, ""People often ask me where they can learn trompe-l'oeil. But no one can teach you. Trompe-l'oeil is the school of life. It's all about observation."" She believes she is still learning. She is honest about her weaknesses, saying, ""I can't paint bread; it always looks like grey concrete."" She also struggles with math. When she had a big job to paint a ceiling, she got confused with the measurements and thought, ""You're not Michelangelo. Who do you think you are?""
Sarah often talks about herself in the third person. After finishing a big project, she thinks, ""Well, I didn't do it, she did."" Her trompe-l'oeil paintings are very special and different from others. She has many important clients and creates art inspired by buildings. For example, she painted a dining room that looks like a beautiful Venetian building and a hallway that seems to lead to two more rooms.
With trompe-l'oeil art, once you understand the trick, you might lose interest. Sarah knows this and says, ""Trompe-l'oeil has to do two things. First, it must draw you in; it's got to trick you. Secondly, it has to hold you and engage your imagination."" She believes that her art should also be personal to her clients. ""I love the interaction with clients; that is where the ideas are born,"" she says. Some clients know exactly what they want, while others do not. She listens to them and tries to understand their ideas.
Many of her clients become friends because she spends a lot of time with them while working. Sarah is thankful for her clients, saying, ""I am very grateful for the mad ones who have let me loose on their walls."" They are happy with her work, which is why she is always busy. Even though she does not like to talk about her talent, she says, ""I really don't like to shout about myself. Like my work, I am very restrained. I don't want it to shout.""
It is true that you might get bored with things that are too loud, but you could never get bored with Sarah or her art. Her work deserves to be better known, and I am happy to share it with others."
CAE_61,C1,"**Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success**
Daniel Goleman talks about the important ""people skills"" we need to succeed at work.
A. The rules for work are changing. Now, we are judged not only by how smart we are or how well we know our jobs, but also by how we manage ourselves and work with others. This new way of judging is used to decide who gets hired and who does not. It helps to show who will do very well at their job and who may not. These new rules are important for our future jobs. They are different from what we learned in school. Doing well on tests is not as important anymore. Now, we need to have good social skills and personal qualities, like being proactive, understanding others, being flexible, and convincing people. These skills are called emotional intelligence.
B. Today, many jobs do not offer security, and we need to have skills that we can use in different jobs. Personal qualities are becoming more important at work. For a long time, people talked about these qualities using different names, like ""character"" or ""soft skills."" Now, we call them emotional intelligence. This means being aware of our own feelings and the feelings of others, and using these feelings to help us think and act. In our work, emotional intelligence includes: knowing ourselves, controlling our feelings, being motivated, understanding others, and having good social skills. Some people think emotional intelligence just means being nice, but sometimes it means being honest, even if it is uncomfortable. It is not about showing all our feelings, but about managing them so we can work well together.
C. More companies are realizing that emotional intelligence is very important for good management. The more complicated the job, the more we need emotional intelligence. If someone lacks these skills, it can make it hard for them to use their knowledge and skills. Many people have succeeded despite having low emotional intelligence, but as work becomes more complex and requires teamwork, companies that work well together have an advantage. In today’s workplaces, where teamwork and good customer service are important, emotional intelligence is essential for doing well in any job.
D. Unlike IQ, which does not change much, emotional intelligence can grow as we learn from our experiences. Studies show that most people get better at managing their feelings and understanding others over time. This growth in emotional intelligence is called maturity. We can learn these skills and use them to help us in our jobs, especially now when jobs are not always stable.

Social media has changed how people share these photos. Now, some journalists use social media to find images of fast-moving events. But some reporters have used pictures from users without asking for permission. There are rules that say images on social media can be used without permission in special cases or if there is strong public interest. However, people still argue about whether this is right. Research shows that about one in ten people would take pictures or videos of a news event. This means user-generated content (UGC) is important for the future of the media. To keep a good relationship with the public, the media should make sure that people are paid for their work and that they always ask for permission.'"
CAE_28,C1,"**Ancient Chinese Medicine in the West**
Acupuncture is a treatment that is over two thousand years old. It comes from traditional Chinese medicine, which also includes herbs, massage, diet, and exercise. Acupuncture is used to help with many health problems, but doctors in the West often use it to treat pain. Some general practitioners (GPs), midwives, and physiotherapists use it regularly for pain relief.
**What is Traditional Chinese Medicine?**
Traditional Chinese medicine believes that good health is when the mind, body, and spirit are in balance. They think that energy, called Qi (pronounced ""chee""), flows through the body along paths called meridians. There are twelve main meridians connected to different organs. If the flow of Qi is blocked or weak, a person may feel weak or sick. 
When you visit an acupuncturist, they will check your pulse, look at your tongue, and ask about your health, feelings, and habits. They use very thin needles that go into the skin. They may also use heat from herbs or apply pressure to points on the meridians to help the flow of Qi.
**Acupuncture Points**
The points where needles are placed are connected to the meridians and may not be near the area that hurts. People often feel a mild ache or tingling when the needle is moved. This shows that the needle has reached the Qi. There are over three hundred acupuncture points on the main meridians.
**How Does Acupuncture Work?**
Even though Western doctors do not fully accept traditional Chinese medicine, many believe that acupuncture can help with pain. They think it may work by blocking pain signals or by releasing natural pain-relieving chemicals in the body.
**What Pain Can Acupuncture Help?**
Many people with long-term pain try acupuncture when other treatments do not work. It can help with back pain, sports injuries, arthritis, headaches, and pain after surgery. Acupuncturists also say it can help with menstrual pain and pain in terminally ill patients.
**Modern Use of Acupuncture**
Acupuncture has been used in China for over 2,000 years, but using it instead of anesthesia during surgery started in the 1950s. This helped some doctors outside China see that acupuncture is more than just a mental trick. In China today, acupuncture is used in many surgeries, and it can help reduce pain. Some people recover from surgery faster with acupuncture.
**Is Acupuncture Always Effective?**
It is hard to study acupuncture, but some trials show that 50 to 80 percent of people find it helps with chronic pain. Acupuncturists say that it usually takes six to seven visits to feel real relief, but some people may feel better after just two or three visits.
**A Different Way to Look at Pain**
Western and Chinese medicine see pain differently. Acupuncturists look at the whole person, not just the pain. They spend time understanding the person’s health and what might be causing the pain. They ask questions about how the pain feels and what makes it worse, like cold or heat. This helps them decide how to treat the pain.
**Choosing an Acupuncturist**
Some doctors have training in traditional acupuncture, while others use scientific methods. Traditional acupuncturists believe that using their methods can lead to better healing. It is important to choose a good acupuncturist, and they should refer you to a doctor if needed."

CAE_5,C1,"**The Pen is Stronger than the Psychoanalyst**
The study of handwriting to understand a person's character is becoming more popular. In some countries, if you want a job, you may need to show a sample of your handwriting. This handwriting can help decide if you are right for the job. 
Handwriting analysis, or graphology, is seen as a real science in many places. Some researchers say it can help find certain health problems, like heart disease and cancer, and can show emotional issues. Many big companies now use handwriting analysis to help choose candidates for important jobs. 
However, many doctors and psychiatrists are not sure about the value of graphology. Patricia Marne, a professional graphologist for over 20 years, thinks they should take it more seriously. She believes handwriting can show psychological traits and some medical conditions. She says, ""Handwriting can show social class and intelligence. It can also help decide if a person should focus on arts or sciences, and if they are honest or not.""
Ms. Marne believes graphology can help find possible criminal behavior. She says, ""Criminals often have messy handwriting. Many come from difficult backgrounds and have emotional problems. This can show in childish handwriting or by writing letters many times."" 
She can tell if people are honest or if they might manipulate others. For example, young male offenders often have tall letters, which means they dream big. Graphologists can also see if someone is under a lot of stress or has violent tendencies. Handwriting can even help predict if someone might think about suicide. 
Ms. Marne explains that heart and lung problems can also show in handwriting. ""You cannot make a diagnosis from one sample unless it is very shaky. But if handwriting changes over time, it could mean something serious is happening."" 
She also says that handwriting can show other psychological traits. For example, people who write with letters connected by threads may be clever but not honest. Those who write mostly in capital letters may be hiding their true selves. Light pressure in writing shows sensitivity, while unique handwriting shows confidence and creativity. 
Ms. Marne says it takes six years of study to analyze handwriting well, along with understanding and intuition. She believes more research is needed to make graphology a proper science. She thinks it is more accurate than psychoanalysis because it can show a person's history and emotional problems without asking them questions.
However, many psychiatrists do not agree with her. They say handwriting is just a result of education and the way people are taught to write, and it does not mean anything more."
CAE_41,C1,"**Is Your Office Working Well?**
A new survey says that fresh air and good chairs are important for a happy and healthy workplace. We visited four different offices to see how healthy and happy they are. We had three experts with us: a building health consultant, an ergonomist (who studies working conditions), and an occupational psychologist. Here are their opinions.
**Office A: Advertising Agency**
- **Building Health Consultant:** This office is very simple. It has no central heating and no mechanical ventilation. The windows open to the street. The workers are part of a small team and seem happy. They change the office temperature by opening doors or using electric heaters, like they do at home. This may help them feel comfortable.
  
- **Ergonomist:** The furniture does not match and some chairs are old and broken. This can cause bad posture. However, the workers have different tasks, like meeting clients and making presentations. This variety helps them avoid tiredness and boredom.
- **Occupational Psychologist:** The staff like the different types of work and the size of the office. It is small enough to know what others are doing but big enough to work alone. The office looks nice and fun.
**Office B: News Service**
- **Building Health Consultant:** This office is not very exciting, but it is comfortable. The air quality is good, and there is a No Smoking policy.
- **Ergonomist:** The company has good chairs and lighting. The space is okay, but the layout could be better. The walls are plain and dull.
- **Occupational Psychologist:** The walls have only a few planners and a poster. Most workers have been there for over five years and get along well. The office could be better if desks were arranged to share information easily.
**Office C: Bank**
- **Building Health Consultant:** This office has mixed feelings from workers. It feels like being in a glass box. The air is not stale, even with smokers around.
- **Ergonomist:** The office is standard and not inspiring. The desks are okay, but some chairs are not good for computer work. The computer setup is not modern.
- **Occupational Psychologist:** The staff help each other and use technology well. There are many awards on display. The office is busy but has a serious look.
**Office D: Newspaper**
- **Building Health Consultant:** This office has many problems. The air conditioning does not work well, and the temperature changes a lot. The space is messy, and there is a lot of dust.
- **Ergonomist:** The furniture is not good for a modern office. Many chairs are old and do not help workers who are shorter.
- **Occupational Psychologist:** The office is dirty, with old chairs and carpets. It needs cleaning and better air conditioning. There were not many conversations when we visited; people seemed stressed. The company should encourage teamwork."
CAE_38,C1,"**Chewing Gum Culture**
Chewing gum is popular in America. People chew about 12 million sticks of it every day. It is a simple food and must follow rules from the American Food and Drug Administration.
Today, most chewing gum is made with synthetic materials. These materials help keep the flavor and make the gum soft. But a long time ago, people chewed different types of gum. The ancient Greeks chewed a resin from the mastic tree, which grows in Greece and Turkey. Women in Greece used mastic gum to clean their teeth and make their breath smell good.
In America, colonists learned to chew resin from spruce trees from the Native Americans. In the early 1800s, they sold spruce gum in the eastern United States. Modern chewing gum started in the late 1860s when people discovered chicle, a substance from the sapodilla tree in Central America. This gum was smoother and more enjoyable to chew, and it created a big industry.
However, it is hard to grow sapodilla trees. Today, many gum makers use synthetic materials instead. The few people who still gather chicle, called chicleros, have a tough life. They walk for miles in very humid conditions to collect the sap. They face dangers like poisonous snakes and insects. The chicleros climb trees to collect the sap, which they carry back to a camp. There, they boil it until it becomes sticky and forms bricks.
Life in the camp is not easy. The workers eat a simple diet and drink local alcohol made from sugar cane. Even though their work is hard, chicleros worry about losing their jobs. Not long ago, the United States imported 7,000 tonnes of chicle each year from Central America. Last year, only 200 tonnes were collected in Mexico.
As chewing gum sales have increased, companies have started using synthetic materials to save money. Gum makers also find new ways to sell their products. They say chewing gum can help you relax, give you energy, and reduce tooth decay. Chewing gum can help produce saliva, which protects your teeth.
Today, many new flavors of gum are made, mostly with artificial ingredients. However, some flavors still use natural ingredients. In America, a large area is used to grow mint for the most popular chewing gums."

Sue Brown is a hotel inspector. She checks hotels to see if they are good. Christopher Middleton watched her work. At the Globe Hotel, things are not going well. The receptionist is talking on the phone and does not notice Sue and Christopher. Sue thinks this is very bad service. 
The Globe Hotel has three red stars, which means it is one of the best hotels. But when Sue arrives, she sees that the entrance is not nice. There is a door with a buzzer and a long, empty hallway. Sue is not happy with this.
When Sue checks in, the receptionist says they have no record of her booking. There are 15 rooms, but 12 are empty. Sue looks at a room on the top floor, but it is stuffy and has a big hole in the wall. 
Sue remembers when she started inspecting hotels. People called her ""The Woman in Black,"" but she did not wear black and did not think she was tough. The next morning, she tells the hotel manager, Robin Greaves, who looks scared when he sees her. He apologizes for a bad smell in the lounge. 
Sue suggests that he should fix the plumbing and tell the staff to be more careful with guests. Robin takes notes and seems worried. He has only worked at the Globe for five months. 
Sue also praises Emma, the assistant manager, and Trudy, the waitress, for their good work. The dinner was good enough to keep the hotel’s two-rosette food rating. Robin asks how to get three rosettes, and Sue says they should not serve bad desserts.
Sue's job is to tell hotels what is wrong. Sometimes, people complain about her. She remembers a woman who said she got her son fired because he served her pie with his fingers. 
Sue must write a report about her visit. The hotels pay for her to help them improve. It is good for Robin to hear that Sue will not take away the Globe's red stars. But another inspector will come back in two months to check if the problems are fixed. Robin smiles, but he does not look very happy about it."
CAE_48,C1,"**Climbing the Seven Summits**
Doug Scott is a mountaineer who writes about climbing the highest mountains on each continent, called the Seven Summits. He started this adventure later in life and will tell us about each mountain in the order he climbed them.
**A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)**  
Doug and his climbing partner, Dougal Haston, were in a snow cave close to the top of Mt. Everest. They talked about sleeping bags, which Doug thought was strange because they were alone. He started talking to his feet because they were cold. Doug remembered other climbers who lost fingers and toes to frostbite. They were not just worried about surviving but also about how well they could survive. Doug felt calm and confident with Dougal. He found a good rhythm and continued climbing to the summit.
**B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)**  
This mountain is very dangerous. In April 1976, Doug and Dougal arrived at the Kahiltna Glacier and spent four days carrying equipment and food. They realized how hard their climb would be. They followed a route from 1967 but then chose a new path to the summit. They carried everything on their backs. After three days, Doug's sleeping bag was wet. They camped on a windy ridge and felt tired. The air pressure made it feel like they were higher than they really were. Finally, they reached the summit and felt happy.
**C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m)**  
In September 1976, Doug and his friend Paul flew to Nairobi to climb Mt. Kenya. Instead, they got a free ride to Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest mountain. They got lost in the jungle and had trouble finding water. On the second day, they found arrows on trees that led them to a rock pool. They tried to climb a steep wall but had to turn back because of falling rocks and ice. They chose a safer route to the summit.
**D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)**  
In January 1992, Doug and his wife, Sharu, arrived at Aconcagua. They met a guide named Phil who invited them to join his group. After waiting for bad weather to pass, they started climbing. The Polish Glacier was icy and windy. They decided to take a different route to avoid the glacier. They walked with many other climbers to the summit. The wind was strong, and they camped outside before going back to base camp. There, they met climbers who wanted to climb the Seven Summits too.
**E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)**  
Doug learned that climbing Vinson Massif was possible if he guided enough people to pay for the trip. In November 1992, his team traveled to the South Pole. The sun was always shining, and it was very quiet. On December 7, they started climbing to the summit. Despite strong winds and very cold temperatures, they all reached the top in 8 hours. However, they could not see much because of a storm.
**F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)**  
In the summer of 1994, Doug's team met in St Petersburg. They went to Elbrus and had to pay a fee to their guide. After a few days, they took a cable car up the mountain. They walked to a refuge and then climbed. They thought they reached the summit but found there was more to climb. They returned to the refuge and then went down the mountain.
**G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)**  
On this expedition, Doug wanted to climb and spend time with the local Dani people. They were warned about dangers from bandits but decided to go anyway. On May 12, they started climbing. The weather got better, and two team members went ahead. Doug and another climber were slower because they were filming. They reached the summit by 11 am. Doug felt proud to complete his seventh summit. Mission accomplished!"

Peter MacCann is the General Manager. He wants his staff to know the guests' names. For more details about what guests like, he uses a computer system. This system helps the hotel give special service to returning guests. It cost £250,000 to set up, but it will save money in the future. MacCann is happy with how well it works. For example, if a guest asks for certain music during their first stay, those same CDs will be ready for them when they come back.
Many hotel guests complain about room temperature. The Merrion Hotel has a system that lets guests change the temperature in their rooms. They can adjust it by three degrees around the normal 18°C. The front desk can also change the temperature from 14°C to 25°C.
The hotel is popular with business guests. MacCann thinks that about 65% of the guests will be business travelers. To help them, the hotel has put a business center in each room. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that can also copy and print, and a video-conferencing system.
Technology changes quickly, so the hotel is ready for new improvements. They have extra cables for future technology. The televisions are rented, so they can get new ones easily. DVD recorders can also be updated.
Even with all this technology, MacCann wants guests to feel comfortable. The hotel has 145 large and cozy bedrooms. There is also a swimming pool, a gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a beautiful garden.
The food at the hotel is very important. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, who has two Michelin stars, has moved his restaurant to the Merrion. He has made a new kitchen and improved the restaurant. The hotel benefits from having a great place to eat without financial risks.
With good technology and a skilled staff, the Merrion Hotel is likely to be very successful."
FCE_24,B2,"**An Eye for Detail**
Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. The big garden around her house gives her many ideas for her art. The garden has many of her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wildly and spread all over the garden. There are two long flower beds along a path that goes from one side of the garden to the other. The colors and shapes of the flowers are very nice. The previous owners of the garden loved to garden and left many plants that Susan likes. She also kept the gardener, Danny. Susan says, ""In fact, it was really his garden."" They worked well together. At first, Danny would say some of Susan's ideas were not good, but when she said she wanted to paint them, he understood.
Susan likes to paint individual plants in detail instead of the whole garden. Sometimes she paints a group of plants, but usually, she picks one flower and takes it to her studio. She says, ""I don't set the whole thing up at once. I take one flower out and paint it. This might take a few days. Then I bring in another one and build up the painting."" Sometimes it can take a couple of years to finish a painting.
Her busiest time is in spring and early summer when the tulips and poppies bloom. ""They all come out together, and you're so busy,"" she says. She also finds beauty in how flowers change over time. For example, with tulips, ""You bring them in and put them in water. After a day, they change shape. They open up and look amazing. At first, they seem boring, but they change all the time.""
Susan has always liked plants. She studied botany in school and collected wildflowers from the countryside. She did not like garden flowers because they looked fake to her. She was fascinated by wildflowers that grew in difficult places, like cracks in rocks.
Now, her garden has many plants from faraway places, but they grow well in her garden. She lets the garden grow freely, like a kind aunt who lets children play as long as they do not break anything. Susan is busy preparing for two art exhibitions, so she has hired an extra gardener. Even though she needs to paint, she knows that to stay connected to her flowers, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""

Many trees in Brackham were knocked down in the big storms in March. The town lost two big lime trees from the old market square. This change made the town look very different, and some people were not happy about it. 
One of these people was Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, the head of the local police. But during the storm, he was very sick with bronchitis. He had a headache and felt tight in his chest. His wife, Molly, wanted him to see a doctor, but he thought he was too important for the police and did not go. This made him forget things and made him angry.
Finally, his colleague, Sergeant Lloyd, took him to the doctor. Pelham was too weak to argue. Soon, he got medicine and went home to Molly, who sent him to bed. 
On Thursday morning, Molly told him that the walnut tree in their garden had fallen during the night. Pelham was too sick to understand. Later, when he felt better on Saturday, he saw that without the walnut tree, the living room looked very different. 
The Pelhams had a big house with a nice garden. They liked their home, but now the storm changed how it looked. Before, the walnut tree made the living room feel cozy and hid the old furniture. Now, without the tree, the room was too bright, and the old furniture looked bad. 
Also, the view from the window was not nice anymore. The tall house next door, which was hidden by the tree, was now visible. It had ugly purple bricks and many windows that seemed to watch the Pelhams.
“Doesn’t it look terrible?” Pelham said to Molly. But she seemed happy. “I’ve been saying this since we moved here. We need to buy a new sofa, no matter the cost.”"
FCE_16,B2,"**Living in the Valley**
We lived in our valley for sixteen months when we first saw the dangers in the hills around us. It was a year when storms came early, even before winter started. Until then, we felt safe in our valley below the hills. 
Then, snow began to fall. In one day, it was about 15 centimeters deep. The snow almost blocked our road and made the path by the stream slippery and dangerous. In the hills, the snow was much deeper and stayed longer. The wind was very strong up there. In our valley, we felt only some strong gusts of wind; the trees moved, but their branches stayed strong. 
We knew we had to worry. The snow and wind were annoying, but they did not really scare us. The river, called the Ryburn, was what worried us the most. It usually flowed gently, but we remembered what could happen if the water from the hills was not controlled by dams built many years ago. 
Soon, the snow started to melt. Every day, we saw dark clouds gather over the hills. These clouds looked dangerous and warned us of what was coming. We watched the river, which was getting fuller and wilder. The snow melted as more rain fell from the clouds, and the reservoir in the hills was filling up quickly. 
Then it happened - for the first time in years, the reservoir overflowed. It was like a small Niagara Falls, as water rushed over the dam and into the stream below. The river looked wild as the water flowed down quickly. Just a few meters from our cottage, the stream was deeper than we had ever seen, rushing angrily at its banks. 
For three days, we hoped the river would stay below its edge. Luckily, the dam held, and the water began to go down. Many times in the past, before the dam was built, the river had flooded nearby villages. Now, the dam controls the river, and usually everything is fine. The water from the hills, from snow and heavy rain, stays behind the dam, with only a little overflow sometimes. 
Because of this protection, we can enjoy the big clouds over the valley and feel safe in our home."
FCE_21,B2,"Mark Adams is a film critic. He has worked for a newspaper called The Front Page for ten years. Writing about films for this newspaper was his first real job. Before that, he wrote reviews for other newspapers and magazines, and he did some work for the radio. He met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, who hired him. Tom was not a journalist, so he did not choose his staff very carefully.
Tom wanted a team of critics to write about different art forms like books, TV, theatre, film, and radio. They would have lunch together every week to talk about what to cover. Mark felt very lucky to be part of a new newspaper. He thought it was strange that a new paper could start in a busy market. He even felt like a millionaire was helping him by giving him a job. The first time he saw someone reading his review in the newspaper, he felt shy.
Tom's idea for a team of critics did not work out. They did not meet as planned, and they ended up talking on the phone. People liked to read reviews from critics who focused on one subject, so Mark chose to write about films. Without Tom's help, Mark would not have the job he has now, where he writes a long piece about one film each week. He likes this way of working. He did not want to be a standard film critic who reviews every new film. That would make him bored quickly.
Mark thinks that people choose films based on stars, ads, or the director. People usually stick to the types of films they like. For example, someone who does not like westerns is unlikely to watch one just because of a review. Mark does not think a film review is a guide for buying tickets. He does not feel he has to be ""right"" about a movie. He does not believe there should be a set number of ""great"" or ""bad"" films each year. His job is to share his opinion, not to judge films."

**Teenager with a love for endurance sports**
**WANTED:** A training partner for a triathlete, preferably female. You should love running long distances (15km), swimming in cold water, and cycling long distances (100km). You must be able to do all three sports without resting.
The triathlon is becoming a very popular Olympic sport. Many people watch athletes swim 1500m, cycle 40km, and then run 10km without stopping. It looks hard, but why do these athletes do it? 
Melanie Sears is a 17-year-old girl who is very good at sports and school. She has not learned the usual phrases that athletes say about personal satisfaction and challenges. She says, ""You swim 1500m, then you run out of the water and jump on your bike, still wet. Then you feel cold. After cycling 40km, you have to run 10km, which is hard when you are tired. But it is great fun, and it is worth it in the end.""
Melanie started her first triathlon when she was 14. ""I won the junior section, but I was the only junior there. It felt easy, and I waved at my friends while I was racing."" She then entered the National Championships. She swam fast and ran fast, but she did not win. ""I was following a man, and we got lost. We ended up cycling 20km too far. I cried while running."" But she did not give up. ""Sometimes I want to stop because it hurts, but I am afraid that if I stop once, I will want to stop again.""
Steve Trew, the coach, admires her determination. ""I tested her fitness, and she worked so hard that she fell off the running machine and hit a wall. Most people stop when they are tired, but she kept going.""
This year, Melanie was the top junior in the European Triathlon Championships, finishing 13th. ""I was almost as good as the top three in swimming and running, but I was slower at cycling. That’s why I am training hard."" She is trying to convince her parents to buy a special bike for £2,000 for her trip to New Zealand for the World Championships. 
But training takes time. ""I don’t have a social life,"" she says. ""I am not a party person. After swimming for two hours on Friday nights, I just want to sleep. But I call and write to the other girls on my team."" What do they talk about? ""Not boys or clothes. We talk about our times in races.""
Melanie has tried other events, like the triathlon ""sprint,"" where you swim 750m, cycle 20km, and run 5km. She wants to try even harder events than the triathlon. ""The problem is, I have no one my age to train with,"" she says."
FCE_70,B2,"**The Collectors**
Amanda Roy talks about collecting things and why many people enjoy this hobby. Many adults like to collect items. It is a fun and exciting world. But if you want to collect something, remember: you should love the item. 
People have collected things for a long time. In the past, early humans collected pebbles and wore them as necklaces. They liked the shapes and colors of the pebbles. Today, children still collect stones and seashells because they are beautiful.
I have collected many things in my life, like flowers, pottery, and paintings. When I was six years old, I went to a school in a cold place in England. My parents took me to a local museum full of interesting objects. I loved looking at these items. 
Many adults also enjoy collecting. Some people collect because it is the only thing they can control in their lives. For me, I just enjoy it. 
One famous collector was the Duc de Berry in France. He had a ""room of wonders"" with many strange and beautiful items. Another collector, Catherine the Great of Russia, had over 4,000 paintings. But you do not need to be rich to collect. I have collected tulip bulbs and china cups. I remember when I convinced another collector to give me a special tulip. I planted it, but one year it disappeared because someone stole it.
I also collected 350 American rag dolls. I searched all over the USA for them. Sadly, my collection was lost in a fire. The next day, I saw the remains of my dolls and furniture. I was very sad.
I find it interesting how collections change hands. A silver spoon that belonged to a king or a poet can be very valuable. As more people want small items, their prices go up. For example, toys from the 1950s are now worth a lot, especially if you kept the original boxes. I wish I had kept mine!"
FCE_3,B2,"**My Line of Work**
Four people talk about their jobs.
**Lisa - Exhibition Programmes Organiser, Science Museum**  
I organize temporary exhibitions. This means I plan and design the exhibition and tell people about it. I read about the exhibition topic and talk to important people to find out the main ideas. I decide what objects and pictures to show. I also plan activities like workshops and theatre to help visitors understand the exhibition. I work with engineers and electricians to make sure everything is safe for visitors. Before the exhibition opens, I help create brochures and leaflets to inform people.
**Janet - Teacher of London Taxi Drivers**  
I start my day at 7:30 a.m. by checking the accounts. Then, I see what new maps and documents we need for the taxi-driver test. By midday, about 50 students are in school, learning the best routes to take. I help when there are disagreements, like if a right turn is allowed at a junction. When they are close to the test, I give them a simple route, but I tell them they must find another way if the road is closed. This helps them think better.
**Sarah - Marine Conservationist**  
I live by the coast and work from home. I answer phone calls, create educational materials, and set up training courses. Sometimes, I go to our main office, but I mostly work by the sea. I work with schools and run courses for people who manage the coast and make decisions about the sea. I take them out on a boat to show them the life under the water. This helps them understand better than just using a computer. I love my job because conservation is my hobby, but I work for a charity, so I always need to find more money to do everything I want.
**Chris - Map and Atlas Publisher**  
My job is very varied. I make sure our publishing program meets what people want and keep about 300 books in stock. We have high standards for information and content. We get many letters from readers about things like international boundaries, and I must respond carefully. I talk about future projects and sales with my co-publishers. I work with a great team, which makes the job enjoyable. However, like many jobs, I have too much administration work, which takes time away from more interesting tasks like product development and design."
FCE_10,B2,"**No Title**
We always went to Ireland in June. Since we started going on holidays together, we spent the first two weeks of June at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. It is a big house by the sea, not far from the village of Ardbeag. The English couple, the Malseeds, bought the house and made some changes, but they did it carefully. Strafe found Glencorn for us. He saw an advertisement when the Malseeds still needed to advertise. One evening, he said, ""How about this?"" and read the details. 
The summer before, we went to a hotel that friends recommended, but it was not good because the food was terrible. The four of us have been playing cards together for a long time: Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia, and me. They call me Milly, but my real name is Dorothy Milson. Dekko got his nickname at school. He and Strafe were in the same school, which is why we call Strafe by his last name like the teachers did. We are all about the same age and live close to the town where the Malseeds lived before moving to Ireland. We think it is a funny coincidence.
""How very nice,"" Mrs. Malseed said, smiling to welcome us again this year. She seems to know when guests are coming because she is usually waiting in the big hall that smells of flowers. ""Arthur, take the luggage up,"" she told the old porter. She called our rooms by names: Rose, Tulip, Lily, and Geranium. Mrs. Malseed painted flowers on the doors instead of using numbers. In winter, when not many people come to Glencorn Lodge, she takes care of little things like that. Her husband takes care of repairs and painting.
""Well, well, well,"" Mr. Malseed said as he came into the hall from the kitchen. ""A hundred thousand welcomes,"" he greeted us in the Irish way. He was smiling, and his dark brown eyes sparkled, making us feel special. Everyone smiled, and I could tell the others felt that our holiday had really started. Nothing had changed at Glencorn; everything was good. Kitty from the dining room came out to greet us. ""You look younger every year, all four of you,"" she said, making everyone laugh again.
Arthur led us to our rooms, carrying as much luggage as he could and going back for the rest. After dinner, we played cards for a while, but we did not play long because we were still tired from the journey. In the lounge, there was a man alone and a French couple. There were other people at dinner because Glencorn Lodge is always full in June. From our table by the window, we could see some guests walking on the lawns and others going down the cliff path to the beach.
In the morning, we would do the same: walk along the sand to Ardbeag and have coffee at the hotel there, then return in time for lunch. In the afternoon, we would drive somewhere. I knew this because we had done it many times before. Since we first came here, we all fell in love with the beautiful landscape."
FCE_67,B2,"**Keeping Holiday-Makers Happy**
Sarah Sutherland-Pilch is a chalet girl. She is 24 years old and comes from West Sussex, England. This is her second year working in Val d'Isere, France. She cooks and cleans for visitors who come to ski and stay in wooden houses called chalets.
Sarah studied French and History of Art at university. She says being a chalet girl is not a long-term job, but it is a fun way to spend a year or two before starting a career. She meets many interesting people every week.
Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to work. The chalet can have up to 18 guests each week. She eats her breakfast first, then makes breakfast for the guests. They have porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants. After breakfast, she cleans up and either prepares afternoon tea or cleans the rooms, which she thinks is the worst part of her job. By 11 a.m., she is ready to ski. On good days, she can ski until 4:30 p.m.
After skiing, Sarah goes back to the chalet to prepare dinner. She takes a shower first but does not sleep because it is not good for her. Dinner is served at 8 p.m., and coffee is ready by 10 p.m. After dinner, she cleans the kitchen. She does not like coming back to a messy kitchen in the morning. Sometimes she talks with the guests, but other times they want to be alone. Good guests can make her week better, but some weeks are not as good.
Sarah lives in a chalet with her friends. They usually go out at 11 p.m. to have fun. They start at a place called Bananas, then go to G Jay's, and maybe Dick's T-Bar at the end of the night. But she does not stay out too late on Saturday because Sunday is her busiest day.
On Sunday, she starts work early. Breakfast for guests leaving has to be ready by 7 a.m. After the guests leave, she cleans quickly. She clears the breakfast, strips the beds, and gets everything ready for new guests. If she did not shop for food on Saturday, she does it now. By 3 p.m., she finishes cleaning and prepares tea for the new guests who arrive around 4:30 p.m. Sometimes the new guests are confused and have many questions.
Between tea and dinner, Sarah helps guests who need ski boots or skis. She takes them to the ski shop and gets a ride back to the chalet. Soon, it is time for dinner again. Sometimes she has a drink after dinner, but if she is too tired, she goes to bed early."
FCE_27,B2,"Miss Rita Cohen was a small girl with pale skin. She looked much younger than Seymour's daughter, Marie, but she said she was six years older. One day, she came to Seymour's factory. She wore overalls and big shoes, and her curly hair framed her pretty face. Seymour was surprised that she was studying at the University of Pennsylvania and doing research about the leather industry in New Jersey for her Master's degree.
A few times a year, someone would contact Seymour to ask if they could visit his factory. Sometimes, he would help students by answering their questions or giving them a short tour if they seemed serious. Rita was very small, like the children from Marie's class who visited the factory years ago. Seymour remembered showing them how he made gloves, especially the special table where the workers shaped and pressed each glove using hot brass hands. Marie called them ""pancake hands"" because they looked strange.
Rita asked Seymour, ""How many pieces come in a shipment?"" He replied, ""Between twenty and twenty-five thousand."" She took notes and asked, ""Do they come directly to your shipping department?"" Seymour explained, ""They come to the tannery. We buy the material, and they make it ready for us. My grandfather, father, and I worked in the tannery here in town. Have you ever been inside a tannery?"" Rita said, ""Not yet."" Seymour encouraged her to visit a tannery if she wanted to write about leather. He said, ""It's an old industry. There are ancient tools found in Turkey that are 6,000 years old. The first clothes were made from animal skins that were tanned by smoking.""
Seymour told Rita that his father was a leather expert and that she should talk to him. ""He can talk for two days about gloves. Glovemen love their work,"" he said. Then he asked, ""Have you ever seen anything being made?"" Rita replied, ""I can't say I have."" She added, ""I saw my mother make a cake when I was a child."" Seymour laughed. He liked her spirit and eagerness to learn. 
Rita was much shorter than Marie, but she reminded Seymour of her. He remembered how Marie would come home from school, full of what she learned. ""I have an idea,"" he said. ""We will show you the whole process. Come on! We will make you a pair of gloves, and you will watch them being made from start to finish. What size do you wear?"""

Chris Arnot asks four people with dream jobs if they are as great as they seem.
**A. Raquel Graham**  
Raquel Graham calls from a taxi on her way to the airport. She cannot meet us tomorrow because her boss wants her in Los Angeles. As a personal assistant to a pop star, she travels a lot. Raquel loves her job and gets along well with her boss. But there is one small problem: she does not like flying. ""On a nine-hour flight to California, I usually take sleeping pills to help me relax,"" she says. Her worst experience was flying on Concorde. ""It felt very closed in with those tiny windows."" When she is not traveling, she works in offices in Manchester and London. She does some boring tasks like organizing schedules, attending meetings, and making travel plans. Raquel did not apply for this job. She met the manager of a pop group by chance and took a secretarial course at night classes. Five years later, she became a personal assistant.
**B. David Brown**  
David Brown has worked as an accountant and a golf caddy, which means he carries a golfer's bags. He prefers being a caddy because he loves golf. However, there are some downsides. He earns a small flat fee and a part of the winnings. Most caddies earn between £25,000 and £35,000, but they spend a lot on travel and hotels. David was 31 when he first caddied for golfer Greg Norman. ""You do more than just carry bags. You give advice and try to understand the course,"" he explains. Recently, his skills in accounting were recognized, and he now works as a statistical data administrator. He collects and analyzes statistics from each day's play, which are important for TV commentators and golf magazines.
**C. Martin Fern**  
Martin Fern is the editor of the 'Food and Drink' pages of a daily newspaper. One of his easier tasks is to try food at fancy restaurants. What does he think about expensive restaurants? ""If people can pay, it's their choice,"" he says. ""I would rather spend £120 on a meal I will remember than buy a microwave."" His friend, who was an editor, offered him a food column because Martin is a good cook. At that time, he worked in advertising and it helped him earn extra money. When he was 42, another newspaper offered him a full-time job. ""It meant I would earn less money, but it was a chance to turn my passion into a job."" He still cooks at home and tries to stay healthy by cycling to the nearest tube station.

""I started writing children's stories about 20 years ago,"" says Dick Prince, a popular children's writer in Britain. ""Before that, I loved words and wrote poems. Then I had an idea for a story. I was a farmer and knew about chickens being killed by a fox. So, I wrote a story called The Fox Busters, which was my first published children's book."" Where do his ideas come from? ""It is not easy; I have to work hard for them,"" he says. ""I usually write in the mornings. I do not wake up very early. After lunch, I spend a couple of hours typing what I wrote in the morning. I use an old typewriter, not a laptop."" He receives 50 to 100 letters a week, which he enjoys. He tries to answer them all, but now he has some help with this."
FCE_66,B2,"In the lumberyard by the lake, there was an old two-story brick building. Around it, there were big piles of soft sawdust. One afternoon, Michael and his friends climbed up to the roof of the building. They sat with their legs hanging over the edge and looked at the lake. 
Suddenly, Michael said, ""I dare you to jump down!"" He jumped off the roof and landed in the sawdust, laughing. ""I dare you all!"" he shouted. He called them cowards to make them jump. They looked scared at first, but one by one, they jumped down and laughed when they landed.
After a while, one friend said, ""Let’s go back up and jump again."" They were not very excited, but they climbed back to the roof. They jumped off quickly until only Michael was left. The others were down below, smiling and calling, ""Come on, Mike! What’s wrong?""
Michael wanted to jump, but he stayed on the edge of the roof, feeling nervous. He tried to count to ten and take a deep breath, but he couldn’t jump. His friends started to laugh at him because he was taking too long. They shouted, ""You’re a coward! Are you going to stay up there all night?"" When he didn’t move, they began to walk away.
Michael felt sad and alone. He looked at the ground for a long time. The sun was setting, getting bigger and bigger in the sky. Finally, he closed his eyes and jumped down into the sawdust. He lay there for a long time, and the yard was quiet because the workers had gone home.
After a while, he got up and walked home, feeling ashamed. He was late for dinner, and his stepmother said, ""You should be able to get home on time. If you can’t, maybe you should stay in tonight."" She was a kind woman, but Michael didn’t really hear her. He was still thinking about his friends laughing at him."
FCE_44,B2,"**Careers Advice**
Are you unhappy in your job? Do you want to change but don’t know how? Kitty Doherty has some good advice. Many people who want to change their job go to a careers adviser. 
First, you will write a short history about yourself. Then, you will take some tests called 'psychometrics'. After the tests, you will get a summary of the results and suggestions for different careers. You may also learn about any training you might need.
I tried Career Analysts, a big organization that gives career advice. Taking the careers test felt like being back in school. I was with about ten other people, and we had to answer questions quickly. I reminded myself that it was not about passing or failing. The tests were hard to understand. They included finding mistakes in lists and matching shapes.
After the tests, I talked with an adviser. He used my test results and our conversation to write a report with his thoughts and suggestions. I agreed with most of what he said, but I was a bit sad to learn that I did not do well in the science and technical tests. I am glad I did not become a nurse! However, it was good to hear that I made the right choice in journalism.
Changing your career does not always mean a big change. Last March, Donna Laney, 25, lost her job as a marketing manager after five years. Her friends told her to go to Career Analysts for help. She said, ""Losing my job was a chance to think about my career. I wanted to look at my skills and interests."" Some results surprised her. ""I didn’t know I was good at design. But I had to think about the cost of training in design,"" she said. Other ideas included taking a year off to work in the Far East. In the end, she decided to use her current skills and work in a job that suited her better. Now, she is a Public Relations officer. She believes she could have found this job without Career Analysts, but they helped her understand what she really wanted to do. She has sent many friends there, and they are all happy with the service.
Some people feel they really needed help. Juliet Greene, 26, went to Career Counselling Services and made important decisions. After working at a bank for six years, she thought her job was boring and wanted a new challenge. She didn’t know what to do, so she went to the adviser with an open mind. The tests showed she was interested in sciences. She had four meetings with the adviser. The third meeting was recorded, which helped her remember what she said. After the fourth meeting, she decided to study geology and start a degree later this year. She thinks the advice from Career Counselling Services was worth the money. Now, she is much happier.
However, career advice does not work for everyone. Amanda Margetts, 24, a sales representative, said, ""I didn’t know where to go in my career. I thought a careers adviser might suggest something new. I got many new ideas, but I didn’t like them because they needed a big pay cut or a lot of retraining. I didn’t learn anything new about myself."" She felt that if she had told a friend the same things, they would have given her similar advice."
FCE_22,B2,"**Fun at the Dentist's?**
If you go to W. Lloyd Jerome's dental office in Glasgow, you will see bright paintings on the walls and a nice blue couch. Patients sit on this couch while he checks their teeth. Jerome says, ""Half of the people only visit the dentist when they are in pain. They are scared."" To help with this, he wants to make the office a place where people feel safe. That is why he does not wear a white coat. Many people think a white coat means pain. Jerome believes that dental visits should be relaxing and enjoyable.
This is surprising for many people who think dental visits are painful or very serious. Jerome says, ""If people feel relaxed and happy, they will forget their bad experiences."" One of his new ideas is to use virtual-reality headsets. ""We were the first dental office in Britain to use them, and they are very popular."" Patients wear the headsets during their check-up. They sit on the blue couch and watch a film about underwater animals while Jerome checks their teeth. Then, the headset shows them a special view of their mouth.
Most patients like this part of their visit. The office also smells nice, like a perfume shop. Today, it smells like oranges. Jerome wants people to feel that this is not a normal dentist's office. The usual dentist smell can make people feel scared. I thought the nice smell in the office was very pleasant.
Jerome is known as Glasgow's most stylish dentist, but he takes his work very seriously. The relaxation ideas are important, but giving good treatment is the most important thing. For example, he uses a special tool that sprays warm water to clean teeth instead of scraping them. It feels a little strange at first, but it is not painful if people are relaxed.
Five years ago, Jerome went to the United States to learn about new dental methods. He says, ""When you make it easier for the patient, it is easier for you too."" He wants to change the serious way of British dentistry. 
At that moment, a patient arrives. Jerome quickly goes to him, offers a cup of tea, asks what video he wants to watch, and leads him to the chair. The patient seems to enjoy this special treatment. The office feels more like a beautiful salon than a regular dentist's office."
FCE_39,B2,"**Bitter Water Becomes Popular**
Chocolate comes from South America and is now a big business around the world. In Britain, people spend over £230 million on chocolate at Easter. This is about eight percent of all chocolate sales. People eat more chocolate at Christmas than at any other time.
The cacao plant, which is used to make chocolate, was first grown by the Aztecs, Toltecs, and Mayans in Central America over three thousand years ago. The cacao tree is a tropical plant found in Africa, South America, Central America, the West Indies, and South-East Asia. The fruit of this tree is big like a melon and has 20 to 40 seeds inside. When these seeds are dried, they become cacao beans, which are used to make chocolate. In English-speaking countries, these are often called cocoa beans. This name is a mistake from the 17th century when they were also called cacoa and cocao beans.
The Aztecs used cocoa beans as money and made a drink called xocoatl, which means ""bitter water"" in their language. They added spices to this drink for special occasions. The Spanish liked the drink better with cinnamon and sugar, but it took a long time for this recipe to reach Europe.
In the late 17th century, chocolate houses opened in big cities in Europe where people could drink chocolate. Until the last century, people made chocolate drinks from solid chocolate blocks that had to be melted in hot water. In 1826, a man named CJ van Houten from the Netherlands made chocolate powder by removing most of the cocoa butter from the beans. 
The chocolate bar we know today started in 1847 when a company in Bristol, Fry and Sons, mixed cocoa butter with chocolate and sugar to make a solid bar. A Swiss company later added milk to make milk chocolate. 
At first, French companies sold most of the chocolate in Britain. In 1879, the English company Cadbury named their factory Bournville, hoping to attract customers with a French name. Then, Cadbury created the Dairy Milk bar in 1905. They advertised it as healthy because it had milk from the English countryside. This helped it compete with fancy French chocolates.
Now, people in Britain eat about four chocolate bars each week. Chocolate companies are trying new ideas to attract customers. They are making chocolate bars into ice cream, soft drinks, or desserts to get more buyers.
However, cacao farmers are still struggling because cocoa bean prices fell in the late 1980s. Many small farmers went out of business. So, next time you enjoy a chocolate bar, think about the farmers who grow cacao."
FCE_18,B2,"**THE SHELL ARTIST**
Peter Cooke is 83 years old and is very good at his art. He wants to try new things like making paper and working with feathers, but for now, he is happy making beautiful objects from shells. 
As he shows me his work in his apartment, he asks, ""Am I boring you?"" He is not boring at all. He is very interesting and his creations are beautiful. He points to some shell-covered decorations above his fireplace. He says, ""I don’t mind if people don’t buy them because I love them."" Peter never planned to sell his work. About five years ago, some friends told him he should have an exhibition so more people could see his art. They helped him talk to a gallery owner in London. At his first exhibition, 70% of his pieces were sold.
His second exhibition just opened. The prices for his work are very high, around £2,000 for some decorations. There are 86 pieces in the exhibition, with prices starting at £225 for a shell flower in a crystal vase. Peter says he does not set the prices. He believes his work is unique, and the gallery owner told him that one day, people will want his pieces because he will stop making them.
Peter wishes he had started this art earlier in his life. He thinks he could have made even more wonderful things. Now, he feels he cannot do as much because he is older. However, his work is very different from the common shell items you find in seaside shops. He has a creative mind and makes boxes covered in tiny shells, pictures made from shells, and baskets of very realistic flowers.
Peter has his own way of working and uses materials he finds. He uses cardboard from laundered shirts for flower bases, a special glue from a sail-maker, and washing-up liquid to clean the shells. He says, ""I have an idea of what I want to do, and it just happens."" His work is very detailed and colorful.
Peter travels to many places to find beautiful tiny shells. He has been to France, Thailand, Mexico, South Africa, and the Philippines. He lies on the beach to look for shells. He only collects dead shells and does not take shells with living creatures in them. He explains that many people walk on the beach and break shells, and the sea also breaks them. He believes it is okay to collect shells that are no longer home to any creatures. 
Peter’s argument about collecting shells is strong, especially when you see how beautiful his work is."
FCE_62,B2,"**The Schoolgirl Model**
Kira Langer is 15 years old. She is a model who travels to many beautiful places and appears on magazine covers. When she is not modeling, she studies for her school exams. 
One day, a reporter named Jane Laidlaw is waiting to meet Kira. The receptionist at the modeling agency tells Jane that Kira will be late. Jane worries about this. She thinks about all the bad things she has heard about models, like they can be difficult or vain. She wonders if Kira will come at all.
When Kira arrives, she is smiling and relaxed. She is with her mother. Kira is not wearing fancy clothes; she has on a simple black dress and trainers. She seems friendly and nice. Kira explains that all models under 16 must have an adult with them when they work. Her mother looks proud of her.
Kira became a model by chance. Her older sister suggested she enter a modeling competition. Kira did not want to, but her sister sent in some photos anyway. When Kira found out she was a finalist, she was at school. This made her feel confident, and she won the competition easily. After that, a modeling agency in London offered her work.
Now, Kira has to manage her life as a model and a student. Her friends and teachers are proud of her, but some people at school are not nice. They say she thinks too highly of herself. Kira finds this hard to understand because she is not a selfish person. She says, ""I have become more confident, but I am still the same person.""
Being a busy model affects her social life. The agency can call her at any time for a job. Kira cannot always make plans with her friends because she does not know her schedule. However, her friends are understanding and do not complain.
Kira has the looks and support to have a great career. Not many people can say that before finishing school. At the end of the interview, Jane asks Kira what she would like to do if she were not a model. Kira thinks for a moment and says, ""I would like to do what you are doing."""
FCE_49,B2,"**Father and Son Search for Gold**
Terence and Chris Madden are a father and son from Canada. They have traveled from the cold north of Canada to hot Africa to find gold. They think their mine on a Welsh mountain could have a lot of gold, about 10,000 ounces. After ten years of digging, they believe they are very close to finding a lot of gold worth five million dollars.
Terence, who is 68 years old and from Liverpool, said, ""As we dig, we are finding high levels of gold. We just need to dig a little more to find it all."" The father and son have worked hard to find gold. They started their search after Terence read about gold in an area called the ""Dolgellau gold belt"" near the town of Dolgellau in Wales. 
They read old mining books and newspapers at the Welsh National Library in Aberystwyth. Then, they chose a good place to dig. They cleared away plants and found small pieces of gold in the rocks. For ten years, they got permission to work on the land, took samples of the earth, and removed old cars and trash. They dug out a lot of rock to make a tunnel and a 10-meter deep hole.
Now, they need more money. They have spent their savings on this project. They need to find someone to invest £50,000 to dig deeper where the gold is. Chris Madden said, ""Right now, it looks difficult, but we have some people we can ask for help.""
As news about their digging spread, many people in the area became interested. Dolgellau depends on tourists, and the people there are hopeful. Peter Woolven, who manages the Royal Ship Hotel, said, ""If they find gold, it could bring more visitors here. But I hope many people do not come and damage the hillside.""
The gold industry in Wales has become much smaller since the late 1880s when many people worked in many mines. One of the last mines, Clogau-St David's, which made wedding rings for the Queen, closed a month ago. Now, more individual gold diggers are coming back. George Hall, another gold seeker, wants to dig a tunnel on the other side of the hill from the Maddens. He is 70 years old and said, ""Searching for gold is very exciting. It feels like an adventure to find hidden treasure. Maybe I will be lucky this time."""
FCE_31,B2,"**IN HOT WATER**
Rachel Mills is a scientist. She spends a lot of time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. Rachel teaches and does research about marine geochemistry. This means she studies the chemicals in the sea. She works at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. 
When she is not teaching, Rachel goes into a small steel vehicle to explore underwater. This vehicle is the size of a small car. It can dive three kilometres down into the ocean to study underwater volcanoes. Inside the vehicle, there is very little space. Rachel can touch the two pilots who are with her. They cannot stand up or move around. They must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. 
A dive can last for 16 hours. It takes three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours to collect rock and water samples, and then three hours to come back up. If there is a problem and they need to get to the surface quickly, they can press a panic button. This makes a small escape vessel come out, which goes quickly to the surface. Rachel says, ""No one has tested it yet, but I don't think it would be a very nice trip.""
Rachel remembers her first dive. She got into the vehicle on a ship with an instructor. He explained what to do in an emergency, like if the pilot had a heart attack. They wanted to see how she would feel in such a small space. Now, Rachel has made six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian team. They went to a place five days away from the Canary Islands. There, they found many underwater volcanoes that blow out black smoke. 
When Rachel is not at sea, she works in her office at the Oceanography Centre. She loves teaching, but she also wants to do research on ""black smokers,"" which are underwater volcanoes. Water comes out of these volcanoes and looks like black smoke. It comes out very fast and is very hot, at 350 degrees.
Rachel felt scared the first time she dived with an American team. They were using equipment when suddenly there was a loud explosion. She thought, ""I'm going to die."" They waited in silence, but they were still alive. The relief was amazing!
Diving to the deepest part of the ocean is an adventure for Rachel. Every time she looks out of the window of the vehicle and sees the volcanoes, she feels wonder. She thinks, ""I am at the bottom of the sea, and no one else has seen this."" Rachel studied black smokers for three years for her PhD. When she finally saw them, it was an incredible feeling."
FCE_58,B2,"I was dirty, smelly, hungry, and a little sunburned. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. I was very tired. I could not understand any more train times, money, or languages. ""Never again,"" I said when I got home. I said the same thing the next year and the year after that. 
All I had to do was buy one train ticket. Because I was under twenty-five years old, I could travel anywhere in Europe for a whole month. Sleeping in a train corridor is very different from sleeping in a bed. The train rocks you to sleep. 
Carrying all my things in a backpack made me travel simply. I learned to throw away things I did not need, like old socks and finished books. This way of traveling is part of the Inter-Rail spirit. You can forget about rules and just enjoy the trip. 
With this ticket, young people can travel to many countries in one day. On my first trip, my friends and I did not know how special this ticket was. We thought it was just a cheap way to get to our campsite in southern France. But we wanted to see more countries. The extra travel did not cost us anything. 
We were not only interested in culture. This was our first holiday without parents, like many other Inter-Rail travelers. We made our own plans and only saw the most interesting sights. We wanted to do something different. I was proud that sometimes all I wanted to see was the view from the train station. 
We just wanted to enjoy our time together. We shared the train floor, food, water, money, and music with other travelers. The excitement of travel comes from seeing a place you only knew by name. When the train arrives, you see the city for the first time. 
You can only understand Europe by seeing it. Watching the changing landscapes and different lifestyles gives you a real picture of the continent. Everyone knows about Europe, but it is not the same until you see it yourself. This is why other people's holiday photos can be boring. 
The train trip may not show you new things in the world, but it is a valuable personal experience. Europe is big, and Inter-Rail helps people see this, even if it does not happen right away."

It is very disappointing to arrive at an airport in another country and find out that your luggage is missing. You may have to wear the same clothes for a long time until the airline finds your bags. Sometimes, you might be in a different place with a different weather and have to wear clothes that are not right for that place.
Airlines do not often say how many bags they lose, but it happens to many travelers. Even good airlines can make mistakes. It is hard for any airline to promise that your checked luggage will be on the same flight as you, especially if you have to change planes.
Here is how it works: Airlines ask passengers to arrive at the airport early. This is to give enough time for the bags to be checked and loaded onto the plane. There is also a minimum time needed to change from one flight to another. This time is often longer to help with moving the bags. Usually, this system works well. But sometimes, extra security checks and air traffic problems can cause delays. These delays can make it hard for the baggage system to work properly. 
Human mistakes can also happen, like if the label on your bag gets lost. This can be a bigger problem at large airports, called 'hubs', because many bags are processed there. For example, last year, Heathrow airport in London had over 41 million passengers, and nine million of them were changing planes. British Airways had two million passengers changing planes at Heathrow.
Even busy airports like Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Singapore, and Zurich can have problems. In the United States, Miami airport is known for losing luggage when passengers quickly change planes to go to Latin America.
To avoid losing your luggage, try to book direct flights when you can and check in early. If you have to change planes, try to use the same airline for all your flights. It is also a good idea to allow more time for connecting flights by taking an earlier flight. Make sure to label your luggage with your home address and your holiday address, and include your flight numbers.
If your luggage is still missing after all this, you should talk to the airline staff in the baggage area and fill out a report about your missing bag. You need to do this before you leave the airport."
FCE_2,B2,"**The Kingfisher**
Wildlife photographer Charlie James knows a lot about the kingfisher. This is a beautiful blue-green bird that lives near streams and rivers and eats fish. Old trees grow over the stream, giving some shade to the shallow water. The main colors around are soft greens, browns, and yellows from the sunlight. The kingfisher moves quickly and looks like a flash of light. It is there for a moment, and then it is gone, but you remember it because it is so special.
Charlie James loved kingfishers when he was young. He feels very strongly about this little bird, but he cannot say exactly why. In Greek myths, the kingfisher is a bird that was once a moon goddess. Another story says that the kingfisher flew so high that its top became blue like the sky, while its bottom was burned by the sun. This story has some truth. Kingfishers do not have blue pigment in their feathers. Instead, their feathers reflect light in a way that makes them look blue. This is why a kingfisher can look bright blue or green depending on the light.
Many wildlife photographers love kingfishers. They are shy birds, but you can watch them easily from a hiding place. Charlie's first hiding place was an old blanket he put over his head while he waited near a kingfisher's favorite spot. The bird came back in just a few minutes and sat very close to him. But it took him four more years to take his first good picture. 
Charlie spent a lot of time by a stream where kingfishers lived. However, school took away some of his time with the birds. He missed classes and called himself an ""academic failure."" But people noticed his interest in kingfishers. At 16, he got a job as an advisor for a nature magazine. Later, he worked as an assistant to the editor and then became a freelance wildlife cameraman.
Now, Charlie wants to make a special kingfisher film. He wants it to have no words, just beautiful images. He likes to take pictures of the kingfisher's wings. He thinks about the colors of the bird that he has loved for many years. His photographs show some of his feelings, but he knows there is much more to his love for the kingfisher than what his work can show."
FCE_68,B2,"**Conducting an Orchestra**
Giving directions to an orchestra is not easy. Anne Inglis talks to five new conductors about their work.
**A. ANNE MANSON**  
Anne Manson is 30 years old. She asked to watch conductor Claudio Abbado's practice sessions in Vienna. When an assistant could not come, she took their place. Later, she helped with another opera. ""I had to lead the first rehearsal for Abbado. I was not nervous. I like standing in front of an orchestra,"" she said. Anne is from America and works with a famous opera company in London that focuses on modern music. She is also becoming known in other European countries. She has received help from the British Arts Council and has worked with Abbado on many projects.
**B. ANDREW CONSTANTINE**  
Andrew Constantine is 31 years old. He says the hardest part of being a conductor is getting good opportunities. He won a big competition in 1991 after trying twice before. He is thankful for the timing of his win. ""If I had won earlier, I would have been forgotten,"" he said. The competition gave him many chances to perform and work as an assistant to a famous conductor. However, he is worried about being known only for the competition. ""If in three years my name is still linked to the competition, I will be concerned,"" he said. But orchestras like the English Chamber Orchestra are inviting him back, which is good for his career.
**C. WASFI KANI**  
Wasfi Kani started Pimlico Opera and enjoys the long practice time for opera productions. ""The music needs four weeks of focus,"" she said. She began conducting seriously in her late twenties. After university, she worked in London until Pimlico Opera became professional two years ago. Taking lessons with Sian Edwards was important for her. ""I saw her conduct and realized she was my size. I had always learned from bigger people, which is different,"" she explained. She likes the complexity of opera because there are many arguments and different personalities among the singers.
**D. ROGER VIGNOLES**  
Roger Vignoles is 48 years old. He says conducting surprised him but he finds it very interesting. He started as a musician in an opera house and worked with good conductors. Last year, he directed Handel's Agrippina from the piano at a festival for the first time. ""It was easier than I thought. I knew the music well and what I wanted it to sound like,"" he said. He tries his best to get the performance he wants. He has learned from all his experiences in music and performing. Now, he is open to doing different things to find out what he enjoys.
**E. WAYNE MARSHALL**  
Wayne Marshall is 32 years old. In 1986, conductor Simon Rattle noticed him and told his agent about him. Soon, Wayne was conducting a musical in London on short notice, which was hard. He had to manage some musicians who were too relaxed and reading newspapers during the show. ""I was strict with them. I always gave a clear beat and tried to get the best result,"" he said. He believes many musicians do not need much advice from a conductor. ""I am not afraid to say what I want. If people see you are worried, it gets worse,"" he added. Wayne has not studied conducting formally, but he is determined and knows what he likes."
FCE_23,B2,"**Variations on a Theme**
If you want to take children to a theme park, there are many in Britain. We asked five families to try some of the best parks.
**Fun Island - The Burns Family**  
Last year, we went to a big theme park in the US, so we thought Fun Island would be boring. But we were surprised! The park is good for younger children, so our three-year-old had fun too. The kids loved the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. There is a special dodgems ride for little kids, which was very popular. For older kids, there are scarier rides like Splash Out, where you jump into a pool! After five hours, we wanted to leave, but the children wanted to stay because they were having so much fun. The only problem was that the park could be more exciting, and the scenery was not great. But the staff were very helpful, and the park was clean and safe.
**Wonderland - The McMillan Family**  
None of us had been to a theme park before, so we did not know what to expect. We thought Oscar might be too young, but he loved it! He enjoyed the Mountain Train and liked Little Land, which has small models of famous buildings. The older kids liked the ferris wheel and driving toy cars. We spent six hours there and were happy there were places to rest. The park looked nice, and the staff were friendly. There was something for everyone, even adults.
**Adventure World - The Jeffree Family**  
After seven hours, we still wanted to see more. The children loved the Big Top Circus, which had a great trapeze act. We went on the Terror Line, and even though the girls were scared, they said they enjoyed it. Their favorite ride was Running River, where you think you will get wet, but you don’t. For younger kids, Toy Land is very fun. The children wanted to try the new ride, Fear Factor, but we were happy they were too small for it! The park is so well made that waiting for rides is not boring. It was very clean, and the staff were great. One staff member even helped me with one of the girls when I could not sit with both of them.
**The Great Park - The Langridge Family**  
We got to the park at one o'clock and were sad that it closed at 5 p.m. This park is great for younger children because the rides are not too scary. I am a bit scared of rides, but I had fun too. We all loved Exotic Travels, a boat ride that starts slow and then becomes very exciting. We waited for half an hour for Lightning River, and it was over quickly! I would not go on the Big Leap, but it looked fun if you are brave. If the children were older, they might have found it a bit boring, but they loved it at their age.
**Fantasy World - The Break-all Family**  
The park says there is ""No Limit to the Fun,"" and we felt that was true. The tallest roller-coaster in Europe, the Rocket, is very exciting. Ben thought it was the scariest ride, but Jennie thought the Hanger, where you hang upside-down 30 meters above the ground, was worse! There are many main rides, and the older kids went on them several times. Sarah was too small for some rides, but she liked the Long Slide. The staff were nice to younger children, but some were not very friendly. You need a whole day to enjoy Fantasy World. We could not tell the kids we were going home early!"
FCE_60,B2,"**Running a Business in the Countryside**
Five women share their stories about starting a business in the countryside.
A. **Christine Hogan** runs a computer design business. She makes over £200,000 a year and has four full-time workers. ""My customers are my friends,"" she says. Christine moved from London to the countryside when her children were small. She wanted to work from home. She had experience with computers, so her husband suggested she start a computer design business. At first, it was hard and she needed a lot of money. She was careful with her spending and talked to the bank manager when she might overspend. Working from home saves money, and she can work in the evening if she wants. Her business is small, and customers usually come to pick up their work.
B. **Maggy Sasanow** designs greeting cards from her home. ""I enjoy being independent,"" she says. She studied art at university and wanted to work in a museum, but there were no jobs in the countryside. So, she started her own business and makes 50 different greeting cards to sell to museums. She works in a big room upstairs. The downside of working from home is that there are always chores to do, like mowing the lawn. She does not advertise; her business grows by word of mouth. People send her work from London because she is cheaper than other artists. Working alone means she misses sharing ideas with others, but she thinks there are more good things than bad.
C. **Delia Turner** makes curtains. She started her business eight years ago when it was growing. In two years, her income went from £24,000 to £80,000. She had six full-time workers, but she had to let them go when the economy got worse. This was hard because it is not easy to find jobs in her area. Now, she makes curtains at home with her husband’s help and works with women who also work from home. She has to lower her prices sometimes and look for new opportunities.
D. **Tessa Strickland** runs a children's book publishing business from her farmhouse. She moved to the countryside three years ago to save money and because she loves the country. She likes being able to work when she wants. Most of her income comes from deals with Australia, the Far East, and North America, so she takes calls at strange hours. The hard part is staying focused and closing the office door. She publishes children's books from different cultures and works with authors and artists. At first, she felt lonely because all her work experience was in London.
E. **Meg Rivers** runs a cake business and a shop. She makes £250,000 a year and has six employees, some of whom work part-time. She started her business ten years ago at home. She is interested in health, so she began making fruit cakes with good quality ingredients. Friends and family asked for cakes, and soon she was sending them all over the country. Seven years ago, she rented a small building where everything is made. Now, she has a baker and a cake decorator. She does not bake anymore because she manages the business. Her biggest challenge has been managing the money, as she did not have a lot to start with."
FCE_1,B2,"**Meet the Amazing Watkins Family**
The Watkins family is very special. The sons are musicians and composers, and their dad makes musical instruments. 
John and Hetty Watkins are teachers from South Wales. They wanted to buy a cello for their son, Paul, who is ten years old. But the cello was very expensive. John thought, ""Maybe I can make one."" He found a school nearby that teaches how to make instruments. He took evening classes for three years.
After making some violins, John made his first cello. Paul, now 28, says, ""It turned out really well. Dad made me another cello later, and I used it until a few months ago."" John has now stopped teaching to make instruments full-time. He makes about twelve violins each year. He even sold one to a famous American musician named Jaime Laredo.
Paul and his younger brother, Huw, started playing music when they were young. Paul remembers, ""I played the piano as soon as I could reach the keys."" Later, he wanted to play the cello. His dad played the viola and wanted Paul to play the violin. Paul tried it for six weeks but did not like it. He liked the cellist in his dad's group and asked for lessons.
Huw, now 22, says, ""My parents were supportive. I wanted to do well like Paul, but I did not feel pushed."" Huw is now a pianist and composer.
Paul has done very well with the cello his dad made. He won a big music competition and became the main cellist for the BBC Symphony Orchestra when he was just 20 years old. He played his dad's cello until last year. Now, he has a very old cello on loan from the Royal Academy of Music.
Paul will soon play on television with his new cello. He will perform Elgar's Cello Concerto. He says, ""I will play it my way."" But he cannot watch himself on TV because he will be playing at the Cheltenham Festival that night. Huw will also be busy, as his String Quartet will perform in London at the same time.
John and Hetty will have to be very organized to keep up with all their sons' music events in the coming weeks."
FCE_53,B2,"**Looking after the Countryside: The National Trust**
The National Trust is a group that wants to protect the British countryside. Gill Page visits the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and talks to Gareth Roberts, a warden who works for the Trust.
Gareth says that a National Trust Warden needs common sense. ""You must be good with people,"" he explains. ""You talk to farmers, visitors, and builders every day."" Gareth grew up on the Lleyn Peninsula and worked on his parents' farm until he got married. Many people wanted to be the warden, but Gareth got the job because he knows the area well and has farming experience, even though he did not have formal training.
Gareth still helps on his parents' farm, which helps him understand the farmers' problems. He says, ""I can talk to farmers as equals, and they cannot trick me!"" His farming background also helps him do the physical work, like building fences and planting trees.
Since working with the Trust, Gareth has learned more about nature. He remembers picking flowers and collecting butterflies when he was young. Now, he sees that farming has changed the countryside. He believes it is not the farmers' fault; they were just following government rules.
At first, farmers and conservationists did not get along. They both wanted things done their way. Now, they are talking and understanding each other better. Gareth says, ""We are close to working together.""
Gareth's job includes conservation, allowing people to visit the Trust's land, planting trees, and working with tenant farmers. He wants to finish jobs quickly and without problems. He enjoys seeing projects completed, but he also spends a lot of time on reports and paperwork.
Gareth loves his job, even though he is always working. He enjoys talking to people, but some visitors can be difficult. ""Some people come in, ask for everything, and leave as if they own the place. It can be annoying!"" he says. But he believes that common sense is important.
If you have common sense and like working outside, you might want to be a warden like Gareth. But be ready to wait a long time for a job on the Lleyn Peninsula!"
FCE_55,B2,"**The Netball Captain**
In this article about women in sports, Suzie Ellis met Kendra Slowinski, the captain of England's netball team. Kendra is very busy because the World Championships are next month. She teaches at a local school and then trains in a supermarket car park.
I asked Kendra if people look at her when she trains. She said, ""I focus on my movements and my feet, so I don’t see much else. I might see cars slow down a little, but that’s it.""
Kendra said, ""My life is all about being my best for the Championships. I have a strict schedule to be very fit."" This is her fourth World Championships, and it will be the biggest one yet, with 27 countries joining. She is happy to have support from home. ""It is special,"" she said. ""We want to make netball better in this country. There will be more pressure because people expect us to play well.""
Their first game is against Barbados right after the opening ceremony. Kendra believes they have always won against them, but she knows they are a strong team. The England team is ranked fourth in the world, but Kendra says the Championships will be hard. ""You must push yourself every day. There is no rest between games. In a series, you can lose the first game and still win. But in the Championships, you only have one chance.""
Kendra has played netball for fifteen years, and the game has become faster and tougher. ""You train hard to win,"" she said. ""But after the game, we are all friends.""
Netball is also using more science to test fitness. Kendra believes it is important to think and train like top players. As captain, she wants to have a strong mind and help her team. ""I support and encourage them,"" she said.
Kendra has planned her netball career carefully. She decided that this competition would be her last as a player. She may coach young players in the future, but now she is focused on her last big event. When she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she might have tears in her eyes."
FCE_50,B2,"**SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS**
What should you do if your child is very good at music? It can be hard to know how to help them. Some parents might not see their child's needs until the child becomes upset or difficult. Most regular schools can help children who are good at subjects like math or English, but children who are good at music need special support that regular schools may not provide. 
In Britain, there are five specialist music schools. These schools help children aged 7 to 18 who have musical talent. The schools create a friendly place where these children can learn from professional musicians. Students spend a lot of time on music, like taking lessons, playing in orchestras, and practicing. They also have some regular school subjects like English, math, and science, but the focus is on music.
The specialist music schools are independent, which means they are not run by the government. The classes are small, so teachers can give more attention to each student. Most students live at the school, which means they eat and sleep there. This helps them be with other children who love music too.
However, there are some problems. The schools are expensive, costing between £12,000 and £17,000 a year for students who live there. The schools try to help families with scholarships, which are financial aids. Also, not all parents want to send their young children to live at school. The directors of these schools worry about admitting very young children because the environment is strict and serious. They want to help children grow up to be well-rounded people.
Sometimes, being in a music school can be stressful. A child’s musical talent might fade as they grow older, and the pressure to succeed can be hard. The schools watch each student closely and offer help when needed. Many former students say they learned a lot from the music teaching, but some wish they had more academic subjects. Many musically talented children are also smart and want to learn more than just music.
Because of this, it might be better to wait until a child is older to decide on a specialist music school. Children who are good at both music and academics can do well in regular schools with good music programs. They can also take music lessons on weekends at music colleges, which offer great teaching and opportunities to play in groups. However, this option may not be possible for families who live far from big cities like London."
FCE_25,B2,"**An Eye for Detail**
Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. The big garden around her house gives her many ideas for her art. The garden has many of her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wildly and spread all over the garden. There are two long flower beds along the path that goes from one side of the garden to the other. The colors and shapes of the flowers are beautiful. The previous owners of the house were good gardeners and left many plants that Susan likes. She also kept the gardener, Danny. Susan says, ""In fact, it was really his garden."" They worked well together. At first, Danny did not like some of Susan's ideas, but when she said she wanted to paint them, he understood.
Susan likes to paint individual flowers instead of the whole garden. Sometimes she paints a group of flowers, but usually, she picks one flower and takes it to her studio. She says, ""I don't set the whole thing up at once. I take one flower out and paint it. This might take a few days."" Sometimes, it can take a couple of years to finish a painting.
Her busiest time is in spring and early summer when the tulips and poppies bloom. She says, ""They all come out together, and you're so busy."" She also finds beauty in how flowers change over time. For example, when she puts tulips in water, they change shape and look amazing. At first, they may seem boring, but they become more interesting as they open up.
Susan has always loved plants. She studied botany in school and collected wildflowers from the countryside. She did not like garden flowers because they looked fake to her. She was fascinated by how wildflowers could grow in difficult places, like cracks in rocks.
Today, her garden has many plants from faraway places, but they grow well in her garden. She lets her garden grow freely, like a kind aunt who lets children play as long as they do not break anything. Susan is busy preparing for two art exhibitions, so she has hired another gardener. Even though she needs to paint, she knows that to stay connected to her flowers, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""
FCE_34,B2,"**Keeping Holiday-Makers Happy**
Sarah Sutherland-Pilch is a chalet girl. She is 24 years old and from West Sussex, England. This is her second year working in Val d'Isère, France. She cooks and cleans for visitors who come to ski and stay in wooden houses called chalets.
Sarah studied French and History of Art at Oxford Brookes University. She says being a chalet girl is not a career, but it is a fun way to spend a year or two before starting a regular job. She meets many interesting people every week.
Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to work. The chalet can have up to 18 guests each week. She eats her breakfast before making breakfast for the guests. They have porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants. After breakfast, she cleans up and either makes afternoon tea or cleans the rooms, which she thinks is the worst part of her job. By 11 a.m., she is ready to ski. On good days, she can ski until 4:30 p.m.
After skiing, Sarah goes back to the chalet to prepare dinner. She takes a shower first but does not sleep because it is not good to sleep before work. Dinner is served at 8 p.m., and coffee is ready by 10 p.m. After dinner, she cleans the kitchen. She does not like coming back to a messy kitchen in the morning. Sometimes she talks with the guests, but other times they want to be alone. Good guests can make her week better, but some weeks are not as good.
Sarah lives in the chalet with her friends. They go out at about 11 p.m. They usually start at a place called Bananas, then go to G Jay's, and maybe end the night at Dick's T-Bar. But on Saturday nights, she does not stay out too late because Sunday is her busiest day.
On Sunday, she starts work early. Breakfast for the guests must be ready by 7 a.m. After the guests leave, she cleans quickly. She clears the breakfast, strips the beds, and gets everything ready for the new guests. If she did not shop for food on Saturday, she does it now. By 3 p.m., when cleaning is done, she prepares tea for the new guests who arrive around 4:30 p.m. Sometimes the new guests are confused and have many questions.
Between tea and dinner, Sarah helps guests who need ski boots or skis. She takes them to the ski shop and gets a ride back to the chalet. Then it is time for dinner again. Sometimes she talks with friends, but if she is too tired, she goes to bed early."

Mandie Currie is a zoo-keeper. She spent a day at the magazine Marie Claire. ""Choosing my clothes for Marie Claire was hard because I usually wear a uniform at the zoo. First, I went to a photo studio, then to press previews, all before lunch. The zoo is a calm place, but here I was rushing around. Some people on the fashion team looked stressed, but my job is not very stressful. At a fashion shoot in the afternoon, I laughed because I usually clean cages or handle rats. I like seeing how magazines work, but I enjoy my job at the zoo, so I will stay there.""
Alice Cutler is a fashion assistant at Marie Claire. She spent a day at London Zoo. ""I wore leather boots and dark blue trousers to the zoo. They gave me a green polo shirt to wear, which was good because I got very dirty. When I petted an elephant, I thought Mandie was probably packing clothes. By five o'clock, I was very dirty, but I had a great day. When I stop working in fashion, I could see myself working with elephants, maybe in Africa.""
Karen Hodson is a nurse at Hammersmith Hospital. She worked with the TV gardening show Ground Force. ""I was very excited to meet the team, and Alan Titchmarsh, the presenter, was nice. I liked being outside because I sometimes do not see daylight at work. It was hard work, but fun. I thought I was strong, but I felt weak compared to the team. I did not think gardening would be so hard. I enjoy gardening, but I will not stop being a nurse.""
Charlie Dimmock is a gardener on the TV show Ground Force. He worked a shift at Hammersmith Hospital. ""I made beds and gave out medicine. I thought I would feel faint, but I was okay. The nurses are friendly, and it felt very different from my usual job with men. I think my job is not as important as nursing. My day at the hospital was not easy, but I felt good about helping.""
Lucy Harvey is a personal trainer. She spent a day with Ryanair as cabin crew. ""I changed into the uniform, and I felt different. People looked at me. Before the flight, our supervisor talked about safety, which I knew from my training. When the passengers got on the flight to Paris, I gave out magazines. Everyone stared at me, and I felt shy. On the way back, we had 80 schoolchildren who would not sit still. I wished I was back in the gym with one sensible adult.""
Sonia McDermott is an air hostess with Ryanair. She spent a day as a personal trainer in a gym. ""I was nervous about this swap because I do not exercise. I was surprised by how much attention you give to one person. In my job, I meet 130 passengers four times a day. At lunch, I saw that some trainers did not eat very healthily, but they all drink a lot of water. I would not change my job for this, but it made me want to join a gym and be healthier."""

Five famous people share their favorite memories of train journeys with Andrew Morgan.
**Andrea Thompson - Newsreader**  
I fell in love with the south of France a long time ago and try to go back as often as I can. There is a local train from Cannes along the coast that goes to Italy. It shows you beautiful views of the sea. It does not matter what the weather is like or what time of year it is; it is always lovely. Out of the other window, you can see some of the best gardens and houses in France. You feel like you are looking into the homes of rich and famous people. The people on the train are always lively because there are many tourists and locals, all enjoying the beautiful journey.
**Raj Patel - Explorer**  
I have enjoyed many train journeys, but my favorite is the Nile Valley Express, which goes across the desert in northern Sudan. When I was young in South Africa, I missed a family train trip from Cape Town to the Kruger National Park because I was too young and troublesome. I had to stay with my aunt. When I moved to England as a teenager, I still had not traveled by train. London Waterloo was the first big train station I ever saw, and its big glass roof amazed me.
**Betty Cooper - Novelist**  
I am thankful for one train in particular: the Blue Train. It took my husband and me on our honeymoon across France to catch a boat to Egypt. On the train, my husband gave me a pink dress, which I loved. Someone said that pink is good for the brain, and I have worn it ever since. The journey was lovely as we traveled through France and then by boat up the Nile. It was the perfect way to relax after our wedding.
**Martin Brown - Journalist**  
We were writing articles about a trip around the world and had to cross a desert in Africa. There was no road, so we took the Desert Express train. The schedule was not reliable; we were just told a day to travel. The driver would often wait for days if he knew people were still coming. When the train arrived, many people rushed to get on, and some even traveled on the roof for free. At night, the train went through beautiful landscapes. It felt like a dream, like traveling on the moon.
**Arisu Mezuki - Actress**  
Most people have favorite memories of trains from when they were children, but I do not. I grew up in Singapore and Cyprus, where I saw very few trains. It was not until I was a teenager that trains became important in my life. I made a film that had a railway in Yorkshire. Most of the filming was on an old train line that volunteers took care of. That is where my love for steam trains started. When we were not filming, we took every chance to ride the train. When I went back last year, everything was still the same, even the gas lights on the station platform!"
FCE_8,B2,"How to Get Your Story Published**
Do you want to publish your story? Margaret Stubbs can help you. Many readers of this magazine ask, ""I have written a story or a book. Who should I send it to?"" 
First, you need to learn about publishers and improve your writing skills. To sell your writing, you must know about the writing world. No matter what you write, you should understand the market you want to reach. 
One good way to learn is by reading a lot. Go to your local library, bookshops, and newsagents. Reading different things will help you see what publishers want. Remember, new magazines and books come out all the time, so keep your knowledge up to date. 
If you want to write short love stories, find magazines that publish them. Get recent copies and read them. Learn what kind of stories they like and who their readers are. The readers want different things, and the editor wants to meet their needs.
Sometimes, new writers send their stories to me and say, ""This was rejected three times. Am I wasting my time?"" I never want to discourage anyone, but it is often true that their work is not ready to be published. Many new writers are too quick to send their work out before they are ready. 
If you have only written one story or article, it is very unlikely to be published. Most successful writers have worked in publishing or journalism for many years before they succeed. 
When you send your work for the first time, keep writing more stories while you wait for a reply. Write ten or even twenty more stories. Each one will be better, and you will start to see yourself as a writer. This will help you feel more confident. 
Do not throw away your stories; try to make them better. In the beginning, it is best not to show your work to others. Remember, every successful writer has faced many rejections before they succeeded. 
Do everything you can to improve as a writer. Look for a creative writing course near you. If you can’t find one, join a local writers' group. This will help you get ideas and confidence from other writers. Think of yourself as a writer and practice writing every day if you can."
FCE_4,B2,"**No Title**
On the last day of a bad year, I was at the Baltimore train station, waiting for the 10:10 train to Philadelphia. There were many more people than I thought. The station did not feel clean and nice like usual. Older couples with matching bags filled the benches, and many college students had their bags on the floor.
A man with grey hair was walking around and talking to different people. He looked rich: he had tanned skin, a nice sweater, and a soft coat. He asked a woman sitting alone if she was going to Philadelphia. She said she was going north, but to New York. He thanked her and moved on.
Next, he asked an old lady if she was going to Philadelphia. She said she was going to Wilmington. He kept walking to a couple with matching bags. I was curious about what he was doing. I was going to Philadelphia too, but I understood why he didn’t ask me. He looked at me quickly and then went to the other end of the waiting area.
He looked stressed. He asked a woman reading a book if she was going to Philadelphia. She was about thirty-five years old and looked like a school teacher. She said she was going to Philadelphia. The man asked her for a favor. I stood a little away and pretended to look at my wrist, even though I didn’t have a watch. I could see that the woman was getting nervous. The man said, “It’s not too difficult, I promise!”
They announced my train, and people started moving to Gate E, pulling their bags behind them. The man was talking to the woman. He said, “My daughter is flying out this afternoon for a study year abroad from Philadelphia. I put her on a train this morning and went home to find my wife upset. My daughter forgot her passport. She called from the station in Philadelphia and didn’t know what to do.”
The woman felt sorry for him. I thought it was better to stay quiet and see what he would say next. He continued, “I told her to stay at the station, and I would get someone to bring her passport.” I thought it was strange. If it was so important, why didn’t he go himself?
The woman asked, “Why don’t you go yourself?” He replied, “I can’t leave my wife alone. She is in a wheelchair.” I thought this was not a good excuse. It seemed like too much bad luck for one family. I looked at them. The man was holding a padded envelope, not a regular one. It was the size of a small book. I thought, “Watch out, lady!”"
FCE_30,B2,"**Gary and Me**
John Moore is the owner of a restaurant. He talks about his son, Gary, who is a famous TV chef. John believes everyone has a chance in life. Gary had his chance with cooking, and John had his chance to run a restaurant.
When John found out about the restaurant, he went to see it. It was in bad shape, but it was perfect for him. Running the restaurant reminded him of his childhood. His mother worked in a factory, and John felt sad when he was left alone. He wanted to have time for family. John's wife took care of the children and helped with the money while he ran the restaurant. They lived above the restaurant and always had meals together. This helped their children, Gary and Joe, become confident. They talked to the customers from a young age, which was good for them.
Gary was a lively child. When he was seven, he jumped into the bath like it was a swimming pool and hurt himself. As he grew older, he did small jobs to earn pocket money. By ten, he worked in the kitchen every weekend and had a lot of money at school. He was very disciplined and woke up early. John liked seeing Gary help in the family business.
Gary was not very good at school, but he was great in the kitchen. By 15, he was as good as the adult cooks and sometimes was in charge. He could make over a hundred meals. John knew Gary would work in catering because he had talent. When Gary needed work experience for school, John sent him to a friend’s restaurant.
Recently, Gary started playing the drums and has his own band. John worries about what will happen to Gary's cooking if the music becomes successful. He advised Gary to focus on one thing to be successful. John told him that if he wanted to achieve something, he should do it by age 30.
At 17, Gary went to catering college. On his first day, he finished his work very quickly and even helped other students. John is very proud of Gary's success with his TV cooking show. He always tells Gary that to get what you want, you must work hard because no one gives you anything. John believes Gary has taken his advice to heart. He thinks that if Gary remembers even a little of what he has said, it is a good thing."
FCE_7,B2,"**Finding a Flat in Dublin**
Finding a good flat in Dublin that you can afford is very hard. The best way to find one is to know someone. If you have a friend who knows someone leaving a flat, that can help. But if you are new in Dublin, like Jo, you don’t have any contacts. Jo had to stay in a hostel and look for a flat. Dublin felt very big and unknown to her. She took the train to work there without thinking too much about it. Everyone at her school thought she would leave her small town. They wanted to go to bigger places and have better lives. Some of her classmates went to towns like Ennis or Limerick, where family helped them. But Jo was going to Dublin alone.
Jo’s mother thought it was good for her to stay in the hostel. It was run by nuns, so her mother thought she would be safe. Her father hoped the hostel was warm because many hostels are cold. Jo’s sisters, who worked in a hotel, thought she was crazy to stay in a hostel for a week. But Jo didn’t know they were talking about her. She answered an ad for a flat in Ringsend. The ad said, “Own room, own television, share kitchen, bathroom.” It was close to her job at the post office and seemed perfect. Jo hoped it would be nice and that the people would like her. 
There was no long line for this flat because it was not just a flat for rent; they needed a third girl to share. The ad said “own television,” which made Jo think it might be too fancy for her. The house looked normal, a red-brick building with a basement. The flat was upstairs. As Jo climbed the stairs, a girl with a college scarf came down. She looked unhappy and said, “This place is terrible. The girls are awful.”
Jo asked what happened. The girl said, “That girl who just left was so snobby. She just looked around and acted like she was better than us.” Jo continued up the stairs. 
“Hi, I’m Nessa,” said the girl with a colorful shirt. “We are having tea. Want to join us?” She had two mugs with her name and another mug that said “Other.” “We can put your name on a mug if you stay with us,” Nessa said kindly. 
Jo was happy to meet them and hoped she would find a good place to live."
FCE_43,B2,"**Behind the Dolphin's Smile**
People love dolphins. We enjoy watching them in seaside places, movies, and TV shows. But the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society says dolphins are in trouble. Mark Simmonds talks about the problems dolphins face.
Dolphins are special to us. They are very smart animals, they can feel human emotions, and they make us think of freedom in the ocean. We see this love for dolphins in TV shows like Flipper and Seaquest with Darwin. However, these happy images hide the real problems dolphins face in dirty and overfished seas.
The number of North Sea harbour porpoises, a type of dolphin, has dropped by up to 89,000. You might think that such popular animals would be protected by laws and cared for in special areas. Sadly, this is not true, and the lack of protection could lead to a big wildlife disaster.
There are forty different types of dolphins in the world. In northern Europe, the most common are striped dolphins, common dolphins, bottlenose dolphins, and smaller harbour porpoises. The striped and common dolphins usually live far out in the sea. We see them in small groups, and we do not know much about them. Bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises used to be seen near European coasts. Bottlenose dolphins are very social and were often found in places like the Thames River in Britain. Now, they can only be found in a few areas, like the Moray Firth in Scotland and Cardigan Bay in Wales. The few that are left show signs of stress.
It is hard to know exactly why dolphin numbers are going down. Overfishing is taking away a lot of fish from the sea, which also affects dolphins and porpoises. Porpoises need to find food quickly. If fish are caught in one area, they may not have enough time to find food somewhere else. They can also get caught in fishermen's nets, which they cannot see. Many modern fishing methods use large nets that can trap dolphins. In recent years, many dead dolphins have washed up on beaches in France and Cornwall. Marks on their bodies show that they died because they were caught in these nets.
Dolphins can also store harmful substances in their bodies. For example, pesticides can build up in dolphins. Female dolphins produce milk that can contain these poisons, which can harm their babies. There is already one case of a young dolphin dying from its mother’s milk.
Another big problem for dolphins is noise from humans. Dolphins live in groups and use sound to understand their world. In the sea, noise travels much better than in the air. This noise can disturb dolphins in ways we do not fully understand."
FCE_51,B2,"**GETTING FIT**
Exercise is very important for your mind, body, and spirit. It helps you feel balanced, especially when life feels busy and stressful. Many articles talk about fitness because it is really good for you. 
There are many reasons to exercise and very few reasons not to. Exercise helps your muscles and changes your body shape. It makes your muscles stronger and helps you stand and sit better. It can also help prevent injuries. Exercise can improve areas like your thighs, stomach, and arms. It is good for your heart, lungs, and blood flow.
Exercise can also help with feelings of sadness and tiredness. It can help you sleep better and reduce stress. It can even help with some health problems. 
If you are not convinced yet, remember that exercise is good for you. There are many types of exercise you can try, like aerobics, jogging, or using weights. But be careful! If you train too hard or lift too much weight, you can get hurt. Start slowly and ask your doctor if you are not sure what is best for you.
Good posture is very important. It affects how you look and feel. If you slouch, try to imagine a balloon pulling you up. This can help you stand tall and breathe better. Good posture also makes your body look slimmer.
Stretching is also important. It helps you move better and prevents injuries. If you stretch four or five times a week, you will feel more flexible and fit. 
A good exercise routine should include warming up, stretching, a workout, and cooling down."
FCE_11,B2,"**IN THEIR NATURAL HABITAT**
What makes film-makers Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman stay away from home for many months? They are looking for the perfect shot of wildlife. In East Africa, it is hard to find them because they are often in the jungles and plains. Right now, they are in the Ngorongoro Crater, where it has rained a lot for six months. This has caused some problems for them. 
Newman said they had to buy a special piece of equipment. This helps Amanda pull him out when their vehicle gets stuck in the mud. Together, they have made some of the best wildlife films on TV, like their famous film about leopards. While this film was being shown, they were already back in the field, looking for another shy animal, the jackal.
Traveling film-makers have been filming wildlife around the world since TV started. I talked to Newman at a safari lodge, where he was meeting other people. He said, ""We do argue sometimes, but we get over it quickly."" They do not see one another as the leader. They both understand animals in the same way.
When they travel, they set up their tents each night. But now, they are staying in one place. They wake up at 5 a.m. and make tea the night before to keep it warm. They eat pre-packed meals that they heat up. Newman said, ""We can be out for up to eight weeks, so cooking can be stressful.""
It can be tough living in the wild, but they love being close to the animals. Newman remembers filming a family of lions. One lioness would go off alone and then come back to greet her family. She even greeted their car as part of her routine.
Newman first worked with Barrett in 1988 on a film called ""The Great Rift."" Two years later, they filmed Arctic foxes together. Since then, they spend four months in one place to gather enough material for each half-hour film. Before they start, they must submit a script for approval.
Newman said, ""Amanda and I have a good working relationship because we share the same ideas. We want to make a film that shows the true spirit of the place and the animals. We want to touch people's hearts. If we can make people feel something, that is better than just making them think."""
FCE_14,B2,"**The Netball Captain**
In this article about women in sports, Suzie Ellis met Kendra Slawinski, the captain of England's netball team. Kendra was busy with her usual day before the World Championships next month. She taught at a local school and then trained in a supermarket car park. Suzie asked her if people looked at her strangely while she trained. Kendra replied, ""I focus on my movements and don’t notice much else.""
Kendra said, ""My life is all about being my best for the Championships."" She follows a strict schedule to be fit. This is her fourth World Championships, and it will be the biggest one yet, with 27 countries joining. Kendra feels special to have support from home. She wants to improve the reputation of netball in England. There will be more pressure because the home crowd will expect them to play well. Their first game is against Barbados right after the opening ceremony. Kendra said they usually win against them, but it will still be exciting to play.
The England team is ranked fourth in the world, but Kendra knows the Championships will be hard. ""You must push yourself every day. There is no rest between games. You only have one chance to win,"" she explained. In the fifteen years she has played, netball has become faster and tougher. Kendra said, ""You train hard to win, but after the game, we are all friends.""
Netball is also using more science to test fitness. Kendra believes it is important to think and train like top players. As captain, she wants to have a strong mind and help her team. She has planned her netball career carefully and decided that this competition will be her last as a player. She may coach young players in the future, but now she is focused on this big event. When she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she might cry because her loyal fans will support her."
FCE_63,B2,"**In Hot Water**
Rachel Mills is a scientist. She spends a lot of time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. Rachel teaches and does research about marine geochemistry. This means she studies the chemicals in the sea. She works at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. 
When Rachel is not teaching, she goes into a small steel vehicle. This vehicle is for exploring underwater and is the size of a small car. It can dive three kilometres down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes. Inside the vehicle, there is not much space. Rachel says, ""I can touch the two pilots. We cannot stand up or move. We must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside."" A dive can last for 16 hours. It takes three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours to collect rock and water samples, and three hours to come back up.
If there is a problem and they need to get to the top quickly, they can press a panic button. This makes a small escape vessel come out, like a ping-pong ball in a bath. It goes quickly to the surface. No one has tested it yet, but Rachel thinks it would not be a nice journey.
Rachel remembers her first time in the vehicle. She got in with an instructor on a ship. He explained what to do in an emergency, like if the pilot had a heart attack. They wanted to see how she would react in a small space. Now, Rachel has made six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian team. They went to a place five days away from the Canary Islands. There, they found many underwater volcanoes that blow out black smoke. The Russian team was leaving some equipment to study a project that would make a hole 150 metres through a volcano.
When Rachel is not at sea, she works in her office at the Oceanography Centre. Two-thirds of her salary comes from teaching, which she loves. She teaches so she can do her research on ""black smokers."" This is another name for underwater volcanoes. Water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke. It comes out very fast and is very hot, at 350 degrees.
The only time Rachel felt scared was when she dived with an American team. They were towing equipment when there was an explosion. There was a loud bang, and she thought, ""I'm going to die."" They looked at each other in silence, waiting. When nothing happened, they were very relieved to be alive.
Diving to the deepest part of the ocean is an adventure. Every time Rachel looks out of the porthole and sees the chimneys, she feels amazed. She thinks, ""Here I am at the bottom of the sea, and no one else has seen this."" Rachel studied black smokers for three years for her Ph.D. When she finally saw them, it was an incredible feeling."
FCE_56,B2,"**Interview Tips**
First impressions are very important. Studies show that people make opinions about us in the first few minutes of meeting. They notice how we dress, our eye contact, our body movements, how fast or slow we talk, our voice volume, and our words.
Mary Pearce wanted to be a teacher. She worked hard to get her degree. When she graduated, she felt very confident. She applied for a job at a nearby primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher. That morning, she saw a small hole in her jacket. She thought about changing, but she didn’t want to be late. She believed it was important to be on time. Mary did not get the job. A friend who teaches at the school told her that the Head Teacher said, ""If someone does not take the time to look their best at an interview, what kind of teacher will they be?""
Simon Grant, a hotel manager, says, ""People who care about how they look are more likely to care about their jobs. People think what is inside is important, but in an interview, you should try to look your best.""
Many people forget how important it is to have a professional image. For example, Janet Goodwood worked for ten years as an administrative assistant in a big accounting firm. When her boss retired, she applied for the job but did not get an interview. She thought it was a mistake and asked the Director of Personnel what happened. He told her she did not look like an office manager. He suggested she improve her clothes before applying again. She was shocked because she thought she did a good job and that her clothes should not matter.
How we move and use our hands can also affect what the interviewer thinks. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian found that only 7% of our message comes from our words, 38% from our voice, and 55% from our facial expressions. If our words and our facial expressions send different messages, the listener will pay more attention to our body language. So, make sure your words match your body language. Mixed messages can confuse the interviewer.
It is also important not to seem too desperate for the job or too eager to please. Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, applied for a promotion. Her interview went very well, and she was offered the job right away. She was very happy but showed too much excitement. The boss saw how excited she was and offered her a lower salary than she wanted. She thinks she could have gotten more money if she had controlled her excitement.
Finally, what we say and how we say it can help us succeed in an interview. David Artesio, a manager of an employment agency, suggests learning about the company before the interview. For example, the annual report can tell you what the company does. Mention something that interests you during the interview. This shows you care about the company.
Business consultant Marian Woodall suggests having a few questions ready and avoiding long, confusing sentences. She says, ""Poor communicators talk in long paragraphs. Successful communicators use short sentences and clear points."""

Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16 years before becoming a masseur at the Life Centre in London. He started working in finance when he was 22. He liked the excitement but did not find it rewarding. In 1989, he almost lost his job, so he decided to travel for a year. During that time, he thought about what he wanted to do. He was interested in health, so he visited gyms and talked to the owners. Paul knew he needed training to change careers, so he took massage courses. Then he got a part-time job at the Life Centre. He has no regrets about his choice. Now he feels in control of his life and is very happy."

Four young sports stars talk about their lives.
**A Darius (runner)**  
I have always loved sports. I played many sports, but I was best at football and athletics. When I was 14, I tried out for a professional football club, but I chose to focus on athletics instead. My best moment was when I competed for my country in the youth team and won a medal. Sadly, not many people heard about it, and I hoped to get some sponsorship because training is expensive. I train at home all winter and then go to Florida for three weeks before the season starts. It is fun there with good training facilities and nightlife. But I have to be disciplined. If my friends ask me to go out the night before training, I have to say no. I wish I could go, but hard work is important in this sport. My main goal is to compete in the next Olympics - that would be amazing.
**B Gabriel (surfer)**  
The surfing community is small, so I see the same people at competitions. Professional surfers are serious, and the best waves are in the morning, so I have to skip late-night parties. I don’t mind too much, but I love sleeping in, and I have to give that up too. But it is worth it because I won the National Championships last year. After a win, I always celebrate with a big night out, and if I win money, I go somewhere nice. Winning the championship helped me get a job presenting a surfing show on TV. Now, I am a bit of a celebrity.
**C Dieter (yacht racer)**  
When I am on a boat with my friends, we have a lot of fun. We celebrate our wins in a big way. Some people say we act a bit childish, but we don’t look for media attention. Sometimes reporters care more about our celebrations than our race results. I am away for eight months each year, so it is nice to come back and hang out with my friends. You can’t always focus on sports; it is not healthy. I am known in sailing, but not many people recognize me on the street. I don’t want to be a celebrity. I get nice letters from fans who want signed pictures, and I reply to every one, even if it takes time.
**D Tomas (tennis player)**  
It feels great to walk onto the court and hear the crowd cheer for me. At my last tournament, it got a bit crazy with many fans around. I enjoy being recognized by fans when I am out shopping. But it has some problems too. My last girlfriend didn’t like it when I got too much attention from female fans. Tennis players travel a lot, and that is why we broke up. It was hard, but you have to make sacrifices in sports; you need to be serious and professional. I focus on my game now and will think about other things in life after I retire, which happens early in this sport."
FCE_33,B2,"**Young Shoppers**
Shopping in a supermarket with children can be very hard for parents. One mother says, ""They want everything they see. If it’s not the newest sugary cereal, it’s a Disney video or a comic. Usually, they want all three. I can’t buy everything, and when I say yes, I feel bad for giving them unhealthy food. But I also feel bad when I say no all the time. I try to avoid taking them shopping, but I worry they need to learn how to make choices. I can’t win.""
Research shows that children ask to buy something every two minutes in a supermarket. More than £150 million is spent on advertising for children, mostly on TV. This number is likely to grow, and supermarkets are a big place for this advertising. Children often do not understand why their parents say no to certain things. Parents worry about how bad sugar is for teeth, but children are influenced by fun and emotional ads.
Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, ""Most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, but these ideas are not always right. It is good for parents and children to talk about food. If children only hear about products from ads, they get a one-sided view. Parents feel they are competing with ads and often disappoint their children.""
The Independent Television Commission, which controls TV ads, does not allow ads to tell children to ask their parents to buy things. But Dibb says, ""The goal of advertising is to make people want to buy something. Even if they don’t say, 'Tell your mom to buy this,' that is what they want.""
Shopping with children can be stressful for parents because they have to decide which requests to agree to and which to refuse. One mother says she talks about food with her children, but she feels unhappy about how she handles their requests. ""My son listens to ads but is critical of them. We talk a lot about different products and look at labels. I’ve talked so much that he thinks all ads are bad. Now, we have less conflict in the supermarket because the children don’t ask for things I don’t want to buy.""
Parents also admit they are not always consistent with their children’s requests. Mike, a father of a seven-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter, says, ""We don’t buy him sweets because we say they are bad for him, but we buy double cream and chocolate for ourselves. It is nice to buy good things, and it is normal for children to want to share that. But I still get annoyed by their requests. It depends on how I feel. If I am happy, I am more likely to say yes.

FCE_20,B2,"**The Merrion Hotel: Luxury and Technology**
The Merrion Hotel is a new five-star hotel in Dublin. It took almost two years to change four old houses into this hotel. The hotel has the latest technology to help both guests and staff.
Peter MacCann is the General Manager. He wants his staff to know the guests' names. For more details about what guests like, he uses a computer system. This system helps the hotel give special service to returning guests. It cost £250,000 to set up, but it will save money in the future. MacCann is happy with how well it works. For example, if a guest asks for certain music during their first stay, those same CDs will be ready for them when they come back.
Many hotel guests often complain about room temperature. The hotel has a system that lets guests change the temperature in their rooms. They can adjust it by three degrees around the normal 18°C. The front desk can also change the temperature from 14°C to 25°C.
The hotel is popular with business guests. MacCann thinks that about 65% of the guests will be business travelers. To help them, the hotel has put a business center in each room. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that can also copy and print, and a video-conferencing system.
Technology changes quickly, so the hotel is ready for new improvements. They have added extra cables for future technology. The televisions are rented, so they can be replaced easily. DVD recorders can also be updated when needed. 
Even with all this technology, MacCann wants guests to feel comfortable. The hotel has 145 large and cozy bedrooms. There is also a swimming pool, a gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a beautiful garden.
The food at the hotel is very important. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, who has two Michelin stars, has moved his restaurant to the Merrion. He has designed a new kitchen and improved the restaurant. The hotel now has better parking than before. This partnership is good for both the chef and the hotel.
With great technology and a skilled staff, the Merrion Hotel is likely to be very successful."
FCE_40,B2,"**Where I Get My Energy**
Emma Marsden asked six women how they get their energy in life.
A. **Jeanette Kupfermann, Journalist and Author:** ""I get energy from excitement. I like challenges and learning new things. Right now, I am learning flamenco dancing, which is fun and gives me energy. If I am bored, I feel tired. Doing something useful, even a little, makes me feel good.""
B. **Linda Kelsey, Magazine Editor:** ""I have a lot of work, but I enjoy it. Work is not a problem for me. When I am tired, I need sleep to feel better. I try to sleep enough. Exercise helps me feel energetic, but sometimes it is hard to find the energy to do it. I do yoga once a week and some workouts at home. I often feel low in the afternoon, so I think it’s good to eat something then.""
C. **Annie Nightingale, Disc Jockey:** ""I don’t eat very healthy, but I have a lot of enthusiasm and a positive attitude. I believe we should enjoy life. I like to achieve goals and have fun. I love my job and being around young people. I enjoy taking photos and writing fun song lyrics when I travel.""
D. **Floella Benjamin, Author and TV Presenter:** ""My energy comes from doing things I love. I believe in being positive. I enjoy working with kids because they are full of energy. Smiling at people can make you feel good. I try to eat healthy and don’t smoke or drink, but I don’t have a strict exercise plan. I get energy from playing with kids.""
E. **Deborah Moggach, Author and Playwright:** ""I love making gardens from empty land. I once turned a concrete area into a garden. It was better than any workout. I also get energy from knowing people want to read my writing. I like exploring nature, even if it’s private land. It feels fun and childlike.""
F. **Katherine Monblot, Therapist:** ""I think it’s important to care about what you do. I like to take risks and stay motivated. Doing things I don’t want to do makes me tired. I used to be on many committees, but I didn’t like the time they took. You have limited energy, so use it for what matters most to you."""
FCE_45,B2,"**ICE SKATING**
Ice skating has been around for thousands of years. Archaeologists found skates made from animal bones. These bone skates were used until iron skates were made in Scandinavia around 200 AD. For rich people in Scandinavia, skating was an important skill. 
In the early 1900s, skating was seen as stylish. But in 1924, an 11-year-old girl named Sonja Henie changed this. She made skating more athletic and popular. Today, skating combines art and sport. It is both beautiful and hard work.
For beginners, balance and control are very important. You can go faster as you get better. Your body position helps with balance. Keep your legs slightly bent and lean a little forward. Relaxing is very important when skating. 
To start, your heels should almost touch, and your feet should point outwards. Push forward with your back foot and make a small movement with the other foot. It is not too hard! If you keep practicing, you can make bigger movements as you get better.
Learning how to fall is one of the first things a skater should know. Even professional skaters fall. To fall safely, stay relaxed. This helps reduce the pain when you hit the ice. To get up, use your hands to kneel, then stand up.
Once you can skate confidently, you can try different styles like figure skating, freestyle, distance, speed, and pair skating. It is best to start with figure skating and then learn freestyle. Most ice rinks have teachers who can help you learn the basics, turns, jumps, and spins.
Good skaters look relaxed and move easily. To skate well, you should practice exercises regularly. It can be dangerous to skate if your body is stiff. Warm-up exercises should focus on your legs, back, shoulders, ankles, and knees. After skating, do the same exercises to avoid stiffness.
Skating helps improve balance, coordination, relaxation, and movement. It also makes your heart and lungs stronger and helps your body stay fit. When combined with swimming or jogging, skating is great for your health."

Seeing a talented child win a medal can make you very happy. Julia Gregson talked to three young stars and their mothers about their lives.
A. **Annika Reeder**, 15 years old, won a gold medal in gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games. She wants to be a physiotherapist and compete in the next Olympics. ""Right now, I work very hard. I don’t have time to watch TV, go out with friends, or do much besides gymnastics and school. I take training one day at a time. When I am very tired, my coach sometimes gives me a day off, but usually, I keep going. You can’t take too many days off because it makes you stiff.""
B. **Annika's mother** says, ""Annika showed great talent from a young age. I have seen some parents push their children, but it doesn’t work. To perform at Annika's level takes a lot of time and energy. You have to want to do it yourself. People say we, as parents, have given up a lot, but they don’t see what the sport has given us. We love it and what it has done for Annika. Before gymnastics, she was a shy girl who hid behind me. Now she has met people from all over the world and is very confident.""
C. **Sarah Stokes** started show-jumping at ten years old. She has won the British National Championship. ""It’s good that my parents like show-jumping because they train me and take me everywhere in the horse box. The shows can last from one to five days. I never get tired of it; I love show-jumping. Even without my parents, I would still do it because I am very determined. I am happy when they are proud of me, but I do it for myself. This year, I want to qualify for the British young riders (under-18) team. My big dream is to win a gold medal at the Olympics.""
D. **Sarah's mother** says, ""From the moment Sarah sat on a horse at age 1, she loved it. When she was 5, she would wake up early to exercise her pony. To qualify for big shows, we travel all over England. To save money, we sleep in the horse box. Sarah is very organized. She is always happy on a horse and knows what to do. Watching your child succeed at something they love is amazing.""
E. **Jane McShane**, 10 years old, is the Under-14 Chess Champion in Britain. ""Tournaments are very friendly. I know everyone, and it’s fun. When I play, I don’t focus as much as I should. I just look around and don’t think too much. I’m not worried about being proud; I don’t talk about my success at school because I don’t like to feel embarrassed.""
F. **Jane's mother** says, ""Jane played her first game when she was 5. My father wanted to see if she liked it. He tried to teach me when I was young, but I was bored. Jane loved it from the start. By the end of that day, she knew all the moves, and by age 6, she was beating adults. I am happy when she wins, but if she wanted to stop tomorrow, I would support her. I don’t want to hold her back because she is special. If she has this talent, I want her to reach her full potential."""
FCE_29,B2,"
Chris Greener was fourteen years old when he told his teacher he wanted to join the navy. The teacher joked, ""What do you want to be? The flagpole on a ship?"" This was funny because Chris was already almost two meters tall. Today, he is the tallest man in Britain at 228 cm.
Every ten years, people in Europe get a little taller. More tall people are being born, but this does not mean we are becoming a super race. Instead, we are going back to how we were as cavemen. We are getting healthier because we are eating better food now. Professor Chris Stringer says we are becoming like Cro-Magnons, who lived 40,000 years ago.
In the past, our ancestors ate many different foods. Women gathered fruits and herbs, while men hunted animals. They ate from 85 different wild plants. But about 9,000 years ago, farming started. This changed everything. Now, most of the world's land is used for farming, and we mainly eat just three plants: wheat, rice, and maize. This limited diet has made many people unhealthy.
In Ohio, scientists found that when they started farming corn, healthy hunter-gatherers became sick and underweight farmers. They had more tooth problems and diseases. Corn, which was thought to be good, actually caused health problems. However, farming spread because it could feed many more people than hunting could.
Today, many people are still not getting enough good food, but in Europe, the US, and Japan, diets are getting better. Now, the average man in the US is 179 cm tall, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. This is a good change, but it also brings problems. Beds have not gotten longer since 1860, and there is less space for legs on planes and trains. Clothes companies have to change their sizes often.
People wonder how tall we can get. Some scientists think we might reach a height of 193 cm this century. But there is a twist. While some people are getting taller because of better food, as a group, humans might actually be getting shorter. A long time ago, during the ice age, people were rounder and taller to keep warm. Now that the climate is warmer, we are getting thinner and shorter. If the planet keeps getting hotter, we might get even shorter."
FCE_57,B2,"**Studio Audiences**
What is it like to be in the audience when a TV show is being made? Cosmo Landesman found out. Studio audiences are a common part of making television, but many people do not understand them. When we watch game shows, we see the audience getting excited and wonder, ""Who are these people?""
Some people think that studio audiences are not important. They say that even people who work in TV do not respect them. I thought studio audiences were just made up of silly people who want to be on TV for a moment. But there is no typical studio audience. They come from different backgrounds, jobs, and income levels. TV shows try to attract different types of people for different programs.
Many people who watch TV at home do not understand why anyone would want to be in a studio audience. Why would someone apply for tickets, travel far, and sit for a long time in a studio just to watch what they can see at home? One reason is that people hope to be on TV for a second. I did not believe this until I talked to Angela. She said, ""I came for a chance to be on TV.""
Another reason is that people are curious to see how a show is made. But the most common reason I heard was, ""A friend gave me a ticket."" Many of us have never been in a studio audience, but we think we know what it is like. You sit close to strangers while someone shows cards that say APPLAUD or LAUGH, and you clap or laugh when you see them. This is true for some shows, but not all. One studio manager said, ""We believe a good show does not need these signs.""
Is there a real difference between being in a studio and watching TV at home? For Claire, being in a studio is ""more exciting."" Charlotte liked being part of live TV. She said, ""Last year I saw my favorite comedian. When you watch him at home, you miss a lot."" What I missed was seeing the live actors. I could only see the back of someone’s head. The opening scenes were far from where I sat, so I ended up watching the show on a monitor.
Going to a studio may not be the best way to watch TV, but that is not what matters. For most people in the audience, it was just fun and a free night of entertainment."

**Bruce**  
I do not like wild landscapes. I like places with people. When I travel, I enjoy lovely villages with old temples, not empty deserts. When I was eight, I went to school in England. On Saturdays, I would ride my bike to the village of Lastingham in its beautiful valley. Cycling helped me relax from school. I loved exploring the hills, valleys, and old villages. I am from Scotland, so the landscape felt familiar but also different. I still visit there today. I wrote about my adventures in my diary. This was my first try at travel writing, which I later became known for.
**Sophia**  
There is a small train that goes from Hythe to Dungeness, run by volunteers. I always travel first class because it is not much more expensive than regular tickets. The view is not amazing. The train goes over Romney Marsh with its sheep and next to a canal. But there is one part of the journey I always look forward to - when the train goes through back gardens. For a few moments, we see people doing everyday things, like making tea or folding a chair. I see myself in their eyes, a woman in a small train, looking into their homes. I like the simple landscape of fields, sheep, and a distant grey sea. It makes me look closely and find something new.
**Matthew**  
The Hartland Peninsula is a quiet and beautiful coast. The beaches are hard to reach and have many rocks, so there are not many people here. Some brave surfers come, but most visitors just enjoy the sea. This coast faces the Atlantic and is known for shipwrecks. There are walking paths along the coast that you can combine with trips into beautiful valleys with oak trees, ferns, and wildflowers. We stay in a simple place with a family in the village of Southole.
**Annette**  
My favorite place in England is the Trough of Bowland. It is a wide-open moorland, perfect for hiking. There are not many people living there or visiting. It is a quiet and remote area, and I like the feeling of space. I found this place by chance when I was a student, and I visit every year, either alone, with my boyfriend, or now with my son. It has not changed much since my first visit. Having a child makes these visits special. I feel sad that he is growing up in a city.
**James**  
I bought Glenthorne, my favorite house in Britain. I wanted peace and to reconnect with my English roots. I grew up in what is now Sri Lanka, but when I was twelve, I went to school in Devon, in the west of England. I used to ride my bike around the moors and village streets. There was a story about a place we would never cycle past: if you went down the driveway, you would never return. That place was Glenthorne. It is my dream place. It is a magical, quiet, romantic house. You can only hear the sea, wind, and birds."
FCE_42,B2,"**HAPPY HUNTING GROUND**
We are a family that loves animals. One afternoon, my daughter called me at work. She was very excited because she found a pine snake. ""Can we keep him?"" she asked. I said, ""Yes, but only for one night."" We had a special tank to keep animals for a short time. 
I got home late. I quickly put a pot on the stove to boil. Suddenly, I heard my sons screaming, ""Oh, Mother! Help! Do something!"" I ran to their bedroom. There was a problem with our cat, Domino, and a white mouse named Bianca. Bianca was a Mother's Day gift for me. 
Domino was running around the room with the mouse in his mouth. He wanted to escape with his catch. I jumped into the room but tripped and fell on the floor. Then I saw the snake. It had escaped from the table and was now on the floor. 
The snake was moving while the cat, mouse, and kids were jumping around, making a lot of noise. The dog was barking too. The pot in the kitchen boiled over, and I ran to turn it off. When I came back, I grabbed Domino by the tail and saved the mouse from him. 
I looked at the snake to see how to catch it. It was hard to catch. I sat on the floor and tried to calm the snake down. Slowly, the snake relaxed and rested its head on its body. I carefully lifted the snake and walked to the end of the garden. I wanted to let it go near a tree. 
When I finally let go of the snake, it surprised me by climbing over my shoulders. It felt like a warm, colorful shawl. My four children and I stood together with the snake. My oldest son, DJ, said, ""Mum, you are warm, and the shed is not."" 
I asked the children to help me encourage the snake to move. Slowly, it started to go away. It climbed up the wall and disappeared over the roof. As the last part of the snake left, my three-year-old son, Clay, said, ""Wow, that was one big snake!"""
FCE_59,B2,"**Drop Me a Line!**
In our fast world with phones and computers, writing letters is becoming rare. But for me, getting a letter is special. I love the excitement of seeing a letter in the mail, finding out who it is from, and reading what it says.
I have been writing letters for a long time. It started when I wrote little notes to my mother. She always made me write thank-you letters for gifts at Christmas and birthdays. It didn’t matter if they were short or messy, as long as they were letters.
When I was 18, I moved to London to study to be a doctor. I wrote to my parents every week, and they wrote back. My father sometimes wrote long, funny letters, which I loved. Most of the letters were about everyday life with my parents and their friends. We also called each other, but I remember the letters more.
I also received letters from my boyfriends. Many of them had to work or study far away, so we wrote to each other. Writing letters helped our relationships. I found it easier to say what I felt in writing than in talking.
I enjoy letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. Notes are nice, but it’s even better to get a lot of news! I love getting letters from other countries, too. I have a friend in Sri Lanka, a penfriend in Australia, and another in Vancouver. I also write to a lady in France. We started talking in a restaurant, and I asked for her address. If she hadn’t replied, we would have missed out on a great friendship. Now, we write to each other regularly. I can practice my French with her because she doesn’t speak English. She has visited us, and we have stayed at her home.
This summer, my family and I visited my American penfriend in Texas. We had been writing to each other for 29 years but had never met. Everyone was surprised that we kept in touch for so long. The local newspaper even wrote about us!
I am happy that my children are also writing letters. Like my mother, I make them write their own thank-you letters. My daughter writes me little letters, just like I did for my mother. She and my son have penfriends in Texas, too, thanks to my penfriend.
I really hope that letter writing does not become a lost art!"
FCE_54,B2,"**Careless Tourists Damage Ancient Rock Art**
Many ancient pictures carved into rocks in France are being damaged. There are about 36,000 drawings on rocks in Mont Bego, in the French Alps. Scientists are worried that these drawings will not last for future generations. The mountain has drawings that are 4,000 years old. They show cows, fields, and different gods and goddesses. 
More and more tourists are visiting the site, but some are ruining the pictures with graffiti. Jean Clottes, the chairman of the International Committee on Rock Art, says, ""People think these pictures will always be here. But if the damage continues, there will be nothing left in 50 years."" He has seen tourists stepping on the drawings and damaging them. Some visitors even take pieces of the rock home as souvenirs. 
When tourists cannot take a good photo, they rub the drawings to make them look clearer. The weather already polishes the drawings, but some people scratch their own names or drawings into the rocks with sharp sticks. 
Experts have different ideas about how to protect the drawings. Henry de Lumley, from the Museum of Natural History in Paris, thinks the best way is to make the mountain a ""no-go"" area. This would mean only guided tours could visit. He believes this is necessary to save the site and allow research to continue. 
But Clottes disagrees. He thinks this plan is too strict and will upset local people. He says the site has been a historic monument for many years, and we should do our best to protect it. 
David Lavergne, a regional architect, also wants to keep the site open. He believes it is important for people to see it, but it is hard to stop visitors from causing damage. He says they might need to charge a fee to help pay for guards, as there is not enough money from the government. 
Annie Echassoux, who has studied the site, is worried that as it becomes easier to reach, more damage will happen. She thinks the best solution is to block off some areas and have guides. She believes money must be found to protect this historic site, or we will lose the drawings for future generations."
FCE_32,B2,"**Young Shoppers**
Shopping in a supermarket with children can be very hard for parents. One mother says, ""They want everything they see. If it’s not the newest sugary cereal, it’s a Disney video or a comic. Usually, they want all three. I can’t buy everything, and if I say yes, I feel bad for buying them junk food. But I also feel bad for saying no all the time. I try to avoid taking them shopping, but I worry they need to learn how to make choices. I can’t win.""
Research shows that children ask to buy something every two minutes in a supermarket. More than £150 million is spent on advertising for children, mostly on TV. This number is likely to grow, and supermarkets are a big place for this advertising. Children often do not understand why their parents say no to certain things. Parents worry about how bad sugar is for teeth, but children are influenced by fun and emotional ads.
Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, ""Most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, but these ideas are not always right. It is good for parents and children to talk about food. If children only hear about products from ads, they get a one-sided view. Parents feel they are competing with ads and often disappoint their children.""
The Independent Television Commission, which controls TV ads, does not allow ads to tell children to ask their parents to buy things. But Dibb says, ""The goal of advertising is to make people want to buy something. Even if they don’t say, 'Tell your mom to buy this,' that is what they want.""
Shopping with children can be stressful for parents because they have to decide which requests to agree to and which to refuse. One mother says she talks about food with her children, but she feels unhappy about how she handles their requests. ""My son listens to ads but is critical of them. We talk a lot about different products and look at labels. I’ve talked so much that he thinks all ads are bad. Now, we have less conflict in the supermarket because the children don’t ask for things I don’t want to buy.""
Parents also admit they are not always consistent with their children’s requests. Mike, a father of a seven-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter, says, ""We don’t buy him sweets because we say they are bad for him, but we buy double cream and chocolate for ourselves. It is nice to buy good things, and it is normal for children to want to share that. But I still get annoyed by their requests. It depends on how I feel. If I am happy, I am more likely to say yes. It is hard to be consistent.""
Supermarkets could help reduce problems between parents and children by moving sweets away from checkout areas or by having play areas for children. Even if parents spend less money without their children, the idea of shopping without their children’s demands could bring in more customers."
FCE_65,B2,"**Going Up the Wall**
Climbers used to go to the mountains to climb. Now, people can climb indoors or outdoors. The crowd is excited. High on the climbing wall, the French climber Francois Lombard is hanging upside down by two fingers. He is in the World Cup Climbing Championships at the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham. This arena is also known for the TV show Gladiators, but both events have one thing in common - The Wall.
In the past, climbers practiced on cliffs. They climbed in places with good climbing spots. In winter, they had to deal with cold weather, go for walks, or climb on snow and ice in Scotland. As climbing became more popular, it was important for climbers to stay fit. Since they could not use cliffs for much of the year, they started to climb on brick edges or stone buildings. This helped them keep their fingers strong and made climbing less boring.
Soon, many sports centers built climbing walls. These walls were made with special bricks that climbers could hold on to. One of the first climbing walls was made by Don Robinson, a physical education teacher, in the mid-1960s at Leeds University. He put natural rock in concrete to create a climbing wall.
In the 1970s, many climbing walls were built in sports halls, but they had problems. The walls were straight up and down, while real cliffs have different shapes like overhangs. Once the walls were built, they could not be changed, and climbers got bored of the same routes.
In 1985, a Frenchman named Francois Savigny created a new material that looked like the shapes on cliffs. This material could be attached to any wall and removed when climbers wanted something new. French companies also started to make climbing walls with steel frames. Steel was lighter than concrete, so they could build overhanging walls easily. This new system gave climbers many different holds to use."
FCE_61,B2,"**So You Want to Be an Actor**
If you tell someone you want to be an actor, they might say it is a risky job. Acting can be risky because there are many actors but not enough jobs for all of them. When you decide to be an actor, some friends may think you are making a bad choice, but others may support you. Everyone will give you different advice. 
Becoming an actor is a personal choice. You are responsible for your own dreams. There are no easy ways to become an actor. You do not have to take tests, and finishing your training does not mean you will get a job. Success depends on luck and talent. 
There is a need for new actors, and acting can be exciting and rewarding. Many people want to know what talent is. Talent is a natural skill and imagination. Imagination is hard to measure. It also depends on a person’s courage and belief in what they do. 
Why do people want to act? It can be hard to explain. In theater, the important moment is when the actor connects with the audience. This connection is what makes actors want to perform. 
When you ask successful actors how they did it, they might not have a clear answer. They know some things about their skills, but they also know that their success can change. Disappointment is a big problem for actors. 
Last month, you might have been without a job, selling clothes or working in a restaurant. Then, you might get a chance to audition for a role. But even if you want the job, you might not get it. Because of this, actors often do not talk about their chances of getting a role. They find ways to deal with the stress of competition and the fear of being rejected. 
No one likes to be rejected. This fear is there from the moment you start trying to get acting jobs. You are saying you are ready and hopefully talented enough for the job. In many ways, it is up to you. If you do not care about your acting, others will not care about you either."

People wonder how tall we can grow. Some scientists think we might reach a height of 193 cm this century. But there is a twist. While some people are getting taller because of better food, as a group, humans are actually getting smaller. A long time ago, during the ice age, people were rounder and taller to keep warm. Now that the climate is warmer, we are getting thinner and shorter, even when we eat well. If the planet keeps getting warmer, we might get even shorter."

**The Farmer**  
Matt Froggatt used to work as an insurance agent in London. Now, he runs a sheep farm. He worked in the city for 14 years, but it became boring. He did not plan to leave his job yet, but he lost it suddenly. He did not get a lot of money when he left, but it was enough to start his farm. He met the head chef of a local hotel, which is one of the best in the country. By selling meat to them, more people learned about him. Now, he also sells meat online. He is happy to be out of the office, but he still works long hours, like before.
**The Painter**  
Ron Able was a manager in advertising, but now he is an artist. He started painting as a hobby and found it more exciting than his job. He decided to leave his job and become an artist. A career counselor helped him. Ron told the counselor he did not want to go back to his old job, which surprised the counselor. Most people in their forties need to work for money. Ron and his wife moved to the north of England, where they did not know anyone. They left their friends, but they still keep in touch, and many friends visit them.
**The Hat Maker**  
Katherine Goodison worked as a lawyer for five years. Now, she makes hats for private clients in her flat in London. She enjoyed being a lawyer and earned a lot of money, but she worked very long hours. She did not want to become a senior partner and work even more, so she left. Many people thought she would get bored, but she has not. She has deadlines to keep her busy. She feels happier and less stressed now. However, she misses talking to her colleagues. She loves being responsible for her work. If she does a bad job, she knows it is her fault. When she worked for a company, she cared, but now she cares even more because her name is on the products.
**The Masseur**  
Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16 years before becoming a masseur in London. He started working in finance when he was 22. He liked the excitement but did not find it rewarding. In 1989, he almost lost his job, so he decided to travel for a year. During that year, he thought about what he wanted to do. He was interested in health, so he visited gyms and talked to the owners. He knew he needed training to change careers, so he took massage courses. Then, he got a part-time job at the Life Centre. He has no regrets. He feels more in control of his life now and is very happy."
FCE_5,B2,"**A Winning Game**
Two brothers, Dave and Norm Lagasse, are using their childhood game to make money. They live in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA. They are playing a game called pichenotte, which their grandfather brought from Canada. The family played this game every weekend and had a lot of fun.
When the family moved to New Mexico, they kept playing pichenotte. Their grandfather made the game board from old wooden boxes. When visitors came, they were curious because no one in the southern USA knew this game.
Three years ago, Dave made a new pichenotte board because the old one was damaged. His family and friends liked it. One night, the brothers took the new board to a sports bar. At first, people thought it was silly, but soon they wanted to play too!
Dave learned that pichenotte has roots in India, where a similar game called 'carroms' is played. The game changed over time and became popular in Canada as pichenotte.
Pichenotte can be played by two to four people. Each player has 12 pieces, called 'pucks'. They flick the pucks across a round board with their fingers. If a puck goes into a small hole, it is worth 20 points. There are also rings worth 15, 10, and 5 points, and eight small posts that make the game harder. A game usually lasts about two minutes.
Seeing how much people liked the game, the brothers made more boards and sold them at markets and craft fairs. Many people came to buy them, and soon there were pichenotte championships with a trophy called the 'Lord Pichenotte Cup'. The brothers started making boards full-time in their garage. They have made over 450 boards, which are strong and weigh 12 kg. Each board costs $595 and can be bought from their website.
There are no professional pichenotte players or TV shows about the game yet, but the brothers hope to make it big. For now, they enjoy playing pichenotte and working on their business."
FCE_41,B2,"WELCOME TO THE MODEL VILLAGE
When you enter the Model Village, it is hard to believe that a few years ago this was just a flat piece of land covered in weeds. For a long time, people thought it was useless. One man, with the help of his wife, worked very hard to change this land into the beautiful place you see today. 
Many tons of soil and clay were moved to make the village. Machines like bulldozers helped, but a lot of hard work was done by hand. After shaping the land, about 1,000 tons of topsoil were added to create lawns, flower beds, and rock gardens. Hundreds of trees and bushes were planted. These plants were chosen carefully because they needed to survive near the sea and strong winter winds. Most plants came from local garden centers, but some were brought from Canada and New Zealand.
Colin Sims had the idea for the Model Village. He made over 100 models by himself over nine years, starting in 1972. The models are made from stone, concrete, special wood, and plastic to last in all kinds of weather. At first, Colin needed help from experts to learn about the materials, but soon he became an expert too. 
You will see that all the models are made to the same scale and have many small details. This took a lot of patience and special building techniques. The Model Village is very popular and is known for its high quality. The methods used here have been used in other model villages in England and even in some college courses.
All the buildings in the village show traditional British styles and are not based on one specific place. One of the most impressive buildings is the Manor House, which is a typical 13th-century stone building with a brick tower. You will also see a Castle, St Mary's Church, a zoo, and a mini golf course, which is the newest part of the village.
Please stay on the paths during your visit and do not touch the models. If you touch them, it can take us a long time to fix them. You can take photos from the paths only. Dogs are welcome if they are on a short lead.
To make your visit more fun, you will find buttons in front of some models. Press these buttons to see the models move. At the end of your visit, we would love to hear your comments. We are always planning new models, and your ideas can help us make the village more interesting. We also want to know if any models need to be fixed.
We hope you enjoy your visit and come back again. Please tell your friends about the Model Village!"
FCE_69,B2,"
Every week, British tabloid newspapers show pictures that invade people's privacy. These pictures often break the rules that newspaper editors should follow. Sometimes, pop stars take pictures with paparazzi, but this is not common. Usually, it hurts people in the public eye when their private moments are shown on the front page. Very few people ask for help from the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), which was created to help with these problems. Most of the time, these pictures are not important for the public. For example, how does a picture of a famous actress on a hotel balcony help anyone? The actress has complained about such pictures before. Since she was in a hotel, where people expect privacy, she had a good reason to complain, but she did not take action. It is surprising that the PCC did not start an investigation. 
The PCC should also look into a recent story about a pop star's love life. Like the actress, the pop star has not made a formal complaint. Shouldn't the PCC take action against these bad stories? This seems like a good idea. It could lead to many decisions against newspapers. Other newspapers would report this, and it would be on TV and radio. The public would not support these newspapers, and editors would stop publishing such stories. Photographers would also be affected and might not be able to hide and take pictures of celebrities anymore.
If the PCC decided to act like a ""police officer,"" there would be some problems. How would they decide to start an investigation? Should they talk to the person affected and encourage them to complain? If the person does not want to complain, should the PCC still investigate? Celebrities might expect the PCC to help them, and they could be upset if it does not happen. The PCC would have a very big job. How could they watch all the newspapers in Britain, including local ones and magazines? 
There is also the problem of embarrassment. Even if someone's privacy is invaded, would they want to go through an investigation? Many people just want to forget about it and move on with their lives. Some might have other reasons to stay quiet. They might have a worse story that they do not want to become public. In this case, the PCC could seem like the enemy.
One British comedian had problems with the press when he and his wife were secretly photographed on their honeymoon. He did not complain then, and he did not complain later when a photographer took pictures of him and his family on holiday. He was afraid that the newspaper would make fun of him and say he was angry, even though they thought it was just a joke. This fear is understandable. People think they will be targeted again if they challenge the tabloids. It is hard to find an easy solution to this serious problem."
FCE_38,B2,"Many college graduates get advice when they start their first job. This article talks about what to think about when you want to find a second job. We are not talking about people who want a temporary job while looking for a permanent one or those who leave a job they do not like after a few weeks. Instead, we will help those who want to take a real step in their career. You have learned some skills and know what you want to do.
What kind of job should you look for? It depends on your long-term goals. You need to think about whether you want to focus on a specific area, move up to a job with more responsibility, or change to a different field. Whatever you choose, be careful when picking your second job. You should plan to stay in this job for two to three years. Future employers will look closely at this job when you apply for your next one. It should show that you are serious about your career. Most importantly, this job should help you grow and give you more responsibilities.
If you want to travel, now is a good time to do it. You can work temporarily when you come back and then find your second job. Employers will be happy to see that you have traveled and are not likely to leave again soon.
Juliette Davidson worked for a year after college for three lawyers. It was a good first job because they were supportive. She learned how to work in an office and improved her typing skills. However, there was no chance to move up in that job. One day, she decided to leave, bought a plane ticket, and traveled for a year.
Now, Juliette works as a Personal Assistant to Brenda Cleverdon, the Chief Executive of Business in the Community. She says, ""In two and a half years, I have become more skilled, and my job has grown."" From the start, her boss wanted to help her develop. Her job title is the same, but her tasks have changed. She now does most of the letters and budgets and answers questions from important people and those wanting to start their own business. Brenda includes her in all her work and gives her special projects and events to organize."
FCE_17,B2,"**Confident People: What’s Their Secret?**
Confident people may seem like they were born that way, but many say it is a skill they learned. Nina Hathway talks to five people about how they became confident.
**A. Jenny**  
When I left school, I was very shy. I thought I would always be shy. When I was about twenty-five, I helped at my daughter’s school. I was nervous, but I did well. Someone suggested I take a university course. On my first day, I was very scared, but my confidence grew over time. Working at the school changed my life.
**B. Michaela**  
Four years ago, my father got sick, and I had to run the family business. I was scared and became too aggressive. I thought that was how confident people acted, but I learned that confidence is about believing in yourself. If work is too much, I don’t feel guilty if I leave some tasks for the next day. When I face something hard, I remind myself that I have nothing to lose. Fear can make you feel less confident, so I talk to myself to push those fears away.
**C. Lisa**  
People think I am very confident, but I often feel scared inside. I learned to look confident because it is important in my job on TV. Interviewing people showed me that many of us feel nervous in important situations. We feel better when we talk to friendly people. My mother once told me that everyone is too busy worrying about themselves to notice me. I remember this advice. I also believe you gain confidence by facing your fears. I was very nervous during my driving test, but I passed. After that, I felt I could handle anything.
**D. Barbara**  
I feel confident because I enjoy my work. I have built my confidence over the years. If you keep working and learn from mistakes, you will feel more confident next time. I work hard and people like me, but not everyone does. That’s okay. You need to like yourself and not try to be what others want. My company offers training courses, which have helped me feel better about myself. It is good to set small goals so you can see your progress.
**E. Kim**  
After college, I worked as a secretary. I often sat in meetings and did not agree with what was said, but I was too scared to speak. Eventually, I found the courage to share my thoughts. When I started working in politics, I had never spoken in public before and I was very nervous. I told myself that many people speak in public every day, so I could too. I also wrote down some notes to help me. I think everyone feels a little nervous when speaking in public. The secret to confidence is to keep telling yourself, “Nothing is impossible.”"
FCE_47,B2,"**Visit to Malaysia**
Paul Forster goes to a kite-flying festival and spends a nervous night in the forest. Adnan Ali smiled when I gave him his broken kite. ""You have to keep it,"" he said. ""It's traditional. If the line breaks, the finder keeps it. I have many more."" He showed me a pile of beautiful kites at his feet. All the kites were 120 cm wide and long, made of tissue paper and bamboo. We sat in the shade of the tall trees behind the Beach of the Seven Lagoons in Kelantan, and watched Malaysia's biggest kite festival.
In the middle of the beach, there were 10 platforms where helpers held up the kites. A line of excited competitors held the lines of their kites and waited for the countdown. When the whistle blew, the crowd cheered, and the kites flew into the sky like rockets. More than 500 men and boys were in the competition, which lasts for five days every year. Each person had four different kites to show. The kites were judged on how they looked, how well they flew, and how stable they were in the air. 
""Flying kites is not so hard,"" said Adnan, ""but making them takes real skill. Come to my house, and I will show you how to make a kite."" I got five invitations that day, and I decided to go to his house. 
At his home, I drank cold tea with milk and ate fish crackers in a big, nice room. As it got dark, he asked me to come back the next day to help him fix his kite, but I could not. Instead, I drove to the southern part of the state, heading towards Kuala Lumpur, into the mountains with thick rainforests. I took a wrong turn, and the smooth road ended at a river. A small boat was there to take people across. Nearby, I saw a sign that said: ""Jelawang Jungle 3 km."" 
Before I started walking, I should have known that most of the path was steep and slippery. When I reached the track, I met Baba, who took care of a kitchen and some bamboo huts. I decided to stay there, trying not to think about the insects under my thin mattress. At night, it was very dark, and I heard many sounds. A waterfall was loud nearby, and many creatures were moving around. 
In the morning, I saw a great view of five green mountain ranges. In the afternoon, it rained. First, there was wind, then lightning hit the trees. I got very wet. As I slid down the hill, I wondered how the big butterflies avoided the rain. I also worried about my car getting washed away and if I would drown if I opened my mouth. Luckily, my car was still there, covered in mud, at the bottom of the hill. 
In Kota Bahru, the capital of Kelantan, everyone asked me questions: ""Where are you from?"" ""How old are you?"" They were very friendly. Kelantan is famous for its kites, but I will remember it more for the kindness of the people."

H. Ann-Marie, 29, nursery worker  
""I love shopping, but I only go on certain days and never on Saturdays because it is too busy. I am a careful shopper. I have an idea of what I want and I look in different shops to find the best price. It takes me a long time!""
I. Linda, 32, restaurant manager  
""I don’t like shopping. I work in the city, so shopping is not fun for me anymore. When I have to shop, I don’t try on clothes because it is too much work. Sometimes the clothes don’t fit, but I don’t care too much. I would rather make mistakes than spend a lot of time shopping."""

A long time ago, people did not have money like we do now. There were no banks or shops. Back then, Mr. Green, a farmer, traded corn for honey with Mr. Hive. They both had something the other wanted. 
Over time, many societies created their own types of money, called currencies. Now, most people use a national currency to buy and sell things."

1. **Write About What You Know**: Write about things you understand. Last year, many stories were about love, family, and problems with friends. Make ordinary situations interesting so people want to read more.
2. **Get Your Facts Right**: If you describe a place or explain something, make sure it is correct. Don’t write about things you are not sure about.
3. **Hold the Reader's Attention**: Start your story in an interesting way and end it with a surprise. A bad ending can ruin a good story.
4. **Think About the Characters**: Make your characters feel real by using good words to describe them.

Hypatia was born in Alexandria, Egypt, in 370 A.D. For many years, she was the only woman scientist in history books. Her father was the director of Alexandria University, and he made sure she got a good education. This was special because most women at that time could not study much.
Hypatia studied in Athens and Rome. After that, she went back to Alexandria and started teaching mathematics. She became famous for her knowledge of new ideas. We do not have her books, but we know she wrote important works about math. Hypatia also liked technology and invented tools to help her work.

PET_27,B1,"**Grass**
Grass is one of the most successful plants in the world. There are more than 9,000 types of grass, and they grow in every part of the earth. Grass can live in very cold places like the Arctic and Antarctic. 
Grasslands are home to many animals, from small insects and birds to big animals like cows and lions. All these animals need grass to survive. 
Grass grows back very quickly after it is cut or damaged. Unlike other plants, new grass leaves grow from below the ground, not from the top. This is why many animals can live together in one place. When they eat all the grass, new grass starts to grow again, so there is always food for them."
PET_44,B1,"Kal Kaur Rai is a young woman who loves fashion. She just won the title of Young Achiever of the Year at the Asian Business Awards. Since she was a child, she liked to draw clothes and create designs. She never told her parents, who own a supermarket, that she wanted to make fashion her job. She thought they wanted her to have a different job, so she studied management at university.
After university, Kal moved to London and worked at an advertising agency. She went to many events but could not buy the expensive clothes she wanted. So, she started making skirts and tops for herself. Her friends liked her clothes and asked her to make some for them too. 
Kal found a small shop in London that agreed to sell her designs. The clothes were very popular, and none of them came back. This made her feel confident, so she decided to leave her advertising job. She took a loan of £20,000 to start her own women’s clothing brand. 
Kal's parents were happy for her and said they would support her. Now, her clothes are sold in over 70 stores, and her business makes more than £500,000. Her designs are in fashion magazines, and she creates clothes for pop stars. Winning this award has made her well-known. 
Kal feels very lucky. She says, ""What I do is my hobby - and I get paid for it! But remember, I've worked hard for this."""
PET_22,B1,"**Sunningdale Hotel**
The Sunningdale Hotel was built in 1913 and opened by Princess Louise. It has given great service to many people from all over the world. In the last 80 years, more than 50,000 guests from 174 different countries have stayed here.
The hotel is on a main road that goes to the town center. It takes about 20 minutes to get to the center by bus. Many buses stop outside the hotel, but guests should not take the blue buses with the sign ""Express"" because they do not stop near the hotel. There is also an underground station less than 100 meters away.
The hotel has 200 comfortable single rooms. Each room has hot and cold water. Showers, baths, and toilets are at the end of the hall. The hotel has a shop, sitting rooms, four TV rooms, a table tennis room, a library, and a laundry. There are also eight pianos for guests to use. Guests can park their cars in the hotel parking area. Daily newspapers are free, and guests can buy stamps at the office.
Guests who stay for a long time must pay for their room every week in advance. They need to tell the hotel one week before they leave. Both short and long-term guests are welcome, but long-term guests get rooms first.
Meal times are: breakfast from 7 am to 9:30 am, lunch from 1 pm to 2 pm, and dinner from 5:30 pm to 7 pm. If guests are studying or working late, they can ask for dinner until 11 pm by writing their name on a list or calling before 7 pm. There are 10 choices for breakfast and dinner.
No animals or fires are allowed in the hotel. Guests should be quiet, especially between 11 pm and 8 am. If guests arrive by train, it is best to take a taxi to the hotel because it is far from the main train station."

Tom Cruise is a very successful actor. But his life was not always easy. When he was a young boy, Tom was shy and had trouble making friends. He liked to be in school plays.
After finishing high school, Tom went to New York to find a job. He worked as a porter and also took drama classes. In 1980, a film director named Franco Zeffirelli gave Tom his first role in a movie. 
Ten years later, Tom became very successful. He was one of the highest-paid actors in Hollywood and made millions of dollars for each film. Today, Tom still acts in movies and has many fans all over the world."
PET_18,B1,"LITTLE CAT, LITTLE CAT, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
Bo the cat wanted to explore a furniture van. She had a big adventure! The driver found her after he drove for more than 500 kilometres. It was a long day, and both the driver and Bo were hungry. The driver gave Bo some milk and tried to find her owner. He called his last customers, but they did not lose a cat.
It was getting late, so he took Bo home for the night. The next morning, he took her to an animal hospital. Bo's owner was also looking for her. After searching everywhere, he remembered the furniture van that delivered to a neighbor. He remembered the name of the company and called them. Soon, Bo was back home safely."
PET_49,B1,"**The Ghan Train**
Mark Ottaway took a train from Darwin, in the north of Australia, to Adelaide, in the south. The Ghan train goes across Australia, from the warm north to the cooler south. It is often called the ""famous Ghan,"" but it is known for being late.
In the 1920s, there was a plan to connect Darwin and Adelaide by train. They built a line from Adelaide to Alice Springs, but floods often made it hard for trains to run. A new line was finished a few months before Mark's trip. The train can go fast, but the Ghan is not a high-speed train. It has few stops, and most passengers are on holiday.
The Ghan was first built to carry goods, not people. It was thought that sending goods from Europe to the south of Australia by train would save time and money. The Ghan is said to be the world's first north-south train.
When Mark waited to get on the Ghan, he saw that everyone was excited for the trip. Many older Australians were especially eager to board. The first stop was Katherine, where the train stayed for four hours. Some passengers got off to take a boat trip. Mark stayed on the train until Alice Springs, where he went on a two-day trip to Uluru (Ayers Rock) with a small group. Climbing the rock is not encouraged now, so they just walked around it and watched the sunset.
From Alice Springs, there are two trains a week going south, so many passengers stop there. The view from the train after Alice Springs is not very interesting. There is a lot of flat land with cattle. But on the third day, they reached the hills near the Southern Ocean. Mark's journey was over. Even if the train did not meet all the promises, it took him to some of the most amazing sights in Australia."
PET_31,B1,"**Climbing to the Top of Britain**
Every year, many people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland. It is very cold there because it is in the north. Climber Keith Hewitt talks about his first time climbing Ben Nevis.
It was February, and it was my first big winter climb. We climbed up the north side of the mountain to Tower Ridge. It is 600 meters high, which is probably the longest climb in Britain. We planned to camp for three days in the ""Carries."" These are big bowls in the mountain, halfway up. We carried tents, sleeping bags, and metal spikes for our boots. You need these spikes because the snow is very hard, like ice. 
Even though some people in my group were very experienced, we took a lot of safety equipment. This included lights to get help, hard hats, and extra clothes. The weather was good, with no strong winds, but we still felt nervous when we started climbing. Climbing Ben Nevis in winter is always hard.
The path went up, and my legs felt heavy. I was the weakest person in the group, so I had to rest more often. The others sometimes stopped to let me catch up, but when I did, they started climbing again. I promised myself to train better before my next climb.
After climbing 200 meters, we reached the start of Tower Ridge. It is only 1.5 meters wide, and the mountain drops down hundreds of meters on each side. We knew we had to stay calm and focus on every step as we moved slowly along it. After seven hours of climbing, we reached the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and the island of Skye, which is 48 kilometers away. But we were not lucky; a mist came down.
Getting back down to camp can be just as hard as going up. You need to read a map well because a wrong turn can lead to dangerous slopes in winter. I was happy we took turns reading the map. That first time, I only felt I enjoyed the climb when I was safe in the tent. But at least I made it to the top!"
PET_58,B1,"**Anna's New School**
This week is very exciting because we have moved into our new school building! It is a great place. The builders used wood to make it, like our old school, but this school is also good for the environment. It took many months to build, and we watched it being built. It was exciting to see the builders work, but it also meant some nice land was gone. The building machines were very loud, and sometimes the builders had to stop because of the rain. We thought the building would never be finished.
Now, we have five big classrooms. They are much bigger than the old school next door, which was very old. We share one room with people from the town for meetings. There is also a nursery, a nice dining room, and big changing rooms. We are excited to use them when our new sports field is ready.
When you enter the school, you will notice there are no heaters! The heat comes from us inside the school - the children, the teachers, and the computers. The building keeps the heat and sound inside, so when we sing in our classrooms, it feels like we are in a concert hall!
Another interesting thing is that the school roof has a tree on it! The builders put it there because it is a custom in Austria, where the roof was made. The electricity for lights and computers comes from a wind turbine on a hill behind the school. We went with our teacher to see it yesterday, and it spins very fast. It is so big that we can see it from far away! We took pictures to put on our website.
Even though we are using the school now, some parts are still being finished. For example, we are putting on a play for our parents, but we have to go back to our old school hall to do it. The new hall will be ready next year. We are very happy with our new school, and our teachers say we will learn much faster here!"

PET_2,B1,"A month ago, I did not know that on a Saturday afternoon in November, I would be 30 meters above the ground and having fun. Now, I looked down at the river far below me and understood why people like rock-climbing. My friend Matt and I arrived at the Activity Centre on Friday evening. The place where we stayed was not great, but we had everything we needed: beds, blankets, and food. We were happy to be out of the city and in the fresh air.
On Saturday morning, we met the other ten people in our group. Cameron came with his friends, Kevin and Simon. Sisters Carole and Lynn came with their friend Amanda. We all came from different places and did not know the area. We knew we would spend the weekend outside, but we were not sure how.
Half of us went caving in the morning, while the others went rock-climbing. Then we switched activities at lunchtime. Matt and I went to the caves first. Climbing out was harder than going in, but after a lot of pushing, we finally got out. We were covered in mud but happy and excited about what we had done."
PET_23,B1,"**Letter to the Newport Evening News**
On Saturday afternoon, I left my handbag on the bus. Inside it were my cheque book, address book, and my purse, which had about £50 in cash and some credit cards. When I realized I lost it, it was too late. I didn’t know what to do. I am 72 years old, far from home, and I felt very worried. I stood by the road and cried.
A young man saw me and asked what was wrong. I told him what happened. He gave me some money for my bus fare home. When I told the bus driver, he said I could keep the fare. I got home safely, and soon after, the phone rang. It was the manager of CityBus, the company that owned the bus. He said they found my handbag and would bring it back to me.
I got my handbag back, and everything was inside and untouched. I want to say thank you to everyone who helped me that day. I really appreciate their kindness and honesty.

PET_60,B1,"**Sharks**
Sharks are some of the most scary animals in the ocean. They are very good at finding food underwater because they can see well and feel movement with special lines on their bodies. This makes sharks dangerous for smaller sea animals that they eat.
Sharks are like other fish in some ways, but their bodies are different. For example, most sharks must swim all the time to breathe and stay alive, so they do not sleep much. Also, if sharks are turned upside down, they can stop moving completely. This is helpful for scientists who need to study sharks. It helps them learn more about these interesting animals."

PET_53,B1,"Joining the Kirov Ballet
My name is Nathalie. Last year, I was one of the youngest foreign students to join the Kirov ballet school in St Petersburg, Russia. At my first ballet class, I was nervous because I didn’t know anyone. Everyone came to me and asked questions in Russian. I tried to speak in Russian, and then they started talking to me in English, so we could understand each other.
Now, six months later, everyone is very nice to me. My Russian has improved a lot, and I understand my teachers better. For the first two weeks after I arrived, my mom stayed with me. When she left, I felt a little sad. One night, I called her because I felt lonely.
The ballet classes in Russia are much harder than in England. I eat a lot to have enough energy. This helps me do well in class. In the evenings, I watch my favorite movies on my computer, but sometimes I fall asleep before they finish.
Now that I feel settled, I really like it here. I enjoy walking around the city and visiting different shops, even in December when it was very cold. I bought a fur hat because it was minus 10 degrees Celsius, but the Russians said it was warm for that time of year! At least my room is warm and cozy.
Right now, we are getting ready for a new show, and there is also a competition for young dancers that I will enter. I feel very lucky to be here."
PET_55,B1,"**THE ICEHOTEL**
For many years, the Arctic was a popular place to visit in the summer to see the midnight sun. But in winter, there were only a few people living there, and they enjoyed the snow and ice. In the late 1980s, people decided that the dark and cold winter could be a good thing. 
In the winter of 1990, a French artist named Jannot Derit had an exhibition in a special igloo (a building made of snow) in the small town of Jukkasjarvi, on the frozen Torne River. This building was called Arctic Hall, and many visitors came to see it. One night, some guests thought it would be fun to sleep in Arctic Hall. The next morning, they were very happy with their experience, and the idea of an ice hotel started.
Today, the ICEHOTEL is famous all over the world. When winter starts, a team of builders, architects, and artists from many countries come to Jukkasjarvi to build the hotel for that year. As they finish one part, it opens for visitors and guests, while they continue to build other parts. The first part is ready in December, and each week after that, a new part opens until January 7th, when the hotel is fully completed. 
The ICEHOTEL is built outside, using snow and ice, so the finishing date can change depending on the weather. In spring, when it gets warmer, the hotel melts. Inside the hotel, the temperature is never colder than -5 to -8 degrees Celsius, even if it is very cold outside. 
Guests get warm winter clothes like overalls, hats, and gloves included in their stay. It is also a good idea to bring sweaters, scarves, and many warm socks. Guests should wear shoes that are a bit bigger than normal to fit the thick socks. 
If you want to visit the hotel, you can buy warm clothes and other things on the ICEHOTEL website. You can order these items when you book your visit, and they will be in your room when you arrive. 
The hotel is in Jukkasjarvi, 200 km above the Arctic Circle, but only 15 km from Kiruna airport and 17 km from Kiruna train station. You can arrange a bus to take you from the airport or train station to the ICEHOTEL."
PET_50,B1,"**Shopping for Furniture**
A report by Dave Worthington
Homestyle is a new furniture shop. It opened at midnight last Thursday but had to close very quickly. Up to 6,000 people came to the shop. There were many special offers, like a leather sofa for £45 (only until 3 am) and a bed for £30 (only between 3 am and 8 am). 
The shop's normal hours are 9 am to 9 pm every day. Homestyle said it would stay open for 24 hours at first. But it had to close within half an hour of opening. 
A police officer said that many people were expected, but they were not patient. The shop became very full, and the managers decided to close the doors. People outside got angry because they thought everything would be sold before they could go in. They did not want to wait quietly in line. 
There was also a long line of cars trying to get to the parking lot. Many people left their cars in the middle of the road and walked to the shop. This blocked the road.
One customer, Jenny Smith, got into the shop. She said, ""I waited in line for three hours, but I didn’t have time to buy what I wanted. The staff were calm and explained what was happening. They had to close because it was not safe. I will come back when they reopen, but I don’t want to wait in line again."""

PET_34,B1,"**Free-diving in the Caribbean**
Tanya Streeter is a famous free-diver. She has four world records in free-diving. In this sport, people dive deep into the ocean while holding their breath. In 2003, Tanya became the first person to dive 120 meters deep without help. She held her breath for more than three and a half minutes. This made her the first woman to break a world record that was held by a man.
A team of fourteen safety divers watched her dive to keep her safe. Some people think free-diving is too dangerous because there have been accidents, but Tanya believes safety and training are very important.
Most free-divers focus on one or two types of dives, but Tanya trains the same way for all her events. She spends two-thirds of her training in the gym and the rest in the pool and ocean. She uses an exercise bike to make her heart strong. She does not run because she wants to protect her knees. Instead, she walks fast to stay fit.
When Tanya practices diving, she usually travels away from home. She tries to do fourteen dives in four weeks, with a rest day between each dive. It is important for her to not get tired, or it can affect her training.
When she is not training, Tanya often appears in public to promote sports products. She also helps environmental groups by doing research and making films. Tanya grew up on the Caribbean island of Grand Cayman. She loved swimming and exploring the sea as a child. She feels that her life now is like living her childhood dreams. Because she is famous, people listen to her when she talks about the environment.
Tanya is now in her thirties and wants to keep breaking her own records. She started free-diving at twenty-five years old and plans to continue for many more years."
PET_12,B1,"CARTOON FILMS
Cartoon films have very few limits. If you can draw something, you can make it move on the screen. New ideas and computer programs make cartoons exciting for everyone. 
In the late 1970s, many people thought cartoons were only for children. But then, some directors had new ideas. They showed that both adults and children can enjoy cartoons together. 
Not all cartoon films were successful. For example, The Black Cauldron did not do well. It was too scary for children and too silly for adults. Directors learned from this mistake, and soon, film companies started to make a lot of money again."
PET_26,B1,"New TV Star Caroline Benson talks about her first TV role. 
""I never thought I would spend my first year at university making The Finnegans. I only acted at school, but I loved the book since I was eleven. My grandmother said I was just like Polly Finnegan, and I always wanted to play her. 
I took a year off to travel before university. While I was in Chile, my mother emailed me. She said they were going to make the book into a TV show. I knew I had to try for the role. My mother was surprised, but she sent my photo to the director and asked him to meet me. I flew back and got the role. 
Filming started a week after university began, so I asked the university for permission to be away for three weeks. When I returned, I woke up at 6:00 am to write the essays I missed. I didn’t tell my university friends, but they found out and thought it was great. It was an amazing experience, and I feel very lucky. 
After university, I want to be an actor. I am not from an acting family, but my grandfather was an opera singer. I have tried for other TV roles, but I have not received any offers yet. I don’t know how I did it all because I also had a busy social life. 
When filming finished, I didn’t know what to do. I have acted in two college plays since then. Unfortunately, I haven’t been home much, and now that my first year at university is over, I am going to Greece for the summer with friends."""

When I opened the first 'Body Shop' in 1976, I just wanted to make enough money to feed my children. Now, 'The Body Shop' is a big company that is growing fast all over the world. Since we started, I have learned a lot. I want to share what I have learned in this book. I believe we can run a successful business and still keep our values.
This book is not just about business or my life. The main idea is that to be successful in business, you need to be different. Business can be fun, and it can be done with love. It can also help people. In business, like in life, I want to enjoy what I do, feel like I am part of a family, and be excited by new things. I want the people who work for 'The Body Shop' to feel the same way.
Now, this book shares my ideas with everyone. I believe there are no limits to our 'family' and no limits to what we can achieve. I find this thought exciting, and I hope you do too."

PET_30,B1,"**HONEY**
Honey is a sweet liquid made by bees. It is made of water and sugars. Bees can fly very far, up to seventy-five thousand kilometers, and visit over two million flowers to make just half a kilo of honey. The color and taste of honey depend on the flowers the bees visit. There are more than three hundred types of honey. Lighter honey usually tastes milder than darker honey.
In ancient times, honey was the main sweet food because sugar was very rare. The ancient Egyptians valued honey a lot and used it as payment. Today, honey is made and eaten all over the world. Research shows that honey can help reduce tiredness and improve sports performance. Honey is not just food; it can also help with sore throats and is used in many skin and hair-care products."
PET_7,B1,"**Norwich**
Norwich is the capital of East Anglia, a part of Britain. It has been a place to live for more than 2,000 years. It started as a small village by the River Wensum. In 1066, when the Normans came, it became one of the largest towns in England. 
Norwich has two cathedrals and a mosque, making it a popular place for different religions. The first cathedral was built in 1095 and celebrated its 900th birthday recently. In 1994, Norwich celebrated 800 years since it became a city and could govern itself.
Today, Norwich is smaller than cities like London or Manchester, with about 150,000 people. But in the 16th century, it was the second city in England. For 300 years, it grew and became rich. It was famous for having many churches and pubs. Now, there are fewer churches and pubs, but in 1964, the University of East Anglia was built in Norwich. 
Norwich has many students and is a busy place for business, especially for insurance services. There are many fun things to do, like going to theatres, cinemas, nightclubs, cafes, and restaurants. There is also a football team called 'The Canaries', which wears green and yellow.
One new attraction is a shopping centre called 'The Castle Mall'. For over two years, there was a big hole in the city while builders worked on it. They moved a lot of earth to make a park on the roof of the Mall, with water pools and trees. The people of Norwich are happy that the old market is still there, next to the new shopping centre. Both places are busy, showing that Norwich has a good mix of old and new."

Every autumn, the sky in Albuquerque, a city in the south-western United States, becomes very colorful. This is the Albuquerque Balloon Festival, which happens every year for nine days. The first festival was in 1972 to celebrate the 50th birthday of a local radio station. There were about twelve hot-air balloons that took off from a parking lot in the city. Since then, the festival has grown a lot. This year, at least a thousand balloons from many countries are expected to come.
**What to See**
The pilots talk to each other using radios. They light up the burners of their balloons at the same time. This is called a ""balloon glow,"" and it is a great time to take pictures. You need to arrive just after night falls or before 5:30 am to see the ""glows"" as the balloons rise into the dark sky. During the day, you can walk around the balloons and talk to the pilots as they get ready to fly. The balloons are in many sizes and colors, some look like animals or cartoon characters, and some are shaped like popular drinks and fast food. Kids will enjoy it.
In the afternoon, you can also take a balloon ride over the desert with one of the many companies that offer this. Another option is to take a cable car from the desert to the top of the nearby mountains. This is the longest cable car ride, and you can see the festival from above.
There are many other fun things to do for visitors of all ages, like balloon races and fireworks on the first night and the last three nights of the festival.
**The Albuquerque Box**
This is a special wind pattern that helps balloon pilots. The Sandia Mountains protect the balloons from strong winds and create gentle winds at different heights. This helps skilled pilots control where their balloons go by going up or down.
**Practical Advice**
Buy your tickets online before the festival to avoid long lines. Wear several layers of thin clothes because it can be cool at night and in the morning, but during the day, you will need sunglasses and sunscreen. Bring a flashlight for night events and don’t forget your camera. If you use film, make sure to get high-speed film for evening and night pictures."
PET_51,B1,"The Eden Project
The Eden Project is in the south-west of England. It is a very popular place for tourists. When you first see it, the big 'biospheres' look like something from a science-fiction movie. Each biosphere has a different climate. They show how important plants are for people. 
Many things we use every day come from plants. For example, we get wood, rubber, fruit, rice, sugar, coffee, and chocolate from plants. There are over 135,000 different types of plants grown at the Eden Project. 
No matter how cold it is outside, electric heaters keep the plants warm. In the Rainforest Zone, it is always wet because of a big waterfall. There is also a zone that looks like the Mediterranean, California, and South Africa. Soon, they will build a desert zone too."
PET_11,B1,"Some people have said they do not like this year's book, New Writing 3. I do not understand why. It has 500 pages of good writing for £6.99, which is great! Most of the book has fiction, like parts of novels and short stories. There are nice stories by famous writers, like Candia McWilliam and Rose Tremain. 
It is interesting that many less-known writers wrote about food. For example, Jane Harris's story, Those Nails, is not good to read after eating. It has some very unpleasant scenes that might make you feel sick! 
There are also poems from nineteen poets, including R. S. Thomas and John Burnside. You can find parts of novels that are not finished by Jim Crace and Jane Rogers. Lastly, there is a little non-fiction, which has a funny article by Alan Rusbridger about some newspapers and a surprising piece by Ursula Owen about herself. 
This is a great collection, and I am excited to see what next year's book will be like!"
PET_14,B1,"**The Best Age to Learn the Violin**
Margaret Porter is a violinist and music teacher. She says the best age to start learning the violin is between three and six years old. This is a time when children learn a lot about the world. Margaret, who lives in London, likes to teach children who are three or four years old. She sometimes teaches five-year-olds who really want to learn.
Margaret started teaching the violin in 1972. Her first class had her children’s friends who were five years old. In her classes, students learn in groups. Each group has about twelve students, and they have lessons for one hour every two weeks. Each student also has one private lesson with her every week. 
Parents must come to the classes too. It is important for parents to be interested in the lessons. In the beginning, students learn to play music by listening. They do not try to read music until they have played for a few years. At first, there is a big difference between how they play and how they read music.
Margaret says her teaching method is not meant to make great violinists. She tells students who do very well to leave and learn the violin in a more traditional way."
PET_56,B1,"**Moonshine**
The band Moonshine released their third CD last week. The CD is called ""Here Again"" and it comes after their last CD, ""The Waves."" There are some changes in the band. Tom Wilcott is now playing bass guitar instead of Simon McVee, who left the band last year. Tom Simpson has joined the band as the new drummer.
The first song on the CD is a dance song. This shows that the band is not going to focus on slow songs anymore. The second song is also a dance song and is even louder. Most of the other songs are in the band’s usual slow style. These two dance songs will surprise many fans. They could become popular hits because they are very good.
The singer, Rob Letchford, shows how talented he is by hitting every note perfectly. Fans should be happy he recorded these songs before he had problems with his throat. Because of this, the band had to cancel their next tour. But fans who bought tickets do not need to worry. The concerts will be rescheduled when Rob gets better.
On this CD, Moonshine shows they can make great music in different styles, from slow songs to dance songs that make you want to move. However, I think they put their best songs at the beginning, and the last few songs are not as good. Still, ""Here Again"" is sure to be a big hit and will bring more success to the band."
PET_36,B1,"**San Francisco**
San Francisco is a city on the coast of northern California. The first Europeans to find this area were led by a Spanish explorer named Gaspar de Portola. He saw it for the first time in 1769. Even though San Francisco Bay is a beautiful natural harbour, it was found by land, not by sea.
In 1849, many people came to San Francisco to look for gold. But the people who became rich were not the gold seekers. The richest people owned banks and law firms. They built big houses on a hill called Nob Hill.
Today, many tourists visit San Francisco to see famous places like Chinatown and the Golden Gate Bridge. Some even take a short boat trip to Alcatraz Island to see the old prison."
PET_6,B1,"**SAMUEL PEPYS**
The most famous diary in English was written by Samuel Pepys. It talks about everyday life in England from 1660 to 1669. Pepys writes about important news, like sickness, an enemy navy coming up the River Thames, and the Great Fire of London. He also writes about himself, including his mistakes - he often slept in church or looked at pretty girls.
He shares stories about his home life, like a fight with his wife and how they made up, and he worries about her being sick. Pepys liked music, the theatre, card games, and parties with good food and fun.
He was a busy man with many important jobs. He was a Member of Parliament and President of the Royal Society. He is also remembered for his work with the British Navy."
PET_33,B1,"**The History of Shoes**
A long time ago, people did not think about shoes being comfortable or stylish. Early shoes were probably made from animal skins. People tied these skins around their ankles to keep warm. 
Today, we still use leather for shoes, but we also use other materials like silk, plastic, and cotton. This depends on what is popular at the time. 
About one hundred and fifty years ago, people started to wear different shoes for each foot. Before that, shoes were straight and could be worn on either foot. 
In the past, all shoes were made by hand. Now, many shoes are made by machines in big factories. Sewing machines helped the shoe industry make many shoes quickly and at lower prices for more people."
PET_20,B1,"**No Title**
When I hurt my back, I had to stop running for a while. I wanted to help more women enjoy running and feel good about it. So, I started a running club for women in my area. I was upset because many race organizers say there are not enough women in running, but they do not make special places for women to change.
I put up posters, and 40 women joined the club. They were young and old, fit and not fit. Many wanted to lose weight, but I think they had not thought about running before. When they did think about it, they imagined it was hard and painful. They did not think about having fun, talking, and smiling while running in nice places, like by a river.
At first, they could only run for one minute, but now they can run for thirty minutes! They also learned about healthy eating and staying fit. I wanted to help women with running, and I feel very happy to see how much they have improved. They are happy too!"
PET_40,B1,"**THE HISTORY OF THE IDITAROD - THE LAST GREAT RACE ON EARTH**
In the 1880s, people found gold in Alaska, the northernmost state of the USA. Many people came to Alaska to find gold and get rich. New towns were built quickly. One town was called Iditarod, which means ""far, distant place."" In 1909, Iditarod became the largest city in Alaska for a short time.
In summer, boats could bring supplies to the towns. But in winter, rivers and the ocean froze, and it was hard to reach them. So, in 1910, a winter path was made for dog teams pulling sleds. They brought mail, food, and clothes to the gold miners. This path was called the Iditarod Trail. It took about three weeks for a team of dogs to travel across Alaska. They stopped at ""roadhouses"" to sleep and eat.
The trail was used every winter until the 1920s when airplanes replaced dog teams for transport. But in 1925, dogs became famous again. A disease called diphtheria was in the city of Nome. The medicine to cure it was in Anchorage, far away. Airplanes were new, and no one knew if they could fly in the cold. The best pilot was away, so they decided to use dog teams to bring the medicine.
The trip was over 1,000 kilometers, mostly on the Iditarod Trail. Twenty dog teams made the journey in just six days. Leonhard Seppala, a Norwegian looking for gold, traveled the first 400 kilometers with his dog Togo, who was very good at finding the way in the snow. The last part of the journey was done by Gunnar Kaasen, who had driven dog teams for 21 years. His lead dog was Saito. At one point, Balto, another dog, stopped the team from falling into icy water. The medicine arrived, and Balto became a hero.
Today, a dog sled race is held every year from Anchorage to Nome, following the famous route from 1925. This race is called the Iditarod and is known as ""The Last Great Race on Earth."""
PET_45,B1,"**Sweden's Ice Hotel**
The village of Jukkasjarvi is in Swedish Lapland. In winter, it can be very cold, with temperatures reaching -40 degrees Celsius. Every year, 6,000 tourists visit this special place. It is home to Europe’s most unusual hotel. 
In this hotel, you eat, drink, and sleep in rooms made of ice. You can even have a wedding there! The bar is made of ice too, so it is not a good idea to put hot drinks on it. The bedrooms are about -4 degrees Celsius, but guests get special sleeping bags to keep warm. If you need warm clothes for outside, the hotel can provide them.
The Ice Hotel is never more than six months old because it melts in summer. Each winter, workers rebuild it. They use 10,000 tonnes of ice and 30,000 tonnes of snow to create the hotel."
PET_29,B1,"**Maria Mutola**
In 1988, Maria Mutola was the only girl on a boys' football team in Mozambique. They played in a local competition and won. Maria said, ""At first, no one thought it was a problem that I was a girl. But then the team we beat complained.""
A man named Jose Craveirinha read about Maria in a newspaper. He helped many African athletes. He went to see Maria and found her playing football outside the club. He saw that she was very fast. Jose talked to her about athletics, but Maria did not understand. She only knew about football. Then, he bought her running shoes and took her to training. It was hard work, and her legs hurt a lot.
Jose spoke to Maria's parents and convinced them that she could be successful. He said this could help their family. They agreed to let him take her to train. In 1991, Maria went to train in the United States. At first, she did not want to go because she would miss her family.
In the US, Maria met other girls who were good athletes. But their lives were different from hers. Maria said, ""I worried about my parents having enough to eat, but they worried about dresses and make-up."" The other girls did not know much about her problems. But Maria felt lucky to be there. The trainers were great, and she learned a lot.
Today, Maria still runs and lives happily in South Africa with her mother for most of the year."
PET_57,B1,"**The Skywalk**
The Grand Canyon is in the United States. It was made by the Colorado River. Many people visit the Grand Canyon Park to walk, run, and see the view. The view is very beautiful, and it is even better because of the Skywalk. 
The Skywalk is 1219 meters above the bottom of the Grand Canyon. It is a platform made of glass. This means you can see the beautiful rocks below you. Up to 120 people can stand on the Skywalk at the same time. It opened in 2007, and many people have visited it since then. 
When you walk on the Skywalk, you must wear special covers on your shoes. This is to protect the glass. Walking on the Skywalk feels like flying high in the air, like a bird."
PET_9,B1,"THE ROCKIES
The Rocky Mountains are a big mountain range in North America. They start in the Northwest and go down to the south. The Rockies are not as high as the Alps, but they are still very beautiful. 
There are many roads to drive through the Rockies, but the best way to see them is by train. You can start your journey in Vancouver, which is one of the most beautiful cities in Canada. In Vancouver, you can enjoy the water and the mountains. You can even go skiing just 15 minutes by car from the city center.
In the past, thirty trains left Vancouver every day to travel across the country. Now, there are only three trains a week, but the trip is still very exciting. You can sleep on the train, which is fun, but you will see the beautiful mountains mostly at night."
PET_42,B1,"**ZOOS**
People have kept animals in zoos for over 3,000 years. The first big zoo was in China and was called the Gardens of Intelligence. In the past, animals in zoos were trained to perform for visitors, but this does not happen anymore. Now, zoos are places where people can see animals acting naturally.
Today, many cities have a zoo or wildlife park. Some people think zoos are good because they help us learn about nature and see wild animals up close. They believe these things would not be possible without zoos.
However, some people do not like zoos. They think it is wrong to keep animals in cages. They also say that in some zoos, animals live in dirty places and do not get good food."
PET_59,B1,"**JAZZ**  
By Katie Atkins, aged 14  
I play the trumpet in my school jazz band. Last month, we had a jazz competition with bands from other high schools, and our band won! Each band wore different costumes. My band wore black school uniforms, but other bands wore bright T-shirts. We may not look like professional adult bands, but we are used to performing in competitions. The music we played was amazing, especially because we are all young. Players from each band even made new songs right on stage. It was exciting to watch, but it was even better when my band played!  
My school has a great jazz band, but not everyone can join. Only about half of the students who want to play are accepted. However, anyone who wants to play can go to jazz practice before school. We also spend time together after school, listening to jazz and learning about it. There are trips to jazz summer camps across the country. I have been to a few and learned a lot.  
Many adults are surprised that young people like jazz. My music teacher thinks it is because pop music is not challenging enough for serious music lovers like me. I find jazz exciting because it is both new and old. You can create your own music, but you also feel part of its history, like the great jazz performers before you. My school is lucky because we have great teachers and parents who support us. Without them, we would not get far with our music!"
PET_54,B1,"**Watering the Desert**
In Marrakesh, Morocco, it can rain from November to March. However, it does not rain often. When it does rain, the water pipes in the city cannot handle the water, and the streets become like rivers. Many winters have been dry, so when it rains, the people are very happy.
The parks and gardens in Marrakesh do not depend on rain. They get water from underground channels that were built in the 11th century. These channels bring water from the mountains all year. Places that are mostly dry but get water this way are called oases.
If you travel south from Marrakesh, you will reach Skoura. In Skoura, people use every piece of land to grow food. There are small squares made by the water channels. The Atlas mountains, which are covered in snow in winter, look beautiful in the background."
PET_32,B1,"**Gareth Ellis**
Gareth Ellis is 13 years old. He is the youngest son of Alan and Kath. Alan is an engineer, and Kath is a nursery teacher. Gareth has two older brothers who work in banking and computers. But Gareth has always wanted to be a clown.
Three years ago, Gareth and his family joined a circus. Kath says, ""People laugh when we tell them, but it's true. Gareth wanted to be a clown since he was three years old."" When Alan lost his job, he and Kath decided to work in the circus. They both found jobs with a famous circus, and Gareth started to train to be a clown. He calls himself Bippo. 
During the summer, they travel with the circus and go home in the winter. Gareth's brothers can take care of the house while they are away. Kath says, ""It was not easy. We had to think about many things. We only had a car and a small caravan to sleep in, and we left our nice house. The only thing Gareth missed was his long, hot baths.""
Gareth talks about his education. He says, ""People ask about my school, but wherever we go, someone teaches me. I use the same books as my friends at school, and I have a computer. I have never fallen behind."" 
What about the future? Kath says, ""It was a hard choice, but this is the best way to teach Gareth about being a clown. I am happy to say it is working, and we are enjoying it."" 
And Gareth? He says, ""I want to be the main clown in a circus one day, maybe Bippo's circus."""
PET_52,B1,"**Eight-eighteen News**
Eight-eighteen News is a news agency for young people. Our members are aged 8 to 18 years old. We collect news and write reports, stories, and articles. We send these to newspapers, magazines, TV, radio, and websites to be published. You can read or listen to the news stories and articles by our members on the Eight-eighteen website.
We have three centers in the country where young people can meet and work on projects. We want to open more centers soon. Since we started in 1994, when we were called 'Young News', over 2,500 young people have joined us. Sophie is one of them. She says: ""I first heard about Eight-eighteen when they interviewed me about young people's opinions on hip hop music. I was in a room with young journalists and was surprised by the chances they had. Age didn’t matter; they could do stories by themselves. I started going to the Eight-eighteen center in my city, got some training, and was a member until I turned 18. Eight-eighteen helped me do more than I thought I could. With the skills I learned, I got a job at 19, and now I am the youngest worker on a big news website, checking articles before they go online.""
**Get Involved at Every Level**
When you join Eight-eighteen, you will get training and join monthly meetings to decide who will write each news story. Eight-eighteen encourages members to help each other. 'Peer trainers' are members who are 12 years old and older. They train new members and teach them basic journalism skills. As they get better at training, some members present to groups of young people and adults outside Eight-eighteen, often in youth clubs and summer camps. These young trainers are always helped by older staff who go with them.
Eight-eighteen News has training sessions for new members three times a year. Our next training for new members will be in February. If you or someone you know wants to join, call Director Den Ley at 01622 657874 for more information. The Eight-eighteen program is good for children with reading and writing skills at all levels. Membership is free, and there is no test to join."
PET_28,B1,"**Antarctica Sightseeing Flights Website**
Welcome to our website! Here is what you need to know before booking a flight.
During the short summer in Antarctica, we take tourists on a big passenger plane (Boeing 747) from Sydney, Australia, over Antarctica and back. The flight dates for next year are not set yet, but if you book now, you can change your date if needed.
**Questions**
Here are answers to common questions about our flights.
**How long is the flight?**  
The flight is about 12 hours long. After about four hours, we usually see the first sea ice and icebergs. We spend four hours over Antarctica and the rest of the time flying back home. During the flight, experts who have worked in Antarctica will talk about the environment and history, and they will answer your questions. There is a camera next to the pilot that shows you what the pilot sees from take-off to landing.
**Will I get a seat next to a window?**  
All passengers get two boarding passes. Halfway through the flight, you will move to the seat on your second boarding pass. Business and first-class passengers will have a window seat for half of the flight and a seat next to a window for the other half. Economy passengers will have a window seat or a seat next to a window for half of the flight and a seat at the end of the row for the other half. While we are over Antarctica, we encourage everyone to get up and move around the plane to enjoy the views. The pilot flies in big 'figure 8s' so everyone can see the sights from both sides of the plane.
**What happens if the weather is bad?**  
We have 17 different flight plans. On the morning of the flight, our captain checks the weather and chooses the best direction for clear views.
**Will I see penguins and other wildlife?**  
Most wildlife in Antarctica lives far below the plane, so we cannot see them well. We do not land in Antarctica because of environmental reasons. If you want to see wildlife, you need to join a boat tour.
**Can I take photographs?**  
Yes! You can bring all cameras. We also have some fun photo opportunities on board where you can try on Antarctic cold weather clothes."
PET_35,B1,"**Little Chefs**
A group of children aged ten to fifteen spend their Saturdays learning how to cook. Their classes are very popular, and there is a waiting list of 30 children who want to join. Parents pay £280 for the course, where children can have fun and learn to make good food.
Bill, who is ten years old, says, ""I love my mum's cooking, and now I can do it better than her. The teachers make us laugh, especially when we eat the food we made together.""
Flora is twelve years old. She has some trouble with onions. She says, ""I love cooking. I made a meal for ten friends, and they really liked it. My mum told me to find a hobby instead of staying home on weekends. At first, I didn't want to come, but now I am very happy I did.""
Their teacher, Philippe, says, ""It's a lot of fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, but the kitchen can be messy when they cook! Adults keep learning about food. If parents teach their children to cook when they are young, the children will know how to make food for themselves when they grow up."""
PET_5,B1,"**Winter Driving**
Driving in winter can be dangerous. It is hard to know what will happen, and accidents can happen easily. Fog can appear suddenly when you go over a hill. Ice can be under the melting snow, which can make you lose control of your car. A car coming towards you might slide on the road.
**Rule Number One** for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly. If you move the car too quickly, it can be hard to control. When you turn the wheel, press the brakes, or go faster, do it gently and slowly. Imagine you have a full cup of hot coffee next to you. Drive carefully so you do not spill it.
**Rule Number Two** is to pay attention to what might happen. If there is a lot of ice, look further down the road. Test how long it takes to stop by gently pressing the brakes. You might be driving faster than you think. 
In general, when the road is wet, allow double the normal distance to stop. On snow, allow three times this distance, and even more on ice. Try to keep control of your car at all times to avoid problems."
PET_41,B1,"**Craigie Aitchison**
Craigie Aitchison is a painter from Scotland. He moved to London to study law, but he went to art school instead. In art school, he found drawing classes hard, but he kept painting. When he was in his late twenties, the Italian government gave him money to study art. He became interested in early Italian artists, and this can be seen in some of his paintings. 
Aitchison loved the green and brown colors of the Italian fields and the bright light there. He wanted to show this light in his paintings. He paints colors very thinly, one on top of another, from light to dark. He says he never knows what the final painting will look like. He explains, ""It's a secret - because I don't know myself. I don't start by painting yellow, knowing I'm going to put anything on top.""
Aitchison makes painting sound easy. He says, ""Anyone can do the colors - you can buy them. I just notice what colors you put next to each other."" Unlike some artists, he does not make drawings before he starts painting. He thinks that if he draws first, he might get bored and not finish the painting. Instead, he changes his paintings many times before they are done. 
He likes to paint people who do not ask to see their pictures while he is working. He says, ""If I feel they're worried and want to look at the painting, I can't do it."" Since he moved to London, he does not feel part of the Scottish art scene. He says he is not interested in following any tradition; he just paints in his own way. Still, his work inspires young British painters."
PET_38,B1,"**Rock Band**
Two years ago, our 14-year-old son, Ben, asked us for a drum set for his birthday. At first, we did not want to buy it because of the noise. Ben said, ""It's better than watching TV or playing computer games. It will keep me out of trouble."" In the end, we agreed. We told him, ""Okay, but you must think about the family and the neighbors when you play.""
That was just the start. Drums are hard to move, so Ben's friends began coming to our house with their guitars and other equipment. Now, for several hours a week, our house shakes with their music and singing. 
At least Ben's hobby is good for our health. When the band practices, my husband and I go for a long walk. I must say, even if their music sounds a bit strange, they are a nice and polite group of young men. I cannot say if they are good musicians, but they play often in local clubs for young people.
Our main worry is that they might not spend enough time on their school work because of music. So far, this has not happened. I always tell Ben how important his studies are. But one thing is sure: Ben was right. Playing music has kept him out of trouble and he is never bored."
PET_17,B1,"**Atlantic College**
Last week, I visited Atlantic College, a great private school in Wales. This college helps young people get important life experience outside the classroom, while also studying for their exams. The students are between 16 and 18 years old and come from many different countries. 
In the morning, they study. In the afternoon, they do useful activities, like helping on a farm, caring for people with learning difficulties, or checking rivers for pollution. 
One good thing about Atlantic College is that students come from many different backgrounds. Many students cannot pay the fees of £20,000 for two years, so there are grants available to help them. About 25% of the students are British, and many of them can only go to the college because they get help from the government.
Barbara Molenkamp, a student from the Netherlands, said, ""I really admire the college for helping young people understand each other from different countries. You learn to live with people and respect them, even if you don’t like them. During the summer holidays, my mother noticed I argued less with my sister.""
In short, Atlantic College gives its students a great education with methods that really work."
PET_47,B1,"**Being an Older Student**
I am 32 years old and I just finished my first year at university. I go to classes regularly, read books quickly, and write long essays. I decided to go to university after being away from school for fourteen years. I worked as a secretary. I earned good money, but I was bored because my job was easy and did not make me think. I felt sad because I thought I was stuck in that job. I saw students at the local university who looked happy and full of hope. I wanted to feel that way too.
Now that I am a student, I find it hard to make friends with younger students. They often think I am a teacher and ask me questions I cannot answer. I also feel different from the teachers. Even though we are the same age, I know much less than they do. But I am happy to have this chance to study because I know I need a good qualification to get a good job, and that is very important to me.
Unlike most eighteen-year-olds, I prefer to spend my weekends studying instead of going to parties. I also enjoy the benefits of being a student, like long holidays and discounts for the theatre and cinema. Sometimes I worry about what I will do after university, but I hope that going back to school now is a good choice."
PET_48,B1,"**Henry Ford**
Henry Ford was born on a farm in Michigan in 1863. He did not like farming. When he was fifteen years old, he started working as a mechanic. In 1893, he made his first car. After driving it for 1,500 kilometers, he sold it and built two bigger cars. In 1903, he started the Ford Motor Company. He used strong and light steel to make cars that were cheap for regular people to buy. 
In 1908, he made the first Ford Model 'T', which cost $825. Soon, he was selling 100 cars every day. By 1927, the Ford Motor Company was worth $700 million. Early Ford cars were simple and cheap, but this sometimes meant there were fewer choices. Henry Ford said about the Model T, ""You can have any color you like, as long as it's black."""
