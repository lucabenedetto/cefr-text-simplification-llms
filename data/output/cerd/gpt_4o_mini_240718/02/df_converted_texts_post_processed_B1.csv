CPE_15,C2,"**Garbage in, garbage out**
Charging families for each bag of rubbish they throw away seems like a good idea for the environment and for saving money. However, it might not be as effective as it seems. In many developed countries, rubbish collection happens regularly. Rubbish bags or bins are taken away by special trucks to be disposed of. This service is usually free for families, even though they pay for it through local taxes. A family that throws away a lot of rubbish pays the same as a couple that throws away very little. 
But rubbish disposal is not free. The more rubbish people throw away, the more trucks and workers are needed, and the more money local governments spend on landfills. This creates a problem: if rubbish disposal is free, people will throw away too much rubbish. A possible solution is to make families pay for the amount of rubbish they produce. This could encourage them to throw away less and recycle more, as long as local governments provide places to recycle.
However, two American economists, Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman, found that charging for rubbish disposal can have unexpected results. They studied several American towns that started charging families for their rubbish. The most common method was to sell stickers that families had to put on their rubbish bags. Only bags with these stickers would be picked up.
In one study, they looked at a town called Charlottesville, Virginia, where residents had to pay 80 cents for each tagged bag of rubbish. This seemed like a good idea, but the costs of running the program were higher than the benefits. Although the number of bags thrown away dropped by 37%, many people just packed more rubbish into each bag instead of buying more stickers. This method of packing, called the ""Seattle stomp,"" is not as effective as using machines at landfills. 
The actual weight of rubbish collected in Charlottesville only fell by 14%. In other towns without a pricing system, the amount of rubbish also fell, but by only 3.5%. Some people even started to dump their rubbish illegally instead of paying for collection. The economists estimated that illegal dumping might explain 30-40% of the reduction in collected rubbish.
On a positive note, recycling increased by 15%, suggesting that people chose to recycle instead of paying for rubbish removal. However, many people were already recycling before the new fees were introduced. 
In a later study, Fullerton and Kinnaman looked at rubbish disposal in more detail. They found that charging for rubbish does reduce the amount thrown away, but not by much. For example, a 10% increase in sticker prices only reduced rubbish by 0.3%. This is less than in other studies. To significantly reduce rubbish, people would need to buy less of everything. A small tax on rubbish is unlikely to make a big difference.
It is also important to consider other factors, like income and education. In wealthier towns, people tend to throw away more rubbish and have less time to recycle. So, should we say that charging families for rubbish is a bad idea? Not really, because free disposal is too cheap. However, the effects of these policies can be complicated. Understanding them often requires detailed economic studies, and sometimes the results are not what we expect."
CPE_19,C2,"**Work and Change**
Theodore Zeldin talks about how our work life could change. Do you feel respected and appreciated at your job? Success in a career is not enough anymore. Many people feel that their work is not valued or understood. Even famous people can feel unhappy despite their success. 
Loving your job used to be enough to make you special, but now you need to think about how your job affects you as a person. This is an important question. If your skills make you boring and unable to talk to others outside your field, then no amount of money or status can make up for that. 
Zeldin wants to find ways for work to be more fulfilling and to help us grow as individuals. Work should not just be about making money; it should also help us live better lives, discover new talents, and meet different people. However, just getting rid of unemployment is not enough. As more people get educated, they want jobs that are interesting and meaningful.
Even jobs that used to be respected, like doctors and architects, can be stressful and unfulfilling. Many workers feel lost in their roles, and companies are not doing enough to keep employees happy. In Britain, only 8% of workers feel that their values match those of their companies.
Zeldin is studying different jobs to see how they affect people. He is looking at important topics like happiness, love, and respect. He believes we need to think about how we can earn a living in more satisfying ways. 
Many experts focus on making companies more profitable, but we also need to think about ourselves as people. How many of us feel truly alive at work? Many workers feel trapped in their jobs, doing work that does not help them grow as individuals.
For example, many people work in hotels, which is a big part of the job market. These workers often have low pay and long hours, even though they are smart and capable. Hotels could be more than just places to sleep; they could be cultural centers where people from different backgrounds meet and connect. 
Hotel staff could use their knowledge to create better experiences for guests. If hotels listened to their employees' dreams, they could offer more services. But often, they focus only on making money.
Zeldin believes that work is about relationships. Many people want to feel independent at work and should be able to design their own jobs and choose their colleagues. This requires good communication, which is different from just talking. Real conversation creates respect and understanding between people.
When we have meaningful conversations, we can change the world, even if just a little bit."
CPE_24,C2,"**BROADCASTING: The Social Shaping of a Technology**
The word 'broadcasting' originally meant to spread seeds widely by hand. This idea is not just about farming; it also represents hope for growth and success. It suggests that if we have the right resources, we can create something valuable. 
We need to understand why a new technology that sends words and pictures electronically was set up in a way that fits this farming idea. Television, like the telegraph and telephone, can allow two-way communication. However, from the beginning, it was seen as a centralised way to reach many people at once. This method matched the social and economic structures of modern societies. Other ways of using television were tried but did not succeed.
There are two lesser-known alternatives that show how television could have been different. In the early 1930s, radio enthusiasts in Britain experimented with two-way television as a replacement for regular telephones. Popular science magazines, like Radio News, published articles on how to build television equipment. Many amateur inventors were active during this time. However, in 1938, big companies agreed on standards for television that pushed these amateur efforts aside. This marked the end of a chance for television to develop as a more equal and community-based form of communication.
Broadcasting was connected not only to strong economic interests but also to the structure of modern societies. Despite the efforts of TV amateurs, television was mainly used for public shows in the USA during the early 1930s and was seen as competition for the film industry. In fact, most people in Britain and Germany first experienced television in public places rather than at home.
The idea of community-based, two-way television was unlikely to succeed. Instead, television systems that focused on public viewing were common in several countries during the 1930s. However, manufacturers saw a chance to sell more home television sets as prices dropped. As working-class people improved their living standards from the 1920s, the dream of having a home filled with entertainment became a reality for many in Western countries. This trend is now happening worldwide.
There is a clear link between social changes and the way broadcasting is structured. As societies modernised, power and wealth became more centralised, and traditional communities broke apart. People became more mobile, both socially and geographically, which made them feel more isolated compared to earlier, stable communities. Centralised broadcasting helped governments share important information with all citizens and created a sense of community within the nation.
However, broadcasting can also be seen positively as a way to support democracy. During the time between the World Wars, many countries recognised broadcasting as a way to ensure equal access to information for active participation in society. 
Television is changing, and there is a chance that the term 'broadcasting' may become outdated. If that happens, it will only refer to a specific way of using audio-visual technology during a certain time of social change."
CPE_13,C2,"**Clutter**
Sometimes, it feels like no matter how many things you own, you still don’t feel secure. It is normal to want a comfortable home that meets your needs, but sometimes we want too many things. Modern advertising is designed to make us feel insecure. We often hear messages like, ""If you don’t have this, you are not good enough."" To see how much advertising affects you, try not to look at any billboards the next time you walk down the street. We are surrounded by ads on TV, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, t-shirts, and the internet, all telling us to buy more.
**Caves**
Researchers and universities around the world have spent many years studying caves. They look at how caves form, how water moves in them, and the living things inside them. Caves are a small but interesting part of nature. They make us curious and have been studied for a long time, especially in places where caves affect our lives. However, visiting many caves requires physical strength, so cave research is often done by both scientists and people who explore caves for fun.
**Weather Watch**
Many people have observed the weather using only their senses. This helped create the science of meteorology, which has become very advanced since the 17th century. Today, satellites and electronic tools give us a lot of weather information quickly. Computers can solve complex math problems much faster than humans. Meteorology uses many difficult words that can be hard to understand. However, human experience is still very important for making weather forecasts. Observations from people can provide valuable information that helps professionals understand the weather better."
CPE_16,C2,"**MUSIC AND THEATRE**
Not long ago, I thought that opera was mainly about theatre. Now, I believe that music is more important than theatre in opera. I learned this while working at a national opera house. I come from the world of theatre, where the words and the actors are the most important. In theatre, once the show starts, there is no one directing the action, and the performers and the audience usually speak the same language.
At a music performance, whether in a concert hall or an opera house, many people, like me, do not have a deep understanding of music. Some may feel embarrassed about what they don’t know, while most are amazed by the talent of the musicians. Watching great musicians is like watching athletes; we know they are doing something similar to what we do, but they do it much better.
Theatre audiences have different expectations. They often do not understand the skills of actors and may not be impressed by a long, difficult speech. They often ask, “How do you learn all those lines?” This does not mean that theatre audiences are less demanding than music audiences; many people enjoy both. However, in theatre, the audience and performers meet on more equal ground, no matter how difficult the material is.
Should music learn from theatre about this relationship? I think so. I have seen how a different approach can make the experience of concert-goers better. Live music is very theatrical, full of emotions and surprises. However, the way music is often presented, with strict dress codes and a lot of respect for conductors and soloists, can create a distance between the performers and the audience.
Sometimes, audiences interrupt performances by clapping between pieces, which can be a way to show appreciation but can also disturb the flow of the music. There is a lot of work being done to attract new audiences to concerts and opera, and to make them feel that “serious” music is for everyone. 
I remember a special event called ""In Search of Angels,"" where the performance moved from a cathedral to the town. It was a wonderful musical experience, and many audience members felt they were part of it, not just watching.
I wish music could take more risks like the best theatre does. This could happen by using unusual locations that change our expectations. This can create surprising experiences for both performers and audiences. Sometimes, it may not be comfortable, but theatre audiences are used to following artists into unexpected places.
I know that most plays are performed in traditional ways, similar to concerts. However, I believe that music can and should change how it is presented. I love both theatre and music, and I want more people to enjoy them as much as I do."
CPE_21,C2,"**Sand**  
I admire how sand can be changed into useful things like glass and concrete, but I don’t really like it when it is just sand. To me, it is mostly a problem that gets in the way between a parking lot and the sea. It blows in your face, gets into your food, and can hide important things like car keys and coins. When you are wet, sand sticks to you and is hard to get off, even with a strong hose. But here’s the strange part: as soon as you step onto a beach towel, get into a car, or walk on a clean carpet, the sand falls off you. For days, you keep finding sand on the floor every time you take off your shoes, and even more comes out when you take off your socks. Sand stays with you longer than some illnesses. So, I would rather not have sand around.
**Lock and Key**  
People have always wanted a safe home where they can feel private and secure. In the past, a simple rope was used to lock doors, but now we have electronic locks that work with plastic cards. However, many people still prefer the feeling of using a real key. Even if they use electronic locks at work, they want the comfort of turning a physical key at home. Because of this, when a company made a new electronic lock, they included a real metal key in it.
**Modern Art**  
I was nervous about going to the new Tate Modern gallery because, like many people, I find modern art confusing. I do like some pieces, especially furry things, neon lights, and big photos. Maybe if I knew more about it, I would have stronger opinions. But art is not just about understanding; it’s about feeling something from it. This gallery tries to help visitors understand the art better. The first thing I noticed was the labels that explained the art and what it means. Instead of just looking at the pictures without understanding, these labels helped me learn more about them."
CPE_46,C2,"**Every Picture Tells a Story**
**Adapting Novels for Film**  
Turning a novel into a film usually means cutting down the story. This can be frustrating for writers, but it can also be helpful. While writing a script, I realized that I could remove a lot of dialogue and descriptions from the book and still keep the main idea. This does not mean that the original words were not important. It is about how each medium (book or film) asks the audience to pay attention in different ways. 
In a novel, some details are repeated to help readers remember characters and their traits. For example, we often see phrases like ""he said"" to show who is speaking. In a play, the dialogue mimics real conversations, but sometimes it can be too much, making it hard to understand the main message.
**Watching Movies**  
When we watch movies, we can feel like we are part of the story. It takes us away from our everyday lives, at least for the time the film lasts. However, when the movie ends and the lights come on, we return to reality. Many people, especially older generations, did not see movies as art; they thought of them as just entertainment. They enjoyed watching films but did not respect them as a serious art form.
**The Film Studios**  
The Leiper Film Company studios were made up of many different buildings. It was confusing to find your way around because there were no clear signs. There were three main entrances, but none of them helped visitors understand where to go. Most people who worked there knew how to navigate the studio, but it was still a confusing place for newcomers. The employees worked together to create stories of romance and adventure that would entertain audiences.
**Film-Makers**  
Many people want to make movies. Bookstores have many guides on how to write scripts and produce films. Universities offer courses, and there are competitions for aspiring filmmakers. For example, Robert Rodriguez made his film *El Mariachi* for only $7,000, which helped him become a well-known director. He wrote about how he felt pressure to succeed before he turned 26, just like famous directors did at a young age.
In the past, filmmakers had to work for years in different roles, like editing or writing, before they could direct their own films. For example, John Huston was 35 when he made his first film, *The Maltese Falcon*. Today, without the support of big studios, new filmmakers often have to find their own way to create movies."
CPE_3,C2,"In the past, the council houses were all over the western side of the city. They were rows of small, old houses made of orange brick or pale white plaster. In summer, the smell from a factory nearby filled the air, and in the mornings, a paperboy often looked disgusted as he walked past the houses. I have forgotten much of my early life, but I remember sitting near an upstairs window and looking at the houses in the distance. I also have memories of my mother ironing towels in a house that I think was not ours, and snow falling on a big mansion.
My mother appears in these memories. She was a small, precise woman who was often angry, and I never understood why. Even as a child, I noticed that she was very lonely, feeling alone even in a room full of people. She had strict rules about how to behave, which I found hard to understand. For example, we were not allowed to walk into our neighbors' gardens or disturb their flowers. We had to sit quietly at the dining table, listening to the radio shows she liked. There were many rules like this.
Over time, I remember other people in our lives. My mother had a few friends, like Mrs. Buddery, who loved the Royal Family, Mrs. Winall, who rarely spoke, and Mrs. Laband, who was more lively but not always liked by the others. Looking back, I see that they often talked about their problems, like bad legs and the cold weather, and I sometimes felt like I was part of their complaints.
It felt like a heavy weight of rules and expectations was on my shoulders, and I wanted to break free from it. Growing up in West Earlham followed a clear pattern. Until I was five, I stayed at home, sometimes bothering my mother. I remember long days playing on the rug while she sat in a chair. After my fifth birthday, I went to Avenue Road infants school, which was half a mile away. Some lucky kids had mothers who could take them on bikes, but my mother usually let me go with other children.
I remember the summer holidays when I saw a little of the world outside West Earlham. There was an old man next door who told stories about his time at sea, and once I went to a charity event where a kind woman offered lemonade. My mother, however, did not trust the charity and thought they only wanted money. She often spoke badly about politicians, seeing them as greedy people.
Despite her strictness, my mother cared about my education. Sometimes, she took me to the Norwich Castle Museum on Sundays. We would walk through the rooms filled with paintings. At first, she was unsure about this, but eventually, she started to have opinions about the art. I remember one time she joked about a painting of a Roman soldier, saying she wouldn’t want to meet him at night. This was a rare moment of humor from her."
CPE_10,C2,"**Philadelphia Avenue**
I walked down Philadelphia Avenue on the side with odd numbers. It was getting dark, and the air felt thick and damp, making my walk feel secretive. I knew this side of the street very well. I remembered our neighbors, the Matzes and the Pritchards, and Han Kieffer's grocery store. The Krings and the Pottses lived nearby, and they were my first friends, all girls. 
Even though I didn’t know everyone’s name, I recognized each house. I remembered the small channels in the sidewalk that carried rainwater from the roofs to the street. As I skated or rode my scooter, I noticed that the street sloped downwards, and the houses changed too. The porches became lower, and the front yards got smaller. 
Over the years, things changed. Wooden railings and posts were replaced with iron ones that looked a bit Southern or Spanish. In Shillington, some houses I remembered as homes became stores, and some stores, like Pep Conrad's and Han Kieffer's, turned back into homes. I wondered how people lived in those spaces that used to be shops. 
**Bachelor Fads Furniture Designer Rick Gilbert**
Rick Gilbert lives in a flat that used to be a curtain warehouse. It has classic loft features like exposed brick and big doors. These doors were once used to lift curtains from trains nearby. But Rick didn’t want a big empty space. He wanted to separate his living area from his work area. 
He said, “In my last place, my living and working spaces were mixed. It was hard to relax or start working when everything was in view.” So, he used a large piece of corrugated plastic to create a hallway and hide his office. He wanted the kitchen to be a neutral space where he could cook for friends or make coffee for clients. 
To make the flat feel warmer, he chose light wood for the floors. Although he has modern chairs and sofas, he also has sentimental furniture from his parents or things he bought at markets.
**Bruce Chatwin**
Bruce Chatwin was a writer who loved to travel. His life was full of secrets and stories, and he was a unique writer. His first book, *In Patagonia*, published in 1977, changed travel writing. It was exciting like a thriller and had the charm of romantic fiction. 
In this book, Chatwin mixed facts with fiction. He sometimes changed details to make the stories more interesting. He believed that traveling could help people discover amazing histories that were waiting to be found.
**Swimming**
One summer day in 1996, it was raining heavily. I ran across the lawn behind my house and jumped into the pool. As I swam, I watched the raindrops hit the water, creating little fountains. The best moments were when the rain got stronger, and the sound of birds disappeared. A mist rose from the pool, making it feel like the water was reaching for the sky.
During this rainy time, I thought about swimming across Britain. I wanted to follow the rain as it traveled to the sea. I felt frustrated with my usual swimming routine, like a tiger pacing in a cage. 
Many places today have signs and labels that tell us what to think. This makes us see the world in a different way. That’s why walking, cycling, and swimming are special. They help us connect with nature and explore the world beyond what is officially shown to us. A swimming journey would let me discover parts of the world that still feel mysterious, like dark woods or high mountains."
CPE_67,C2,"**Crying**
Charles Darwin thought that crying did not have a clear purpose in human evolution. However, he was likely wrong. Recently, scientists have shown that crying is important for social reasons. Psychiatrist John Bowlby pointed out that crying helps create a strong bond between a mother and her child. Many people believe that children cry mainly because they feel helpless.
It is harder to understand why adults cry. The sound of crying is not as important as the way it looks. In early human groups, crying may have helped people trust each other and feel connected. 
People cry for different reasons. We might cry to show sympathy for someone who is suffering. Sometimes, we cry without meaning to, like when we hear beautiful music or moving speeches. We are also more likely to cry when we watch a sad movie with others than when we are alone. 
The social reasons for crying are clear, but research on this topic is still ongoing."
CPE_27,C2,"**The Heat is On**
We have all heard about global warming, but how much warmer will the Earth get and how will it change our lives? Most people know a little about global warming, but many are unsure about what it will mean for us. A warmer climate will likely change the weather everywhere in the world. Since the atmosphere affects everything on our planet, any climate changes will have important effects on plants, animals, water, and soil.
Humans have learned to use natural resources to help us grow food, build cities, and support billions of people. So, any changes to these resources are very serious. The challenge we face is understanding how the world will change and what is causing these changes. Over the last 100 years, human activities have increased the amount of certain gases in the atmosphere, which are linked to global temperature. These gases are likely affecting the climate, but we do not fully understand how.
We know that the levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have changed together with global temperatures for the last 40,000 years. This suggests that they are related. Evidence shows that the Earth's surface has warmed by about 6°C in the last century. Most scientists believe this warming is not just a natural process but is partly caused by human pollution.
A lot of research has been done to predict what will happen because of higher global temperatures. Scientists use computer programs called general circulation models (GCMs) to help with these predictions. These programs analyze how temperature, pressure, sunlight, and other factors interact to predict climate conditions. However, these models are not perfect and can be slow and expensive to use. We still do not understand all the processes in the climate system, even though we know it is complex.
Despite these challenges, most people agree that climate change will happen faster than we have seen before. The predictions from GCMs suggest that by the year 2100, the average global temperature could rise by 1°C to 3.5°C. Sea levels may rise by 15 to 95 cm, and we can expect changes in rainfall patterns. Scientists also think that extreme weather events, like heatwaves, floods, and droughts, will happen more often in some areas.
These changes could greatly affect the environment and human life. Climate change can change where ecosystems, like forests and grasslands, are located, what species live there, and how they provide resources we need, like food and water. Some effects may be harmful, but not all changes will be bad. In some places, climate change may even have positive effects. For example, in Australia, wheat production has increased because of warmer temperatures, which have led to fewer frosts that damage crops.
However, many predicted effects of climate change are concerning. Even small changes in climate can affect water availability, especially in dry areas. For example, the Mediterranean region has seen less rainfall in recent years, and rain is now falling in shorter periods. 
Another serious effect of climate change is on glaciers. Changes in ice will affect plants, animals, and human structures. The Arctic ice is likely to melt completely, which could make shipping and oil exploration easier but also increase the risk of icebergs.
The most visible effect of global warming will be rising sea levels. This happens because warmer water takes up more space and because ice is melting. Since about half of the world's population lives near coastlines, rising sea levels could have severe consequences. Cities like London, New York, and Tokyo could face significant flooding, and many people could lose their homes and jobs, creating millions of environmental refugees.
The worst effects will likely be felt by small, low-lying island nations, which could disappear if the worst predictions come true. This would be devastating for the people and cultures of these islands, as well as for the countries that would have to take in those who are displaced."
CPE_66,C2,"**Mission to Mars**
Wanted: a married couple in their middle age for a 501-day trip to Mars. Applicants must be strong both physically and emotionally. This couple could be the first astronauts on Mars if Dennis Tito, a wealthy businessman, can launch a spacecraft on January 5, 2018. 
The spacecraft will take the crew to about 160 km above Mars. It will use Mars' gravity to help it return to Earth without using extra fuel. Saving fuel is very important because the next time Mars and Earth will be in the right position for a launch is not until 2031. 
This is a big challenge, and there is a race to create new technologies for the mission. If these technologies are ready in time, the spacecraft might succeed. Even if the mission does not happen, the work done will help future space missions."
CPE_44,C2,"**AESTHETICS**
Sometimes, the existence of art makes it hard to understand art itself. This is because art is a physical object, like a building, book, painting, or statue, that exists outside of our personal experiences. People often think of art only as these objects, not as what they mean or how they affect us. 
When a piece of art becomes very famous or is seen as a classic, it can be hard to see it in a new way. This fame can create rules and ideas that stop us from understanding the art's true meaning. When we separate art from the people and experiences that created it, we lose sight of its importance in our lives. Art then seems to exist in its own world, away from everything else we do as humans.
A key job for anyone writing about art is to connect these beautiful works back to everyday life. Just like mountains are part of the earth, art is part of our human experience. Those who study the earth, like geographers and geologists, show how mountains are connected to the earth. Similarly, those who study art must show how it connects to our daily lives.
To really understand art, we sometimes need to forget about the art itself for a moment. We should look at the everyday experiences that we usually don’t think of as art. Understanding art requires us to take a different path. For example, we can enjoy flowers without knowing much about how they grow. But if we want to understand how they bloom, we need to learn about the soil, air, water, and sunlight that help them grow.
To appreciate art fully, we should start with the simple experiences that catch our attention and make us happy. However, many people think of art as something separate and special, which can make them feel less connected to it. The things that people enjoy the most today, like movies, jazz, and comic strips, are often not seen as ""art."" When people think of art as only what is in museums, they miss out on the joy found in everyday experiences.
Many who disagree with the idea of art being only in museums still hold onto the belief that art is separate from daily life. The best appreciation of art happens when it is connected to the things we do every day."
CPE_22,C2,"**Observing Lions**
Many people think that lions hunting together is a beautiful sight. At sunset, a group of lions quietly moves in to catch their prey. They seem to work well together, showing that they are social animals. However, after studying lions in the wild for many years, we have a different view. 
When we began our research in 1978, we wanted to understand why lions hunt together, raise their young, and scare off other animals with their loud roars. We thought that working together would help them survive and have more cubs. But if one lion helps too much, it might not benefit from it. So, why do lions cooperate? We thought we would find the answer in a few years, but lions are very good at being lazy. 
It took us a long time to learn about their behavior. Since wild lions can live up to 18 years, we are only now starting to understand their actions.
**Pop Music Review**
The release of Bedrock's third album was an important moment for the band. Their album, ""New Life,"" changed rock music in the country for many years. It moved away from the serious and dull music of the past and introduced a lighter, more melodic style. 
The album mixed social commentary with strong emotions, using sounds from fairground organs and brass bands. It had humor and showed the band’s roots. Bedrock proved to be talented songwriters, writing about traditional English themes like sunbathing and Sunday afternoons. 
However, the best songs on the album, like ""So Low"" and ""To the Brink,"" had deeper feelings. ""New Life"" is impressive because it has 16 high-quality tracks with no weak songs, which is rare for long albums.
**Extract from an Autobiography**
As a child, I was always interested in stories about 'The Sibyl,' wise women from ancient times. I first heard about one from a story my mother told me. An old woman from Cumae offered the King of Rome nine books for a lot of money. When he refused, she burned some books and offered him fewer for the same price. In the end, he bought the last three for the full price. I learned a valuable lesson about sales and life from this story.
I was often lonely as an only child. When I wanted to play with other kids and they said no, my mother told me to do something interesting so they would want to join me. This advice worked, and I have never forgotten it.
When I got the chance to write a travel book, I looked for a topic that mattered to me. I don’t like to travel much, so I gave my editor a long list of places I didn’t want to go. I prefer to explore ruins because I enjoy traveling through time in my mind.
**What Happens to Your Manuscript?**
When you send your manuscript to a publisher, it usually goes into a pile of other manuscripts waiting to be read. This pile is called the ""slush pile."" The first person to read it is often a junior editor or a more experienced editor who works part-time. They want to find something new and interesting.
If they like your novel, they will show it to a senior editor. This editor will need to explain why your book is good and if it can sell well. They will also consider if you, as an author, have the potential to be successful in the future. Publishers often want to meet authors before making an offer to help promote the book."
CPE_39,C2,"**Advertising on Trial**
If you work in an advertising agency, the early 1990s were very tough years. The economy was in a recession, which was worse than expected. This affected many countries, including Britain. In 1991, the economy shrank, interest rates were very high, and many people lost their jobs. Over half a million people were unemployed, and many homes were taken back by banks. All businesses suffered, especially in industries like cars and construction, which saw a 30% drop in work.
People in advertising were not the only ones losing their jobs, but those who kept their jobs felt a lot of pressure. They were expected to help their companies make money, and they felt their work was being closely watched. At the same time, they had to do their jobs with smaller budgets. They were told to do more with less money. 
Despite these challenges, marketing became more important. Companies started to focus on what customers really wanted instead of just what was easy for them to sell. In the last ten to fifteen years, many companies began to take marketing seriously. This change helped marketing professionals gain more respect, but it also made their jobs harder.
About half of marketing budgets go to advertising, so advertising people are often seen as responsible for results. The 1980s were good for advertising, but the early 1990s were the worst times for the industry in a long time. The bad economy made companies cut their advertising budgets and question how effective their advertising was. They wanted to know what they were getting for their money and if advertising was worth it.
Many companies wanted better advertising strategies, creativity, and media placement. They wanted the best people from advertising agencies to work for them and to be motivated to create great ads. While this situation is tough for advertising professionals, it also means they face the same problems as their clients: how to achieve more with less.
Several factors made creating effective advertising even harder. The recession caused debates about production costs and made companies less willing to take risks, which are often necessary for good advertising. Other changes, like shifts in population, the growing power of retailers, changing consumer needs, and stricter advertising laws, also made things difficult. Some companies even had to start advertising in other countries.
Because of these challenges, advertising professionals are under pressure to make their advertising more effective. However, help for them is not easy to find. Companies and advertising agencies are too busy dealing with these problems to share their experiences. Those who have managed to succeed often keep their strategies secret. This means that while some events may provide useful information, many books on advertising do not help much. They often suggest that all advertising work is of high quality and good value, which is not true and does not help the employees who are responsible for the results."
CPE_18,C2,"**The Lure of the Kitchen**
When I was in university, I wanted to be a chef. This was not a common choice among my friends. Most people did not see cooking as a good job. Being a chef is hard work: it is long, stressful, and not well paid. But I did not let this stop me. I was not happy at university. The work was difficult, and the social life felt closed and self-important. I thought being a chef would be a good escape from this. It seemed to offer a seriousness and honesty that I missed in my college life.
My wish to cook was not just because I was unhappy as a student. It also came from my love for food. I first realized this when I had a meal at a famous restaurant in London. It was amazing. I still remember my first dish. After that meal, I felt so grateful to the chef that I wanted to cry. I felt happy for days. This experience made me want to learn the secrets of cooking. I changed my student life to prepare for becoming a chef. My history degree felt unimportant compared to my real passion. I learned to cook by reading cookbooks, visiting markets, and making special meals.
**The Swimming Instructor**
The swimming instructor at my school was a tough man, small and strong, with tattoos on his arms. When I asked him to teach me how to dive, he told me to sit on the edge of the pool, put my hands above my head, and roll forward, pushing off with my feet. I practiced this until my lesson was over. The next time, he had me stand up and dive off the edge. He was strict, and every time I came up from the water, he looked at me with disapproval: ""Don't look down, look up!"" ""Keep your legs straight."" ""Point your toes!"" 
The following week, I went to the high diving board. It was very high, and I felt scared as I stood there. Slowly, I stopped hearing the noise around me and felt quiet. I moved my arms like I had been taught, tried to look up, and jumped. For a moment, I felt like I was flying. But when I hit the water, I fell awkwardly, and my legs were everywhere. The instructor looked at me with disappointment, but I still felt happy. I understood what they mean by ""free as a bird.""
**The Traveller**
For people who value a comfortable bed, running water, and safety, the idea of a traveller can seem strange and fascinating. Some people choose to take risks, like climbing dangerous mountains or sailing alone in small boats. They might eat insects if they have to and can live for months in uncertain conditions. It is easy to think of these people as unusual or eccentric, like hermits or extreme sports enthusiasts. While they exist, their world is very different from ours, and we can easily ignore it. We can be thankful for our own lives, where the risks are more predictable, like crossing a busy street.
**Sailing**
Jonathan Raban is afraid of the sea, which is probably why he spends so much time on it. He does not say he is a top sailor, but he is skilled. He sails because, as a writer, he enjoys writing about his experiences. Sailing gives him stories to tell. Raban's small boat has a device that shows exactly where he is on the earth. He likes this tool, but he also believes that using a compass was a mistake. He thinks it changed how people relate to the sea. 
Raban believes that since the compass was invented, sailors no longer pay attention to the waves and the ocean. The sea, which used to be full of life, has become just a space to cross. Because of this, a sailor can let an autopilot steer the boat for long periods. This might be why Raban has time to observe the waves closely."
CPE_62,C2,"**Holiday Reading**
Summer gives us two great joys: escaping home and reading books. These joys are closely connected. Books can help us feel more at home in the world. We can relate our own experiences to those in great books written long ago or in faraway places. There are fewer types of people than there are individuals, so we often find our own thoughts and feelings in the stories of others. Authors can express our feelings in a way that we cannot. What we feel shy or confused about is clearly described in their words. This connection is even more surprising when the author is from a different time or place. We feel thankful to these authors for reminding us of who we are.
Through reading and traveling, we can escape our daily routines. Our eyes are most open when we first arrive in a new place, just like when we read a great book. Reading helps us notice things we usually ignore. Our minds become more aware of the colors in the sky, the changes in a person's face, the dishonesty of a friend, or a sadness we didn’t know we felt.
**Author's Note**
These travel reflections were published as articles in the Observer newspaper over seven years. I have made some small changes to fit the articles better, but I have added very little. I corrected some mistakes, but only if they were small details I should have gotten right. If I were to rewrite the articles to predict future events, they would no longer be reports of what I experienced at that time. Like any traveler, I was there, not knowing what would happen next, and focused on understanding what had already happened. This is the real story of modern travel: the world opening up to people who can afford a ticket. However, I believe that my fellow travelers were not completely unaware. Even a postcard can have a purpose.
**Ecotourism**
If there were awards for tourism phrases that have been misused, ""ecotourism"" would win first prize. This term appeared in the early 1980s when people became more aware of the environment. Tour operators realized that many travelers wanted to ensure their trips would not harm the places they visited. The term quickly became popular. Now, ""ecotourism"" can mean anything from living with remote tribes for two weeks to a one-hour boat trip through an Australian gorge. Any tour that includes cultural experiences, beautiful nature, wildlife, or a bit of adventure is likely to be called ecotourism. While the original idea was to help travelers make better choices, the lack of rules and clear definitions has confused many travelers.
**Transylvanian Journey**
I lost my notebook about my journey in Transylvania for 50 years, but I found it again a few years ago by chance. It has helped me remember that time, but it was not as helpful as I hoped. In Transylvania, I had a much easier time than I expected, moving from one friendly house to another and often staying for weeks. When I stayed in one place for a long time, I stopped writing because I thought there was nothing to record. I was slow to start writing again when I moved on, and sometimes I only wrote short notes instead of full stories. I worried that some details might be out of order when I began writing this book, so I added many warnings. But then I realized that these pages were not meant to be a guidebook, so I let the story unfold naturally without too many concerns."
CPE_49,C2,"**Fashion**
Fashion is often thought of as something new, created by capitalism in the 19th and 20th centuries. However, many historians say that fashion, especially in terms of style and design, has a long history. They often start their studies in the 16th and 17th centuries when trade began to grow. As societies became more complex and populations grew, new technologies were developed to make different types of clothing and accessories. Because of this, the meanings of what we wear have also become more complicated. Today, it is hard to say exactly what a piece of clothing means. For example, a man's suit is often seen as very uniform, but it can mean different things to different people in different situations.
**Writer**
Stories in the news about famous authors getting big book deals can give a wrong idea about what life is like for most writers. For many of us who are not best-sellers, there are two main ways to earn a living. The smartest writers work full-time jobs and write in the evenings. This way, they have a steady income even if their book does not sell right away. Others, like me, do different jobs, such as teaching or writing articles. I have heard of a writing job at a chocolate factory, but I have never found something like that. Still, by balancing part-time jobs and using credit cards, and often thanks to the help of friends mentioned in the Acknowledgements, I manage to write my novel.
**Sudden Fame**
The small places where we performed started to sell out, and we needed extra security to manage the crowds of excited fans. We had to use secret entrances to avoid being overwhelmed by them. On the few nights we were not working, it was hard to go out without being followed by fans. In just a few days, we became celebrities. Our fans watched our every move, and our management took care of everything we needed. Even though I still felt shy, I also felt a strange confidence that only people who are usually shy can understand. In short, I felt completely out of my comfort zone."
CPE_31,C2,"**Music - The Challenge Ahead**
Technology is changing our lives at work, home, and during our free time. Susan Hallam talks about how this affects music in Britain. In the late 20th century, there were many new ways to listen to music, like radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, and videos. However, there has been a decrease in live music performances and full-time jobs for musicians.
It is clear that more people will continue to have access to music because it meets many human needs. Music is important for national events and for personal activities. A society without music is hard to imagine. The question is not if there will be music in the 21st century, but what kind of music it will be and if people will still want to learn to play instruments.
I believe that people will still want to learn instruments. The music industry is a big source of income in Britain, and musical skills will be important for many jobs, especially in media. Also, there is evidence that playing an instrument helps develop skills in young people. Research in the USA shows that listening to or making music can improve spatial reasoning, which is a part of intelligence. While these results need more study, other research in Europe suggests that group music lessons can improve social skills and concentration in children, especially those with behavior problems.
Current research is also looking at how playing an instrument can help develop useful skills. For example, regular practice can help with good study habits and focus, while playing in concerts can teach punctuality and organization. Because of this, there will likely be a continued need for music lessons in the near future.
What about the future? Will there be changes in music? I think there are two likely possibilities. First, people will listen to a wider variety of music, and new styles will mix together. Second, technology will be used more to create and perform music, making it easier for more people to compose music. However, this may reduce the need for live performances and musicians who only perform live.
At the same time, more people of all ages will want to make music together in their communities, reflecting their local musical traditions. If this future happens, the music profession needs to prepare. Music lessons will need to change to help more people learn different instruments throughout their lives. This means that music education will need to adapt to be relevant for more people and include a wider range of musical skills.
Training for musicians will also be important. They will need to inspire and teach learners of all ages, work with diverse groups, and develop skills in communication, social interaction, and management for community work. This is a big change from traditional methods and will require accountability to the public. 
This change can be a chance for everyone in music education to show the high quality of music teaching available. Finally, we need to raise awareness of the importance of music in our lives. Music is essential, but it is often taken for granted. Everyone in the music profession should work together to make sure this changes."
CPE_58,C2,"**The Actor's Craft**
Sometimes, people make fun of actors. This often happens when actors talk about their work in interviews. Instead of explaining their art, they often use boring phrases or gossip. The actor Paul Scofield once wrote to a friend that acting is only interesting when it is performed. He believed that talking about acting makes it less real. Each time an actor performs, they start fresh, learning about their character and the story. After a play ends, they feel empty until they perform again. This emptiness shows when people discuss acting.
**A Review of Hamlet**
Adrian Lester plays Hamlet in a way that shows he is between being a boy and a man. His performance is simple but strong. He controls his body and emotions well, showing both anger and humor. This makes his character both scary and lovable. You can see his talent in how he moves. Another actor, Handy, plays Horatio in a way that also shows a strong inner feeling. 
So, what is acting? Is it just copying real behavior, or is it something deeper? This is a big question in theatre.
**One Director's Approach to Rehearsal**
This director has a special way of rehearsing called ""dropping in."" During this process, the stage manager shows the script on a screen. The actors listen quietly to understand the words. When it is their turn to speak, they look at the screen, think about the first line, and find the reason to say it. For example, if the line is about waiting in the rain, they should breathe and remember a similar experience. This helps them feel the moment and find the right way to say their lines. The director encourages actors to be open and trust that something will happen during the performance.
**The Perfect Theatre**
A perfect theatre makes you feel important as an audience member. Going to the theatre should feel special, and the staff should understand this too. It is not nice to feel like the workers don’t care about the performance. The theatre should create a connection between the actors and the audience. People in the audience should be able to see and hear everything clearly. The size of the theatre is important; it should fit the human voice and body. If the theatre is too big, it feels wrong because drama is about people. Many theatres built in the late 1800s were designed well, making the audience feel close to the stage. 
When you go to the theatre, you want to see something surprising and new. If it is not different, you might as well stay home."
CPE_37,C2,"**Paul Simon**
Rock and roll in the 1950s was mainly popular with young people, but it also had a big effect on older people and the middle class. This music opened the door for new rock stars who were inspired by it. They knew that this exciting and different sound would be important in their lives. For Paul Simon and many other young people in the US, the best way to hear this new music was through Alan Freed's radio show called Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party. This show was very important for many young musicians. Just like John Lennon, who listened to Radio Luxembourg in Europe, Paul Simon loved the music from Freed's show. He was getting ready to move from just listening to music to creating his own.
**Snow**
I could not see a clear path, but I thought I would be okay if I was careful. The wind was very strong, pushing me over as I tried to walk on the slippery ice. Suddenly, the snow that looked safe gave way, and I fell into a hole about four feet deep. The snow had covered a gap between two rocks, and I was surprised to find it. I climbed out, feeling shaken and worried about what would have happened if the hole was much deeper. I sat against a pine tree that was sticking out of the snow to think about what to do next. After an hour, I had only gone half a mile. It was clear that I had to change my plans.
**Qualitative Research**
There are many books that help researchers understand qualitative research. While there is a lot of information about collecting data, these books often do not explain how to analyze the data. Many people find the process of analyzing data to be a mystery. To help with this, we asked different social scientists who have worked on qualitative projects to share their experiences. The goal was to help others understand how to analyze qualitative data, not to create a guidebook. This task is not easy, so we allowed our contributors to share their work in different ways, including personal stories and more formal writing."
CPE_2,C2,"**Screen Learning**
A few days ago, I saw my six-year-old son eating noodles in a funny way. He was pulling them up with his teeth and pretending to be a dinosaur. He said, ""I'm a little dinosaur."" He was acting out a scene from a TV show. I asked him what he remembered about dinosaurs, but he didn’t know much.
Many people are excited about learning through the internet and computers, but is this a good way to learn? One writer shared his experience with an interactive program he tried with his son. The father read the words while the son played with the pictures. The father thought that if his son had spent ten minutes reading a book, he might have learned something.
Research shows that learning happens best when there is conversation with teachers or parents. It is important to use new technology to teach our children, but traditional education is still very important.
**Hollywood**
By 1918, most of the world’s film-making had moved to Hollywood. The local people did not like this change and thought Hollywood was being taken over by rude newcomers. However, in the end, they accepted it because success is important in America, and success is measured by how much money films make.
Hollywood has changed a lot in less than a hundred years. It went from a small village to a famous town, like New York, Rome, or Paris. A hundred years ago, you would walk through orange groves to get to the village store. But in some ways, it is still a small village where everyone talks about films: how much money they made, who is dating whom, and who is working on which project. Many successful people try to live somewhere else but still work in Hollywood. It is the place where almost everyone in show business wants to be.
**Photography**
Photography was created by artists in the 1800s who wanted to capture what they saw. They found a way to make lasting images using light, lenses, and special surfaces. These images were more detailed and realistic than paintings, which took a long time to create. This made some artists unhappy. They thought photography could not be considered art because it relied on machines.
Despite the critics, photographers believed they had created a new form of art. They used their tools to show the world and express their ideas, just like painters use brushes and pencils.
**Book Illustration**
In the past, every children's book needed illustrations. This was also true for many novels for older readers, but the number of illustrated books decreased over time. Children's publishing was mostly low-budget, which led to many average-quality works, but the best artists always did their best.
The collection of black-and-white illustrations is a mix of valuable and less valuable works. It is a great place for research and finding interesting pieces. Many of these treasures will be shown to the public again, either through new editions of old books or exhibitions of original artwork. There are signs that this is starting to happen, and soon, a creative publisher will likely produce a series of classic children's book illustrations from this time."
CPE_68,C2,"**Blogging: Sharing with Caution**
Some time ago, a website warned about the dangers of sharing your location online. When you say, ""Hey, I'm here,"" you are also telling many people where you are, including those you might not want to meet. This shows that sharing everything online can have negative effects. 
The internet gives us many chances to share our lives with a large audience. We might think this will bring us wealth or fame, but it can also lead to problems. Many people share personal stories and photos online without thinking about the risks. 
In the past, some early internet users, known as bloggers, explored these risks. They faced many challenges, like losing jobs and friends, long before social media became popular. These bloggers have valuable lessons for us. 
In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started sharing his life online. At that time, the web was mostly used by students and scientists. Hall saw a chance to tell his own story. He created a blog where he shared everything about his life, and many people started to read it. He was open about all topics, and his blog became popular. 
However, one day, his homepage disappeared and was replaced by a video called Dark Night. Hall had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it, his partner told him to choose between the blog and the relationship. Hall chose to stop blogging, saying that sharing so much made people not trust him. 
In 2002, Heather Armstrong had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job. One day, a coworker shared her blog with the company's bosses, including some she had made fun of. This led to her losing her job. 
Experts call this the ""online distribution effect,"" which means people often say things online that they would never say in person. Our online lives are connected to our real lives, and ignoring this can lead to serious mistakes. 
Armstrong's story had a happy ending. After taking a break from blogging, she got married and started a new blog about her family. Now, she is successful as a ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing helps support her family. 
Armstrong learned an important lesson: the internet lets us say anything, but that doesn’t mean we should."
CPE_23,C2,"**Enough Sleep?**
Many people today feel tired all the time. In richer and busier countries, not getting enough sleep and feeling anxious have become common problems. In the USA, research shows that 40 million people have serious sleep issues. Some popular books in Britain even have characters who cannot sleep or are in sleep research labs. 
One important idea is that people need more sleep. A sleep researcher says, ""When people are busy, they sleep less. They wake up early to avoid traffic."" Recently, a researcher did an experiment. He let people sleep for up to 14 hours a night for a month. After three weeks, they found they needed about 8 hours of sleep. This shows they were catching up on sleep they missed.
In Europe, a university in the English Midlands studies sleep. They look at how tiredness affects sailors, how noise at airports disturbs sleep, and how tired drivers can be dangerous. They find volunteers by advertising in student newspapers. These volunteers are picked up by taxi, paid £5 an hour, and asked to change their sleeping habits.
Dr. Louise Reyner helps the volunteers feel comfortable. Some worry because they wear electrodes on their heads, thinking the researchers can see their dreams. But the researchers are more interested in how the body works. In a dark room, they have a driving simulator where volunteers drive while answering questions. They always come in the afternoon when people usually feel sleepy, especially if they had little or no sleep the night before.
During the test, the volunteers try to stay awake while driving. At first, they look alert, but soon they start to blink more and nod off. Sometimes they fall asleep for a few seconds, and the car goes off the road. Dr. Reyner says that drinking two cups of coffee can help someone stay awake for a while. She suggests using energy drinks and other products to help people stay alert, especially those who work at night.
Scientists know that humans sleep in cycles, just like other mammals. When we sleep, we go through four stages, from light sleep to deep sleep. Dreams usually happen during light sleep, and the brain keeps the body still to prevent injuries. Scientists believe sleep helps repair the body and rest the brain, but they are not completely sure how it works.
It is known that women sleep about half an hour longer than men, and older people need less sleep, but the reasons are unclear. Some researchers say sleep helps us travel through time safely. 
In the past, people had different sleep patterns. A history professor studied British sleep habits from 1500 to 1850. People would go to bed early, wake up after midnight for a while, and then sleep again. This time was used for thinking, remembering dreams, or even stealing. Poor people benefited the most from this quiet time, as they could escape their daily struggles.
By the 17th century, with more artificial light, rich people started to sleep in a more efficient way. The industrial revolution made people work longer hours in lighted buildings. However, in some non-western cultures, people still have flexible sleep patterns. They might sleep for a few hours, wake up, and then sleep again. In some tribal societies, noises and the need to watch for danger make it hard to sleep continuously. 
It seems that people everywhere are in need of more sleep."
CPE_60,C2,"We are talking about really big cowboy boots. I stood in my expensive designer cowboy boots on the rocks in the Arizona desert. I wore a full cowboy outfit, but I was not a cowboy. I looked at the Arizona mountains and realized I didn’t belong there. I had flown in from Denver early in the morning, thinking I might look like a cowboy. But that feeling went away when I saw a real cowboy at the Phoenix airport. He was wearing a dirty shirt and carrying a bag. When he saw my new cowboy boots, he raised an eyebrow and walked away without saying anything.
I thought there should be some clothes that an ex-racing driver could wear without feeling out of place. I loved being a racing driver and driving fast cars. But I don’t do that anymore. I wondered what I should do now. A racing driver should have other options for when they stop racing. I thought I had some ideas, but they didn’t work out.
One idea was to be a commentator at races, but there were many former drivers who wanted that job. Another idea was to sell classic cars, but that didn’t go well either. It was a bad year for selling old cars, so I decided to stop before I lost everything.
Being an ""ex"" anything is hard. Who wants to hear about how I almost became the World Champion? No one wants to hear a story that ends with ""almost."" Even if I had won, people would only listen for a short time before getting bored. Last year’s champion is not interesting anymore. I don’t want sympathy, and I don’t get any. I had a good career and made money, but I miss the excitement of racing. I miss the fast cars and the thrill of driving. I miss the attention from fans and reporters who cared about what I said. 
Now that I don’t race, I have a lot of free time. Just last week, my phone rang twice, and I realized I have so much empty time. I looked up at the blue sky and saw some small birds in a cactus. They seemed to be telling me to leave their nest alone. I never thought the desert had songbirds. I realized that a fake cowboy in fancy boots still has a lot to learn."
CPE_1,C2,"**Vancouver**
In the last ten years, many people from around the world have moved to Vancouver, which is in western Canada. In the evenings, residents walk around the city, and if you join them, you will probably hear different languages being spoken. People come to Vancouver because of its mild weather, beautiful location between the ocean and the mountains, clean and safe environment, and good schools and job opportunities. Some locals complain about how quickly new buildings are being built, but it is clear that the new residents and growing tourism have helped the city improve. Vancouver used to be called 'Terminal City' because it was a main stop for travel. Although this name is not used much anymore, Vancouver is still an important gateway to other places.
**Putting Pen to Paper**
Journalists, like me, are often not good at writing letters. Some say this is because we don’t like to write for free, but I think it is more about how we try to make our writing perfect for our jobs. In our work, we want to have the best effect, so writing a simple letter can be hard. Real artists, who write without thinking too much about the effect, do not have this problem. I believe that understanding how words affect people is what makes someone a true artist. For example, when Shakespeare wrote his famous lines, he probably did not think about how the sound of the words made them powerful.
**Supermarket Opening**
Opening a new supermarket used to be a big event in Britain. A celebrity, like a soap star or a member of the royal family, would usually come to cut the ribbon. Now, new supermarkets are opening all the time, so there is no need for a famous person. Last week, people waiting to enter a new Superbuy store did not care who opened it, as long as they were first in line. A customer said that the first five men to enter would get a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women would receive flowers. This news spread quickly, making those at the front feel proud, while those who arrived later felt jealous."
CPE_53,C2,"**Citizen Kane**
The film *Citizen Kane* was released in 1941. There was a lot of excitement about it, but it did not do well at the box office. The film was delayed because the distributors were afraid of what William Randolph Hearst, who the film was about, might do to them. It was only when it was shown on television that people started to remember it. *Citizen Kane* is known as a film that has inspired many people to become filmmakers. This is surprising because it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles believed that the film was successful because he did not know the rules of filmmaking; he just made the film the way he wanted. He had a great team, including cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and special-effects expert Linwood Dunn. When Welles and Mankiewicz decided to create a story about a newspaper owner who was similar to Hearst, Welles realized he had a great opportunity to direct and act in the film. He took this chance with a lot of energy.
**Dermot and Carmel**
That morning, Dermot thought Carmel was acting a bit strange. He had told her twice that he might be late and that he might stop at the golf club on his way home. He wanted to talk to someone, and the golf club was a good place for that. Carmel nodded but seemed like she didn’t really understand. Dermot asked her, “Will you be okay? What are you going to do today?” She smiled and said, “It’s funny you ask. I was just thinking that I have nothing to do today, so I will walk downtown and look at the shops. I feel like it’s almost wrong to waste the day like this.” Dermot smiled back and said, “You deserve to enjoy yourself. And if I’m late, I won’t need anything to eat, so don’t worry about it.” “That’s fine,” she replied.
**Title Race**
A recent study showed that job titles can cause jealousy and problems at work. A survey by a recruitment company found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees believe that job titles create divisions among coworkers. Surprisingly, 70% of office workers said they would give up a pay raise for a better job title that sounds more motivating or professional. This shows that people care a lot about how they are labeled at work. In the early twenty-first century, no one wants to be called ""subordinate."" The job titles being discussed focus on skills (like specialist or coordinator), but they are really just fancy words."
CPE_55,C2,"**The Vienna Assignment**
I was in Vienna to take photographs. This was usually why I traveled. Photography was not just my job; it was my passion. I loved how light fell on different surfaces and how one picture could capture a moment in time, a city, or a person. I always hoped to take the perfect photograph. As long as I had film in my camera, I could keep trying. I had a simple rule: finish one roll of film, load another, and keep looking for great shots.
Once, I took a picture of smoke from a burning oil well that became very popular. It was lucky, but they say you create your own luck, both good and bad. After that, I decided to work freelance, which I thought was a smart choice. However, life had other plans, and things did not go as well as I had hoped. The mid-nineties were not as successful as I expected, even after my photo was on the cover of Time magazine. That’s why I found myself in Vienna instead of a more exciting place. But I was still taking photographs, and I was getting paid for it, which was good enough for me.
My assignment in Vienna happened by chance. I had taken photos for a book called ""Four Cities in Four Seasons,"" which included London, Paris, Rome, and Vienna. I had received a good payment for my work in London, capturing the beauty of the city in different seasons. I knew that some of my best photos would not be used because it was just a picture book, not something that would change people’s views.
After I submitted my winter photos of London, I learned that the Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, had left his job in Vienna for reasons I didn’t know. Instead of hiring someone new, they asked me to take his place. The Austrian publishers liked my work, and I was available, while other photographers were not. I was happy to go because things were not good at home. A week in snowy Vienna sounded great to me.
They put me up at the Europa hotel in the old city. I had visited Vienna before with my wife, but it was a busy and hot trip, and I didn’t take many photos. This time, I was alone in the cold January weather, and I knew it would be different. As soon as I arrived and saw the beautiful light over the snowy roofs, I felt excited. I was ready to take amazing pictures.
On my first day, I didn’t take any photos. Instead, I rode the trams around the Ringstrasse, getting on and off to enjoy the city’s atmosphere. The weather was cold and still, just like the grand buildings from the old empire. I didn’t want to see what Schussner had done in the other seasons. This was going to be my Vienna, and I wanted to discover it for myself.
A photograph captures a moment, but you have to wait for the right moment. So, I took my time to look around until I was ready. The next morning, I woke up early. The snow from the night before made Stephansplatz look beautiful and almost empty. I was unsure how to photograph the huge cathedral. Its tall spire reached into the sky, but at the ground level, it looked massive. I realized I might not be able to capture it all in one shot, but I could still find something magical in that moment.
Photography has always had a sense of magic. Even when you understand how it works, it still feels mysterious. You can watch a blank piece of paper turn into a photograph in a dark room, and that feeling stays with you forever. Maybe that’s why what happened at Stephansplatz that morning didn’t surprise me in a strange way."
CPE_50,C2,"**Kinetic Art**
Great news! The Hayward Gallery in London has changed into a wonderful place. This change is not because of a big, expensive show, but because of a unique exhibition about kinetic art. Kinetic art is art that involves movement. This exhibition shows the history of kinetic art over the last 60 years. It highlights that creating art that moves or explores movement has been an important but often unnoticed part of art in the twentieth century. 
The exhibition includes many paintings, drawings, documents, and films about kinetic art. Curator Guy Brett, who has studied this topic for many years, has put these works together without too much text. This means visitors can enjoy the art and make their own connections and discoveries.
**David Hockney**
David Hockney is an artist whose work attracts many people, even those who usually do not care about art. People might like his art because it is easy to understand or because it shows fun and relaxing moments in life. Some people might even be more interested in Hockney's personality and his clever comments than in his art itself. 
Some critics think Hockney is not a great artist, but others believe he is popular for good reasons. Hockney knows his own strengths and weaknesses. He does not claim to be a great artist and believes that only time will tell how important his work really is.
**Window-shopping - an Art Exhibition**
In recent years, I have seen many contemporary art exhibitions, some great and some not so good. What bothers me are shows that seem to push a specific idea or message. Sometimes this works, but often it feels forced. Because of this, I decided to create a different kind of exhibition. 
With seven artists, I took over an empty warehouse for a show called ""Window-shopping."" This exhibition featured individual artworks that were connected only by the fact that they were all art. For example, Sam Cole created knitted cats that chased each other on a toy train track. In contrast, Matthew Crawley made a video of him opening a camera and breaking it. These artworks did not fit into a specific theme, but they worked well together and added to each other’s meaning.
**Art History**
Many people who enjoy paintings are afraid to analyze them because they think it will ruin their experience. Some art historians focus more on theory than on the enjoyment of art, which can take away from the pleasure of looking at art. This is similar to how knowing the recipe for a dish might take away from the enjoyment of eating it. 
However, understanding more about art can actually make the experience more enjoyable. Our feelings about art are influenced by our senses and the society we live in. While it is important to enjoy art, the idea that thinking about art takes away from enjoyment is an old belief. Today, we can appreciate both the emotional and intellectual sides of art."
CPE_25,C2,"**Metals**  
In the Stone Age, people may have become interested in metals because they wanted to decorate themselves. While sitting by a river and waiting for fish, one of our early ancestors might have found a shiny yellow stone. This stone felt different from regular stones and was very attractive. This could be how gold became important to early humans. Gold is easy to shape, so it quickly became a popular material. Copper might have also been found by chance. Once people realized that copper could be used to make tools, they started looking for copper ores and ways to extract the metal. This led to the development of metalworking, which helped improve their lives.
**St Ives**  
We walked slowly down a narrow, cobbled street towards the town, carrying our heavy bags. The strong wind made it hard to walk, and we tried to avoid the cold waves that crashed over the walkway. The streets were empty, and all the windows in the houses by the water were closed tightly against the storm. We had seen the weather get worse as we arrived in St Ives on a small train. With the dark clouds above, visiting Cornwall in the off-season without a car didn’t seem like a good idea anymore. I had convinced my friend to come with me by promising beautiful walks along the coast and cozy evenings by the fire.
**Computer Modelling**  
Studying the past is difficult because it is already gone. The people who lived in times of peace and those who faced wars and droughts are no longer alive. We cannot know exactly why they settled in certain places or how they formed families and communities. Archaeology gives us some clues, but we cannot test our ideas with experiments on past cultures. We cannot go back in time to see what happened. However, computer modelling helps us recreate ancient landscapes and environments. We can create virtual communities that act like real people. We can set rules for them and create social groups. Then, we can change things like the amount of rain or the number of people and see how these digital communities respond."
CPE_34,C2,"**Vervet Monkeys**  
Cheney and Seyfarth studied a group of vervet monkeys. One day, the dominant male saw a strange male monkey nearby. The stranger wanted to join the group. If he did, the dominant male might lose his position. To keep the stranger away, the dominant male made an alarm call that sounded like there was a leopard nearby. The stranger quickly went back to the trees. This happened many times throughout the day. However, the dominant male made a mistake. He called out the alarm while walking across the open ground himself. 
**What Cats Catch**  
In a village in England called Felmersham, people collected what their cats caught over a year. Seventy cats caught over 1,000 animals. A professor in America estimated that all the cats in Britain might kill 100 million birds and small animals each year. However, this number is not realistic. Most cats live in towns and catch fewer animals than those in the survey. The important question is whether the bird population can survive. The answer seems to be yes. In winter, many people feed birds, and there are many places for birds to nest. This helps keep the bird population healthy, so cats are not destroying it.
**Buffalo's Day**  
Buffaloes are very important to the marshmen who care for them. Every morning, the buffaloes leave their sleeping places slowly and with tired groans. They move towards the reed beds beyond the water. They take their time, standing at the edge and complaining about their tiredness. Finally, the leader steps into the water, and the others follow. Once in the water, they seem to forget their purpose and relax. They swim slowly, barely keeping their noses above the water. They spend the day grazing on green plants among the reeds.
**Picasso, Pablo**  
In 1940, Picasso painted several pictures of fish while staying in a fishing port called Royan. One painting shows a fishmonger’s table with a crab and some soles. The fish look alive, even though they are on the table. The painting is not easy to understand because Picasso used a flat pattern with overlapping shapes. The light colors and soft brush strokes create a calm underwater feeling. However, there is a sense of danger as the fish seem to be ready to fight the crab. The sharp shapes in the painting add to this feeling of tension."
CPE_12,C2,"**Photography**
For the last 150 years, photography has been used to capture many parts of human life. In this short time, photography has improved a lot, allowing us to see both big and small things. It has given us images from faraway places, different parts of space, and the complex issues of modern life. Photography is one of the most important ways to express what it means to be human.
However, the idea of recording events visually is much older. The first pictures were made about 35,000 years ago during the Upper Paleolithic period. We are not sure why early humans made cave paintings. They might have shown real hunting events, been used for magic to help with hunting, served as religious symbols, or just been made to decorate their living spaces. These early images are closely connected to human culture.
Throughout history, people have questioned how accurate visual images are and what their role is in society. The saying ""seeing is believing"" has always given special importance to images. When photography was invented in the mid-1800s, it seemed to promise a true visual record of reality. The camera worked like the human eye, capturing images that looked very similar to what we see. This ability to fix images chemically allowed photography to show natural events.
At the same time, photography was seen as a great achievement of culture. It created images that artists had worked hard to make. Because photography seemed so real, many believed that everyone could easily understand photographs. In 1933, photographer August Sander said that even the most isolated person could understand a photo of the sky, whether it showed the sun, moon, or stars.
However, as global communication grew in the late 20th century, we need to think about how well photographs can cross cultural differences. Is photography limited by cultural rules like language? Has our familiarity with photographs made us overlook the details and skills needed to create them? 
Photography is often seen as strong evidence, making it seem like there is no difference between what we see in real life and in photographs. For example, it is common for someone to show a photo and say, ""This is my grandson."" Since photography was invented in 1839, the technology and how people view it have changed a lot. 
Photography has moved from being just a way to keep records to becoming a historical document. These images can tell us as much about the people and society that created them as they do about the subjects in the photos. 
I want to show that the camera is not just a tool that records events. Photography can also inspire social and political change. For example, the cultural changes during the Italian Renaissance in the 15th century were closely linked to the development of perspective in art. Similarly, photography has played a big role in creating the media culture we have today, while also showing the harsh realities of the world."
CPE_26,C2,"**How to Write Poetry**
Writing poetry can be tricky. It is important to be creative, but making mistakes can lead to problems. Instead of pretending to know everything, I believe that if you want to write poetry, you should read a lot, write often, and let your imagination flow. Some people need to feel safe in their lives before they can write a poem, while others write to escape their sadness. Some writers have a schedule, while others wait for inspiration. All these ways are valid as long as you find your own style. It is important to listen to your inner voice and let it grow. One day, it will be strong enough to stand on its own.
**The Short Story**
In a short story, you should not have too many characters or long descriptions. Flashbacks should be quick and only used when necessary. A memory in the main character's mind can help move the story forward, but it should not slow down the action. Dialogue is very useful because it shows different sides of a story quickly. It keeps the reader interested and avoids using too many words. A short story should be clear and focused, making every word important. The conflict and action should be strong, just like in a novel.
**Screenplays**
Writing a screenplay for a film is like playing chess. At first, it can be confusing, and you may not know what will happen next. But as you learn more, you start to see the bigger picture. You notice patterns and strategies, just like in chess. The more you practice writing screenplays, the better you understand how to create a good story.
**Looking at Writing**
Humans naturally learn to speak, as we see in young children. However, writing is not something we are born knowing how to do. Language exists in all cultures, but writing systems are rare and were created in complex societies. Most children in the past did not learn to read or write, and even today, many struggle with it. Children are good at learning to speak, but writing is something that takes time and effort to learn. We need to understand how writing works and how to help children learn it."
CPE_8,C2,"I have never started a novel with so much doubt. I call it a novel because I don’t know what else to call it. I don’t have a big story to tell, and I don’t end with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave my reader wondering. This book is about my memories of a man I met only a few times, and I don’t know much about what happened to him in between. I could make up stories to fill in the gaps and make it more complete, but I don’t want to do that. I just want to write what I know.
To protect the people who are still alive, I have given the characters in this story names that I made up, and I have taken care to make sure no one can recognize them. The man I am writing about is not famous, and he may never be. When his life ends, he might leave no more trace than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the water. If my book is read, it will be for its own interest. However, the way he lives and his strong and kind character might influence others, and maybe, long after he is gone, people will realize that he was a remarkable person. Then it will be clear who I am writing about, and those who want to know a little about his early life may find something useful in my book.
I think my book will be a helpful source of information for my friend’s biographers. I do not claim that the conversations I wrote down are exact. I never took notes, but I remember well what matters to me. Although I have put these conversations in my own words, I believe they represent what was said. I mentioned earlier that I have invented nothing, but I have taken the same liberty that historians do. I have imagined what my characters might have said in situations I did not witness. I did this to make the scenes more lively and interesting. I want people to read my book, and I think it is okay to do what I can to make it enjoyable. A smart reader will see where I have used this technique and can choose to ignore it.
Another reason I feel nervous about this work is that the people I write about come from a different culture. It is hard to truly know people, and I think you can only really know those from your own country. People are shaped by where they were born, the places they grew up, the games they played, the food they ate, the schools they went to, the sports they liked, and the poets they read. All these things make them who they are, and you can only understand them if you have lived through those experiences. Because you can only know people from another country by watching them, it is hard to make them believable in a book. I have never tried to write about anyone but my own countrymen, and if I have done so in short stories, it is because you can be less detailed in those. You give the reader some hints and let them fill in the rest. In this book, I do not claim that my characters see themselves the same way; they are seen through my own eyes."
CPE_4,C2,"**POETRY RECITALS**
At any time in history, people may find the world of literature confusing. However, later on, it becomes easier to see clear patterns and important writers. Right now, there are many different styles of poetry, and many ways to write, present, and teach it. There are also different opinions about what poets should do in society.
Today, there is a debate between two groups of poets. One group is made up of serious writers who want their poems to be read on the page. The other group is made up of popular poets who enjoy performing their poems for an audience. This division is not strict, as many poets do both.
In the last twenty years, public poetry readings have become more common. Small literary groups hold readings in village halls or members' homes. Schools and colleges invite poets to read and talk to students. Arts festivals also feature poetry readings by well-known poets.
These events have different effects on poets. For popular poets, performing is beneficial. Their poems are often simple and can be understood easily when heard once. However, for serious poets, their work may not be appreciated by an audience that is hearing it for the first time. These poets work hard to create deep and meaningful poetry, but they may only share their simplest pieces during performances.
Listening to poetry readings is not a replacement for reading poetry on the page, but it can be enjoyable and helpful. Hearing good poets read their work can show the audience how to understand the poems better. It is best if the audience has the text in front of them or knows the poems beforehand.
One good reason for popular poetry readings, sometimes mixed with music, is that they help people enjoy poetry. This way, audiences can see poetry as something for everyone, not just a special group of people."
CPE_30,C2,"**Oral History**  
Historians are increasingly using oral evidence, but this has some problems. It is not realistic to think that a person's story is a perfect reflection of the past. In an interview, both the historian and the informant influence each other. The historian chooses who to interview and what to ask about. Even if the historian only listens, their presence can change how the informant remembers and talks about their past. The final result is affected by the historian's social position and their way of understanding history, which may also influence the informant. This means historians must take responsibility for creating new evidence. 
However, the informant also does not have direct access to the past. Their memories can be influenced by other sources, like the media. They might remember the past with nostalgia, thinking ""things were better then,"" or they might feel upset about their childhood, which can change their memories. The feelings and attitudes of the informant can make their story seem more convincing, but these emotions might come from later experiences, not the time they are talking about.
**Animal Science**  
There are two main ways to study animal science: the physiological approach and the whole animal approach. Physiologists focus on how the body works, including how nerves, muscles, and senses work together to create complex behaviors. Those who study the whole animal look at the behavior of animals in their natural environment and what affects that behavior. 
Within the whole animal approach, there are psychologists and ethologists. Psychologists usually work in labs and study a few species, like rats and pigeons. Ethologists study animals in the wild and their natural behaviors. Although these two areas are different, they are starting to work together more. Physiologists often believe their methods are more important. However, even if we understand how every nerve cell works, we still need to study behavior as a whole. Behavior has its own structure that we need to understand. Trying to explain a bird's nest-building by only looking at nerve cells would be like trying to read a book with a microscope.
**The Social Sciences**  
Students studying social sciences for the first time face a challenge. They need to learn both the content of their new subject and the methods used to study it. This means they must understand not only the information in textbooks but also how that information is gathered and organized. 
These two parts are connected. We all have experience with social life, so it may seem like social sciences are just common sense. However, each social science goes beyond common sense. Each one focuses on a specific part of social life, uses different methods, and has its own key ideas. These key ideas form the foundation of the subject and help social scientists understand more than everyday experiences. 
**Classical Architecture**  
In Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building structures. The Roman architect Vitruvius said that architecture includes order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, propriety, and distribution. He also provided Greek terms for some of these ideas, which likely came from earlier Greek sources that we no longer have. 
Vitruvius did not include utility and function in his definition, but he later described the best forms and arrangements for different types of buildings. At first, he emphasized the artistic side of architecture. The beginnings of classical architecture are complex. There was a long history of simple buildings, like huts, in Greece and Italy that did not meet Vitruvius' artistic standards. Even though these early structures were not artistic, they contributed important elements that influenced later architectural ideas. Despite how complex it may seem, a classical temple is essentially a simple, single-room hut."
CPE_7,C2,"The two sisters kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for a while. Lily would drive around the gardens and the railway, going over a small bridge with all four wheels in the air, which was her only mistake. After that, they would pass the gasworks, which smelled bad. Chen found it funny that Lily was driving without telling him. ""So you can really drive, Lily? Well done!"" he said. Mui thought it was strange that her brother-in-law was not upset. Instead, he was excited and made plans with Lily for a trip. They decided to go on a Monday at the start of next month, which was the quietest day for their business. They planned to leave early in the morning and come back by noon so they wouldn’t lose any customers. In the meantime, Lily would practice driving.
Mui, even though she was worried, bought a road map and got a ten percent discount, which made Chen happy. But Lily felt a bit insulted because she thought Mui didn’t trust her to find the way. After leaving home, they soon saw the English Channel. Lily drove very well. Even Mui, who was in the back seat ready to give directions, had to agree. Lily even passed a couple of slow cars confidently, which made Chen clap his hands in approval. 
After passing the gasworks and the lagoon with small boats, they drove smoothly along the empty seaside promenade. Lily parked in a small street with many empty spaces. She wasn’t sure about the parking rules, so she decided to pay to avoid getting a ticket. She noticed her sister’s worried face in the mirror and thought it was better not to add to her worries. Lily locked all the van doors carefully. ""Don’t worry,"" Chen joked. ""No one will want that old van."" The sisters were annoyed. Lily told Chen he was ungrateful, and Mui said he was too proud and easily fooled by looks.
Chen took Man Kee, their son, to see the sea. He held him close and thought about how he wanted to raise him. Chen wanted Man Kee to learn about business and own many restaurants one day. As he looked at the sea, he felt a mix of sadness and happiness while thinking about Man Kee’s future. He saw smoke on the horizon and then a ship shining in the sunlight. Chen put a coin in a telescope and tried to find the ship. At first, he couldn’t see it, but then he finally spotted it. It was a small, old, rusty ship. 
""Do you see the ship, Son?"" Chen asked softly. ""It’s a special ship for people like us. It may look small and old, but we know it will take us back home when we are done here. It will take you to your homeland, which you have never seen."" Chen kissed Man Kee’s head. Lily and Mui were behind them. Lily put her arm around Chen’s shoulders. ""The little old ship,"" Chen said. ""Let your mother see, Son."" Man Kee didn’t want to let go of the telescope, and when he finally did, the view was just a blurry light. By the time Chen found another coin, the ship was gone, and all Lily could see were seagulls flying over the water."
CPE_43,C2,"**THE WELL**
I once read that if you dig a deep enough hole, you can see the stars on a clear day. I convinced you to help me with my idea. You watched with wide eyes as I pulled up the well bucket, steadied it on the wall, and then climbed in. I told you to let me down. I didn’t think about how heavy the bucket was or that you might not be strong enough to hold it. You held the handle, trying to help as I pushed the bucket off the wall. As soon as it was free, I fell into the well. I hit my head. At that moment, I didn’t realize I had achieved part of my plan. I saw strange lights, like the stars I usually saw in cartoons when a character got hurt. At first, I felt confused, then scared, then relieved, and finally angry at you for letting me fall. I was also worried about what my mother would say.
You called down to me, asking if I was okay. I opened my mouth to shout, but then I heard panic in your voice, and I couldn’t speak. I lay still, peeking at you through my eyelashes. You ran away to get help. I waited a moment, then climbed back up and pulled myself over the edge, landing on the courtyard stones. I heard loud voices coming from the castle. I ran the other way, down to the passage by the moat bridge, and hid in the shadows. 
My mother and father came with you and old Arthur. My mother was screaming, and my father was shouting for Arthur to pull on the winch handle. You looked pale and shocked. I was hidden in the shadows, feeling a strange excitement. Then I noticed the drops of water I had left from the well to where I stood. I looked in horror at the dark spots of dirty water on the dry stones. I saw a little pool at my feet. I looked back into the courtyard, where my father was shining a flashlight down into the well. The drops sparkled in the sunlight. I couldn’t believe no one had seen them. My mother was now screaming loudly, a sound I had never heard before. It made me feel scared. What should I do? I had gotten back at you, but now things were more serious than I thought. What started as a fun prank was turning into something that could lead to punishment, probably for me.
I regretted not thinking this through. In just a few minutes, my plan had turned into a disaster. Suddenly, I had an idea. I gathered my courage and left my hiding place, coming out and blinking in the light. I called out softly, then yelled louder when no one heard me. I stumbled a bit and then fell dramatically on the stones. Sitting up, I felt comforted in my mother’s arms. I took a deep breath and said I had found a secret tunnel from the bottom of the well to the moat, and I crawled through it until I got out. I thought I was almost getting away with it until my father came and asked me to repeat my story. I hesitated. His eyes narrowed. I said the secret passage had fallen in after me, so there was no point in looking for it. I told him the well was dangerous and that I had barely escaped with my life.
When I looked into my father's eyes, it felt like looking into a dark tunnel with no light. It seemed like he was seeing me for the first time, and I realized how adults see the world differently than children. My words got stuck in my throat. “Don’t be ridiculous, boy,” he said, sounding more disappointed than I expected. He stood up and walked away. Arthur looked down at me, looking worried. He didn’t feel sorry for me because of my adventure, but because he could see through my lie. He worried about what kind of person I would become if I kept lying. His pity hurt me even more than my father’s words. It made me realize that both my actions and my father’s reaction were serious, and I couldn’t ignore that."
CPE_51,C2,"**REMOVAL DAY**
Susan is a widow with grown children, and now she has to leave her family home. A van with the words ""Removers of Distinction"" is there to help her move. Everything that made her house special is being packed away by Fred, the removal man, and his team. They are wrapping her belongings in newspaper and putting them in boxes. 
Susan is leaving a beautiful four-story house that looks over a small harbor. She remembers the years she spent there with her children as they grew up. When they first bought the house, her son Robert, who was five at the time, asked, ""Mum, how do you get a house home?"" Now, Robert is helping her move, making sure she doesn’t forget about the piano. Her daughter Francesca is also there, being bossy and insisting that she will take care of the piano because it is very valuable.
Fred, the removal man, notices that Susan is not crying. He tells her that many people cry when they see their things being taken away. Susan can understand why. If it were up to her, she would have told the movers about the piano before they started. But Robert insisted that it was the movers' job to notice any problems.
The piano is in the best room of the house, and they plan to move it last. Sitting on the bottom stair, Susan remembers the day they moved in. It was a difficult day because the piano got stuck on the stairs. The movers struggled for almost two hours to get it inside. Little Robert watched in amazement while Francesca cried, saying they couldn’t live without a piano. They had to find a way to get it in, and Susan’s late husband, Peter, solved the problem. They had to take out a window and use a crane to lift the piano inside. The children were so happy to see it finally in the house.
Now, many years later, Susan thinks about how her children are too busy to visit often, and she finds it hard to move around the house. She worries about the piano and feels she should have told the movers about it. But it is too late now. Fred asks if she is okay, reminding her that the piano is the last thing to move.
As the piano comes down the stairs, Susan feels emotional. She realizes that moving her things makes her feel sad because they hold so many memories. Just then, the piano tips a little, and Fred calls for everyone to be careful. They carefully carry it out of the house and place it behind the van. 
Robert laughs first, and soon Susan and Francesca join in. They all laugh together, feeling relieved that the move is almost over. As they walk down the path for the last time, Susan realizes that her tears are now tears of laughter."
CPE_11,C2,"**Online Literary Criticism for Everyone**
**Do-it-yourself literary criticism: Is it just for fun?**
When the Internet started, one of its main ideas was that everyone could share their thoughts. In theory, anyone could publish their ideas or create a music channel online. At first, it was not easy for everyone because some technical skills were needed. However, one area that became open to everyone was book reviews. 
By visiting Amazon.com, the first popular online bookstore, anyone could write a book review. Amazon allowed anyone to share their opinions about books and give them up to five stars. This was a great idea because it meant that readers could see what others thought about a book, not just what the publisher said or what professional critics wrote. Other online bookstores also allowed reviews, but Amazon was the biggest and had the most customers.
Every day, thousands of reviews were submitted on Amazon, and it was hard to check them all. A team of editors looked for reviews that followed the rules. For example, one-word reviews or personal attacks on authors were not allowed. However, reviewers could remain anonymous, and bad reviews were only removed if Amazon noticed them. This meant that some people could write fake reviews. 
For instance, a writer named Lev Grossman was upset by the bad reviews of his first book. To fix this, he wrote some good reviews under a fake name. His trick worked until he wrote an article about it, and then Amazon removed his fake reviews. Authors could also comment on their own books by clicking a link. Most authors wrote friendly messages asking readers to buy and enjoy their books. Some even shared their email addresses for direct communication. However, Amazon did not always check if these comments were really from the authors, except for famous writers.
The real excitement came from readers, not writers. When James McElroy's book about a cheerleading team was published, it received good reviews from the press. But some people mentioned in the book felt hurt and wrote many negative reviews on Amazon. These reviews disappeared after a few days. Despite this, Amazon thought it was good that so many people were writing and reading reviews.
Amazon wanted reviews to be a place to discuss books, not just a chat room. They paid special attention to popular books to make sure all reviews followed the rules. This meant that silly reviews were more likely to appear on pages for less-known books. For example, a classic children's book called *The Story about Ping* inspired some funny reviews because ""ping"" is also a term used in technology. One long review compared the book's story to how the Internet works.
Most reviews on Amazon were serious, and they helped readers decide if a book was worth buying. The writer George Orwell once said that reviewing too many books made it hard to have real feelings about them. This is why making book reviews available to everyone is a good thing."
CPE_14,C2,"**Art in Modern Times**
In the last two hundred years, people often think that artists must go against the art of their time. We admire artists who create unique and shocking work. We feel good about liking artists whose work was not appreciated in the past. However, when we see modern art, we sometimes think it has gone too far and is not really art anymore. The media often shares this opinion, and many of us agree because we find it hard to understand new art. We forget that modern art still has old themes and methods.
Artists today are seen as special people with unique talents. In the past, people asked artists to create art for specific reasons, and art was part of everyday life. Now, artists often work alone, and we can get upset if they try to connect with us.
**Picture This**
Let me describe a situation and ask an important question. An artist picks a simple text from an art book that talks about different kinds of pictures. The text asks, ""What are they all about?"" and then says there are many types of pictures. This sounds childish, but stay with me. 
The artist then asks someone to prepare a canvas and take it to a sign painter. He tells the sign painter to write the chosen text on the canvas in plain black letters. My important question is: Is this finished piece a painting?
**Underground Encounters**
At the Mercury Gallery in London, there is a rule that successful painters should stick to one style. Collectors want artists to keep creating the same type of work, and if they try something new, people often feel disappointed. Gallery owners prefer artists who are safe bets, and the art-buying public likes familiar styles.
Some artists, like Picasso and Hockney, have successfully tried new things. Eric Rimmington is another artist who is now trying something different. He is moving away from the still lifes that made him famous and is painting scenes from the London Underground. He finds the railway fascinating. His new exhibition, ""Underground Encounters,"" shows 40 paintings and drawings that capture the unique charm of this underground world.
**Extract from a Novel**
I have come to this island with a few books. I say ""escape"" because the villagers joke that only a sick person would choose such a remote place to heal. I am alone here, except for an old woman who comes from the village to clean my house. I feel neither happy nor sad; I am lost in my memories.
I talked about the uselessness of art but did not mention how it can comfort us. The true value of art is that it allows us to see reality in a new way. Our daily lives often hide the deeper meaning of things. For artists, creating art helps us deal with the pain and challenges of life. It allows us to fulfill our true potential through imagination. Otherwise, why would we hurt each other?"
CPE_63,C2,"**Family Business**
""Look, this isn't good!"" said my Dad. We were in the car going back to London. My father, with my brother Maurice, had just picked me up from the fancy girls' school I attended. He had also just been to Parent's Day, where I received a Latin prize and a prize for doing well in my exams. He had a long talk with my headteacher, and now we were on our way home for the holidays.
""What isn't?"" I asked, but I already knew what he was thinking because he was unusually quiet. My dad usually talks a lot. ""You can't fool me. You'll do what you want now,"" he said. ""With all those certificates, I heard you will get a scholarship to Oxford.""
""So?"" I replied, trying to act tough. ""Isn't that useful?"" 
""I also heard,"" he continued, and I knew he was going to confront me, ""that you want to be a barrister. A barrister!"" My father knew a lot about lawyers and the law. 
""I just said that,"" I replied. ""I couldn't think of anything else!"" 
""And apparently,"" he went on, ""you have the right personality. You can understand a lot of information quickly, you are good at talking, and you enjoy performing."" 
""I don't know about that,"" I said. ""I only know what I see on TV."" 
""Anyway,"" he said, trying to stay calm, ""I feel like your heart is not in the family business. You will go to Oxford University, and after that, I don't think you will want to join us."" 
The problem was that, like many children in family businesses, I felt trapped by what my family expected of me. I saw many job options, and I wanted to explore them. But I also didn't want to upset my father. I wasn't as scared of him as Maurice was - I was his favorite - but I still found him intimidating. 
""It's too soon to know,"" I said weakly. 
""I tell you, you won't want to join us,"" my father said, who often turned out to be right about these things. ""It's a shame because you have the talent - the brains, the courage, the vision."" 
""There's still Maurice,"" I said, feeling down. My father laughed. We both knew Maurice didn't like the business. 
""Anyway,"" I continued, ""you could always use me as a consultant."" My mother had died when I was young, and my father raised me and Maurice. Maurice was two years younger than me, and I took care of him because he didn't have a mother. I loved Maurice, and it was not a burden. 
Because the business was successful, we lived comfortably - in a big house in London, went to nice schools, wore good clothes, and enjoyed parties, theaters, and operas. My father knew many interesting people - politicians, actors, and businessmen - and our house was always lively.
""I have an idea,"" my father said. ""You can help us during the holidays until you leave Oxford, and then if you want to leave, you can. It will give you some pocket money and help me."" 
""Okay,"" I said, relieved to avoid making immediate choices and especially to avoid my father's disappointment if I disagreed with him. This was how he controlled us. 
So, I helped out during my last term at school and during university breaks, but only a couple of times a year and on easier tasks. I became one of the smarter students, with a small house, a nice car, designer clothes, and a fancy black dress for my final exams.
In my last term, my father came to visit me and took me to a village for a meal and a chat. There were only a few weeks left. My tutor said I would get a First Class degree in Law, and I knew that if I focused, he might be right. I felt ready and confident. 
But then my father told me that he needed me to do one last important task for the family business. He said it was the most important job they had ever done, and it would be worth my time. 
""But Dad,"" I protested, ""I have my final exams coming up, and I need to focus on that. It's really important, and I don't want to think about anything else right now."" 
I could tell my father didn't understand how much pressure I was under, or maybe he was jealous of my life away from him. He would see my refusal as a betrayal. As he explained the task, I saw how focused and determined he was. He was very skilled at his work, and I admired that in him. It made my own plans seem less important. 
""Okay,"" I said. ""I'll do it."""
CPE_56,C2,"Simon Costello realized that buying the house in Pembroke Square was a mistake within a year of moving in with Lois. He thought it was a good idea at first because he had been successful at work, and Lois had returned to her job after having twins, earning a good salary. Lois wanted to move because their flat was too small for their family, and they needed more space and a garden. They could have found a bigger place in a less expensive area, but Lois wanted to live in a nicer neighborhood. 
To save money, Lois decided that one of them should take public transport to work, and Simon ended up being the one who had to travel. The crowded tube ride made him feel frustrated and unhappy. He often thought about his grandfather's house, where he felt cared for as a child. His grandmother had always supported her husband, who was a lawyer, and seemed happy in her role. 
Lois had made it clear that her career was just as important as Simon's, which was common in modern marriages. Their lifestyle depended on both of their incomes. Simon felt threatened by a colleague named Venetia, who seemed angry when she came to their office. She accused him of wrongdoing in a past case, saying that a client claimed he had known about jury bribing and did nothing. Simon denied it, but his response felt weak and guilty. 
He wished he had said something different to defend himself. He felt ashamed and saw contempt in Venetia's eyes. He wondered why she was so angry and if she had the right to judge him. He was worried that if people heard these accusations, it could ruin his career."
CPE_36,C2,"I chose this place to live because I thought I could be anonymous among people who didn’t care about the state of their rented homes. I hoped to find peace, but I was wrong. People in the shops soon start to recognize you, even if you don’t know them. The beautiful roses from my neighbor’s garden remind me that gardens can be loved. Usually, I stay inside to forget about the summer outside, but tonight I am watching the swifts flying between the trees and roofs. I have trimmed some plants to make space for a chair, and my arms are sore from the work. 
It is a small garden in London, where plants have to grow tall to survive. My upstairs neighbor, Jaz, leans out of her window and sees me. She is a writer, and I sometimes help her with her work as an English teacher. I have her latest manuscript with me. “How’s the work going, Jaz?” I ask. She complains about how people always ask her about her writing. “I have something to drink in the fridge. I’ll bring it down,” she says. I don’t want her in the garden, and I realize it looks messy. Jaz knocks on my door and comes in. 
“So, you’re on holiday now,” she says, sitting in my chair. “I should’ve gone into teaching – writers don’t have holidays.” She asks about my plans for the break. I feel anxious about the empty days ahead. “I’m going to Stonebridge tomorrow. Can you feed my cats?” I ask. “Of course,” Jaz replies, knowing she will be around. “Where will you stay?” she asks. “I’ll be with my oldest friend, Ruby, at the Rising Sun,” I say, even though it’s not true. 
Jaz asks about her manuscript, The Cruelty of Red Vans, which I haven’t read much of. I like the title and tell her so. I think red vans can be cruel because they bring gifts to other houses but not to hers. I decide to give her some advice. “Try writing about nice people for a change,” I suggest. She gets upset and tells me to get a life. I have my work and sometimes go out, but I also think about my old geography teacher, Miss Tarrantine, who once told us, “I’ve had my moments.” We all laughed at that."
CPE_6,C2,"**Heritage**
Heritage means the connection people have with their past. We often feel connected to our personal heritage, like knowing about our grandparents and hearing stories about their lives. But we also have a need to learn about our wider past to understand our future. Heritage helps us feel secure about where we come from, which can give us a sense of belonging. Just like we inherit our genes, we also inherit a culture that has been passed down through generations. There may be parts of our national heritage that we do not like, but it is still a part of us, and it can be comforting to feel connected to something bigger. Heritage teaches us a lot and is important for our well-being. It influences our customs and material culture. In the past, we learned about our heritage through stories from our ancestors. However, in modern society, many of these stories have been lost. Now, we can learn about our past through places and buildings. It is very important to protect these links to honor our ancestors.
**The Fens**
Some time ago, I started writing a novel called *Waterland*. I did not know then that the Fens, a part of England, would be very important in my story. After the book was published, people asked me why I chose to write about a place I did not know well. I chose the Fens because they seemed simple and empty, a good setting for my story. However, I learned that the Fens are not flat or empty at all. They are very English but also strange and unique. It is interesting that in the middle of England, there is a place that many people find unusual, especially since many other areas of Britain have become part of the national culture. The Fens are both empty and full, both farmed and wild, and they seem open yet are very mysterious. I have not visited places like Wisbech or Prickwillow, but as a fiction writer, I prefer to imagine places rather than seek proof. This way of imagining the Fens is important because, as shown in Edward Storey's book, the Fens are not just a landscape but also a way of thinking.
**Museums**
Museums need to make their collections easy to access. In the past, this meant just putting items in display cases with long labels that were hard to understand. Now, museums should do more. They can create interesting displays that capture visitors' attention and emotions. Museums should also reach out to the community. For example, they can provide loan boxes of objects for teachers and materials for elderly people with memory loss. Museums focus on real items from history, not copies. This is their strength and what makes them different from heritage centers and theme parks. Museums that create exciting displays and programs will find that their competition in ""virtual history"" can actually help them by making people want to see the real things that only museums can offer.
**Architecture and Environment**
The desire to preserve things is not new, but changes in our towns happen quickly and affect us all. This can make some people want to protect everything, while others think more about what our towns are like today and what they will be like in the future. People who have lived through major events, like world wars, may feel a stronger need to preserve things because stability is important to them. If there is a need to preserve, planners should consider this. Change is not bad if we learn how to manage it. Changes in our towns reflect changes in society, such as population growth, welfare, and our needs."
CPE_33,C2,"**Einstein**
If you ask someone on the street to name a scientist, they will probably say Albert Einstein. His face is often used to sell products like computers and encyclopedias. Most people do not know much about what Einstein did, except that he created some complex theories called 'relativity'. These theories are famous for being hard to understand and for making strange predictions that do not match our everyday experiences.
Einstein was part of a big change in scientific thinking, which started the modern science of the 20th century. Scientists were trying to explain the universe better by studying how matter and natural forces relate to each other. Einstein made important contributions by looking closely at basic ideas like time, space, matter, and energy. Before him, scientists like Isaac Newton believed that stars and planets moved in a fixed space and time. Einstein changed this idea, saying that time and space are not fixed but depend on each other.
**Young Readers**
When we were children, my sister Lydia and I did not trust any book that won awards because we thought they would be boring. Our mother did not like our attitude, but our father would give us small coins for each chapter we read to encourage us to read better books. He would also give us some special books as gifts, marked with ""This Book is NOT Literature."" Even though we thought most of his books were for boys, he did help us read some good short stories and even a famous collection of poems.
**Language**
Jacob Grimm wrote in 1851 that the beginning of human language is a wonderful mystery. This mystery has led to many strange ideas. For example, Charles Caller suggested in 1928 that early humans made sounds like ""meuh"" when they were scared. This sound is sad. Early humans who faced dangerous animals might have made desperate sounds, and some words we use today, like ""malaria"" (meaning ""fever"") and the Latin word ""mors"" (meaning ""death""), remind us of those times.
Many people avoided talking about how language started because they thought it was silly, but now, studying the origin and development of language is very important. Language likely began in East Africa about 100,000 years ago. At first, people used speech mainly for friendly communication and to gain power. Sharing information was probably not the main purpose of language, which is different from what philosopher John Locke believed when he called language a way to share knowledge."
CPE_20,C2,"**Writing Reviews**
Frank Kermode talks about how to write reviews from the perspective of someone who does it. Most reviews are written quickly and do not last long. They have deadlines and strict limits on how long they can be. Once published, they are usually only read for a short time, like a day or a week, and sometimes a month at most. Because of this, many people think that writing reviews is not very important. They believe that writers only do it because they need money or because they cannot spend all their time on writing serious books.
However, writing reviews is a skilled job. It is different to write a short review of about 600 to 800 words for a newspaper than to write a longer review of 6,000 to 8,000 words for an international journal. A review in a weekly magazine is usually about 1,500 words and has challenges from both short and long reviews. 
Reviewers must think about who will read their work. Some readers just want a quick summary, while others want a detailed analysis. Reviewers also need to know a lot about different topics and write in a way that is clear and enjoyable for smart readers. This means that most reviewers also write other things besides reviews.
For example, the American writer John Updike, who does not think highly of criticism, still writes reviews when he is not working on his novels. He collects all his reviews, even the short ones, into books with modest titles. Some people might think that less famous writers should accept that their reviews will not last long, but it is understandable if they want their work to be remembered, especially if they feel their best writing is in those reviews.
I feel this way about my own writing. I mostly write academic books, which are the kind of work that professors are expected to do. In the English-speaking world, there is not a big difference between writing reviews and studying literature, so it is common for the same people to do both. 
In the past, some academics criticized professors who wrote reviews for showing off or wasting time. But now, there are more reviews available, so many people can write them. This is good for readers because they can trust that the reviewer knows what they are talking about. It is also good for professors because it helps them stay connected to the public. They need to remember to explain their ideas clearly to people who are not professors. 
In conclusion, writing reviews is important, but it is usually a secondary job. You can only write good reviews if you are also doing something else well."
CPE_40,C2,"Ralph unlocked the door to his apartment. As he entered the dark hallway, he felt a brief moment of ownership, which still surprised him after three years of living there. When he first bought the flat, he would come home excited and curious, wondering what had happened while he was away. The flat felt like a welcoming place where he could be himself. He thought he should worry about things like break-ins or leaks, but his flat always seemed to be waiting for him, looking either independent or messy, depending on how he had left it.
Over time, Ralph began to see his flat as a part of himself, a space where his thoughts and feelings overflowed. He became frustrated that it didn’t change. There were always a few letters by the door and the answering machine would sometimes blink with messages when he got home. He was thankful that his windows were intact and nothing had been stolen, but he often wondered what it would be like if something bad happened.
From his small, dull office on the third floor, Ralph looked forward to his quiet evenings at home. After leaving the busy office, he felt a little more like himself on the bus ride home. However, once he was home, he didn’t want to be alone anymore, even though he often thought he did. Sitting at his desk, he longed for peace and time to himself, but when he finally escaped, he felt empty. He started to think that his job, which he didn’t enjoy, was changing him and taking him away from who he really was.
At night, he would read or listen to music, but he began to wonder who he was doing it for. His thoughts became unclear, and he felt lost. He remembered a time when he felt more in control of his life. He had wanted to improve himself after university, but he found that he only wanted to get by. He applied for jobs that his friends talked about, following them as they moved forward, unable to see how he could find happiness in his work.
He went to one job interview and was relieved when it went well. He didn’t think to question the job, which was a vague editorial position at a local newspaper. His future boss, Neil, offered him the job right away, saying he was the only graduate who had applied. Ralph took this as a compliment at the time, even though he didn’t fully understand what it meant for his future."
CPE_45,C2,"**Goat Racing**
I was about to see goat racing on Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. I was pushing my way through ice-cream vans, many people, food stalls, and loud music. Even though everyone was going towards the racecourse, I tried to find a good spot to watch. They had set up an area for the race. It was not like a big racecourse, but people were standing on both sides of a path where the goats would run. They were trying to keep a few special goats in line. This was not easy because goats are known to eat almost anything.
**Canoe Trip**
As the day ended, I started to worry about the night. The canoe was too wet to sleep in, and we could not find a place to stop. We had not seen any villages or huts since early morning. In the dim moonlight, we used our flashlight to see the cliffs, but the batteries were dying. We changed the batteries, but they did not work. We could not find a place to camp. A little later, Lesley shouted that she saw a light in the distance, and we felt hopeful. But the light was just the moon shining on the waves. Soon, we heard the loud sound of rushing water, but we could not see what was happening. We kept moving on.
**How to Be Presentation Perfect**
I am not good at making presentations, but as the managing director, I have to present to my colleagues and important shareholders. How can I get better at this and feel more confident? You are not alone. Making a presentation is different from running a company, but many leaders need to be good at it. If you want to convince your audience, you must believe in what you are saying. Show your belief with passion and enthusiasm during your presentation. This means you need to prepare well. Test your ideas before the presentation. Ask your colleagues what tough questions the audience might ask. You should also create a positive atmosphere from the start. Begin with something everyone can relate to and then lead to the conclusion you want to share."
CPE_64,C2,"Some activities cannot be rushed. They take the time they need. If you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you are impatient with mayonnaise and add the oil too quickly, it will not turn out right. If you pull hard on a tangled fishing line, it will get tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some things happen very quickly, while others take a long time to finish. We can get better at some tasks, like solving puzzles, but other things cannot be rushed. If we try to hurry them, they can break down or get tangled, just like the mayonnaise or fishing line.
Sometimes, we need to think quickly to get results, but this can be a bad idea. We learn and think in different ways, and these ways work at different speeds. There are three main speeds of thinking. The first is faster than normal thought. Some situations need a quick reaction. For example, when I almost fell off my motorbike on a wet road, my body reacted quickly to keep me safe. This quick reaction is called our ""wits.""
The second speed is normal thinking. This is when we solve problems by using logic and reasoning. For example, a mechanic figuring out why a car won’t start or a student working on an assignment is using this type of intelligence, which we often call ""intellect."" People who are good at this kind of thinking are often called ""bright"" or ""clever.""
The third speed is slower and more relaxed. In this mode, we think in a more playful or dreamy way. For example, when we are daydreaming or just enjoying nature, we are in a different mental state than when we are planning something. This slower way of thinking is just as important as the faster ways. Taking time to think slowly is necessary, especially when life gets busy. 
Some problems are better solved with a slow mind. For example, when we are unsure about something complicated, we need to take our time to think. If we are trying to decide how to manage a difficult team at work or whether to change jobs, it might be better to sit and think rather than rush for answers. This slower thinking is connected to creativity and wisdom. 
Poets and philosophers have always understood that slow thinking has its own value. Recently, scientists have started to study these slower ways of knowing. They have found that the unconscious mind can do many interesting and important tasks if given enough time. It can recognize patterns that our conscious mind might miss and help us understand complex situations better than quick thinking can."
CPE_29,C2,"**Surviving in a Foreign Land**
I have been welcomed warmly. I am in a friendly place with many people, like scientists and students, living together in a very isolated area. There are about forty people here, and we all help each other. My school French is just enough to communicate, but I struggle to have casual conversations. I miss the small details in conversations, and my phrasebook does not help me at breakfast. This is not a big problem, but at first, I felt unsure of myself. I was nervous about mealtimes. I would hesitate to choose a table, worried about the silence when I spoke, and I felt anxious like I did in my first weeks of school. I still smile awkwardly or feel panicked when people talk to me. I think my occasional sadness is not about missing people or communication, but because I have lost the confidence I usually have when I talk easily.
**Elliot**
When I first met Elliot, I was just a young writer, and he did not pay much attention to me. He remembered faces, though, and when I saw him, he would shake my hand politely but did not want to be friends. If I saw him at the opera with important people, he would often ignore me. But then I became successful as a playwright, and I noticed that Elliot started to be friendlier. One day, he invited me to lunch, and I thought he was testing me. After that, as I made more friends because of my success, I began to see him more often.
**Alfred Hitchcock**
The film director Alfred Hitchcock always said that he did not care about the story or the acting in his films. What mattered to him was the photography and the sound. He believed that it was not the message or the acting that moved the audience, but the film itself, no matter where they came from. So, if a film is made well, people in Japan should react the same way as people in India. Hitchcock was very clear and logical about his work. He was a genius who liked to see the audience react strongly. He did not focus on complicated ideas or deep meanings, and he did not explore his characters in a complex way. He concentrated on the film itself and how it could affect the audience in a powerful way."
CPE_57,C2,"**Amateur Astronomy**
Many things have changed in astronomy in the last 50 years. Until about 30 years ago, there were not many charts and catalogues available. Telescopes were limited, and there were few books about practical astronomy. Today, there are many types of telescopes and equipment that people can buy. Electronic calculators and computers have made it easier to create charts and analyze observations. This is a great time for amateur astronomy. 
However, some things have also been lost. Now, you may have to travel 80 km to find a dark sky, which was easier to find in cities 50 years ago. During the day, the sky is often filled with trails from airplanes, which can last for hours and make it hard to see the sun or stars at night.
**Too Much Choice**
Today, people have too many choices. There are too many things to do and too many options. In our modern economy, people often want the newest product or service, and technology makes this change happen very quickly. New products come out all the time, and it can be overwhelming. This can lead to stress and make life feel complicated. 
Because of this, many people are looking for ""simplexity,"" which means finding simple things that bring meaning to life in a complicated world. But it is not easy to simplify life when there are so many products, like different brands of detergent and breakfast cereals, and many software updates and plans to choose from.
**McAndrews Hotel**
Every summer, my family spends two weeks at McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. This is a tradition started by my grandmother, and it is very important to us. Nothing can change this routine. 
The guests at McAndrews Hotel are a bit old-fashioned and some might say snobbish. I do not like the bad manners of shop assistants today, who think they are being friendly. I prefer the respect and privacy that I find at the hotel. I know many of the other guests because we have been coming here since we were children. When I see them, we usually just say hello and do not talk much. This respect for personal space is hard to find in hotels these days."
CPE_9,C2,"**Othello**  
A great production of Shakespeare's play *Othello* has moved from Stratford to London. I want to correct an unfair review I wrote when the show first opened last spring. I said that Ray Fearon was too young for the role of Othello, and I was wrong about his acting. I still believe that the age difference between Othello and Desdemona is important, but I take back my criticism of Mr. Fearon's amazing performance. The whole cast is excellent. Some memorable scenes include when Cassio's games with other young officers become dangerous, and when Iago starts to lose control. The scene where Emilia helps Desdemona get ready for bed is very emotional and can make anyone cry. The pace and tension of the play are fantastic. Don’t miss this production!
**Lake Vostok**  
In the middle of Antarctica, there is almost no life. On the edges, you can find penguins, seals, and birds. But in the center, on the big white ice, there is no life at all. However, there is a huge hidden lake called Lake Vostok, which is under almost 4 kilometers of ice. This lake is below the coldest place on Earth. The water has been cut off from air and sunlight for up to 25 million years. Scientists are very excited to explore this mysterious lake and find out what strange life forms might be there. For two years, researchers from around the world have been trying to discover the secrets of the lake. If they succeed, we will see many discoveries about Lake Vostok in the next few years.
**Scientists**  
Last week, I heard something interesting on the radio. A group of scientists is discussing what makes them want to be scientists. The phrase ""because it's there"" comes to mind. We all know that scientists want to gain knowledge and understand everything from tiny atoms to huge black holes. But these scientists want to know why we have this desire for knowledge and why science cannot explain this desire. I think it is more important to know if what scientists do is right, rather than getting stuck in debates about why we want to know things. The key point is that science is a tool, and we should decide how, where, when, and why to use it."
CPE_42,C2,"**Food**  
Food is very important in our lives. Many people who love cooking buy cookbooks like this one. Sometimes, we think cooking is only worth it for special occasions or fancy dishes, but that is not true. You can make a tasty soup just by putting some chopped carrots, a leek, celery, and herbs in water. This is much better than buying soup in a packet or a can. Instead of buying a sweet chocolate mousse full of chemicals, you can make a delicious dessert in just five minutes that both adults and kids will enjoy. Cooking is also a way to show care and love. Sharing food is important to us, which is why we celebrate special events like birthdays and anniversaries around a table. No one would want to have takeout for a wedding or anniversary party, and most people wouldn’t discuss business over canned soup.
**In the Elevator**  
This morning, Alistair tried to clean up his office, but there were still papers everywhere. Tax forms were sticking out of drawers and boxes, waiting for a day when he felt like organizing them. He also had a lot of paperwork from owning an apartment building. As the elevator took him to his floor, he knew Mallory would arrive on time for their meeting. She would knock on his office door exactly at the hour. She was very strict about time and cleanliness. He wondered how she would react to the mess. She might think someone had broken in. He could walk in after her and pretend to be shocked. His cleaning lady, Mrs. Wilson, had come while he was trying to clear some space on the floor. When he peeked out of his office, he smiled at her, hoping she would help. But she looked unhappy and thought, “There’s no way I’m going in there.” She believed he was someone from a different place, not from her familiar world in Brooklyn.
**KAREN**  
Karen wanted to be different from her mother, so she created her own story. In her story, there were important moments, like when she was twelve years old and her brother accidentally hit her in the eye with a golf club. At first, she thought she would go blind, but the bone protected her. The doctor later told her that the club had missed her eye, and she only needed a few stitches. When she opened her eyes in the doctor’s office and saw her mother talking about miracles, she felt grateful and knew she was saved for a reason.
**Miss Fogerty**  
Miss Fogerty was walking quickly across the wet grass of the village green, feeling both excited and sad. It is always thrilling to be the first to know something important in a small community, and her life was usually quiet. However, she was very sad about Dr. Bailey’s health. He had been her doctor for many years, and she appreciated how he cared for her when she had laryngitis, which was her only health problem. Miss Fogerty thought his best quality was that he always made time for his patients and listened to their worries. This is why the villagers loved him so much. He was always ready to share his time, knowledge, and humor, and in return, he received their loyalty and affection."
CPE_59,C2,"**Joanna's Lessons**
Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist. She performs a lot, but she has also started writing books for young children who want to learn the piano. Joanna's performances are exciting and impressive. Even people who do not know much about music can enjoy her playing. At a recent concert for kids, one boy asked her, ""Can you play Match of the Day?"" This surprised many musicians, but Joanna found it funny. She realized that the boy thought she was not a real pianist until she played that song.
Joanna cares a lot about how children learn music. She has just published a beginner piano book called *Joanna MacGregor's Piano World*. She wrote this book even though she has a very busy schedule. This summer, she is performing at many festivals and working with young composers. She also runs her own music label called Sound Circus.
Joanna believes that the first lessons in music are very important. Many music teachers focus on talented children, but she thinks that most people enjoy music in a more everyday way. She wants to make music accessible to everyone. When she was younger, she taught many beginners how to play the piano. She also grew up with many children coming to her home to learn music from her mother. This experience helped her understand that music should be for everyone, not just for those with special talent.
Joanna thinks that just like everyone should learn to swim or speak a little French, everyone should try to learn the piano. Some children learn quickly, while others take their time and sometimes give up. This can happen for many reasons. Some kids find it hard at the beginning, while others feel pressure to be like the talented children they see on TV. Joanna worries that some parents push their children too hard, making them feel they must achieve something instead of just enjoying music.
When asked if she thinks other piano books are not good, Joanna is careful with her words. She does not want to criticize other teachers or books. However, her books are colorful and fun, and she tries to make learning enjoyable by adding stories to them. She believes that learning should be fun and encourages children to play freely.
As children learn, they need to practice reading music, which can be challenging. Joanna understands this because she relied on her ear when she was young. She believes that practice is very important. She suggests that children should have clear goals for their practice. She also advises them to enjoy playing, even if they make mistakes, and to mix difficult pieces with easier ones.
Joanna wants to help children enjoy music and believes that everyone can learn to play the piano."
CPE_54,C2,"**Writing by Hand and on Screen**
Dr. Johnson said that ""what is written without effort is usually read without pleasure."" This means that good writing takes hard work. When I look back at my handwritten school essays, I see that I made very few mistakes. Today, I would rewrite them many times. I think this is because writing by hand is harder. Writing slowly helps the brain think better. When we write by hand, we take more care. But using a computer can make us careless. Many writers spend just as much time fixing mistakes in their computer drafts as they did writing by hand. 
Also, emails feel different from handwritten letters. Emails are often less personal. Many people now write love letters through email, which is a good thing. At least these emails are written in English and have some grammar. However, words on a screen can feel boring. Writers often do not understand the power of writing and can exaggerate their messages. Words typed quickly lack the care and personality of handwriting.
**The CD**
I put down my cup and looked at the CD. The case was not impressive, but the shiny disc inside looked interesting. ""Wonderful little things, aren't they?"" Mr. Warriston said when he came back. I agreed and carefully handed the disc to him. ""It's amazing that they can fit seventy minutes of music on them,"" he said, turning on the music player. Lights turned on, and he pressed a button to open a small drawer. He placed the disc inside and closed it again. ""Some people say they sound cold, but I think they..."" I interrupted, ""Do you have to turn them over like records?"" 
""What? No,"" Mr. Warriston replied. ""You only play one side."" I asked why, and he looked surprised and then thought for a moment. ""I don't know. You could make both sides playable and double the music,"" he said, looking at the machine. ""You could use two lasers or just turn it over by hand... hmm."" He smiled at me. ""Yes, good point."" He pointed to my wooden chair. ""Come on, let's get you sitting in the best place for the stereo effect, okay?"" I smiled, happy to have asked a technical question that Mr. Warriston could not answer.
**Books vs. Electronic Text**
Malcolm Bradbury said that if matches had been invented after cigarette lighters, we would have thought they were a great improvement. Many people say that electronic text is as important as the invention of printing. They believe it is almost finished. But they forget that changes in how we think take a long time. This idea is called chronocentricity, which means thinking that our generation is the most important in history. 
In a book from 1979, it was said that in the 1980s, books would slowly disappear. So far, this has not happened. Reading long texts on a screen is often not enjoyable, so many people do not do it. Computers encourage people to read only parts of texts. Some people say this is good because it leads to new ways of telling stories. But many books have always been read in parts, like religious texts and dictionaries. The real problem is that computers do not encourage us to read everything from start to finish.
**The Office**
Charles walked into the office and saw everything was in order. The carpet was clean, and the dark wooden desk looked just like it did at the auction five weeks ago. Neat file holders were in their drawers, and twelve years of trade journals filled one wall. Kathleen struggled to close the filing cabinet and then turned to him. ""You have to use computers, Charles. This is too much,"" she said.
""Hello, Kathleen. This is amazing,"" he replied, admiring the room and its antique furniture. He did not think about computers or any machines in the office. ""Simply amazing,"" he said, avoiding the topic of computers. They had talked about this many times over the two years they had known each other. She could not understand why he did not want to use technology, even though he was good with computers and had published an important paper about them. She had inspired that paper. She could easily use software to create new things."
CPE_32,C2,"""You don’t take sugar, do you?"" shouted his secretary. She was not really asking; she was stating a fact because she had been making coffee for Lancelot for many months. She often forgot things because he was not usually supposed to be there. But now, he was there all the time. He realized that staying away from work only caused more problems. 
He thought about how he had changed from a respected advisor who met authors and playwrights for lunch to someone who was always rushing to avoid problems and had trouble finding a parking space in the morning. 
""This came,"" she yelled, waving a manila folder before putting it in front of him. ""From that guy in Los Angeles. You wanted to see it."" The label said: ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert,"" and below it, it said ""An Expanded Synopsis."" Lancelot did not want to see the word ""synopsis."" He wanted to see ""A First Draft."" He had already seen a synopsis of this book and did not want to see another one, even if it was revised. 
Ian Cuthbert had received a large advance for this book when Lancelot bought the company. Ian was one of Lancelot's old friends, and he had made a mistake by asking him to write books. Ian was known for being unpredictable, and Lancelot felt that he was becoming even more difficult to deal with. 
Lancelot skipped the introduction he had read many times and looked at the synopsis. He recognized almost every phrase. He closed the folder and pushed it aside. At this rate, Ian's manuscript would never arrive. The synopsis lacked the brilliance that Ian was supposed to have, and it felt like he had lost his passion for the project. 
Lancelot remembered a famous author whose last book was published after his death, chapter by chapter, with payments made one at a time. But in that case, the payments were small amounts that had never been given. Ian had received a huge advance, which was against the usual business rule that authors must deliver a manuscript before getting paid. 
Lancelot, who studied modern languages at Oxford, remembered when Ian was seen as a great talent in Cambridge. His friends wanted to take over British theatre, and they succeeded quickly. But Ian seemed lazy compared to them. He wore his overcoat like a cape and talked about famous French writers as if he had met them. However, Ian's creative talent remained hidden. 
While less talented people became successful, Ian became more reclusive. Even when he was a well-known editor for an arts magazine, he struggled to produce anything. The magazine used up a lot of money without being published. His contract with a fashion magazine was renewed three times, but it only created stories about how much he was paid, which kept increasing to try to make him work. 
At meetings, Ian was often rude and critical of others' ideas. Ten years later, he was so unreliable that Lancelot thought ""A World History of the Short"" had been a mistake from the beginning."
CPE_65,C2,"**England's Breakfast Revolution**
Health experts agree that a good breakfast is very important. However, breakfast is a relatively new meal in England. In medieval times, people rarely wrote about breakfast. There are a few mentions of travelers eating a meal at dawn before long journeys and sick people having breakfast for health reasons, but most people did not eat breakfast unless they were kings or nobles.
In the sixteenth century, breakfast started to become common for everyone. Some writers say this happened because food became easier to get. However, they may not have thought about other important changes in society. For example, new job patterns meant that more people had to work set hours, often starting very early. Because of this, eating a meal in the morning became necessary and was not just for rich people anymore."
CPE_61,C2,"**Photography**  
When a photographer takes a picture, they choose what to show based on their skills, personal views, and experiences, as well as social and cultural ideas. In this book, we will see how these factors influence the style and meaning of a photograph, and how viewers understand and react to these images. For example, a person reading a newspaper will usually understand the photos printed there. However, instead of just accepting the photo as it is, we can ask if it really shows what happened at that moment. Does it show the photographer's opinion? Is the exact moment important, or should we see the photo as a symbol of something bigger in the world?
**More than a Game**  
For me, sports are more than just a game. The most successful athletes believe in themselves completely. To succeed in sports, you need to focus only on that goal. It is a tough world, and no one will do the hard work for you. You either succeed or fail. Sports have taught me discipline and determination, but they also show the importance of teamwork. My sport allows me to shine as an individual, but it is still a team effort, and I must balance both. This is similar to life – you can achieve personal success, but you should always remember the people around you. Sports have given me a lot, not just money. They have opened doors for me and shown me things in the world that many people will never see. However, you also have to give up a lot to enjoy these benefits.
**Tuning In**  
Some experiences stay in our memory very clearly. For me, one special moment happened many years ago in California. One night, I was awake listening to a beautiful mockingbird singing from a tree in my neighborhood. I don’t have trouble sleeping, but the bird's amazing song kept me awake. As I listened to its complex melodies, I felt like I was in a special musical world. To understand the bird's patterns, I thought about my experiences with jazz and Indian classical music. The bird made me feel like I was enjoying a fantastic live performance. I reacted with joy as I listened to its surprising musical changes until I finally fell asleep."
CPE_52,C2,"
People have always had strong feelings about birds. They love them, fear them, and even worship them. But what does this say about us? 
In a greenhouse, a little brown bird called a wren is bumping against the glass. Some people think this bird has a special message, while others see it as just a lost bird. Both ideas could be true. 
Wrens have been part of British culture for a long time. In medieval times, people believed that the way wrens flew could tell them about their luck. Today, wrens are still seen in pictures and decorations in many British homes. Even if old beliefs about them are not as strong now, people still care about wrens. A place without wrens feels sad and empty. 
This connection with birds comes from a time when people relied more on nature for survival. They developed a way to understand the importance of different animals. However, people's views can change over time. 
For example, the red kite bird was once seen as a valuable part of city life in London. People were amazed to see them taking food from children. But soon, they were considered pests and disappeared from many areas. Now, red kites are seen as important birds again and are being protected and brought back to their original homes. 
Our relationship with birds goes back to the beginning of human history. Early humans watched birds closely because they could warn them about danger or changes in the weather. Birds also connected them to their dreams. 
When we think about why birds matter to us, we are also thinking about what it means to be human. Birds can fly, sing, and represent freedom. Our interest in birds shows something about our own identity and our connection to nature. Some people might think these feelings are not important anymore, but they are still part of who we are. Losing this connection would be difficult. 
Recently, birds have become important signs of environmental change. In Britain, 30 bird species are in danger, which is sad because it means losing not just the birds but also part of our culture. Birds like the skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing represent love and magic in stories and poems. Losing these birds is felt deeply by those who appreciate literature. 
However, the loss of other birds that are not part of stories or folklore is often ignored. Folklore is important because it connects us to the past through stories and legends. These stories have a stronger emotional connection than scientific facts. 
Whether we watch birds on TV or in our gardens, the joy we feel from them cannot be fully explained by science. Birds engage us in ways that are hard to describe. The wren in the greenhouse connects our present with a rich history, reminding us of the mysteries of life and nature."
CPE_28,C2,"**Maps**
The main purpose of a map is to show how different places and features on the earth relate to each other. This is done by showing distance and direction. In the past, people often measured distance in time, like saying ""it takes so many hours to walk"" or ""a day's journey by river."" These measurements helped people understand how easy it was to travel through different areas, rather than giving exact distances.
Direction is also important, but for most travelers, the main questions were ""Where do I go from here?"" and ""How far away is it?"" Because of this, written directions were often just as important as maps. Even today, some maps, like those for train systems, do not always show true directions. In the beginning, important landmarks along a route were marked by signs, which could be realistic or simple, and their size showed how important they were.
The way maps are made can change based on their purpose and location. To understand early maps, it is important to know the specific rules used to create them. The history of map-making, or cartography, shows how the accuracy of distance and direction has improved over time. Other sciences have helped in this process. For example, instead of using shadows or stars to find direction, people started using the magnetic compass and tools that could measure angles accurately.
As explorers learned more about the world, they tried to create better maps. Astronomers found out that the earth is not a perfect sphere, which led to more improvements in mapping large areas. Over time, the needs of map users changed. Travelers and merchants were not the only ones using maps anymore. Soldiers needed accurate maps for military purposes, especially after the invention of artillery. This led to the creation of contour maps, which show the shape of the land.
Other people, like archaeologists and historians, also needed maps for their work. Today, cartographers create maps for many different uses, such as showing geological layers or land use. The growing importance of maps in many fields has led to a new interest in cartography.
It is important to note that the development of maps has not always been steady. There have been times when progress slowed down, and old ideas stayed alongside new ones. Cartographers have often had good ideas but had to wait for better tools to use them. Since it is easy to copy old maps, many map publishers have been slow to accept new ideas. Therefore, we should not always trust maps as perfect representations of current knowledge and techniques.
The many maps we have today are the result of a lot of human effort and thought. They provide valuable information about our past, which makes studying historical maps both interesting and educational."
CPE_35,C2,"**Tim Rice**
I was taken to a young man's living room, which was a nice and calm place compared to the messy rooms where his family members spent time. Moving from the kitchen to his room felt like going from economy to business class. In this room, I saw the biggest collection of records I had ever seen, the first stereo record player I had encountered, and surprising things like Georgian wine glasses, pictures, and furniture that a teenager had bought. His name was Andrew Lloyd Webber. He had a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford, to study history, and he had nine months before starting school. During this time, he wanted to become a famous composer like Richard Rodgers.
I also had big dreams; I wanted to be a pop star for the usual reasons: women, money, and fame. But my dreams were not as important to me as Andrew's were to him. When Andrew suggested that I try to become a famous lyricist like Oscar Hammerstein, I was open to it. This was partly because, after just ten minutes of meeting him, he played me three of his own songs on the piano, and I could tell he was very talented.
As he played more songs from the shows he had created at school, I remembered some of the best albums from my parents' collection. He needed a new lyricist, and I didn’t have much to show him except for my praise for his music and a single I had written with a little-known pop group that had not done well. We agreed to meet again and write something together. I was still more interested in pop music than in theater, but I thought I had met someone special who would be very successful in musical theater soon. Even if we didn’t become top composers, we could try to compete with the Beatles and Rolling Stones later in the summer.
The next day, back at my office where I was training to be a lawyer, the excitement I felt about working with Andrew had faded a bit. I would still look for ads in Melody Maker for groups needing a singer and write more simple songs. But it was likely that I would finish my exams and become a lawyer by twenty-five. My father thought I would stop enjoying pop music by twenty-one, which worried me because that meant I only had a few months left to enjoy it. But I felt I had nothing to lose by seeing Andrew again. It would be fun to go to a musical with him and write lyrics for musicals instead of pop songs. Andrew was an interesting person who talked about good food and old buildings, and he supported the Leyton Orient football team.
I wasn’t sure about the musical idea he had been working on for a year, but in 1965, I often doubted things. His talent was clear, and he said he had many important contacts. I soon found myself back in his living room. The idea was about Dr. Thomas Barnardo, a man from the 19th century who started orphanages. His story was important, but it didn’t excite me much. The main character seemed too perfect, and the idea felt unoriginal, similar to the popular show, Oliver.
However, Andrew was very confident about his music, and his excitement was contagious. I didn’t know much about musicals, but as someone once said, if there is one hamburger place, there can be another. We could be the second one. I started working hard, especially on the funny songs. Andrew explained the story, played me the music, and often gave me the song titles, which were probably thought up by his friend from school. I even skipped a day at the law office, pretending to be sick, to write my first lyrics for the musical. I didn’t know it then, but I was starting a new career."
CPE_5,C2,"**Language**  
You and I are part of a special group of beings that can communicate with each other very well. Language is so important in our lives that it is hard to think of life without it. If you see two or more people together anywhere in the world, they will likely start talking to each other. When people are alone, they often talk to themselves, their pets, or even their plants. I like to think of language as an 'instinct'. This means that people know how to talk, just like spiders know how to make webs. Spiders do not need to learn how to spin webs from someone else; they just know how to do it.
**Climate and Weather**  
Climate and weather, which are mostly created by the air around us, greatly affect the lives of animals and plants. Climate can change how landscapes look. For example, warm and wet weather all year allows tropical jungles to grow, which are full of many different species. On the other hand, cold and windy places have fewer living things. The daily weather we experience is caused by large air movements, as the atmosphere is always changing. Some of this movement happens because the air is on a spinning Earth. Since air is light, it does not move as fast as the Earth, so it tends to lag behind. The sun is also a big reason for air movement.
**Coffee**  
As a bar-person, my job included serving drinks, but I was also responsible for making coffee. In Lygon Street, Melbourne, a restaurant's success can depend on how good its coffee is. I spent several days learning how to make coffee, including how to clean and take care of the restaurant's espresso machine. I also learned how to make a great cappuccino. By the end of the first week, I realized that making good coffee was harder than it seemed, and I thought I might have to go back to cleaning ashtrays. Luckily, my boss was patient. He told me, ""Making coffee is both an art and a science, and you need time to learn it."""
CPE_41,C2,"**Art on TV**
Why does television often have problems with programs about visual arts? Painting and sculpture are great subjects for the camera because it can show the whole artwork and then zoom in to see the details. However, there are not many TV series that show the joy and complexity of looking at art. 
A good example of this is Robert Hughes's series called *American Visions*, which has eight parts. Hughes is a trusted critic with a strong personality, and he has almost eight hours to introduce British viewers to American art, which British galleries often ignore. I thought the series would focus on famous artworks, but instead, it looked at how American history and culture are shown in its art and buildings.
**Dealing in Metals**
For 20 years, I worked as an international metals dealer and became known as a speculator. The metals market has fewer rules than other markets. With some luck, a willingness to take risks, and a good understanding of the market, it is possible to make a lot of money. Taking risks is part of this business. This adventurous culture fits well with a free-market global economy. 
However, the free-trade economists who believed that the market would keep the prices of rare metals high have found the opposite is true. More minerals are being mined, and the prices of raw materials are going down. When we consider inflation, the prices of most metals are about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to investigate claims against a large company that benefits from these cheap raw materials.
**Extract from a Holiday Brochure**
Abaco and its nearby cays are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas, which stretch from Florida to Cuba. Each island has its own character and something special to offer. To get around the islands and cays of Abaco, you need a boat. If a boat is not included with your room, don’t worry. There are many ferries and water taxis available. You can also rent boats if you want to explore on your own. 
Sailing is the most popular way to travel here. Abaco is known as 'The Sailing Capital of the World' for good reasons. The calm, protected waters are perfect for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The cays and their beaches stretch for 200 miles, looking like a string of pearls. At night, the lights from the restaurants and cafes in Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay shine brightly, adding to the beauty of the area."
CPE_69,C2,"**Build Your Own Bamboo Bike at the UK’s First Workshop**
You can build your own bamboo bike at the Bamboo Bike Club in the UK. This workshop is run by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan. When you join a course, you get a custom bike frame designed by a computer and a fun weekend of bike-building.
It is Saturday morning in Hackney Wick, east London. The Bamboo Bike Club is the only place in Britain where you can learn to build bamboo bikes. I went to see what was happening. There was a lot of energy and fun in the air. Bamboo is becoming popular for making bikes again. Companies like Calfee Design from California and Bamboo Bikes from Yorkshire have been making bamboo bikes since 1894. However, many cyclists find these bikes too expensive. A ready-made bamboo frame can cost around $2,995 or £1,868.
James and Ian wanted to create a bamboo bike business that everyone could afford. They spent years working in a shed in Brecon, Wales, to make this happen. They wanted to share the joy of making something special and sustainable. So, they created the Bamboo Bike Club, which is more about community than just business. Both James and Ian have other full-time jobs; James makes wind turbines, and Ian is a civil engineer.
The Bamboo Bike Club offers monthly courses where you can build your own bike frame at a good price. On the first day, James and Ian teach you how to choose strong bamboo and how to make strong joints. You start by putting together the front triangle of the bike, then the seat and chain parts. Some metal tubes are added for the handlebars and other parts that need extra strength.
Building the bike can be challenging, especially if you are not used to DIY projects. James and Ian help everyone by checking each cut and joint. They are friendly and encourage you to try again if you make a mistake. The bamboo used in the workshop is checked for quality, so you can choose how your bike will look: plain bamboo, black, or mottled.
On Sunday, you spend time building the lugs, which are the parts that connect the frame. You wrap the joints with hemp and glue them to make them strong. After adding a waterproof coating, your bike is ready for wheels, brakes, gears, and any personal touches. James and Ian say their bamboo bikes are just as strong as metal bikes. Ian has used his bike for over a year, and James has tested his bike off-road for three months without breaking it.
The bamboo bikes may not look as polished as professional ones, but they are unique. James and Ian believe that the special look of each bike is important. I think bamboo bikes are great for relaxed rides rather than racing. I chose a 'Classic English' frame for a smooth ride. When I tried James's bike, it felt light and smooth, even on bumpy roads.
James says that some people enjoy building the bike, but the real fun is riding it. Bamboo bikes are light and easy to ride, making them enjoyable. And the best part? The price is less than £500."
CPE_38,C2,"**Self-Help Books**
Diane Reverend was an editor at Random House in New York when she first saw a book by a new pop psychologist, Dr. John Gray. She thought the title was great and believed it would be a bestseller, and she was right. Dr. Gray became very successful, and Diane started her own company. Dr. Gray's book helps people understand each other better in relationships and is part of a big self-help industry in America. This industry tries to meet people's desires for improvement and also creates new needs. It supports the publishing world in New York. 
In Britain, people are discovering that many self-help books are not very good, but many more are rejected because they are too similar or too specific. This is a good thing. Editors are now looking for the next popular book, and they care more about how marketable a book is than how well it is written. Diane says that if someone has a catchy title, it makes it easier to attract readers.
**Autobiographies**
When someone writes an autobiography, there is an unspoken agreement that they will tell the truth. However, this agreement is often not fully kept. Writers may leave out things they feel are too embarrassing or not important. Sometimes, they might invent stories that express their truth better than just sticking to the facts. They might even call their book an autobiography just to make readers believe it is true, even if it is mostly fiction. This can happen without any bad intentions.
**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**
People who study detective stories say that this genre grew because of the problems in society in the late 1800s and early 1900s. A detective story often shows a crime that represents human feelings like greed or desire. Solving the crime helps bring order back to society. In Hammett's stories, society is shown to be corrupt. The detective and the criminal are two sides of the same person. They understand each other and have a strange connection. The detective is seen as too honest by criminals and too shady by the law. His job is complicated because he feels connected to both sides.
**Science Writing**
Stephen Jay Gould is one of the best science writers today. I met him at the Grand Hotel while he was promoting his new book. We both felt out of place there. Gould believes that to write well about science, you need to understand the scientific community. If you don’t know the culture, it is hard to write about it. He advises writers to never talk down to their readers. You can make the language easier to understand, but you should not change the main ideas. If readers feel like they are being treated as less intelligent, they will lose interest in the writing."
CPE_17,C2,"**Air-conditioning**
At Cannons Gym, a popular place for City of London workers during lunch, it feels very cold inside. To handle the high summer temperatures, the gym has turned the air-conditioning up too much. Sometimes, it feels like being in the Arctic! This shows how people often misuse air-conditioning today. It is now a common part of our work and leisure, showing how we try to control the climate. However, many buildings could use other ways to stay cool. They could use natural light and fresh air, and have thicker walls that keep heat out during the day and let it go at night. These ideas might seem simple, but they can really help and would reduce the need for air-conditioning.
**Sundials**
It is interesting that as we start a new millennium, more people are interested in sundials. Sundials are tools that tell time by using the sun's position. A hundred years ago, they were very important for keeping time. But as clocks and watches became better, sundials were mostly seen as garden decorations. Now, they are being taken seriously again. David Harber, who makes sundials, thinks people like them because they connect us to the planets. He says there is a special moment when a sundial starts to work. They are calm and beautiful objects that remind us of our place in the universe.
**Paint Your Own China**
My idea of china-painting came from a visit to an arts and crafts show long ago. There, I saw serious-looking older women painting delicate flowers on teacups with great skill. It was amazing to watch them, as each brushstroke created a perfect petal or leaf. Their hands were steady, and the paint never smudged. I thought these women must have practiced for many years or had a special talent. Because of this, I wondered what kind of people would join a china-painting class. Would beginners be good at it? When I attended a class, I found it was not scary at all. Everyone was there to have fun, and even the teacher did not want to paint flowers as quickly as I had remembered."
CPE_47,C2,"**The Wrong Country**
Uncle chose a package holiday for Keith and Dawne at a good price. They had a flight from Gatwick Airport and twelve nights in Venice, a beautiful city, at the Pensione Concordia. When they went to the travel agency to book the trip, the clerk told them that the other people in their group were a school group from the south coast, all learning Italian.
But something went wrong. At the travel agency, the check-in desk, or maybe in a computer, a mistake happened. Instead of going to Venice, Keith and Dawne ended up in a hotel called the Edelweiss in Switzerland. At Gatwick, they gave their tickets to a girl in a yellow-and-red uniform. She checked their tickets and said everything was fine. An hour later, they were surprised to hear older people on the plane speaking with accents from the North of England. Keith thought there might have been a cancellation or that the Italian class was on another plane.
After they landed, a woman with glasses told them to stay together. The brochure did not mention an overnight stop, but when they arrived at the hotel, it was close to midnight. They were tired and did not question the beds they were given. However, the next morning, they found out they were supposed to stay in that hotel for their whole holiday, and they became worried.
The receptionist smiled and said they could enjoy the lake and take a boat to Interlaken. Keith calmly told him there had been a mistake. They were supposed to be in Venice at the Pensione Concordia. The receptionist did not know that place. Dawne added that the man who booked their trip was bald, wore glasses, and had a moustache. She also mentioned the travel agency in London.
Then, a woman named Mrs. Franks, who had been on the plane, approached them. She said she was married to a man with a bad leg. Dawne asked if she was in charge because they were in the wrong hotel. Keith explained that they had followed the girl in the yellow-and-red uniform and ended up in the wrong group. Dawne added that they should have known something was wrong when they heard people talking about Darlington instead of Dover.
Mrs. Franks explained that there are many different holidays offered by the travel agency, and all tickets look similar. She laughed and said if they followed others with the yellow-and-red label, they might end up in a wildlife park, but that could never happen. Keith insisted they were not supposed to be in Switzerland.
Mrs. Franks then walked away, leaving them confused. The receptionist was gone, and they could hear typing. Dawne whispered that Mrs. Franks seemed kind, but Keith was not paying attention. He thought about everything that had happened: giving the tickets, waiting, and getting on the plane.
An elderly man named Mr. Nottage interrupted Keith's thoughts. He and his wife, both in their eighties, said they had a great night's sleep because of the fresh air by the lake. Dawne replied that was nice. Keith and Dawne left the hotel reception without saying anything to each other about the irony of their situation. They had planned a holiday to escape the demands of older people, but they found themselves on a tour with them instead. Uncle had said the same thing when they tried to convince him to join them."
CPE_48,C2,"**He Was a People Person**
American business leaders are looking to the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a good example of management. Eluned Price reports.
Most people in Britain know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and what he did. However, America has only recently discovered him. The Wall Street Journal called Shackleton ""an Antarctic explorer whose achievements went mostly unnoticed for most of the 20th century,"" which is not entirely true. Now, Americans are showing great interest in him. Many books about Shackleton and his famous voyage on the Endurance are being published. The American Museum of Natural History is planning a big exhibition, and a film about Shackleton's life is being made.
Some American managers see Shackleton as a role model. They talk about his actions with great respect and find lessons in his leadership and communication skills. They even refer to each other as ""speaking Shackleton."" Shackleton, known for his determination and resourcefulness, has become a model for modern management consultants.
Jim MacGregor, a managing partner at a New York firm, has looked up to Shackleton for years. His firm focuses on communication during business mergers and crises. For example, they deal with situations like ""the factory exploded"" or ""we have to lay off half the workers."" While it may seem hard to connect Shackleton's survival skills in extreme cold to managing a business crisis, MacGregor believes Shackleton is a great example of a leader. 
Shackleton had strong values and was at his best when he and his team had a lot to lose, including their lives. One of his most interesting decisions was to turn back when he was only 97 miles from the South Pole. This choice showed his commitment to his men’s safety. In a crisis, people want to know who is in charge. While many managers today avoid responsibility, Shackleton was willing to take charge.
His 1914 expedition became legendary. His ship, the Endurance, was trapped in ice for nine months and eventually sank. When the ship went down, Shackleton told his men, ""We should all reach safety if you do your best and trust me."" From the diaries kept during the journey, it is clear that Shackleton was always in control. 
MacGregor explains that Shackleton planned for every situation, kept his men informed, and listened to their opinions. He was flexible and ready to change plans if needed. Shackleton believed that an explorer must have optimism, strength, and patience. MacGregor notes that in difficult times, especially in America, people often want quick solutions. For example, if you invest in bonds and make a mistake, it is better to wait for the situation to improve rather than sell and lose money. 
Shackleton led by example. On the way back from the Endurance, he saw Hurley, the photographer, without gloves. He insisted Hurley wear his gloves, saying he would throw them overboard if he didn’t. Another time, during a 1905 expedition when food was scarce, Shackleton offered to leave a biscuit in the snow instead of eating it himself, saying it was worth more than money.
As Caroline Alexander, the author of ""Endurance,"" says, ""People are increasingly interested in heroic efforts. Shackleton shows that true heroism is rare today. He stands out as a real example of the ideals we long for."""
CAE_15,C1,"**Tapping into a Food Supply**
In the forests of Madagascar, there is a special animal called the aye-aye. This primate has a way of finding food that is similar to how a woodpecker does. Both the aye-aye and the woodpecker look for insects by digging into wood. The woodpecker uses its beak to make holes and its long tongue to get the insects. The aye-aye, however, uses its sharp front teeth to chew into the wood and its long third finger to reach inside and get the insects.
Scientists have studied the aye-aye's feeding habits for many years. Dr. Carl Erickson from Duke University has been observing three aye-ayes: two males named Nosferatu and Poe, and a female named Samantha with her baby, Annabelle. He wanted to find out how they find insects hidden in the wood.
Dr. Erickson first checked if the aye-ayes could see signs of insects, like holes in the wood where insects might have entered. He gave them logs with holes he had made. Some holes led to food, while others were just empty. The aye-ayes went straight to the food, showing they did not need to see the holes to find it. They might have been using their sense of smell or hearing, but more tests showed they did not need these senses either. They could find food even when the smell was blocked and when the insects were dead and silent.
So, how did the aye-ayes find the insects? Dr. Erickson found that they could sense the empty spaces in the wood. When looking for food, an aye-aye taps the wood with its long finger and listens carefully. Dr. Erickson thinks the aye-aye is using a method called echo-location, where it listens for sounds that tell it there is a hollow space below. It can also hear insects moving when they are disturbed.
Some people think the aye-aye acts like a woodpecker in Madagascar, but there are also birds like the Sickle-billed and Nuthatch Vangas that look for insects in wood. So, the woodpecker role may not be empty. The aye-aye is unique because it combines features of both woodpeckers and bats, and it also behaves like a squirrel. Its front teeth keep growing like a squirrel's, and it has been seen in the wild chewing through nuts and using its long finger to get the nut meat inside."
CAE_19,C1,"**Ordinary People, Ordinary Lives**
Many of us have pictures of our grandparents, but how many of us really know what their lives were like? We might have some old diaries or family stories, but they often don’t tell us everything. And what will our grandchildren know about us? We often plan to write down our stories, but we don’t always do it. Sometimes we leave videos instead of photos, but videos can’t show everything.
Hannah Renier has found a solution. She writes autobiographies for other people, creating a book of at least 20,000 words, with pictures if needed. She focuses on ordinary people, not famous ones. Hannah got this idea after talking to her family and realizing that many stories from the past were being forgotten. She says, ""When I started, I didn’t take it seriously, but after meeting people with interesting lives, I changed my mind. They often say they are doing it for their children, but they enjoy it too.""
People feel safe sharing their stories with Hannah because she keeps everything private. One man, who is 62 years old, said, ""I felt free to be honest. I talked about painful things, like my divorce."" He wrote his story for his family, but he hasn’t let his children read it yet because he wants to protect them from some details. He thinks it might be better for them to read it after he is gone.
Hannah has noticed that many people are influenced by their parents. She says, ""It’s surprising how much childhood experiences affect people for the rest of their lives. They often repeat the same mistakes or choose partners their parents would like or rebel against them."" Many people still feel regret about things that happened long ago, and they carry these feelings into adulthood.
Hannah listens more than she asks questions. She says, ""I’m not here to judge or be nosy. Sometimes people share something and then worry if it should be included. I usually keep it in, but they can change it later."" People want to be honest about their lives, even the difficult parts.
Hannah’s work is not about showing off. She believes that as life moves quickly, we forget our past. Writing these stories helps people connect with their roots and understand their family history. Each book takes about 30 hours of recorded interviews, which Hannah uses to write the life story. She organizes the material well and writes clearly. The final book looks good and costs nearly £3,000, with extra copies available for £25 each. 
Hannah gets about 10 requests each week, but the price stops many people from ordering. She thought her service would be cheaper, but the people who have used her service are often from wealthy backgrounds. They are the kind of people who would have had their portraits painted in the past to pass down to their families."

The Museum of Classical Archaeology has a large collection of over six hundred copies of Greek and Roman sculptures. It is important to know that none of the sculptures are real; they are all replicas made from the originals, mostly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Museum is in a specially designed building with great natural light. The benefit of these plaster casts is that you can see groups of sculptures that were originally together, even if they are now in different museums across Europe. You can see many famous Greek and Roman sculptures in just one afternoon.

There is a small display in the entrance hall, and the library staff can help with questions. You cannot borrow the photographs, but you can usually buy copies, which take about a month to make.
**E. Cambridge Medieval Brass Rubbing Centre**  
The Cambridge Brass Rubbing Centre is the second oldest and longest-running center of its kind in the world. It is a unique tourist attraction where you can have fun creating wall hangings by rubbing over one of more than a hundred different brass plates from the tombs of medieval knights and ladies. The center makes resin copies, called facsimiles, to protect the original plates while allowing everyone to enjoy brass rubbing. These brass plates were used as memorials and spread from Germany to medieval Europe and Scandinavia. Many beautiful brass plates were destroyed during various revolutions, but most of the remaining ones are in Britain, with the largest variety found at the Cambridge Centre."
CAE_13,C1,"**From Here to Fatherhood**
**A. The Theatre Director**  
I have had a strange personal life, but I have enjoyed 35 years with small children. This morning, I fed the baby, and that is what being a father means to me. I feel very lucky with my children. We all love the same things: opera, theatre, books, and music. This has created a strong bond between us, especially now that they are mostly grown up and I feel more like a friend than a father. I do not believe in hitting children. I have slapped my kids in anger before, but I do not think it is right. I may not have been the most attentive father, but I have always tried to be there for them. I am available if they need me, but I do not chase them to ask why they haven’t called. I think that makes them feel guilty, and I would never want to do that to my children.
**B. The Advertising Executive**  
I was young when my children were born, around 25 years old. I found the responsibilities hard at first, but they also kept me feeling young. As they became teenagers, they showed me new things like music and fashion, which helped me in my job. I missed some important moments when they were younger, like their first concerts and sports days, and I feel sad about that. However, now I can take them on holidays to nice places like the south of France. They get along well with my friends and come to parties and work events without feeling nervous. I think it helps that my job is seen as interesting.
**C. The Politician**  
My first child was born just before I started my political career. My wife and I promised to spend time with our children, but as my work became busier, it became harder to find time. I only accept weekend meetings if my kids can come with me. This way, they can see what I do when I am not with them, and they do not feel like I am disappearing. I have noticed that more politicians are bringing their kids to work. Maybe we are all realizing how important it is to include our children in our lives.
**D. The Writer**  
My first marriage ended when my daughters, Kate and Bonnie, were young, so I had to think more about being a father. I tried hard to stay close to them. My ex-wife and I even lived next to each other for a while so they could visit easily, but I think that confused them. Kate has said I was always there for her, but I am not sure I was a good father. I was around a lot, but I treated my kids like adults too soon. Kate recently said we were too relaxed as parents. I think I should have set more rules. I still worry about my daughters, no matter how old they are. In that way, your children never really leave you.
**E. The TV Presenter**  
I was ready for kids when I turned 30. I had met my wife, and we had a nice home, so we thought, ""Why not have a child instead of just buying new things?"" Having my daughter, Betty, has helped me understand who I am. It feels special to have a child, but it also makes you just one of many parents. Sometimes I feel frustrated, but just one smile from her makes everything better. A baby's smile is the best way to feel happy."

CAE_46,C1,"**Science Flying in the Face of Gravity**
Journalist Tom Mumford joins students who are testing their ideas in weightlessness. The aircraft looked normal from the outside. The pilot told the 13 students from Europe and America that it was built in 1964 and was a Boeing KC-135 refuelling tanker, based on the Boeing 707. But inside, it was very different. The inside was a long white tunnel with few windows and bright lights along the padded walls. Most of the seats were removed, except for a few at the back where the nervous students sat.
For a year, these students had competed to join this flight, which was a challenge from the European Space Agency. They had to come up with creative experiments to do in weightlessness. The students with the best ideas won a spot on this special flight, which was like the most exciting roller-coaster ride.
For the next two hours, the flight would feel like a big bird flying up and down. The pilot would cut the engines at 3,000 meters, and the plane would go higher for a moment before falling back to Earth. During the few seconds of weightlessness, the students would feel like they were closer to the moon than to the ground.
The plane took off smoothly, but that changed quickly when the pilot made the plane climb steeply for about 20 seconds. The engines roared, and we felt heavy as blood rushed from our heads. Then, the engines stopped, and we suddenly felt weightless. For 20 seconds, we floated in silence, like we were on a trampoline. Moving around was confusing because up and down didn’t mean anything anymore.
After ten seconds of falling, the pilot pulled the plane out of its dive. Gravity returned, but not as quickly as it had left, and some students landed hard. After the first curve, some students felt sick thinking about the 29 more to come. The flight included thirty curves, giving the students ten minutes of weightlessness for their experiments.
The Dutch students studied their robotic cat, Leonardo, to see how cats always land on their feet. They released a device to help with this, and one student managed to turn it over using a remote control. However, another student accidentally landed on it during a curve, almost breaking it.
A German team from the University of Aachen studied how metal joints are affected by weightlessness, which could help build future space stations. Another group from Utah State University worked on creating solar sails from thin liquid films that harden in sunlight. They believe that if they succeed, satellites could use solar sails like yachts use wind.
After two hours of flying between heaven and Earth, the students felt excited rather than sick. One student said, ""It was an unforgettable experience. I wanted to be an astronaut before, but now I want it even more."""
CAE_3,C1,"**With the Trees, I Planted My Stake in New Zealand**
**JONATHON PORRITT TALKS TO DANNY DANZIGER**
Jonathon Porritt is the author of *Seeing Green - The Politics of Ecology*.
I had a strange time in my life when I didn’t have any summers. I went to New Zealand every summer, which is actually winter there. So, I had nine winters in a row, which was great because I like winter. My parents had the idea to buy a small piece of land for my brother, sister, and me to take care of. My mother said, “If you plant trees on it, you can have it.” The idea was that we would always have a connection to New Zealand, which is nice because my father grew up there. They found a piece of land about 20 miles north of Auckland in a place called Rangitoupuni. The land is not very good, but it is good for planting trees.
I have always been interested in land. I spent a year in Australia working on sheep farms and doing different farming jobs, so the idea of planting trees excited me. I think my family became more enthusiastic as we went along. I started planting in 1968, and by the end of 1972, we had planted the whole 70 acres together.
In New Zealand in 1968, it rained a lot during that winter. It is funny to think of it as a happy time because it rained almost every day we were planting. I don’t think I have ever been so wet and cold for such a long time. Every morning was a challenge: getting ready for the next planting session. I would come out of the Land Rover warm and dry, but the rain would be pouring down. My jacket was still damp from the day before, my boots were soaked, and my hands struggled with slippery laces. 
In that first year, I had a helper who was an experienced tree-planter, which was very helpful because I had never planted trees seriously before. You wear a planting bag around your neck and fill it with as many trees as you can. When the bag is full, it is heavy, but it gets easier as it gets lighter. The hardest part was getting the lines straight. You decide how far apart to plant the trees, then you line up three poles to guide you. Once you are in line, you just plant all the way down the line, turn around, and come back.
I enjoy hard physical work, and it helped me get fit. After a while, you can plant trees almost automatically. You get used to a rhythm and use the least number of spade strokes to dig the hole. This rhythm is important in many farming jobs. You train your body to do the same moves, and then it becomes easy: you take the tree out of the bag, dig a hole, put it in the ground, stamp it down, and move on. 
Mentally, it is interesting. My mind starts to think about many things, including nature and our place in it. A lot of my thoughts about these topics began during that time. I have been back to New Zealand four times since then and watched the trees grow, which is very satisfying because I planted them. I feel a connection to what happens to them. I always worry when I read news about strong winds or droughts in New Zealand. Such news makes me anxious. However, everything worked out well, and those trees are now 20 years old and healthy.
I should add that I took a break from teaching and went back in 1984 for three months by myself. I wrote my first book there, *Seeing Green*. There is a simple cabin on the tree farm with just a bed, a table, and a chair. In the mornings, I would write; in the afternoons, I would prune the trees, and in the evenings, I would do research. My connection to that area is still very strong. It is the place I feel most connected to in terms of the bond between people and the earth."
CAE_10,C1,"**Bringing Up Badgers**
""What now?"" was my first thought when one of my helpers brought me a cardboard box. My husband Derek and I have an open farm in Somerset where we care for orphaned animals. But the noise from the box was strange, so I looked inside and saw three small grey badger cubs, each about eight inches long. Their soft coats were like velvet, and their milky eyes looked up at me from their tiny black-and-white striped heads. I had never seen badger cubs before. Most badgers are born between mid-January and mid-March and live underground. If they lose their mother, they often die from hunger. These three cubs were found by builders who accidentally disturbed their home while working. Their mother was dead, but the cubs were alive, though cold and whimpering. 
After removing fleas from them, I took them into the kitchen to keep them warm. There were two females named Primrose and Bluebell, and a male named Willow. At first, I fed them with a syringe, but I had to wipe them with a warm cloth to make them feel like their mother was licking them. This helped them go to the bathroom. For the first few days, I fed them every four hours. Within a week, they learned to drink from a bottle and started to move around, although a bit unsteady. They were happy with each other and a heated pad that acted like their mother.
Three weeks later, I noticed Willow seemed tired, but he was still eating. I should have acted quickly, but I didn’t realize it was serious. The next morning, I found him dead. The vet said he died from a lung infection caused by drinking too fast. I felt sad about losing him but continued to care for the other two. Then, a local farmer came to me with another male cub he had found alone. He knew the mother would not return, so I took in Willow II. He was younger than the females and very hard to feed. It took a long time to get him to drink from the bottle.
By the end of April, the females were eating creamed rice and other foods. Willow II was finally ready to eat solid food, but he made a mess while trying to eat. I gave him a sausage, and after a week, he was ready for more food. At almost five months old, they were all eating cereals, meat, vegetables, fruit, nuts, cheese, and eggs. Badgers usually eat a lot of earthworms, but my badgers were doing well, especially since it was a hot summer and finding food was hard.
By August, the badgers started to be active at night. We often walked through the orchard, and they would play and chase each other. I learned to avoid their playful bites, but Derek sometimes got caught and ended up with bruises. During these walks, I saw other badgers in our field. They were looking for food because their own areas were disturbed. We were warned that they might come into our badger pen and harm the cubs, so we made the gate secure.
The local press took pictures of me walking the badgers, and many people wanted to help build a home for them on our farm. With advice from others, we designed a new home for the badgers. Our son Daniel made the plans, and we built a sett with tunnels and a special gate. It had three rooms, one bigger than the others, with a glass side so people could see inside. As we built it, the badgers explored the new home before going on their walks. They soon forgot about the walks and enjoyed playing in the tunnels.
The building cost more than we expected, but a local bus company helped pay for it, and other businesses donated materials. Everyone wanted the badgers to have a home. One evening, they finally moved in. After watching them for a while, we left them to settle down. When I checked later, I saw three badgers curled up and sleeping.
Now, I don’t walk with them as often because they stay awake until midnight. We see Primrose only sometimes because she has joined another sett, but Bluebell and Willow II still come to say hello before running off into the night. This is their home now, and they have made it their own."
CAE_67,C1,"**In Search of True North - The Man Behind Halley's Comet**
Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, wants to follow the journey of Sir Edmund Halley, who studied compass variations. Anjana Ahuja reports.
Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is famous for the comet named after him. However, many people at that time thought his most important work was to study the ""variations of the compass."" These variations, now called ""declination,"" show the angle between magnetic north and true north. Sailors needed this information to correct their compasses and navigate the oceans accurately.
Halley was one of only two people in England paid to do scientific research. He set out for the Cape Verde Islands to study declination in the North and South Atlantic. However, he had to return early because of problems with his crew. Later, he made another trip that took him to Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, Newfoundland, and back to England. From this journey, Halley published a map in 1701 showing compass variations in the Western and Southern Oceans. This map helped sailors for over a hundred years until changes in the Earth's magnetic field made it less accurate.
Dr. Clark wants to celebrate the 300th anniversary of Halley's trip by retracing his route. He needs to raise £70,000 before he can start, and Sir Vivian Fuchs, who led the first expedition across Antarctica, is helping him.
Dr. Clark became interested in Halley while working at Halley Station in Antarctica, where he read about Halley's life. He says, ""Halley led a remarkable life. He was a respected scientist and led many expeditions. He was not just an astronomer; he also studied geophysics."" During his time as Astronomer Royal, Halley mapped the stars and invented a diving bell. He also helped Sir Isaac Newton with his famous book, *Principia Mathematica*.
Dr. Clark believes that recreating Halley's voyage will give him the recognition he deserves. His expedition, called ""In the Wake of the Paramore,"" will also have scientific value. Dr. Clark plans to take measurements like Halley did, but with better tools. These measurements are important because the Earth's magnetic field is always changing. The data collected will help improve the current model of the Earth's magnetic field.
Dr. Clark explains, ""We usually measure the size of the magnetic field, but not its direction. To measure direction, we need to know true north."" On this expedition, they will use satellites to find true north. The British Geological Survey and the United States Navy will provide instruments for the trip. A Danish satellite will also be taking similar measurements, and Dr. Clark hopes his work will fill in any gaps in the data over the Atlantic Ocean.
Halley's journey was significant because it was the first scientific expedition at sea, and he was the first civilian to be appointed as a naval captain for this purpose. 
Does Dr. Clark have what it takes to succeed in his journey? He has spent two years in Antarctica and worked in the geomagnetic group at the British Geological Survey. He has also sailed the 13,000 kilometers from Rio de Janeiro to England. He plans to complete the expedition in four stages with different crews.
Does he share Halley's passion? He says, ""I am ready to give up eight months of my life for this, so some might think I'm obsessed. But I wouldn’t want to sail across the Atlantic again without a good reason. Halley and his amazing life have given me a real sense of purpose."""
CAE_27,C1,"**POWER DRESSING**
Every summer, the peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show off their beautiful feathers to the hens. This behavior has puzzled scientists like Charles Darwin. He wondered how birds could develop such extravagant features in a world where survival is tough. 
Darwin believed that animals change over time through evolution, not by special creation. He thought that the strongest and best-adapted animals survive and have babies. However, he found it hard to explain why peacocks have such large tails, which can be a disadvantage. He introduced the idea of ""sexual selection,"" suggesting that females choose males based on their beauty.
Darwin's friend, Alfred Russel Wallace, had a different view. He believed that if peahens liked the most colorful peacocks, it meant those peacocks had some hidden quality that helped them survive. 
Now, 100 years later, scientists are still studying this question. At Whipsnade, there are 200 peacocks that live like wild birds but are used to people. Researchers, led by Marion Petrie, are trying to answer two main questions: Do peahens really prefer the peacocks with the most beautiful tails? And do these peacocks have other advantages, or is it just about looks?
The researchers have observed that peahens seem to prefer males with more eye spots on their tails. These peacocks attract more mates. However, it is still unclear if these attractive males are better in other ways. 
William Hamilton from Oxford University suggested that showy male birds might be healthier and have fewer parasites. This idea has been supported in other bird species, but the researchers at Whipsnade have not yet been able to check the health of their peacocks.
This year, Dr. Petrie is studying the babies of attractive and unattractive peacocks to see if the attractive ones grow faster and are healthier. If they are, it would support Wallace's idea that females choose males for practical reasons.
There is also an interesting theory from mathematician R A Fisher. He suggested that if a female chooses a male with a slightly better tail, her sons will inherit that tail, and her daughters will prefer long tails. Over time, this could lead to peacocks having very long tails. This idea also supports Darwin's view that females might choose beauty for its own sake."
CAE_66,C1,"**THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS**
Tom Cunliffe believes that the best boat design should mix old and new ideas. He showed this with his own boat, 'The Westerman'. This week, the Summer Boat Show in London is full of beautiful yachts with new technology. Most of these boats come from a big change in boat design that happened 25 years ago. In contrast, my boat is quietly resting in a tidal creek on the south coast. It was designed last year, but it looks like it is 100 years old. You might think its owner is a romantic person. Maybe I am, but I’m not sure.
My boat uses the best parts of old boat design, but modern technology has made it easier to build. However, even though technology is important in boat design, it often keeps sailors away from the real challenges of life at sea. These challenges are often what sailors want to experience when they go to sea. I don’t think sailors should go back to suffering through every difficulty. I believe it is important for my boats to have a coal stove for warmth and comfortable places to sleep. But why go sailing if everything is done for you? Dealing with sails that flap in the wind is part of being a sailor.
Also, why should we change the steering position from a safe place at the back of the boat to a less safe spot in the middle? This change makes the inside of the boat feel like a big house, with a bed bigger than the one at home. For me, a boat should be a boat, not a house on the water.
When I bought my first boat, Hirta, to sail around Britain for a TV race, the previous owner said it had all the comforts but no luxury. I learned how true this was during my time with Hirta. She had heavy sails, no running water, little electricity, no fridge, no central heating, and no electronics for navigation. Still, she was the easiest boat I ever sailed.
However, classic boats like Hirta need a lot of care. When I hurt my back, I knew I had to stop sailing her. I looked for a younger boat but couldn’t find one, so I decided to build a new boat from scratch. The Westerman has never let me down. Although the designer, Nigel Irens, and his assistant, Ed Burnett, use computer programs, Irens first drew the boat on a paper napkin and then moved to the computer. After creating a model, we worked together to improve the design. The final version was perfect.
The Westerman has crossed the North Atlantic and won four out of her first six races. She looks timeless, moves beautifully in the sea, and has a peaceful atmosphere inside, made from reclaimed pitch pine. This is because she was designed only as a sailing boat, without thinking about furniture. This traditional method works well. The Westerman shows that you don’t need to follow trends to be happy, and sometimes it’s good to learn from the past. Made from wood treated with special glue, she is completely waterproof. So, she has the advantages of a fiberglass boat but still looks, feels, and sails like a real boat."
CAE_44,C1,"**RETREAT, RELAX, RECHARGE**
Health farms and country house hotels with spa services are becoming very popular. We asked five journalists to visit some of these places.
**A. HENLOW GRANGE**  
I was happy to spend six days at Henlow Grange because I was tired and needed to relax. My room in the big 18th-century house was very comfortable, and I felt calm right away. On the first day, I did nothing and slept a lot. From the second day, I started taking classes like yoga and body conditioning. The instructors were very skilled. I felt more flexible as the week went on. They offer many treatments, including aromatherapy, seaweed baths, manicures, and pedicures. The facial treatment, which lasts an hour, made me feel like a new person. The staff were friendly and professional. The atmosphere was full of energy. Henlow is planning to improve the facilities this year, including a new swimming pool. You can also ride bicycles around the grounds. If you want to relax, you can read a magazine or take a quiet walk in the garden. During my stay, I felt happier and had a better appetite. I left feeling great and full of energy. I would love to visit again. This is a perfect place for busy women. Save Room 5 for me!  
*Marcella D'Argy Smith*
**B. SHRUBLAND HALL**  
The peaceful atmosphere of this stately home was clear as soon as I entered. The Hall has a beautifully decorated library and a lovely conservatory, with plenty of space to relax alone. When you arrive, everyone gets a medical check-up, including weight and blood pressure. They called us patients, which felt strange since I am healthy. However, I was impressed that they quickly addressed a shoulder problem I had. Each person gets a special diet to follow. I lost weight without starving, but I was still hungry and got a headache on the second day. My daily menu included grapefruit and honey for breakfast, salads for lunch, and fruit, yogurt, and hot broth for dinner. If you are not on a diet, you can eat in the main dining hall, where the food is tasty. You can enjoy a massage or water therapy every other day. Extra treatments are available at reasonable prices.  
*Liz Gregory*
**C. CAREYS MANOR**  
Careys is not a health farm, but a lovely old manor with cozy log fires and a big lounge. If you are counting calories, you might want to skip the gourmet food, which is rich and delicious. Luckily, the hotel has a gym and a soft-water pool to help you stay active. There is also a spa bath, steam room, sauna, and treatment rooms. A popular service is the sports injury clinic. I got advice for an old shoulder injury. The physiotherapist suggested good posture and exercises. Careys is comfortable and luxurious, but also relaxed. If you want to explore, there is beautiful countryside around.  
*Beverly D'Silva*
**D. CLIVEDEN**  
Cliveden is a grand country home and a five-star hotel that treats guests like royalty. It offers health and beauty treatments, a gym, saunas, a swimming pool, tennis, horse riding, and more. There are beautiful walks and gardens in the 376-acre estate. The restaurant, Waldo's, has amazing food. It took me a long time to read the dinner menu because there were so many choices. The meal was fantastic, especially the sticky-toffee pudding with banana ice cream. I went to bed very happy! The next morning, I spent some time in the gym to burn off some calories. I enjoyed a facial and an aromatherapy massage. Cliveden has everything you need for fitness and beauty before you treat yourself at Waldo's.  
*Kay Letch*
**E. SPRINGS HYDRO**  
The best and worst thing about Springs Hydro is the carrot cake. It is the most delicious cake I have ever had, but it has a lot of calories, which is not good if you want to lose weight. You have been warned! The second best thing is the wonderful aromatherapy massage. I chose relaxing oils and fell asleep during the massage. I had the best sleep in years. The place is modern and well-organized, with great facilities and comfortable rooms. There are many therapists and beauty rooms, so it is easy to book treatments. They offer a variety of services, from manicures to deep-cleansing facials. The guests are a mix of people, including football teams, mothers and daughters, friends, and singles. I would love to take a break here every month.

CAE_22,C1,"**NATURAL TALENTS**
In the seven million years since humans separated from chimpanzees, we have not changed much. Genetically, we are still over 98% similar to chimps. This means that the differences between humans and animals are very recent. Our ability to create art and other things we think are unique to humans comes from just a small part of our genes. 
Recent studies show that many traits once thought to be only human are also found in animals. For example, both humans and wild chimpanzees use tools. Chimpanzees use sticks to eat and as weapons, while sea otters use rocks to open clams. Monkeys also have a simple form of language, with different sounds for warnings like 'leopard', 'eagle', and 'snake'. This means that there are not many clear differences between humans and animals, except for art.
If human art comes from a special genetic ability, it is strange that our ancestors did not create art for almost seven million years after separating from chimps. The first forms of art might have been wood carvings or body painting, but these materials do not last over time. The first clear evidence of human art appears around 35,000 years ago with cave paintings, statues, necklaces, and musical instruments.
If we believe that our recent creativity makes us different, we need to think about how our art is different from animal art. Three main differences are often mentioned: human art is not useful, it is made for beauty, and it is learned rather than instinctive.
First, as Oscar Wilde said, ""All art is quite useless."" This means that human art does not help us survive or pass on our genes, unlike many animal behaviors. While some human art communicates ideas, this is not the same as passing on genes. For example, birds sing to defend their territory or attract a mate, which helps them pass on their genes. By this idea, human art does seem different.
The second claim is that human art is motivated by the desire for beauty. We cannot ask birds if they enjoy their songs, but they mainly sing during mating season, so they might not sing just for beauty. Again, this makes human art seem unique.
The third claim is that human art is learned, not instinctive. Each human group has its own art styles that are learned. For example, songs in Tokyo are different from those in Paris. People can learn each other's songs. In contrast, some birds are born knowing how to sing their species' song, even if they have never heard it before.
Human art changes quickly. For example, people can easily tell that a painting from the 20th century is different from the famous Mona Lisa. Art experts can often identify when and who painted a work. However, two chimpanzees named Congo and Betsy created paintings that some experts might mistake for human art. Congo made up to 33 paintings in one day and was upset when his pencil was taken away. Their paintings were shown in a gallery in London in 1957, and many sold, which is something many human artists cannot achieve.
These chimpanzee paintings blur the lines between human art and animal behavior. Like human art, the ape paintings were not created for practical reasons; they were made for the satisfaction of the painter. Some might argue that human art is different because it is meant to communicate, while the apes did not care about sharing their art. However, even some famous human art was created for personal satisfaction, not to communicate with others."
CAE_39,C1,"**An Awfully Big Adventure**
The Taklamakan Desert in western China is one of the last unexplored places on Earth. It is also very dangerous. Charles Blackmore crossed this desert and lived to tell his story. There are not many big adventures left and not many heroes. In the past, children's stories were about brave explorers with sunburnt skin and narrow eyes, looking into the unknown. Today, we do not see such people in stories or in real life. But then I met Charles Blackmore.
Blackmore's big adventure was leading a group across the Taklamakan Desert. Its name means ""once entered, you never come out,"" but local people call it the Desert of Death. He remembered the dangers and excitement of that amazing journey while sitting calmly at home with his family. 
The team he led had four British people (one was a doctor), an American photographer, four Chinese experts, 30 camels, and six camel handlers. It turned out that the camel handlers had never worked with camels before; they were long-distance truck drivers. This misunderstanding could have been very dangerous and could have ruined the expedition.
This mixed group set out to cross 1,200 kilometers of the world's toughest desert, and Charles Blackmore wrote a fascinating account of their journey. At that time, he was about to leave the Army after 14 happy years. He started the expedition for fun, to fill a gap in his life, and to learn more about himself. ""I always thought I would spend my whole life in the Army. I was offered a promotion, but I suddenly wanted to see who I really was outside of that. It was a big risk. My wife, Tina, was very worried that I wouldn’t come back because nobody had ever done that route before; we went into it without knowing what would happen. In the end, it took 59 days to cross from west to east, and the desert was very good to us.""
Anyone reading his amazing story will be surprised by the word ""good."" The team faced many hardships: sickness, extreme temperatures, severe thirst, and losing part of their water supply. ""But,"" Blackmore explains, ""when we were at our limits and the camels had gone without water for seven days, we found some. We did not face the famous sandstorms of the Taklamakan. And we did not experience the freezing cold that could have stopped us completely. However, we were always fighting against challenges. The fine sand got into everything, especially our blisters and wounds. The high dunes were hard to climb for us and for the heavy camels, which often fell over onto us.""
""What pushed me on more than anything was the need to survive. We had no backup plan. Our budget and time did not allow for one. No aircraft ever flew over us. Once we got into the sandhills, we were completely alone. I knew I had the mental strength for the trip, but I was very scared about my physical ability. I remember the first day — we sat at the edge of the desert, and it was so hot that it was hard to breathe. I thought, 'We have to do it now!' At that moment, I was very scared.""
If it was hard at the beginning, how did they feel at the end? ""After walking for 1,000 kilometers, you are not going to give up. You have gone through so much; you have so much behind you. We were very thin but also very strong despite being tired. My body was fit, and my legs were strong. I could walk over anything.""
In the middle of the book, Blackmore describes lying in the desert, looking up at a full moon and thinking about his family. How did he feel about what they went through? ""Inside me, there is someone trying to find peace. When I have doubts about myself now, I think back to the image of the desert and remember that we managed to do that together. I feel prouder of that expedition than of anything else I have done. But when I think about my life, I think of my family and the happiness we share. Compared to that, the desert does not measure up.""
Has Charles Blackmore found peace? ""I long for the challenge and the open spaces. We felt a strong sense of purpose. Now, I find it hard to be part of the sameness of modern life."""
CAE_18,C1,"Life Without Gadgets**
Susan Harr decides to unplug her gadgets and enjoy doing things by hand. Many people love technology because it gives us useful devices that make life easier. However, Susan feels that we have become too dependent on technology. She believes that using gadgets can sometimes cause more problems than they solve.
Recently, her word processor broke, and she had to pay a lot of money to fix it. This made her think about how much we rely on technology. She started to let go of some household gadgets as they broke down. She wonders if the time we save with technology is really worth it. Does it just mean we have more things to buy?
When her broken gadget made strange noises, she decided to leave it outside. Now, she enjoys sewing by hand instead of using a machine. She feels free and can take her sewing with her wherever she goes. While she appreciates some gadgets, like her washing machine, she has found joy in doing things without them.
For example, she returned her rented color TV and went back to a small black-and-white one. This change helped her family spend more time walking the dog, reading, and talking to each other. She also stopped using her sewing machine and now sews by hand, which she finds relaxing.
Sewing by hand allows her to listen to the radio or talk with family while she works. She enjoys the cozy feeling of sitting by the fire with a cup of tea. At first, she thought sewing by hand would be boring and tiring, but she now finds it satisfying and calming. 
Susan realizes that she can take her time and enjoy her activities without rushing. She also finds pleasure in simple tasks like washing dishes. Now, she looks around her home and wonders if she really needs all her gadgets, like the freezer or microwave. She thinks that living without some of these devices could save her a lot of money."
CAE_62,C1,"The Cabinet-Maker Charles Hurst**
Charles Hurst is a cabinet-maker who makes beautiful furniture. Joanna Watt meets him in his workshop, which is under a railway arch in East London. When I arrive, he greets me quickly with a handshake and says, ""Well, fire away then!"" It is not clear if he is always in a hurry or if he is shy. 
His workshop is busy, filled with unfinished furniture and pieces of wood in many colors. Hurst has been making furniture for ten years and has a great reputation. He always has many orders, even though he does not advertise himself. People know that if they want a good cupboard, table, or bookcase, Hurst is the right person to contact.
Finding a furniture-maker is not hard, but finding one who makes high-quality furniture is more difficult. Hurst says, ""There are few real cabinet-makers now. Many people just call themselves furniture-makers."" He is often disappointed by the quality of modern furniture. He does not like mass-produced furniture and believes that many people accept poor quality.
Hurst's desire for perfection is important for his success, along with his talent. He is confident in his skills and says, ""I have a huge natural ability. I have always been good at making things."" He learned his craft by asking questions and teaching himself. Most of his work comes from private clients, and some come back to him many times. He enjoys doing complete projects for their homes.
However, he admits that not all client relationships are easy. He finds it frustrating when clients do not know what they want. He prefers clients who are clear about their needs. Hurst is proud of his work but also respects other craftsmen. He says, ""There are people far better than me."" He did not study at a famous furniture design school, but he is critical of those who take too long to make one piece of furniture. 
He also does not like when students try to make their work look fashionable. He believes furniture should be practical and useful. Hurst is confident but not pretentious. As I leave, he reminds me, ""After all, I am only making furniture."""
CAE_49,C1,"**Three Theories About Sleep**
People spend about one-third of their lives sleeping. This shows that sleep is very important. However, scientists do not fully agree on why we need to sleep. There are three main theories.
The first and most popular theory says that sleep is important for our body. It suggests that while we sleep, our body repairs itself and gets ready for the next day.
The second theory focuses on learning. It says that sleep helps us process the information we learn during the day. Without sleep, we would not be able to learn well.
The third theory talks about energy. It claims that we need to sleep to recharge our energy, so we can feel ready and active for the next day."
CAE_31,C1,"**ECCENTRICS**
An eccentric is someone whose behavior is different from what is normal in society. This raises the question, ""What is normal?"" Most people have their own strange habits or interests. For example, someone might love entering newspaper competitions, collecting beer mats, or writing letters to the press about many topics. Eccentricity shows our individuality.
Inside us, there is often a struggle between two forces: individualism and conformity. Individualism is the desire to be unique, while conformity is the desire to fit in with others. Most people want to be accepted and loved, which makes them follow the crowd instead of standing out.
People with unusual hobbies or strong opinions often come together. They form clubs and hold meetings to share their interests, which others might see as strange. Being part of a group can be comforting. Many of us feel a conflict between wanting to be ourselves and wanting to fit in. For example, someone might say, ""I say what I think,"" to show they are different, or ""You must take me as you find me,"" to show they do not care about social rules.
Anyone can choose to be more individualistic at any time. Many successful people have done this. Bob Dylan, an American singer, said, ""When you feel strongly about what you are doing, pursue it without giving up. This may confuse others."" However, being different on purpose, like a pop singer wearing strange clothes for attention, is not true eccentricity. 
True eccentrics do not try to be odd; they just are. They do not care much about what others think. They act based on who they are. This makes eccentrics different from enthusiasts, practical jokers, or attention-seekers, who are aware of society and often react to it. Eccentrics, on the other hand, live their lives happily without worrying about others."
CAE_58,C1,"**Natural Books**
We asked four well-known naturalists to share the wildlife book that has influenced them the most.
**A. Geoffrey Lean**  
It was easy for me to choose the author. As an environmental journalist, I have met many important people in this field. One of the most important is Barbara Ward, a small and fragile woman. She was very influential in environmental issues in Europe after the war. She combined her experiences from different environmental movements into her own strong ideas. When I was a young journalist, she helped me understand these issues better. Choosing her book was harder. I could have picked ""Only One Earth"" or ""Progress for a Small Planet."" But I believe Barbara's most important book is ""The Home of Man."" It talks about the rapid growth of cities and important themes she cared about. It is a powerful call for what we now call ""sustainable human development."" I have read many books since, but none are as good as this one.
**B. Linda Bennett**  
When I read ""Signals for Survival"" by Niko Tinbergen, I can hear the calls of herring gulls and remember the smell of their droppings in the sun. This book wonderfully explains the interesting world of animal communication with words and pictures. After reading it, if you watch a gull colony, you will see how their chaotic activity is actually a well-organized social structure. You can identify which birds are partners and recognize families later in the season. Niko Tinbergen was a great behaviorist who wanted to share his findings with everyone. His work with talented wildlife artist Eric Ennion made this book special and interesting for anyone who loves wildlife. Ennion's paintings show how one gull can be aggressive while another is calm, showing the skill of a true naturalist.
**C. Lee Durrell**  
The book that has influenced me the most is ""My Family and Other Animals"" by Gerald Durrell. This book not only led me to a wonderful husband but also to a great career in conservation. It made me love the natural world. I was doing research on animal sounds in Madagascar when I first read it. After two years of challenges, reading this book made me feel hopeful again. It beautifully connects animals, people, joy, and beauty, showing a world worth saving. Some people think humans are bad because of the harm we do to other species. But I remember Gerald as a boy in the book, seeing all living things as a family, showing that we are all connected. This is an important idea for everyone to understand.
**D. Bruce Pearson**  
I found ""The Shell Bird Book"" by James Fisher in my school library soon after it was published in 1966. I was immediately attracted to it, especially the 48 colorful bird paintings by Eric Ennion. These images caught my attention. I already had other bird books and had spent holidays learning to identify birds. They inspired me to start sketching what I saw. But ""The Shell Bird Book"" offered much more. It had beautiful paintings, chapters on bird migration, the history of birds in Britain, and even a chapter on birds in music, literature, and art. This book helped me appreciate birds and nature in a broader way. It showed me that my emotional and creative feelings about nature are just as important as scientific ones. Since art was my stronger subject, I began to see new opportunities for myself."
CAE_37,C1,"**Do Reviews Sell Books?**
We asked five important British publishers how book reviews affect a book's success. Here is what they said.
**Publisher A**  
Reviews are very important for publishers. They are the first thing we look at in newspapers. A study showed that many people said they bought a book because of reviews, more than any other reason like ads or recommendations from friends. Authors feel differently about reviews. Both authors and publishers are upset when there are no reviews, but publishers often think that even bad reviews can help sales. They believe that both good and bad reviews can make readers want to try the book for themselves. Publishers enjoy reviews that match their own feelings about a book since they are often the first to read it.
**Publisher B**  
Publishers and newspapers both care about book reviews, but they have different needs. Newspapers want to entertain their readers, while publishers want their books to be reviewed, especially in a good way. Book reviews today are better and more varied than they were 40 years ago. However, many paperback books still do not get enough attention. Publishers should not complain too much because they, like readers and writers, need reviews. A good review from a trusted source can really help sell a book, especially if there are several good reviews.
**Publisher C**  
Reviews are very important for publishing. Without them, we would struggle to promote our books. Most of the books we publish are not by famous authors, so we rely on reviews from literary editors. Good reviews are often more valuable than ads because readers trust them. Publishers say they care more about the size of the review than its content. Good reviews can help a book and an author become successful, but they need support from other things like recommendations from readers and good marketing.
**Publisher D**  
I wish I understood the relationship between publishing and reviewing in Britain! In the United States, a single review can make or break a book. Here, bookshops often do not pay much attention to reviews. Sometimes it takes many years of good reviews for people to notice a good writer. However, some poorly reviewed books still sell very well. It is unpredictable. Non-fiction books allow reviewers to share their knowledge about the topic instead of just focusing on the book.
**Publisher E**  
All publishers and writers hope for great reviews. But do they really help sell books? I once published a biography that received excellent reviews, but it did not sell well because people felt they could just read the reviews instead of buying the book. Does the name of the reviewer matter? Thirty years ago, if certain reviewers liked a book, people would pay attention. Now, sometimes it is the unexpected reviewer or a unique review that encourages people to buy the book."
CAE_2,C1,"**WEATHERVANE MAKER**
Making weathervanes is an old skill that started in ancient Egypt. Today, Graham Smith continues this craft in his workshop. He is one of the few people in the country who makes weathervanes by hand. Graham creates unique designs based on what his customers want. He says, ""This way, I can make a special item just for them."" Many of his customers are women looking for gifts for their husbands. They want something special that shows the man's job or hobbies.
Graham's work is different from the usual cockerel design that most weathervanes have. The first weathervane he made was a witch on a broomstick for his wife. His friends liked it and asked him to make weathervanes for them too. He realized there were many different ideas he could use for designs. 
Graham decided to focus on making weathervanes. Before this, he trained as a precision engineer and worked in that field for 15 years. Then, he and his wife, Liz, changed their roles. She went to work as an architectural assistant, and he stayed home to take care of their children and grow his business. This was five years ago, and he is happy with his choice. He says, ""My old job was not creative, but this work is exciting and artistic. I really enjoy designing.""
Graham has created over 100 original designs. He pays close attention to detail and always gets the customer's approval on the design before he starts cutting it by hand. He also keeps some traditional designs available because they are still popular. Graham believes that people like handmade items because they are different.
He does not plan to grow his business because he wants to keep it as a rural craft. He says, ""I have found my place in the market. People love unique items, and I feel satisfied when I see a simple shape turn into something beautiful."" For many years, weathervanes have helped people understand the weather by showing changes in wind direction. Now, more people are moving to the countryside and want to add special touches to their homes. This has helped crafts like his.
Graham is now busier than ever, sending weathervanes to customers all over the world, especially in America and Denmark. He explains that the price depends on how detailed the design is. His latest request was for a weathervane shaped like a curly-coated dog. No matter the occasion, Graham can create a special gift."
CAE_68,C1,"**Beginner Takes All**
Before it was published, *The Horse Whisperer* was already a very popular book. It is the first novel by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans, and it made him a lot of money. Here, he talks about his inspiration and success.
At the beginning of the year, Nicholas Evans was having a tough time. A film project he had worked on for months fell apart suddenly. He was worried because it had been two years since he earned any money, and he was in debt to the bank. A smart person in his situation would have found a job, maybe returning to television. But instead, he made a surprising choice. He bought a ticket to America to spend three months researching for his first novel.
Even though he acted on impulse, he had an idea for the story for a while. He got the idea from a farrier he met while visiting a friend. The farrier told him about a calm horse that suddenly became aggressive. The owners were desperate until they heard about a gypsy who could calm the horse just by talking to it. These people were called ""horse whisperers."" This story inspired Evans.
He started to research horse whisperers, thinking about writing a screenplay since he was a filmmaker. But after his film project failed, he decided to write a book instead. During the spring, he traveled across the US, visiting ranches and learning about horses and the people who work with them. He later said, ""It was a funny time. I was observing people, but I felt alone and worried about my life. I had tried for ten years to succeed as a filmmaker, and now I was in debt and unsure how to support my family.""
By the end of August, he returned home and had written the first half of the book. He was still worried about money and needed to know if he should continue. He showed the book to a friend who was a literary agent. The friend said it was ""fine"" and thought Evans could get $30,000 as an advance for the book. Evans needed more money to pay off his debts, and he had spent seven months on *The Horse Whisperer*, with more work to do.
In October, he sent the first two hundred pages of the novel and a 12-page summary to seven UK publishers just before the Frankfurt Book Fair. Soon, his agent called to say he had turned down the first offer of $75,000. Evans was shocked and asked, ""You what?"" His agent replied, ""It's OK, I just sense something is happening.""
What happened next was amazing. Within a week, the novel was sold to Transworld Publications in the UK for £550,000 and to Delacorte in the US for $3.15 million, both record amounts for a first novel. Evans and his team were in disbelief. They had not even sent the manuscript to New York, and they did not know how it got there. Major film studios also wanted the book. Evans's UK agent worked with an agent in the US, and when they said they could get $3 million for the film rights, they laughed in surprise.
That October, four famous filmmakers called Evans one after the other, asking to pay $3 million for his unfinished novel. Evans shared this story while we drank coffee on his porch, overlooking his garden. He said he turned down an offer to write the screenplay for *The Horse Whisperer*. ""It's all been like a fairy tale,"" he said. ""I don't want to spoil it. Writing at that level is very hard, and I don't want to become just an employee. I want to stay involved but at a distance.""
His novel's success also brought new support for his film project, *Life and Limb*, but he was not sure if he wanted to make it anymore. ""I think it would be foolish not to write another novel,"" he said."
CAE_23,C1,"**Young Masters**
Bobby Fischer is trying to return to chess, but age is not on his side. Chess is now more of a young man's game. After being away from chess for 20 years, Fischer is back and playing against his old rival, Boris Spassky. Fischer won the first game, which was impressive, but he is not the same player he was in 1972. He is now 49 years old, out of practice, and not in great shape. Spassky is even older.
Chess has changed a lot in the last 20 years. Fischer helped make chess popular, and now there is a professional chess circuit. Today, the main goal for players is to win. In international chess, a player’s nerves and stamina are just as important as their intelligence. The pressure in chess has always been high. Players use a chess clock to make sure they finish their moves in time. If they don’t, they lose the game. Now, games can last longer, and many are played without breaks. This has made it harder for older players.
In the last 30 years, every new world champion has been younger than the last. Of the ten best players in the world, eight are under 30. The way chess is played has also changed. Many players prepare before matches, especially because computers can store many chess games and help players study their opponents. In recent matches, players have had teams of helpers working to find weaknesses in their opponent's game. The beginning of a chess game is now studied very carefully, and being well-prepared can be the key to winning.
Today, there are more great chess players than ever before. Many grandmasters compete for small prizes around the world. Success in chess requires both mental and physical effort. A single game can last up to eight hours, and players must stay focused. If they lose concentration, they can lose the game. The chess clock adds to the stress, and the end of the game can be very intense, with players racing to make their moves in just a few seconds.
At the highest level of chess, losing is very painful. Winning feels great and helps players recover from the stress. But one win is not enough to win a tournament. Chess tournaments usually last 9 to 11 days, with games every day. World championship matches can be even tougher. For example, a match between Anatoli Karpov and Gary Kasparov in 1984 had to stop after several months because both players were exhausted.
Can Bobby Fischer overcome these challenges? He once said, ""All I want to do is play chess."" This makes his long absence from the game surprising. If he has come back for money, he will do well, as both he and Spassky will earn millions from their match. But if Fischer believes he can prove he is still the best player, the outcome could be very disappointing for him."
CAE_60,C1,"**Fame and Fortune**
Imogen Edwards-Jones talks to some new British talents, from poets to pop stars, who are becoming famous.
**A** Nick Grosso is in his early 30s and has written three successful plays. He is now turning his first play, *Peaches*, into a movie script. He says, ""It's a low budget, but we don't know how low. It won't be over £30 million, but it could be £30."" The interesting thing about Nick is that before writing *Peaches*, he had never been to a play or read one. He explains, ""When I wrote the play, I never thought it would be performed. It's set in a car, and now I know that was a difficult choice."" He left school at 16 but returned a year later. After finishing A-levels, he joined the Young People's Theatre. He realized he wanted to write for actors because he wanted his work to be heard. He says, ""I was finally around people who thought like me. It was the first time I enjoyed learning.""
**B** Simon Pegg, 28, has made great progress in his career since studying drama at Bristol University. He is now writing a TV comedy series and has just finished a tough tour with comedian Steve Coogan. Simon has always worked hard, even performing in comedy clubs while at university. He remembers, ""University was very theoretical. It made me realize I didn't want to be a serious actor; I was more interested in comedy. People think comedy is the hardest job, but it isn't. If you have courage and good material, it's great to make people laugh."" He has worked with the comedy group Funny Business, but his best partnership has been with Steve Coogan. Simon admits, ""He saw my show, and since I was a big fan of his, he probably noticed I was copying him.""
**C** Ciaran McMenamin, 24, became well-known when he starred in the series *The Young Person's Guide To Becoming A Rock Star*. The response was very positive, and now he can choose what projects he wants to do. He says, ""It's been a great opportunity for me. I can pick and choose, which is what I've always wanted."" This is impressive, especially since he just graduated. Ciaran started acting in school and then joined the Ulster Youth Theatre for four years. He jokes, ""I used acting to avoid doing homework. But then I decided I wanted to take it seriously because I had a talent and passion for it."" Now, he is waiting for more recognition, but he reflects on fame, saying, ""When you're 18, you think you'll love the photos and interviews, but you realize it's not why you act. It's about getting respect for good work.""
**D** Neil Taylor, 25, is the lead singer of the pop band Matrix, which has just signed a deal for three albums. Neil and his bandmate, Rick Brown, are expected to be very successful when their single, *Chimera*, is released soon. Neil says, ""The record company has a different idea of success than I do. They want a big hit, but for me, if two people buy it, I'll be happy."" Unlike many new pop stars, Neil has worked hard for his success. He left school at 16 and has been trying to enter the music industry since then. He shares, ""It's funny how things happen. I was doing student gigs for eight years and was about to give up when I met Rick, who had connections in the music business."" This meeting changed everything for him. He adds, ""There were times I felt very down, but I hope it will all be worth it.""
**E** Stephen Richards, 27, is a poet and author who has won many awards. He is well-known in the poetry world and has been giving readings for six years. His first novel, *Hidden*, will be published in March. He describes it as a story about obsessive love, which he felt was too strong for a poem. Stephen loved creative writing in school but lost interest in education later. He decided not to go to university but changed his mind after getting bored with a job at a theatre. After university, he published his first book, a children's story, in 1992. He says, ""My parents didn't expect me to be a writer; they thought I would just read."" With his poetry getting great reviews, moving to novels is a big step for him. He explains, ""Poetry has a structure, but novels can be any length, which means there are more chances to make mistakes. My goal is to avoid just writing a lot without caring about quality."""

Isabel is looking for Mr. Right and hopes that her knobbly knees won’t stop her. She stays hopeful, which helps her and others in the story. The author writes in a lively style, using chapter titles like ""Our Hero Feels Inspired.""
B. This story is about a local radio station in America that almost fails. It is told from the perspective of a smart, shy boy named Francis With. He works for WLT (With Lettuce and Tomato) Radio, which was started by two brothers to promote their sandwich shop. The station plays a mix of music, sermons, and soap operas. The author uses humor and simple writing to take readers back to the 1940s and 1950s, a time of old stores and classic cars.
C. In this story, it is normal for a second husband to talk to his wife’s first husband. Richard Vaisey, a successful professor, falls in love with a Russian poetess. He shares his feelings with his wife’s ex-husband. The poetess writes bad poetry, which bothers Richard, and she wants his help for her brother who is in prison. The author skillfully tells the story with humor and insight into relationships, making it an enjoyable read.
D. In 1960s London, two sets of best friends—two women and two men—become connected for 25 years. At the beginning of the story, James Hudson, a wealthy American, is starting a newspaper with his friend Richard Blake. The newspaper launch is important, but so is the fact that a woman they both loved, and one of them married, was killed years ago. The story includes themes of murder, ambition, love, and jealousy, and the writing is engaging. This book allows readers to really get to know the characters.
E. This story, written by a great American author, is about Ian Bedloe, who feels guilty about something he did. To make up for it, he becomes a father figure to his brother's three orphaned children. At 40, he is slowly becoming a quirky bachelor. The story explores many emotions and shows the special bond Ian forms with the youngest child, Daphne. It is a warm and funny book that balances sadness and laughter."
CAE_53,C1,"**Volunteer Tourism**
Four writers talk about international volunteer work. 
A. It is difficult to say that volunteer work really helps development a lot. Volunteer tourists can help build homes or schools, but they usually pay a lot of money to do this work. If this money was given directly to a local community, it could pay for more help than one volunteer can give. This is especially true for gap year volunteers, who often do not have special skills or experience. Many studies question whether these volunteers really want to help the community or if they just want to improve their own careers. However, these projects can help develop people who will act ethically and help those in need in the future.
B. Volunteering can help people understand each other better, solve conflicts, and participate in global issues through organizations. It can also create international friendships among regular people. In this way, everyone benefits, and it helps the world as a whole. But if only wealthy people can volunteer, it may help them in their careers but not help the communities that need it most. Those who volunteer may continue to benefit personally while using the communities they help.
C. Sometimes, international volunteering can be seen as a form of charity that is more about helping the volunteers than the communities. It can also provide real help for development. At its best, volunteering can bring benefits to both volunteers and the organizations they work with, while also sharing skills and experiences with developing communities. Most importantly, volunteering can raise awareness about unfair power relations and the deep causes of poverty and injustice.
D. Volunteer tourism fits well with the idea of helping others. These small efforts to ""make a difference"" can seem positive, especially when people are tired of big government and businesses. However, this approach can ignore the need for democratic government and reduce development to individual acts of charity. While volunteering is often a good thing, when it is promoted as sustainable development, it can weaken the real conversation about development. The politics of volunteer tourism can distract from understanding global inequalities and the poverty many people face in developing countries."
CAE_55,C1,"**Sound the Alarm**
Stuart Harris reports
Many people listen to the radio in the morning, and most of us need something to help us get out of bed. This is why we have clock radios. But how do you choose a good one? A group of us, including inventor Tom Granger and broadcaster Paul Bridges, tested five different models.
One model has a 'dual alarm function'. This means you can set two different wake-up times, one for work days and one for weekends. However, it does not let you snooze and sleep longer as I thought. This model costs about the same as another one we tested, but it has a cassette player. You can listen to your favorite tapes to fall asleep and wake up without news. We all agreed that the radio quality was excellent, but the size is a problem; it is as big as a rugby ball. Paul Bridges said, ""Any clock radio I buy must leave space on my bedside table for my keys, wallet, glasses, and phone. I always book a wake-up call just in case the alarm doesn’t work.""
This model was voted the best-looking and overall winner. Paul Bridges said he was ""in love with it,"" even though the clock he tested sometimes got stuck at 16:00. I liked the digital display with its nice grey numbers on a soft green background. The snooze button is wide, so you can easily tap it with your eyes closed. However, the buttons felt nice to touch, and I ended up pressing them too much, which made it hard to understand the instruction booklet. The clock has a backup battery, so you don’t have to reset it if the power goes out. We all liked this feature. But we found it difficult to set up, even though learning to use it made us feel cool.
Tom Granger thought this model, which has a built-in lamp, looked cheap. He had to read the instructions twice to get it to work because the clock kept changing time. The lamp was hard to adjust, and you couldn’t read by it because it only shines on the clock, which is already lit. Paul Bridges found the lamp idea funny but agreed that tuning the radio was difficult. The buzzer sounded like an alarm on a submarine, and it made me want to throw the clock across the room. Interestingly, this model is the third most popular on the market. It is aimed at young people with its bright colors, and both Tom Granger and I liked it. Tom said, ""I would choose this one because it stands out.""
The controls were easy to use, and we could set it up without reading the instructions. However, the alarm can go off 20 minutes earlier or later than the set time, which Paul Bridges found ridiculous. He said this model was ""very complicated"" and ""completely useless."" 
The simplest and cheapest model we tested was liked by Tom Granger because it was small and had old-fashioned dial tuning. He said, ""It’s easier to set up. With modern buttons, you’re never sure if you pressed everything correctly."" He agreed that radio quality has improved with new technology. I thought the tuning was not very good, and so did Paul Bridges, but we both agreed that the radio quality was fine. The buzzer on this model worked well; it got me out of bed in just two beeps!"
CAE_50,C1,"Hedgehogs
A hedgehog is a small animal with sharp spines on its body. You can find hedgehogs in many parts of the world, but they are not native to America or Australia. All hedgehogs can roll into a tight ball when they are in danger, so their spines point outwards. This helps protect them. However, how well this works depends on how many spines the hedgehog has. Some hedgehogs that live in deserts have fewer spines because they have adapted to their environment. These hedgehogs are more likely to run away from danger instead of rolling up.
Hedgehogs are mostly active at night and sleep during the day. They usually sleep under bushes or in holes in the ground. Although all hedgehogs can hibernate, not all of them do. Some hedgehogs will stay awake all year if the conditions are good."
CAE_25,C1,"**Great Sportswomen on a Winning Streak**
It is hard to be good at any sport, even for men, but women often have to work even harder. Training and competitions take a lot of time, so they have to make sacrifices. Despite this, they are overcoming challenges and breaking records. Here, we talk to some amazing British sportswomen who are reaching their goals.
**A. Jill, 27, Skier**  
""I love the feeling of flying through the air and landing safely, but it can be scary. Sometimes I don’t feel well or the weather is bad, but I keep going. It’s hard to have a life outside of skiing because we train for ten months each year. I give up a lot of time with friends, but it was my choice. There are six men and three women on the British team. We all compete together and are treated the same because it is a new sport.""
**B. Caroline, 22, Cyclist**  
""Two years ago, I borrowed a bike to join a charity race. I won because I cycled faster than everyone else, which was surprising since I had never cycled before! I earn good money as a professional cyclist, and there are many opportunities for sponsorship. However, I worry that people might think I succeeded because of my looks, not my skills. So, I focus on cycling. I train for at least four hours every day, plus I do stretching, swimming, and running. My boyfriend is also a cyclist, so he understands how much time it takes.""
**C. Annabel, 26, Rower**  
""Rowing is hard for girls because not many schools offer it. Most girls start when they are 19 or 20, which makes it harder to compete internationally. Coaches often change, so the women’s team struggles to stay strong. But I enjoy it and love being fit, plus there is a good social life.""
**D. Ffyona, 24, Long-Distance Walker**  
""When I was 13, I dreamed of walking around the world, not knowing how big it was! I felt trapped in Britain and didn’t like anyone controlling me. Now, I am more careful. Each walk is different. Walking across Australia was the hardest experience for me. I walked 50 miles a day with little sleep and many blisters. But I set a record! I had to because my sponsorship money would run out after 95 days. Some men think women are more likely to fail, so they see sponsoring us as a risk.""
**E. Lisa, 26, Saloon Car Racer**  
""Some men are very competitive when driving. When I do well, they often ignore me. Being a woman has its challenges. When I reach a corner, men think they must beat me, so I have had many accidents! You need to be competitive and strong. It is hard to earn money, and what I do make goes back into racing. Women have been racing since the 1920s, but they were often seen as unusual. It’s great that more women are joining racing every year. I love trying to drive perfectly.""
**F. Alison, 28, Triathlete**  
""I wake up at 5:30 three mornings a week to swim. I need the other mornings to catch up on sleep. In the evenings, I cycle or run. Sometimes I fall asleep at my desk! There is a lot of pressure before a race, and I push myself hard. I often ask myself why I do this. The answers are: a) I feel happier when I stay fit, b) I would be lazy if I didn’t push myself, and c) racing is very social. Men and women usually compete together, but when events are reported in the news, most of the focus is on the men. The prize money is not as good for women either. But now we have formed an International Triathlon Women’s Commission to help improve this."""
CAE_34,C1,"**The Day I Met Picasso**
Richard Cork remembers the day he met Picasso when he was 78 years old. He saw Picasso eating lunch at a restaurant in Cannes. Even from far away, Picasso was easy to recognize. At that time, I was an 18-year-old student traveling around Europe and Morocco in an old van. I had run out of money and found a job painting boats by the water. But I spent a lot of time drawing and had my sketchbook with me when I saw Picasso.
Picasso was known to be a private person who usually stayed away from others to work. So, I was surprised to see him sitting at a table with his wife, Jacqueline, and some friends. I would not have asked for his signature if my friend hadn’t encouraged me. I nervously introduced myself and offered my sketchbook, and to my surprise, he agreed. He wrote his name at the top of the page and then added some fun lines below. These lines might have represented a cloud, the sea, or the shape of Cannes harbor.
I thanked him and started a conversation. Since Picasso's English was not very good and my French was not great either, an American woman at the table helped us talk. She called him ""the Maestro,"" which made it hard for me to speak. But I told Picasso that I loved art and admired his work. After a while, I went back to my boat and showed my friend what I had. He saw that Picasso was still having lunch and asked, ""Is that all?"" He encouraged me to go back and talk to Picasso again, saying I might not get another chance.
So, I went back to Picasso's table with my sketchbook. I didn’t ask if I could draw his portrait because I was afraid he might say no. Instead, I just stood there, took out my crayon, and started to draw. When Picasso noticed, he smiled and made funny faces, which made it hard for me to draw him. He rolled his eyes, stuck out his tongue, and made silly shapes with his hands. Even though it was difficult, I felt like he was testing my determination.
After a while, Picasso stopped being silly and sat still for me. I noticed how strong and alert he looked, wearing a blue-and-white striped shirt. He looked much younger than his age, with bright, dark eyes that were very intense. Even though he was with friends, he seemed to be in his own world, quietly focused on his own thoughts.
When the American woman told me that Picasso wanted to see my drawing, I felt shy and said it wasn’t good enough. But Picasso insisted, so I showed him my sketch. He nodded in approval and then surprised me by saying it was his turn to draw. I quickly gave him my crayon, and he made a few quick strokes on the paper. In just a few seconds, he drew a bearded face that looked very different from my careful drawing. He had moved one of my eyes onto my nose and captured my smile with just one lively line. I looked like a character from one of his playful artworks.
I thanked Picasso and asked if he could sign my drawing. The American woman explained that he said I already had his signature. So, he was not going to give me another one! Still, I feel very lucky to have met Picasso and to have received his attention. It meant a lot to me."
CAE_12,C1,"**Talking Shop**
Have you ever gone into a store and bought more than you planned? This text explains how shops encourage you to spend more money.
**A. The Fresh Look**  
Supermarkets know that people like fresh food. They often put fruits and vegetables at the entrance of the store. Some even have bakeries that make the smell of fresh bread fill the store. The colors in the store, like green, can also make it feel fresh. However, most of what supermarkets sell, like frozen food and cleaning products, is not fresh.
**B. Smart Product Placement**  
Where products are placed in a store is very important for sales. Supermarkets use computers to find out which areas are most popular with shoppers. They put high-profit items in these areas. Products at eye level are more likely to be bought. Special offers in bins can attract bargain hunters. Sometimes, related items are placed together, like desserts near ice cream.
**C. Spreading Basic Items**  
Supermarkets often place low-priced items like bread and sugar far from the entrance. This way, shoppers pass by more expensive items on their way. Stores may also put popular products far from the entrance, hoping loyal customers will look for them and see other tempting items.
**D. Less is More**  
Chain stores have changed how they display their products. For example, the Next chain shows fewer items on the shelves, making them seem special. Even though their clothes are mass-produced, their store design helps them sell well.
**E. Total Costs Matter**  
Shoppers care more about the total cost of their shopping than the price of each item. Supermarkets mix low-priced basic items with more expensive ones. They sometimes sell basic items at a loss to attract customers, which are called ""loss leaders."" They also get discounts from manufacturers by buying in large amounts.
**F. The Price Tag**  
Shoppers in chain stores often buy fewer items and pay more attention to prices. For example, pricing a blouse at £14.99 instead of £15 can make a difference. This pricing strategy can also help reduce theft by staff.
**G. Lighting Matters**  
Both supermarkets and chain stores think carefully about lighting. Chain stores try to use natural light so customers can see the true colors of clothes. Supermarkets use special lighting to make fresh fruits and vegetables look better.
**H. Store Layout**  
Many chain stores use different carpet patterns to guide shoppers. One pattern shows the paths through the store, while another marks sales areas. This design encourages shoppers to explore, but some may stick to the main paths.
**I. In-Store Promotions**  
When you enter a supermarket, you often see big pictures of delicious food, which can make you hungry. In the U.S., some supermarkets are testing ""video trolleys"" that show ads for products while you shop. These trolleys aim to encourage impulse buying and can increase sales significantly."
CAE_26,C1,"**Sea, Ice & Rock**
Chris Bonnington, who is 58 years old, is famous for climbing Mount Everest in 1985. He has also created new climbing routes in Britain and the Alps and has written many books, such as *Quest for Adventure* and *Everest the Hard Way*. Robin Knox-Johnston, who is 53, started his career at sea in the Merchant Navy. In 1968-1969, he became the first person to sail around the world alone in his yacht called Sunhaili. He also set a record for crossing the Atlantic Ocean, taking just 10 days to sail from New York to the Lizard in England.
Chris and Robin worked together to sail and climb in Greenland, and they wrote about their adventure in a new book called *Sea, Ice and Rock*. In 1979, while Chris was working on *Quest for Adventure*, he called Robin for an interview. Robin invited Chris to join him for a sail. Chris could teach Robin some climbing skills, and Robin could teach Chris how to sail. This was Chris's first time on a yacht. They sailed for a while and then stopped. Robin's wife and daughter stayed on the boat while Chris and Robin paddled to shore to practice climbing.
The climbing route was difficult, but Chris was impressed by how steady Robin was in tough conditions. When they reached a big drop, Chris asked Robin if he had ever climbed before. Robin had not, so Chris showed him how to do it. Robin politely asked if he could climb down using the ropes from his boat. Chris wanted him to use his legs instead of his arms. Although Chris was not happy about it, Robin safely lowered himself down.
During their trip to Skye, Chris and Robin became good friends. Robin suggested they combine their skills for a trip to Greenland, which was a big step from their Skye adventure. Chris admired Robin as a leader. Normally, the captain makes all the decisions, but Robin asked for everyone's opinion first. Most of the time, people were too shy to give advice, but it felt good to be part of the decision-making.
Chris found sailing difficult and boring. He preferred the excitement of dealing with problems, but he did not like spending so many days at sea. He was not a natural sailor like Robin, who enjoyed fixing the boat. Chris sometimes felt useless and found it hard to be so close to the other crew members on a small yacht designed for four people, but they had six on board.
When they reached Greenland and it was Chris's turn to lead the climbing expedition, he felt nervous about being responsible for Robin's safety. There were times when Robin could have fallen and pulled Chris down with him. Chris did not expect how hard climbing Greenland's highest mountain, called the Cathedral, would be. Robin was not a natural climber, which made his efforts even more impressive. The first time they tried to reach the top, they climbed for 24 hours. On the way down, they were so tired that they almost fell asleep on steep slopes, 1,500 feet above the ground. Robin trusted Chris completely and just followed him. When it became too difficult, Chris knew they had to turn back, and Robin accepted this.
Robin was also worried about their boat and whether it would be okay in the ice. Still, he wanted to try climbing the mountain again. The only time they had a problem was on the way home. They were taking turns to keep watch on the yacht. Chris was supposed to wake up at 4 am for his shift, but Robin decided not to wake him because he thought he could handle it alone. Chris had almost fallen asleep the night before and felt that Robin did not trust him. He expressed his feelings, and Robin quickly reassured him that he was wrong to think that.
While they enjoyed their trip to Skye, they really got to know each other during the Greenland expedition. Chris discovered that Robin, despite his tough appearance, was a kind and sensitive person."
CAE_8,C1,"**A History of the Apple**
Apples have been around for a very long time, in many different colors, shapes, and sizes. However, in the late 20th century, we risk losing this important part of our history.
**Prehistoric Times (8,000 BC)**  
People have been eating apples since ancient times. In Britain, they would spit out apple seeds. About 10,000 years ago, people left apple remains near their homes by lakes in Switzerland and Italy. In these areas, ancient people even stored dried apple halves for winter. But these apples were wild crab apples, which are small and not like the apples we eat today.
**Norman Knowledge (1000 AD)**  
The Romans taught the French how to grow fruit, and this knowledge spread to Britain. They brought different types of apples, like the dessert apple called Decio, introduced by a Roman general. However, many Roman apples did not grow well in Britain, so the apples from the Normans became more popular. British monks also experimented with growing new types of apples, which led to the apples we have today.
**Medieval Favorites (1200)**  
In the 13th century, several apple types became popular in Britain. The Old English Pearmain was a main dessert apple until the 18th century. The Costard was a cooking apple sold in markets and gave us the word 'costermonger,' which means someone who sells fruits and vegetables in the street. However, due to droughts, the Black Death, and wars, fewer apples were produced, and more were imported. This changed in the 16th century when King Henry VIII sent his fruit expert to France to learn about apple growing. He returned with many new apple types, including the famous Pippins, and started the first modern orchard in Kent.
**Settler Treasure (1750)**  
By the 17th century, apples were very popular in Britain. When settlers went to Canada, Australia, the US, South Africa, and New Zealand, they took apples and seeds with them. Captain Bligh took apples to Australia, and the Pilgrim Fathers brought them to America. In North America, a famous apple planter was John Chapman, known as 'Johnny Appleseed.' He planted apple trees across many states and was seen as a kind man who cared for nature.
**Modern Delicious (1850)**  
Around this time, a farmer named Jesse Hiatt found a new apple tree in Iowa. He named the apple 'Hawkey,' and when a judge tasted it, he called it 'Delicious.' This apple became very popular worldwide.
**Granny Smith (1850)**  
Another famous apple, the Granny Smith, was discovered in Australia by Maria Anne Smith. She was known as 'Granny Smith' because she took care of her family's farm. In 1868, she found a small tree growing from old fruit. She moved it, and soon she had a large crop of green apples that became famous around the world. She believed that something good could come from what others thought was useless.
**Uniformity Issues (1950)**  
Today, apples are grown all over the world, but most come from just a few types that are chosen for their appearance and how well they travel, not for their taste. This lack of variety is a problem, as it reduces the different types of apples we can enjoy. While some gardeners in the UK keep old apple types alive, many apples in the US have been lost. However, people are starting to want more variety. We should all work to protect the diversity of apples and other foods for everyone’s benefit."

CAE_30,C1,"Richard Nerurkar is a long-distance runner from Britain, known for running 10,000 meters. He visits a training camp in Kenya, which is located ten miles south of the equator. The camp is near Mount Kenya, the highest peak in the country. For three years, Richard has trained in this beautiful but quiet place, but he had never trained with Kenyan runners before. 
On his fourth trip to Kenya, he decided to change this. He ran in his first race in Kenya and stayed at the national team training camp, where the best Kenyan runners prepare for competitions. He was invited by the national team coach after he finished fifth in the World Championship 10,000 meters race. This was a great opportunity for him. 
Training at high altitudes helps runners produce more red blood cells, which improves their ability to carry oxygen. This is one reason why many Kenyan runners are successful. Richard's first race in Africa was also special because it was the first international cross-country race held on the continent. He finished behind 41 runners, most of whom were Kenyan, but he felt he did well.
Richard believes that Kenyan runners' success is not only because of the high altitude. They have a simple and relaxed approach to running, and they enjoy competing. He wanted to learn more about how they train. 
The national team training camp is at St Mark's College, 6,200 feet up Mount Kenya. The camp is basic, with athletes living in shared rooms. Their daily schedule includes three workouts: a morning run, interval training in the middle of the day, and a steady run in the afternoon. They start their day at six in the morning. The coach reminds them to take it easy during the morning run because they have a tough day ahead. They run about 40 kilometers each day, except on Sundays when they only run 20 kilometers.
Life at the camp is simple. They wash their faces and brush their teeth before breakfast, which includes tea, bread, and boiled eggs. Lunch and dinner are similar, with dishes like ugali (a maize dish), stew, and vegetables. After running, they often go to bathe in streams from Mount Kenya's glaciers.
By the end of his stay, Richard understood more about why Kenyan runners are so successful. It is not just about genetics or altitude; it is also about their simple lifestyle, hard training, and passion for running. These factors may be the real reasons behind Kenya's success in long-distance running."
CAE_7,C1,"**The Challenges of Mass Marketing**
Almost everyone knows that advertising is struggling. This problem started in early 1989, before the recession really hit. The truth is that advertising has not kept up with changes in the economy. Advertisers often think about large groups of people and big media, but as more brands and media options appear, the target audiences have become smaller and more specific. Even big brand campaigns should focus on smaller groups, but they usually do not.
Think about your own shopping. When you go to a supermarket, you might buy 30, 40, or even 50 items. Most of these items are not from advertised brands. You might buy a few well-known brands, but you will not buy many different brands in a year. For example, you might only buy around 400 different brands in a year, even though there are over 32,500 brands advertised.
If we look at the 9,500 brands that are often advertised, the average person only buys about 400 of them, which is only 4 percent. This means that a lot of advertising is not effective. When you watch TV, count how many ads are for brands you buy. Most people find that only about 1 in 16 ads (6 percent) are for brands they are interested in. This means that 94 percent of the ads are not useful for them.
Many people believe they are not influenced by advertising, but that is not true. Most people do not buy the brands they see advertised. There is always some waste in advertising because not everyone who sees an ad will buy the product. However, advertising can still be effective. It needs to reach many people to find the few who will respond, as advertisers cannot know in advance who will be interested.
Even the best-targeted ads do not get a 100 percent response. This is different from face-to-face selling, where a salesperson might succeed with every customer they talk to. If advertisers knew exactly who would respond, they would not need to use mass media at all.
For any advertising campaign, getting just 2 percent of the adult population to become new customers is considered a success. For example, the top-selling soap powder brands would be very happy with one million new customers. So, while mass media can be a good way to reach people, advertising needs to be more focused to be successful again."
CAE_43,C1,"**Solar Survivor: Charles Clover Visits a Green Home**
Charles Clover explores one of the most environmentally-friendly homes in Britain, located in Southwell, Nottinghamshire. This area has some interesting surprises. First, there is Southwell Minster, a little-known ancient cathedral famous for its carvings of 'green' men made by medieval craftsmen. Second, there is the 'autonomous house,' built by Robert and Brenda Vale, which is known as the greenest home in Britain.
The Vales use rainwater for drinking and washing, recycle their sewage into compost for their garden, and heat their home using waste heat from their electrical appliances and their own body heat, along with that of their three teenage children and two cats, Edison and Faraday. The house looks traditional, with a clay tile roof, and is located 300 yards from the Minster. It was designed to match the orange brick of the town's older buildings and was approved by planners even though it is in a conservation area.
When you ring the solar-powered doorbell, you hear no sound because the house is very well insulated. It has special windows that keep noise out. Inside, it is very quiet and calm. On a sunny summer day, the windows are closed, and the conservatory warms the air before it goes into the house. Robert shows how the house has clever ventilation systems to keep the air fresh.
The Vales, who teach architecture at Nottingham University, have cared about the environment for many years. They wrote a book about green architecture in the 1970s called *The Autonomous House*. They wanted to create a home that does not produce carbon dioxide and decided to use only rainwater. They built special toilets that compost waste, installed rainwater tanks in the cellar, and used copper gutters to keep the drinking water clean. They filter the water before using it and do not have a dishwasher because they believe using strong detergents is wrong. 
Robert says, ""We wanted to show that it is possible to design a house that is better for the environment without living in darkness."" The only old-fashioned part of the house is the hall, which has a fireplace and a staircase that goes up to the roof. The Vales do not pay for water, and last winter, their house used only nine units of electricity a day, costing about 70p. This is much less than what other four-bedroom houses use.
Soon, they will install solar panels in the garden, which will help the house generate its own electricity. The house will still use some electricity from the mains for cooking and appliances, but it will produce more electricity than it needs. One day, it might even charge an electric car. The only heating in the house is a small wood-burning stove, which they only use on very cold days. 
When Charles visited in February, Robert said it was too warm to light the fire. The temperature on the first floor was 18°C, which is lower than usual for living areas, but Robert felt comfortable because there were no drafts and everything felt warm to the touch. He explained that people in the past were comfortable at lower temperatures because of their clothing. 
The secret of the house is that it is simple and low-tech, which means there are fewer things that can break. Most materials were bought from local suppliers and installed by local workers, making the house affordable to build. It cost the same as low-cost rental housing. However, big building companies do not want to adopt this idea."
CAE_51,C1,"**The Camera Never Lies**
Arthur Conan Doyle, who created the Sherlock Holmes stories, thought of himself as a rational man and a scientist. In 1920, he saw photographs of fairies taken in a garden and believed they were real proof that these tiny creatures existed. He published these photos with an article, saying that fairies were wonderful supernatural beings. 
However, in 1939, the two women who took the photos admitted that they were fake. They had cut out pictures of fairies from a book and placed them among flowers. The photos looked beautiful, but the simple trick showed that photography can be misleading. 
People often say that the camera never lies, but it can. Today, we have computer programs that let us change our digital images. It is a myth that photography was ever completely honest. From the beginning, when cameras started to capture reality, that reality was being changed."
CAE_11,C1,"**Blacksmiths**
Throughout history, iron has fascinated people, and blacksmiths, who work with iron, have been seen as more than just skilled workers. Before the Industrial Revolution, blacksmiths were as respected as doctors and astrologers because they made weapons, armor, and farming tools. They were also considered artists. In the 18th century, blacksmiths created beautiful ironwork for places like St Paul's Cathedral. The elegant metalwork in French and Belgian Art Nouveau buildings was also made by talented blacksmiths. 
However, by the late 1960s, the number of blacksmiths in Britain had greatly decreased because heavy industry no longer needed them, and modern architects rarely used beautiful wrought-iron designs. In the last 10 years, there has been a revival of interest in decorative architecture and more creative interior design. Still, much of the work looks similar, with many manufacturers calling their products ""classical"" or ""Victorian-style."" You can find trendy design stores filled with rusty candlesticks and other similar items.
Fortunately, there are new events to promote the blacksmith's craft. One of these is an exhibition of forged ironwork by members of the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA), which opened last week at the Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey. Alan Dawson, the secretary of BABA, believes we might be starting a new ""Iron Age"" because both the public and blacksmiths are more open to new ideas. 
Power tools have made it easier for blacksmiths to work with metal, allowing them to bend, twist, and weld it more easily. Dawson says, ""These artists now have a material that lets them express themselves."" About 250 pieces are on display, including bookends and a spiral staircase. Prices start at £90 and can go much higher. Most of the money will go to the individual makers, but a part of each sale will help promote good ironwork.
Dawson has created an eight-foot gate and a lamp with a glass shade. He explains, ""My style comes from letting steel bend and flow into shape when it's hot. It's like drawing with metal in space."" Many artists love working with iron. Unlike other metals, iron and steel are tough and challenging to work with. Susan May, a jeweler, says, ""It's magical because it's soft when hot, but when it cools, it becomes hard and unmovable.""
Ann Catrin Evans makes door knockers and handles from mild steel, inspired by the dark castles seen in horror films. One of her designs looks like a ball and chain, and another like a Celtic cross. She says, ""I love that steel is cold and hard, and it feels like it will last forever."" No other metal gives people as much visual pleasure or a sense of security. It seems likely that iron will continue to be used for decoration for many years to come, as long as we don’t have to see any more rusty candlesticks!"
CAE_14,C1,"**The Day I Gave Up Smoking**
I thought everyone would be happy when I stopped smoking, but one of my coworkers was very angry. She asked, ""What do you mean? If it was that easy, why didn't you stop years ago?"" I found it hard to explain how I went from being a heavy smoker to not smoking at all in just a few hours. It was strange for me too. 
I stopped smoking two months and three weeks ago. I didn’t plan to quit, and I didn’t really want to. I felt pressure from people who are against smoking, and I still do. I also had low blood pressure and a healthy family. I didn’t cough or feel sick, and I got over colds faster than my friends who tried to live healthier. 
That Thursday afternoon, I went to a stop-smoking session in Birmingham to write an article about it. I said, ""I won’t try to stop smoking; I’m just here to write."" I thought it was fair because I enjoyed smoking. The counselor seemed to understand me. We could smoke as much as we wanted, and the room was so full of smoke that we had to open the windows. 
I noticed that when I was told to smoke, I didn’t want to, and neither did the others. The messages about stopping smoking started to make sense to me. Just like smoking had become a challenge, the idea of stopping began to feel good. I started to feel strong about the possibility of not being a smoker. 
It was easier than I thought. The cravings for nicotine, which felt like hunger, went away after a minute or two and lasted only four or five days. I thought working without cigarettes would be hard, but it wasn’t a problem at all. I was worried I wouldn’t be able to meet deadlines without smoking, but I did fine. 
Surprisingly, the hardest part was doing things at home on weekend mornings. I realized that smoking helped me deal with boredom; having a cigarette was something to do. Yes, I do miss smoking, but not too much. Every new experience as a non-smoker is something I have to get used to, like eating out, waiting for a plane, checking into a hotel, or during a break at the theater. These are all moments when I would have smoked before."
CAE_63,C1,"**Dorothy Hodgkin: A Scientist Worth Knowing**
Dorothy Hodgkin was the only British woman scientist to win a Nobel Prize, but many people in Britain do not know her name. For the past four years, I have been asking friends if they know about her. If they respond with excitement and say, ""Isn't there already a biography?"" they pass my test. 
Why should people in Britain know about Dorothy Hodgkin? She won a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1964 for her work on important substances like penicillin and vitamin B12. She was a remarkable person and her life shows important changes in the 20th century, like the growth of women's education and the global sharing of scientific knowledge.
When I started my research, I wanted to read biographies of scientists. A friend suggested a biography of Linus Pauling, who was a close friend of Hodgkin and also won Nobel Prizes. I went to a local bookshop but found no biographies of Pauling. I was surprised because he was a very important chemist. This made me realize that many people do not find scientists interesting enough to read about.
Some scientists believe that their lives are not exciting. Peter Medawar, a Nobel Prize winner, once said that the lives of scientists are often boring. If scientists think this way, it is not surprising that publishers and bookstores feel the same. Many biographies focus only on famous scientists, while the lives of other scientists are often ignored.
It is not true that scientists have less interesting lives than artists, writers, or politicians. Some scientists avoid talking about their personal lives because they do not want to seem like they are promoting themselves. This can make science seem less inviting to young people and create misunderstandings about what scientists do.
Fortunately, things are changing. More scientists are appearing in public in different ways. For example, Professor Richard Dawkins gives out awards on TV, and geneticist Steve Jones appears in car commercials. These activities help people see scientists as real people, not just researchers.
The way scientific biographies are written is also changing. In the past, they were often boring and focused only on work. But now, books like Richard Feynman's ""Surely You're Joking, Mr Feynman?"" show that scientists can have interesting lives outside of their research. Even famous scientists like Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein are now shown with their personal struggles.
Dorothy Hodgkin was dedicated to her work and also raised three children while being married to a husband who traveled a lot for his job. Her personal life is not the main focus of her work, but it shows how she balanced different parts of her life. 
Hodgkin's passion for science was a big part of her life, and it is important for any scientist to have this passion. The challenge for biographers is to share this passion in a way that readers can understand. Learning about science can be as challenging as reading Shakespeare or learning a new language, but it is possible with effort.
It is sad that many educated people do not know about important scientists like Dorothy Hodgkin, even though they would feel embarrassed if they did not recognize a famous writer or artist. We should celebrate the contributions of scientists and learn from their lives."
CAE_56,C1,"**Margaret and Her Water Finding Skills**
Margaret Wilkins is known for having a special ability, often called a ""sixth sense."" She can use a forked hazel stick to find water underground. Many farmers need her help because their wells have dried up. Margaret and her husband run a well-drilling business that uses machines like drilling rigs and air-compressed hammers. However, to find water, she only needs her hazel stick. They have a success rate of over 90%.
This ability to find water, minerals, and lost items underground is called dowsing. There are many ideas about how it works, from physical reasons like magnetism to spiritual beliefs. One popular idea is that everything on Earth vibrates, and water vibrates more than other things. Some dowsers believe they can feel these vibrations, while others think they can smell water.
In recent years, Margaret has been very busy because of droughts. Many of her customers are farmers with dry wells. She says, ""We usually see customers only once because wells last a long time."" Other customers include people with holiday homes who do not want to pay for long water pipes, and developers building golf courses.
Margaret looks for water between 50 and 70 meters deep. She explains, ""You can't drill where there is a risk of waste getting into the water."" The water she finds is usually in safe places, but she has to be careful because some areas have high mineral content, like iron.
Electricity is also needed to pump the water, so it is best if the well is close to power sources. Once she considers all these factors, she starts looking for water. For large areas like golf courses, she first studies a map and uses a pendulum. She holds the pendulum over the map, and it swings when she is above a water source.
After checking the map, Margaret walks over the fields with her hazel stick. When she is above water, she feels a strange sensation. She then uses the stick to find the exact spot to drill. She holds the two forks of the stick and pulls them slightly apart. If the stick rises, it means water is below. It is very important to drill exactly where the stick indicates. If they disagree on the spot, she and her husband will keep looking until they agree.
Margaret is not alone in her work; many people are interested in this unusual skill. She describes it as an ""intuitive perception of the environment."" This special ability helps her family continue their well-drilling business year after year."
CAE_36,C1,"**We Changed Lives for a Day!**
Have you ever thought about living someone else's life for a day? It could be fun to try something different! We helped four people do this. Here’s what happened.
**Amanda's Story**
Amanda is 23 years old and a mother of two daughters. She swapped lives with her friend Cindy, who is 30 and works as a waitress in a busy restaurant in London. 
Amanda had never been in a place like that before. It was dark, loud, and full of people. She felt nervous and thought it would be hard to manage. Being a mother is busy, but waitressing was even more challenging! She had only fifteen minutes to learn how to carry drinks on a tray. Other waitresses made it look easy, but when Amanda tried, the drinks fell and spilled everywhere. She felt embarrassed, but the other waitresses laughed and said it happens to everyone.
When the restaurant opened at 11:30 am, there was already a line of customers. Amanda worried about remembering their orders, but luckily, everything was done with computers. After a few hours, her feet hurt, and the loud music was hard to handle. She often had to ask customers to repeat themselves, which was embarrassing. By the end of her shift at 5 pm, she was very tired and wanted to relax her feet in hot water. One waitress told her it was a ""quiet"" day, and Amanda was shocked at how tiring waitressing was. She thought it was an easy job, but it actually requires a lot of energy and a friendly attitude. Amanda realized she could not handle the busy Saturday nights. She was also disappointed with the tips she received. In the end, she was happy to return to her children, as being a mother felt easier after her day as a waitress.
**Cindy's Story**
Cindy is 30 years old and felt nervous about being a mother for a day, but she was also excited. She knew Amanda's daughters could be cheeky, but she thought she could manage. 
When Amanda left for the restaurant, Cindy had to get the two girls ready for the day. After dropping Sophie at school and Katie at nursery, she thought she would have some quiet time. But she was wrong! Amanda had left a note reminding her to clean the house and do the laundry. 
At 1 pm, Cindy picked up Katie, went shopping, and then took her home for lunch. When she brought Sophie home from school, things got wild. The girls turned the couch into a trampoline and screamed loudly while playing. Cindy thought they would tire out, but they had more energy than she expected! After a lot of effort, she finally got them to bed by 8 pm, but then the fun continued. The girls kept asking for water, trying to get out of bed to watch TV. Cindy realized it was tiring to take care of two small children. She had no time for herself, and the responsibility felt heavy. Still, she enjoyed the day.
**Rosemary's Story**
Rosemary is 42 and runs a dairy farm. She swapped lives with Hilary, who is 30 and a primary school teacher. 
On the farm, Rosemary wakes up at 5:30 am, so sleeping in until 7 am felt great! She worried about how to dress for school. At assembly, she hoped no one noticed her as she stood in front of about 400 students. 
In class, the children worked in small groups, which was different from Rosemary's school days. She helped with a nature project about snails. By lunchtime, she was tired but only had five minutes to eat. There was a lot to do before the next classes. She attended a meeting and helped with sports trials. After lunch, she enjoyed a silent reading lesson and then a French lesson, where the children practiced speaking with her. Finally, they had Physical Education, and by then, Rosemary was very tired, but the children were full of energy. Speaking in front of the class was the hardest part for her. Even though teachers have more holidays, Rosemary decided she prefers farming.
**Hilary's Story**
Hilary is 30 and arrived at White House Farm at 8:30 am, only to find that Rosemary had been working for three hours already! Rosemary's farm has many animals, including cows and sheep. 
Hilary spent the morning in the ice-cream shop, filling containers with milk and making ice cream. She had to stop herself from tasting everything! At lunchtime, she checked on the sheep and helped a fallen ewe. If sheep are not checked daily, they can die. After feeding the calves, Hilary started milking, which took two and a half hours. Rosemary does this twice a day, every day of the year! 
Hilary felt lonely and missed being around children because animals do not talk back. The hardest part of farming is that there is no time off. The cows need to be milked twice a day, making it hard to plan vacations. Farming may seem romantic, but the reality is very different. The income can be unstable, and Hilary would not want to depend on the weather."
CAE_6,C1,"A trumpet isn't just for Christmas. It is interesting that many musicians, even famous ones, come from families without music. Hakan Hardenberger, the only son of parents who did not play music, is now 30 years old and is a unique trumpet player in the world. His recordings introduce new music, including concertos by old composers and new pieces. When you meet him, he looks young and has a friendly manner, just like the sound of the trumpet.
Recently, he played the Hummel Trumpet Concerto in one of London's top concert halls. A television program was made about his work and life, filmed in London and Sweden. Hakan was born near Malmo, Sweden. His music career started when he was eight years old and received a trumpet as a Christmas gift from his father. His father liked Louis Armstrong's music and wanted to give his son a real trumpet, not a toy. The gift was a success, and Hakan loved playing.
His mother found a trumpet player from the Malmo Symphony Orchestra to give him lessons. Bo Nilsson, the teacher, saw Hakan's natural talent. Hakan is grateful to have had such a passionate teacher. He explains that the trumpet is a simple instrument, and it is impossible to make a perfect one. Each mouthpiece is different, and he believes it is important to understand these differences and work with them.
From the beginning, Hakan had a special sound that people could recognize. Unlike another famous trumpet player, John Wallace, who played in orchestras, Hakan always wanted to be a solo artist. He admired the French trumpeter, Maurice Andre, and bought all his records. His parents supported his dream of becoming a trumpet player.
At 15, Hakan needed to decide where to study. His teacher thought America was too far, so at 16, he went to Paris to study with Pierre Thibaud. Thibaud told him that playing in an orchestra was not as exciting as being a soloist. Hakan knew he played better than many of his peers, but it was only when he entered a competition at 17 that he realized he had a special ability to connect with people through music.
Thibaud suggested he enter the competition for experience. Hakan learned the first round pieces and made it to the second round. He was lucky to know most of the pieces for that round too. However, in the final round, he faced a concerto that scared him. He did not win first prize, but he enjoyed performing and realized that people listened to him, even if he felt he played poorly.
Hakan is realistic about his talent and career, but he does not want to analyze what makes his communication special. He believes that trying to explain it might ruin it. The power of music is that it can always touch people's hearts."

Rebecca Cripps meets five women who talk about their different jobs: the good parts, the bad parts, and what a typical workday is like.
**A. THE BRAIN SURGEON**  
**Name:** Anne  
**Age:** 34  
**ANNE'S DAY**  
""I wake up at 6:30 am, go to the gym at 7 am, and get to work by 8 am. I start surgeries at 8:30 am. I do surgeries all day on Mondays and Wednesdays, and sometimes on Friday afternoons. Most brain surgeries take about three hours, but some can take all day. Sometimes, I work for ten hours without eating or taking a break. Deciding when to operate can be stressful. I don’t feel stressed while I’m operating, but I do worry about what I will do the next day. Brain surgery is usually a last option for patients, but when it works, it feels amazing. From 10 am to 1 pm, I see patients to explain their operations. I enjoy this and find it easy to talk to them. If they get upset, I try to comfort them, but I often feel rushed. I leave work between 6 pm and 8 pm. Some nights and weekends, I am on call, and I always carry my beeper. When I’m on holiday, I worry about my patients for the first few days, and I often dream about operating. I find it hard to relax.""

I work in a team with three senior designers, a partner, and a junior designer. My job is mostly about production, with some design work. I get a brief from the client about what they want. I spend three to four weeks designing and developing the project. After that, I present my ideas to the client. If they like them, we work on budgets and I hire photographers and illustrators. I also work with printers to make sure everything is done on time. I spend a lot of time managing people and need to communicate well. When I get home, it’s usually between 7:30 pm and 8:30 pm, and sometimes later. I find it hard to relax after a busy day.""
**C. THE CHAUFFEUR**  
**Name:** Linda  
**Age:** 42  
**LINDA'S DAY**  
""I usually wake up around 7 am, but on some days, I get up between 4:30 am and 5 am for long flights. At 10:30 or 11 am, I might go for a bike ride or swim. Since chauffeuring is a sitting job, I need to eat well and exercise. I have a big breakfast and snacks during the day. People often ask me for restaurant or shop recommendations, so I need to know the area well. Most jobs are pre-booked, which helps me plan my routes. Not all passengers are polite; some can be rude. But most are nice, and I have good relationships with my regular clients. I work seven days a week, up to fifteen hours a day, so I have to be careful not to get too tired. I try to go to bed by 11 pm.""
**D. THE LANDSCAPE GARDENER**  
**Name:** Tracy  
**Age:** 27  
**TRACY'S DAY**  
""I wake up around 7 am, leave home at 7:30 am, and go to my first job. My assistant and I maintain gardens we designed. We do some commercial work, but most is in private gardens. We spend about an hour and a half at each house. At around 11 am, we take a break and go to a local café for breakfast. In summer, I might work until 10 pm, and in winter until 4:30 pm. I have my office at home, so when I return, I check messages and calls. If someone wants a new garden, I usually meet them in the evening. We like to use old materials to make gardens look historic. It’s very satisfying to see a garden we created bloom. I find it hard to relax in the evenings because I can hear the business phone. I sleep well because my job is very physical, and I am always tired at the end of the day.""
**E. THE CIVIL ENGINEER**  
**Name:** Zena  
**Age:** 27  
**ZENA'S DAY**  
""I arrive at the work site by 8:30 am. I am an assistant engineer, helping to build bridges and a wall to keep cars safe. I check that the workers are following the schedule and safety rules. I help solve any problems that come up. The workers start at 6 am, so my first job is to find out what happened since I left the night before. I usually have paperwork to review or design questions to answer. I take a half-hour lunch break between 2 pm and 2:30 pm, but I often eat while I work. Since I check the workers' progress, I need to keep a good relationship with them. I leave the site around 6 pm and am always on call."""
CAE_40,C1,"**Careers: Six People Talk About Their Typical Working Day**
**A. Credit Card Executive**  
I wake up at 6 am and get to the office by 7:30 am. I manage programs for our credit card users. My job includes starting and managing the Membership Rewards scheme in Europe. I keep in touch with current card users, find new ones, and build relationships with partner companies. I spend the first 45 minutes organizing my day and then check my emails. I work with marketing staff and advertising agencies to plan our advertising strategy. I have many meetings during the day, but I keep my door open for anyone who has questions. I travel to different markets in Europe once or twice a week. When I am in London, I leave work between 6:30 pm and 7:00 pm.
**B. Record Company Executive**  
I arrive at work by 10:00 am and check the mail, which includes demo tapes, letters from producers, and concert information. The phone starts ringing around 10:30 am with calls from producers and publishers. I have meetings throughout the day to discuss projects for artists. When I listen to demo tapes, I know that these are very important to the artists, so I try to give helpful feedback. Once I sign a band, we start working on their first album, choosing songs and a producer. I also manage budgets and spending. I usually leave work by 7:00 pm and often go to concerts in the evening, sometimes seeing up to five new bands. I often don’t get home until 1:00 am, when I listen to music to relax.
**C. Sales Director**  
I wake up at 8:00 am and drive to work, arriving by 9:30 am. I check the mail and my schedule for the day. I enjoy showing customers around the showroom and selling furniture. We sell antiques that cost between £1,000 and £6,000. I spend time working with restorers and other specialists to fix the furniture we buy. I read the Antiques Trade Gazette while drinking coffee to stay updated on the business. I do the accounts once a month and tax returns every three months. I go home at 5:30 pm, and it usually takes me about an hour to relax.
**D. Air Traffic Controller**  
I work in shifts. On early shifts, I leave home at 6:00 am. I start my shift at 7:00 am, taking over one of the control positions in the tower. I work for about an hour and a half at one station, then take a break and switch to another station. My team controls aircraft movements, handling about 1,000 movements a day in winter. Night shifts are quieter, and I can read about new air traffic rules. This job is stressful, and I take sick days if I feel unwell. I hope to become a watch manager and then a general manager of the airport.
**E. Shop Manager**  
If I have an early shift, I leave home by 8:00 am. I start by getting the electronic sales system ready. I make sure someone is watching the cash register and organize lunch breaks for staff. I help customers find and order books. I enjoy serving customers, but it can be challenging when they expect me to gather many books quickly. From 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm, publishers’ representatives visit, and I discuss new book titles. I need to ensure new titles arrive on time. My early shift ends at 5:45 pm. On two days a week, I work late and close the shop before going home.
**F. Financial Analyst**  
I listen to the news at 7:00 am, then get up and take a taxi to work, arriving at 8:45 am. I contact freelance reporters to find out what is happening in my area. I assess financial risks for companies working abroad and warn clients about possible problems. I provide three services: an online news preview, a security forecast, and a travel information guide. From 9:15 am to 9:30 am, I meet with editors to discuss the stories I will follow. I have to send my first news preview online by 10:00 am and my second by 11:00 am, so I work quickly. I travel to Africa about three times a year to report on events. I leave work around 6:00 pm, but it is hard to relax, and I often stay awake until 1:00 am."
CAE_45,C1,"**Career Power: Take Control at Work**
A. **What Makes a Good Leader?**  
A good leader inspires others and helps them change for the better. Leadership is not about being tall or very smart. According to Pat Dixon, who wrote the book *Making the Difference: Women and Men in the Workplace*, leadership is about getting things done with the help of enthusiastic people. A good leader should speak clearly and confidently. It’s important to say ""I believe"" instead of ""I think.""
B. John van Maurik, who teaches a Leadership in Management course, says that many people have more potential to be leaders than they know. To become a leader, you need to recognize your hidden talents, develop them, and use them. In a way, we are all born to be leaders; we just need the right environment to grow. While we can easily see leadership in famous people like Emmeline Pankhurst or Mahatma Gandhi, it can be harder to see it in our own jobs. However, leadership is very important for good management.
C. Think about the best and worst boss you have had. They might have been good at setting goals and meeting deadlines. But how did they achieve these goals? A good leader motivates and supports you. A bad leader makes you feel unimportant and keeps information from you. When things go wrong, a bad leader blames you. The good leader leads well, while the bad leader just manages poorly.
D. Leaders and managers are different. Managers like to work within set rules, while leaders create new opportunities. Micheal Shea, who wrote *Leadership Rules*, says a good manager can keep a company running, but a good leader can change a struggling organization, whether it’s a business, a sports team, or a country.
E. Whether you are the boss or a middle manager, you can improve your leadership skills. Here are some tips:  
- Leadership works best when you choose to lead. Find what you are passionate about and use that energy to lead.  
- Start seeing yourself as a leader. Your ability to lead is important.  
- Sometimes you need to lead firmly, even if you usually work with others. Try different styles of leadership. If you often ask for others' opinions, try taking charge instead. Notice how this changes the results.  
- Set goals and try to achieve them. Look at your job and see where being a leader can help you do better and advance in your career.
F. Leadership does not just happen. It develops when you take the lead, take risks, and learn from mistakes. Learn to delegate tasks, motivate others, organize well, and give praise.  
- Don’t think your way of leading will always be accepted. It might even push people away. Keep improving your communication skills. You don’t need to be liked, but your ideas should be respected.  
- Be visible and approachable to important people. Remember, you don’t have to lead all the time. Know when your leadership is needed and how you can help others become leaders too."
CAE_64,C1,"**Films on Video: Reviews by Film Critic Nick James**
**A. Abyss**  
Before ""Titanic,"" director James Cameron made a tense Cold War thriller called ""Abyss."" It is about oil workers and navy experts trying to save a nuclear submarine deep underwater. The characters, especially foreman Bud and his team, remind us of tough heroes from older movies. The special effects and set design are very impressive, but the dialogue and characters are not as strong. The story feels like a typical B-movie.
**B. The Thin Red Line**  
This video version of James Jones's novel about the battle for Guadalcanal is directed by Andrew Marton. It is different from Terrence Malick's more artistic film. Marton’s version is a more traditional war movie, focusing on one soldier and his difficult relationship with his sergeant. While Malick's film is richer and more complex, Marton's version has some strong moments, especially a flashback where the soldier dreams of his wife.
**C. On Guard**  
This fun swashbuckler is based on a novel from 1875. It is better than many other musketeer films. The villain, played by Fabrice Luchini, is a sneaky politician causing trouble. Vincent Perez is a lively hero, even if he doesn’t last long. Daniel Auteuil plays a moody character, but he also has good moments as a swordsman. The film uses familiar costume-drama ideas with a lot of humor and charm.
**D. Character**  
Set in early 1900s Rotterdam, this film tells a serious story. The detailed costumes and sets make it look like a museum piece. Jan Decleir plays a harsh bailiff named Dreverhaven, who is cruel to his tenants. His difficult relationship with his son is the main focus, but the filmmakers spend too much time on the details and not enough on the dark story.
**E. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly**  
This re-released video shows off director Leone's skills. The sound is excellent; you can hear every step and noise clearly. The story is very harsh, and whenever it slows down, Morricone's great music brings excitement back. The characters, the good (Clint Eastwood), the bad (Lee van Cleef), and the ugly (Ell Wallach), all act in selfish ways as they travel through the post-Civil War West.
**F. The Longest Day**  
This three-hour war film features many international stars and has four directors and 23,000 extras. However, it feels too long and slow, especially in the early scenes where soldiers wait for news about an invasion. While it is impressive in size, it is better suited for the big screen. Watching it on video does not give the same experience."
CAE_29,C1,"**BOOK A** Steve Martin's *Compelling Evidence* is very interesting. The main character is a lawyer who is trying to start a new career after leaving a big law firm. He ends up defending his boss's wife when she is accused of killing her husband. The trial scenes are exciting, and the ending has a surprising twist. This is a great first book in a popular genre.
**BOOK B** *Curtains for the Cardinal* starts with a lot of action. It follows Sigismondo, a problem-solver for the rich people of the Italian Renaissance, as he gets involved in politics, church secrets, and serious crimes. Even though the story is complicated and a bit too long, it is still very enjoyable.
**BOOK C** *File Under: Deceased* introduces a new detective, Leah Hunter, who is a tax inspector. She gets involved in a mystery when a strange man dies in front of her. Despite facing challenges and the disapproval of a handsome local detective, Leah is brave and clever, making her a great character.
**BOOK D** *Double Deuce* by Robert B. Parker features Spenser, a smart private investigator. He helps his friend Hawk get rid of drug dealers in a poor area of Boston. The dialogue is quick and clever, and while there are not many deaths, there is more thinking than usual. It is always high-quality entertainment from Parker.
**BOOK E** *False Prophet* by Faye Kellermann has her usual detectives, Pete Decker and Marge Dunn, looking into a robbery at the home of a famous actress's daughter. The author's easy writing style and focus on unusual human behavior make this mystery fun to read.
**BOOK F** *Blood Red, Snow White* is written by husband and wife team Diane Henry and Nicholas Horrock. It features another lawyer and a female client, but most of the action happens outside the courtroom. The lawyer becomes a victim as the story unfolds. It has all the classic elements of romance, money, and violence, making it a gripping suspense novel.
**BOOK G** *Dead for a Ducat* by Simon Shaw features actor Philip Fletcher as a character who is supposed to be a victim. A funny group of characters comes together to film a story about Robin Hood, but Philip feels that his career is not going in the right direction. Simon Shaw usually entertains well, but this time the story is not as strong as his usual work.
**BOOK H** *Fall Down Easy* is Lawrence Gough's best book in a while. It tells the story of Canadian police searching for a clever bank robber who targets female bank tellers. The story builds tension slowly and shows the smart but troubled robber, making it much better than an average detective novel."
CAE_57,C1,"I might be too old for this, but here I go! At 34, Tim Pozzi has left a good job to go backpacking. He thinks about why he and others his age have decided to take this big step. This summer, he quit his job and decided to rent out his flat to travel in South East Asia for a year. You might think he is lucky, but he feels nervous. He has traveled before, spending two years backpacking in North and South America after university. When he came back, he wanted to travel again, but then he fell in love, started a career, bought a flat, and got used to earning a salary. Over time, he realized he was giving up his own happiness for his job. When he quit, it felt like he was taking control of his life again. 
Many of his friends are now married with children. They wouldn’t want to change places with him, but they envy his freedom. He is no longer in a relationship and doesn’t have big career goals. He feels he should make the most of his freedom, especially for his friends. But he is nervous. First, he has to make all the arrangements. He worries about having someone else live in his home and how to organize the rental. He also needs to decide where to go. He tends to procrastinate and is already behind schedule. He thought about enjoying the summer in England and waiting for the football season to start.
Letting go of emotional ties is hard. He wonders if he can still handle backpacking. Will he be able to live a simpler life? Will he feel out of place among younger backpackers? He has found that more people in their late twenties and thirties in Britain want to leave their current lives and travel. Jennifer Cox from Lonely Planet says that many people who always said, ""I wish I had that chance,"" are now realizing they can have it anytime if they are brave and organized.
For Danny, a 30-year-old accountant, and his girlfriend Tammy, a 28-year-old teacher, this trip is a chance to have fun before settling down. They bought a round-the-world ticket for a year. Danny says he is ready to give up job security for this trip. He knows he might return to the same job position, but he believes it is a risk worth taking. When he left his office, he threw his calculator into the river as a sign of defiance!
For Matt, who just left the Army, traveling for a year was a time of change. He needed to break away from the strict way of doing things in the military to live better as a civilian. There are many reasons for people my age to travel, but some common reasons exist. Angela Baron from the Institute of Personnel Development says that more people are working on short-term contracts, so if a contract ends, they have nothing to lose. Some big companies even allow career breaks, knowing that trained employees will return instead of going to competitors.
Dan Hiscocks, managing director of Travellerseye, says that many people in their thirties are reevaluating their lives. If you are not happy with your job, it is no longer just about sticking with it. People now know that opportunities exist and that a job is not for life. Traveling gives a chance to think about life. 
Is wanting to travel just a sign that my generation cannot accept adulthood? Jennifer Cox does not think so. She believes it shows a better-educated and more stable society, where people care more about living a balanced life than just paying bills. We are taking time to ask ourselves, ""Is this what I want?"" Ben, a 32-year-old picture researcher going to Central America for a year, feels he is not running away but running towards something he wants. However, he is nervous about leaving his comfortable routine, like going to the office every day and chatting with colleagues.
I share Ben's worries about leaving a stable life. I might not be going on this journey if I hadn’t found my boss so difficult to work with. Jennifer Cox points out that there is often a reason, like a breakup or losing a job, that pushes people to travel. It took a little push for me to start, but now I feel excited about the next 12 months. No matter what happens, I will be happy that I took this chance. I believe many of us older backpackers feel the same way."
CAE_42,C1,"**Plugging in the Home**
Georgina McGuiness took a long break from her job in journalism and felt lost with all the new technology. She shares how she changed her home into a good place to work.
The Christmas before last, I turned 37 and realized I needed to restart my journalism career. I felt like my skills were old-fashioned, stuck in the 1980s when typewriters were common. I saw job ads asking for experience with desktop publishing, which I didn’t have. I thought it would be easier to host a seminar on nuclear physics than to use a computer for layout. I was not good with technology; even calculators confused me, and I didn’t know how to use the timer on the video.
I knew I had to change quickly. I thought leaving home before my kids would be hard, but then I entered a competition in a local newspaper. To my surprise, my family won a computer package! We received a laptop for my husband and a personal computer for the family. We jumped into this new world of the Internet and started chatting with people from around the globe. The kids stopped watching TV, and I set up a small office in the kitchen with a phone, a fax machine, a CD-ROM, and a modem to connect to the Internet. I had everything I needed to work from home while still taking the kids to school.
The children were already good with computers from school, but I was nervous. I thought I would lose my work if I pressed the wrong button. I was wrong! I learned the basic skills I needed, and it was easier than I thought. With practice, I got better every day. I started freelancing for a magazine, writing about two articles a month, and I felt proud to balance work and family life.
How has the computer helped me? I used to work at a messy desk and often lost important papers. Now, the computer helps me stay organized. I can keep track of money with spreadsheets and use ready-made invoices and letterheads, which saves me time. As a journalist, being online allows me to research stories, ask questions in forums, and talk about working from home with people worldwide.
However, working from home has its downsides. I can feel lonely without face-to-face contact. There are also distractions, like household chores, and sometimes my kids argue over who gets to use the computer. But many people in my neighborhood are buying computers, not just for learning and fun, but also for work. 
A report called ""PC Usage in UK Homes"" describes the typical home computer user today: they are around 38 years old and well-educated. Most own a personal computer, and many have a CD-ROM, laser printer, and modem. I feel like I am doing well with technology. Who knows, maybe one day I will be emailing a column to a newspaper in Melbourne or even publishing my own magazine from home. The possibilities seem endless!"
CAE_59,C1,"**The Tartan Museum**
The Tartan Museum is Scotland's national museum, located in Edinburgh. The building is modern and looks like a cheese wedge, which is very different from the historic city around it. Sally Varlow visited the museum before it opened to see what it was like inside.
You can easily see the museum from the street. It has a big yellow tower and unique buildings with a garden hanging from the roof. Last winter, people had mixed feelings about the building. Some called it a ""masterpiece"" or ""stunning,"" while others were not so sure.
Now, as the museum is almost ready to open, people are wondering if the exhibitions will be interesting. The museum tells the story of Scotland through many different objects. It has a timeline to help visitors understand the history, but it does not force them to follow a strict order. The museum also shows important items, like jewels from Mary Queen of Scots, without being too proud of them.
Dr. David Clarke, who is in charge of the exhibitions, wants visitors to enjoy their experience. He believes the museum should be for everyone, not just experts. He does not want to use too much imagination in the displays because he thinks it is important to show the truth about the past.
Visitors will see real objects and learn about their stories through information panels and multimedia displays. However, it is still unclear if this will be enough to keep people interested. 
When you enter the museum, you will notice the different gallery spaces. They connect to each other and have pale walls that look like stone. Natural light comes in through special windows, making it a pleasant place to explore.
There is also a Discovery Centre for children, created by a group of kids aged 9 to 12 from all over Scotland. They wanted to have fun activities, and although they could not have rides through the displays, they got a hands-on area for kids.
On the top floor, there is a gallery that changes every three years. It shows objects chosen by Scottish people that have had a big impact on life in Scotland in the 20th century. Some items suggested include an electric guitar and a television. While this idea is fun, it may not address more serious topics.
Dr. Clarke believes that objects can tell stories about the past better than anything else. The museum's modern design works well inside, but some people question if it is in the right place."
CAE_54,C1,"**The Future of Newspapers**
The change from print newspapers to online news is happening slowly. The word ""transition"" means moving from one place to another in a calm way. However, the change for newspapers to go online is not easy and can be uncomfortable. Many people believe that this change will happen eventually because print newspaper sales are going down, while visits to their websites are increasing.
For example, newspapers like The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian have seen their print sales drop by 8% to 10% each year, but their websites are getting more visitors. This is true, but there are some things that do not fit this picture. A recent survey showed that worldwide newspaper circulation actually increased by 1.1% last year, reaching 512 million copies a day. While sales in Western countries have fallen, Asia has seen a rise in sales. 
Magazines about news and current events have also grown by 5.4%. So, while some areas of print are struggling, many are still doing well. The same is true for books. E-readers like Kindle are very popular, with sales increasing a lot this year. However, when bookstores looked at the sales of physical books, they found that sales were only down by 0.4%.
Many people think that young people are not reading newspapers anymore, but this is not completely true. The latest survey shows that nearly 5 million people aged 15 to 35 still read the main national newspapers. Different countries have different trends. In Britain, print sales have dropped by 10.8%, but in Germany, the decline is only 7%, and in France, it is just 3.1%.
In the past, experts thought that online advertising would help newspapers succeed online. But now, digital advertising on newspaper websites is actually going down. Many US newspapers have started charging for online access. The best way to attract paying readers seems to be offering both print and digital access together. This means that print newspapers are still important for selling online subscriptions. 
However, running both a website and a print edition is difficult and expensive for newspaper companies. Print newspapers still have a strong presence, but it is harder to get noticed online."
CAE_32,C1,"**Photographing People**
People are the most interesting subjects to photograph. A picture with a person is usually more engaging than one without. However, taking good photos of people can be challenging. Photographers need to pay attention to actions, gestures, and expressions. Sometimes, just having a camera can change how people act.
**A. Grouping People**  
When taking group photos, avoid straight lines. Ask people to stand at different angles and distances. You can also have some people sit or kneel in front so that all faces are visible.
**B. Posing for Pictures**  
People often feel stiff in front of a camera. Help them relax by suggesting comfortable positions, like folding their hands or putting them in their pockets.
**C. The Right Approach**  
Don’t pretend you are not taking a picture when it’s obvious. This can make people feel tense. Most people will agree to have their picture taken, but they might feel self-conscious. You may need to guide them to look more natural.
**D. Eye Contact**  
A picture looks better if the subject is looking at the camera. Ask them to look into the lens, but they don’t have to smile. If they seem distracted, remind them just before you take the photo. You can also say something funny to get a genuine reaction.
**E. Candid Concentration**  
Instead of looking directly at the camera, the subject can focus on something else in the picture. This can make the photo feel more natural, as if you are observing them without them noticing.
**F. Expressions and Gestures**  
Expressions and gestures tell us a lot about a person. A laughing child can make viewers smile, while a sad face can create sympathy. Look for common expressions like smiles, frowns, or gestures like thumbs-up.
**G. Situation Interest**  
The background of a photo can add interest. When using a background, make sure it doesn’t distract from the subject. A wide-angle lens can help make the subject stand out more.
**H. Interaction**  
Photos of people interacting, like talking or laughing together, can be very appealing. Look for moments of connection, like eye contact or a friendly touch.
**I. People and Places**  
Many photos of people are taken on trips. To show both the people and the place, use a wide-angle lens and step back to include the background. Make sure the people are close enough to be seen clearly.
**J. To Pose or Not to Pose?**  
Decide why you want to take the picture. If it’s to remember someone, a clear posed picture is good. However, family photos can be more fun if they capture real moments instead of stiff poses. Candid shots often bring back memories better than posed ones."
CAE_65,C1,"**Under Sarah's Spell**
Sarah Janson is a trompe-l'oeil artist. This means she creates paintings that trick the eye into seeing something that looks real. In this interview with Joanna Watt, we learn more about her.
Not many artists do not sign their work unless someone asks them to, but Sarah Janson is one of them. She believes that the work is more important than the artist. She says, ""It's not the artist who is important, but the work."" Sarah is very humble and almost makes it seem like her paintings create themselves. This makes the interview a bit difficult at first. She says, ""I just don't like to shout about myself,"" and she looks worried when asked if she can be photographed.
After a while, Sarah becomes more comfortable, and the interview turns into a fun and interesting conversation. She has been a trompe-l'oeil artist for sixteen years. Before that, she studied drawing at art school for two years, got a degree in graphic illustration, and worked at a publishing house. However, she was not happy with illustration and started working with a decorator named Jim Smart. He asked her to create one trompe-l'oeil painting, and that changed everything for her. She says, ""Suddenly my interest got channelled."" She decided to start her own business, not knowing exactly what would happen, but feeling it was the right choice.
Sarah's ability to observe details helped her become a good trompe-l'oeil artist. She often gets asked where people can learn this art, but she believes no one can teach it. ""Trompe-l'oeil is the school of life. It's all about observation,"" she explains. She is always learning and believes that if you think you have mastered something, you should stop.
Sarah is honest about her weaknesses. For example, she says, ""I can't paint bread; it always looks like grey concrete."" She also struggles with math. When she had a big project to paint a ceiling at Lulworth Castle, she got confused with the measurements. She thought, ""You're not Michelangelo. Who do you think you are?"" This self-doubt makes her feel distant from her talent. Sometimes she talks about herself in the third person, saying things like, ""When I finished that ceiling, I thought, 'Well, I didn't do it, she did.'""
Her trompe-l'oeil paintings are very special and stand out from others. Many people have hired her for important projects. Much of her work is inspired by buildings. For example, she created a trompe-l'oeil dining room based on a Venetian palace and a painting that makes it look like you can walk into two more rooms.
However, there is a challenge with trompe-l'oeil art. Once people understand the trick, they might lose interest. Sarah knows this and says, ""Trompe-l'oeil has to do two things. First, it must draw you in; it's got to trick you. Secondly, it has to hold you and engage your imagination."" She believes that the art should also be personal to the client. ""I love the interaction with clients; that is where the ideas are born,"" she says. Some clients have clear ideas, while others do not, so she listens carefully to understand their vision.
Many of her clients become friends because she spends a lot of time with them while working. Sarah appreciates her clients, saying, ""I am very grateful for the mad ones who have let me loose on their walls."" They are happy with her work, which is why she is always busy, even if she does not like to talk about her talent. ""I really don't like to shout about myself,"" she repeats. ""Like my work, I am very restrained. I don't want it to shout. You become bored with things that shout."" 
While she may not want to be in the spotlight, her work is truly remarkable and deserves more recognition."
CAE_61,C1,"**Emotional Intelligence - The Key to Success**
Daniel Goleman talks about the important ""people skills"" needed to succeed in our jobs.
A. The rules for work are changing. We are now judged not only by how smart we are or how well we were trained, but also by how we manage ourselves and our relationships with others. This new way of judging is used to decide who gets hired and who does not. It helps to show who is likely to be a top performer and who may not do as well. These new rules are important for our future job opportunities. They focus on social skills and personal qualities, like being proactive, understanding others, being flexible, and convincing people. These skills are part of what we call emotional intelligence.
B. In a time when job security is low, personal qualities are becoming more important at work. For many years, people have talked about these qualities using different names, like ""character"" or ""soft skills."" Now, we have a clearer understanding of these skills, which we call ""emotional intelligence."" This means being aware of and managing our own feelings and the feelings of others, and using these feelings to guide our actions. Emotional intelligence includes self-awareness, self-control, motivation, empathy, and good social skills. Some people think it just means being nice, but it can also mean being honest, even when it’s uncomfortable. It’s not about expressing all our feelings freely, but about managing them so we can work well together.
C. More companies are realizing that developing emotional intelligence is very important for good management. The more complicated a job is, the more emotional intelligence matters. If someone lacks these skills, it can affect their ability to use their knowledge and skills. Many people have succeeded despite having low emotional intelligence, but as work becomes more complex and requires teamwork, companies that encourage good relationships among employees have an advantage. In today’s work environment, where teamwork and customer service are key, emotional intelligence is essential for success in any job.
D. Unlike IQ, which does not change much, emotional intelligence can grow as we learn from our experiences. Studies show that most people become better at managing their emotions, motivating themselves, and understanding others over time. This growth in emotional intelligence is often called maturity. We can learn these skills and use them to help us in our careers, especially now when job stability is uncertain. Emotional intelligence is not a magic solution for companies, but if we ignore the human side of work, everything else may not work as well."
CAE_52,C1,"'Should the media make money from content they do not own? Digital cameras and camera phones have made it easier to take pictures of important news events. However, social media has changed how people share these photos. Many journalists now look at social networks for images when news happens quickly. Unfortunately, some reporters have used photos from users without asking for permission. There are rules that say images on social media can be used without permission in special cases or when there is strong public interest, but people still argue about whether this is right. Research shows that about one in ten people would take photos or videos of a news event, which means user-generated content (UGC) is important for the future of the media. To keep a good relationship with the public, the media must make sure that people are paid fairly for their work and that they always ask for permission.'"
CAE_28,C1,"**Ancient Chinese Medicine in the West**
Acupuncture is a practice that is over two thousand years old. It comes from traditional Chinese medicine, which also includes herbal medicine, massage, diet, and exercise. Acupuncture is used to treat many health problems, but it is especially known for helping with pain. Some doctors, midwives, and physiotherapists in the West use it regularly for pain relief.
**What is Traditional Chinese Medicine?**
Traditional Chinese medicine believes that good health happens when the energy of the mind, body, and spirit are balanced. This energy, called Qi (pronounced ""chee""), flows through the body along pathways known as meridians. There are twelve main meridians, each connected to an organ, and many smaller ones that carry Qi to every cell. If the flow of Qi is blocked or weak, a person may feel weak or become ill.
When you visit an acupuncturist, they will check where the Qi is unbalanced. They do this by feeling your pulse, looking at your tongue, and asking about your health, feelings, and habits like eating and sleeping. The acupuncturist uses very thin needles that are inserted into the skin. They may also use heat from burning herbs or apply pressure to certain points to help the flow of Qi.
**Acupuncture Points**
The points where needles are placed are connected to the meridians and may not be near the area that hurts. People often feel a mild ache or tingling when the needle is moved. This can be done by hand or with a machine. Acupuncturists believe this feeling means the needle has reached the Qi in the meridian. There are over three hundred acupuncture points on the main meridians, with many more used less often.
**Scientific Understanding**
Even though Western doctors do not fully accept traditional Chinese medicine, they agree that acupuncture can help with pain relief. They have found scientific reasons for how it works. For example, it may block pain signals from reaching the brain or release natural pain-relieving chemicals in the body.
**Types of Pain Treated**
Many people with long-term pain try acupuncture when other treatments do not work. It is often used for back pain, sports injuries, arthritis, headaches, and pain after surgery. Acupuncturists also claim it can help with menstrual pain, facial nerve pain, and pain in terminally ill patients.
**Modern Use of Acupuncture**
Although acupuncture has been used in China for thousands of years, using it instead of anesthesia during surgery started in the 1950s. This helped convince some doctors outside China that acupuncture is effective. Today, acupuncture is used in many surgeries in China, including tonsillectomies and heart surgery. Needles can be used alone, with electrical stimulation, or with medication. While some people feel little to no pain, experiences can vary. Acupuncturists say that acupuncture does not have the side effects of regular anesthesia, and recovery is faster.
**Effectiveness of Acupuncture**
Like many alternative therapies, it is hard to study acupuncture in clinical trials. However, studies show that 50 to 80 percent of people find it helpful for chronic pain. Acupuncturists agree with this success rate. They know it does not work for everyone, and some people respond better than others. For long-term pain, it usually takes six to seven visits to feel significant relief, but some improvement can be felt after just two or three visits.
**A Different View of Pain**
Western and Chinese medicine see pain differently. Acupuncturists look at the whole person, not just the pain. They spend time diagnosing the problem and looking for weaknesses in the Qi. They also consider outside factors that may affect the pain, like weather conditions. This is different from how most doctors approach pain.
**Choosing an Acupuncturist**
Some medical professionals have training in traditional acupuncture, while others focus on scientific explanations. Many traditional acupuncturists believe that using traditional methods leads to better and longer-lasting results, but this is hard to measure in studies. It is important to choose a qualified acupuncturist, who should refer you to a doctor if needed."
CAE_35,C1,"P.D. James is a famous crime writer known for her clever and complex stories. Her full name is Phyllis Dorothy James, and she has a calm and confident presence. Many people think she could have been a headmistress at a girls' school if she had not become a writer. However, she is actually quite shy. She says that her main character, Adam Dalgliesh, is similar to her, imagining how she might have been if she were a man. Dalgliesh likes to solve crimes alone, just like P.D. James prefers to write in private. 
Although she is considered one of the best crime writers in Britain, she is modest about her success. Her 12 detective novels are popular around the world. She admires her friend Ruth Rendell and enjoys her psychological books written under the name Barbara Vine. P.D. James often reads books by women authors like Iris Murdoch and Anita Brookner, but she also appreciates male writers like Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh.
P.D. James found success later in life. She published her first crime novel, Cover Her Face, when she was 42 years old. She was born in Oxford and grew up in Cambridge. She met her husband there, who was a student. Life was not easy for her; her husband returned from World War II very ill, and she had to work long hours to support him and their two daughters, Clare and Jane. During this time, her husband's parents helped take care of the children.
While working for the National Health Service, she used her strong organizational skills. She also worked for 11 years at the Home Office, where she dealt with police and juvenile crime. While working in forensic science, she became used to seeing dead bodies, but she was not interested in death itself. Instead, she loved the challenge of writing crime stories. 
P.D. James did not want to write about her own difficult life experiences. She saw writing detective stories as a good way to learn how to be a serious novelist. She believed that even within the rules of a classic detective story, it was possible to write a meaningful novel about people. For her, writing detective stories is a way to create order from chaos, and solving a crime shows the value of life, even if that life is not perfect."
CAE_5,C1,"**The Pen is Mightier than the Psychoanalyst**
The study of handwriting to understand a person's character is becoming more popular. In some countries, if you apply for a job, you will likely be asked to provide a sample of your handwriting. This handwriting sample can help decide if you are suitable for the job. Handwriting analysis, also known as graphology, is considered a real science in many places. Researchers believe it can help show certain health problems, like heart disease and cancer, and can reveal emotional issues.
More companies are using handwriting analysis to help with job interviews. Many large companies now hire graphologists to look at the handwriting of job candidates. However, many doctors and mental health professionals are not sure about the value of graphology. Patricia Marne, a professional graphologist for over 20 years, thinks they should take it more seriously. She believes handwriting can show psychological traits and some medical conditions. She says, ""Handwriting can indicate social class and intelligence. It can also help decide if someone should focus on arts or sciences and show if they are honest or tricky.""
According to Ms. Marne, handwriting can help identify possible criminal behavior. She says, ""Criminals often have messy handwriting, which can show emotional problems. Many come from difficult backgrounds, and this can lead to childish handwriting."" She believes handwriting can show if someone is under a lot of stress or has violent tendencies. It can even help predict if someone might think about suicide.
Ms. Marne explains that heart and lung issues can also be seen in handwriting. ""You cannot make a diagnosis from just one sample, unless the writing is very shaky. But if the handwriting changes over time, it could mean something serious is happening."" A big emotional upset can also change a person's signature for a while.
She says handwriting can show other psychological traits too. For example, people whose letters connect in a strange way might be clever but not honest. Those who write mostly in capital letters may be hiding their true feelings. Light pressure in writing can mean someone is sensitive and lacks energy. If a person's handwriting is very different from standard writing, it can show confidence and creativity. Disconnected writing often means the person is a loner. Small signatures can show insecurity, while circles over the letter ""i"" can mean someone wants attention. Heavy crossing of the letter ""t"" can show intolerance.
Ms. Marne believes it takes six years of study to analyze handwriting well, along with understanding and intuition. She thinks more research is needed to make graphology a proper science. She believes it is more accurate than psychoanalysis because it can reveal a person's history and emotional struggles without asking them questions.
However, despite these interesting ideas, there is not much strong evidence to support them. Some psychiatrists are very critical of these claims. They argue that handwriting is influenced by education and the way writing is taught, and it does not have any other meaning."
CAE_41,C1,"**Is Your Office Working Well?**
Fresh air and good chairs are important for a happy and healthy workplace, according to a new survey. We visited four different offices to see how healthy and happy they are. We had three experts with us: a building health consultant, an ergonomist (who studies working conditions), and an occupational psychologist. Here are their opinions.
**Office A: Advertising Agency**
- **Building Health Consultant:** This office is very simple. It has no central heating or mechanical ventilation, and the windows open directly to the street. It is surprising that this space works, but the small team of seven people seems happy. They adjust to the weather by opening doors or using electric heaters, just like at home. This may be why they feel comfortable and do not have to deal with too many rules.
- **Ergonomist:** The furniture is mismatched and some pieces are not good for sitting. Many chairs are old and broken. However, the workers have a varied schedule, which helps them avoid tiredness and boredom.
- **Occupational Psychologist:** The staff enjoys the variety of work and the size of the office. It is small enough to know what others are doing but big enough to work alone. The office feels fun and creative.
**Office B: News Service**
- **Building Health Consultant:** This office is not very exciting, but it is comfortable. The air quality is good, partly because of a No Smoking policy.
- **Ergonomist:** The company has hired an ergonomist to help. The chairs and lighting are good, but the office feels impersonal with plain grey walls.
- **Occupational Psychologist:** The walls are mostly bare, except for a few planners and a poster. Most staff have worked there for over five years and get along well. The office could be better if desks were arranged to help share information.
**Office C: Bank**
- **Building Health Consultant:** This office gets mixed feelings from workers. It feels like being in a glass box. The air is not stale, even with smokers around.
- **Ergonomist:** The office is standard and not very inspiring. The desks are okay, but some chairs are not suitable for computer work. The setup is outdated.
- **Occupational Psychologist:** The staff supports each other and uses technology well. There are many awards on display, but the office feels a bit dull with dark colors.
**Office D: Newspaper**
- **Building Health Consultant:** This office has many problems. The air conditioning does not work well, and the space is messy. There is a lot of dust everywhere.
- **Ergonomist:** The furniture looks more like it belongs in a workshop than an office. Many chairs are old and not good for working at a desk.
- **Occupational Psychologist:** The office is dirty, with old chairs and carpets. It needs cleaning and better air conditioning. There were not many conversations when we visited; everyone seemed stressed. The company should encourage teamwork."
CAE_38,C1,"**Chewing Gum Culture**
Chewing gum is popular and people in America chew 12 million sticks every day. It is low in calories, with less than ten calories per stick, but it is considered food and must meet certain health standards.
Today, most chewing gum is made from synthetic materials, which include pine resins and softeners. These ingredients help keep the flavor and improve the texture. However, this was not always true. In ancient Greece, people chewed a gum-like resin from the mastic tree, which grows mainly in Greece and Turkey. Women in Greece used mastic gum to clean their teeth and freshen their breath.
American colonists learned to chew resin from spruce trees, following the example of Native Americans in New England. In the early 1800s, lumps of spruce resin were sold in the eastern United States, making it the first commercial chewing gum in the country.
Modern chewing gum started in the late 1860s when chicle was discovered. Chicle is a milky substance from the sapodilla tree found in Central America. Gum made from chicle was smoother and more enjoyable to chew, leading to the growth of a big industry. However, it has been hard to grow sapodilla trees in large amounts. As the demand for chewing gum increased, companies began to use synthetic alternatives.
Today, only a few chicle gatherers, called chicleros, still collect chicle. They have a tough and dangerous job, walking for miles in very humid conditions. They face dangers like poisonous snakes and insects. The chicleros climb trees to collect the sap, which they carry back to a camp where it is boiled and made into bricks. Life at the camp is difficult, with a boring diet mostly made of maize and local alcohol.
Even though their work is hard, chicleros worry about their jobs. Not long ago, the United States imported 7,000 tonnes of chicle each year from Central America. Last year, only 200 tonnes were collected in Mexico's Yucatan peninsula. As chewing gum sales have increased, manufacturers have turned to synthetic materials to save money and meet demand.
Gum companies also find creative ways to sell their products. They claim that chewing gum helps you relax, gives you energy, and reduces stress. During both world wars, soldiers were often given gum. One of the biggest claims is that chewing gum can help reduce tooth decay. When we eat, plaque acid forms, but chewing gum can increase saliva flow, which helps protect our teeth.
Research is ongoing to create new textures and flavors for gum. Glycerine and other vegetable oils are now used in the gum base. Most new flavors are artificial, but some still use natural ingredients. In America, a large area is dedicated to growing mint for the two most popular chewing gums in the world."

One of my favorite hotels is the Hermitage Hotel on New Zealand's South Island. I found it by chance while climbing. After climbing a glacier, I was surprised to find this hotel at the bottom. It is in a beautiful and wild area, high in the mountains. After a long climb, it was amazing to relax in luxury, with a man playing music on the piano.
C. **MAURITIUS - Paradis Hotel**  
The Paradis Hotel is located on a quiet peninsula in the south-west of Mauritius. The road to the hotel goes along the coast, past empty beaches where only fishermen are found. The hotel is large and offers many free water sports, but you can easily find peace on its nine kilometers of private beach. If you swim a little way out into the Indian Ocean, you can hardly see the hotel because of the palm trees. In the evening, when everyone has left, you can enjoy the quiet and beautiful sunset.
D. **ST LUCIA - Ladera Hotel**  
Ladera Hotel in St Lucia has a stunning view of the Caribbean Sea. It is quiet and located high up, at 1,000 feet. The open rooms look out between two mountains called the Pitons. The hotel has a colonial style, with wooden furniture and four-poster beds covered with light fabric.

Sue Brown is a hotel inspector. Christopher Middleton watched her during an inspection at the Globe Hotel. Just one minute into the inspection, things start to go wrong. The receptionist is busy talking on the phone and does not notice Sue and Christopher. Sue thinks this is very bad service. She has seen this problem many times in her 11 years as an inspector. 
The Globe Hotel has three red stars, which means it is one of the best hotels. But even before they enter, Sue feels something is wrong. The entrance is not welcoming, with an empty corridor leading to the hotel. 
When they finally reach the reception, the receptionist says they have no record of Sue's booking. There are 15 rooms in the hotel, but only three are occupied. The room they are shown is not good. It feels stuffy, and there is a big hole in the wall behind the wardrobe. 
Sue remembers when she started her job, people called her ""The Woman in Black,"" even though she never wore black. The next morning, after paying her bill, she tells the hotel manager, Robin Greaves, who looks scared when he sees her. He quickly apologizes for a bad smell in the lounge, saying there is a blocked drain. 
Sue suggests that the staff should not take guests to the lounge with the smell. Robin listens and takes notes. He has only been at the hotel for five months and seems unsure about Sue's advice. 
However, not everything is bad. Sue praises Emma, the assistant manager, and Trudy, the waitress, for their good service and knowledge about the hotel’s history. The dinner was also good enough to keep the hotel’s two-rosette food rating. Robin asks how they can get three rosettes, and Sue jokingly says they should not serve dessert that falls apart. 
Sue's job is to tell the truth about the hotel, even if it is hard. Sometimes, she gets complaints from people who are unhappy with her reports. She has to write a full report for the hotel after each inspection. The hotel pays to be included in the guide. 
The good news for Robin is that Sue will not recommend taking away the hotel’s red stars. The bad news is that another inspector will come back in two months to check if the problems have been fixed. Robin smiles but looks worried."
CAE_48,C1,"**Climbing the Seven Summits**
Doug Scott, a mountaineer, shares his experiences of climbing the highest mountains on each continent, known as the Seven Summits. He started this journey later in life and will tell us about each mountain in the order he climbed them.
**A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)**  
Doug and his climbing partner, Dougal Haston, were in a snow cave, 91 meters below the top of Mt. Everest. Dougal started talking about sleeping bags, which Doug found strange since it was just the two of them. He thought it was because they were low on oxygen. Doug began talking to his own feet because they were getting cold. He remembered other climbers who lost fingers and toes to frostbite. They were not just worried about surviving but also about how well they would survive. Over the next two days, Doug thought about their time on the mountain and felt confident climbing with Dougal. He focused on finding a good rhythm to reach the summit.
**B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)**  
This mountain is known to be very dangerous. In April 1976, Doug and Dougal arrived at the Kahiltna Glacier and spent four days carrying equipment and food to the base. After the first day, they realized how big their task was. They followed a route from 1967 but then chose a new route to the summit. They decided to climb with everything on their backs, which was a new way to climb this mountain. After three days, Doug's sleeping bag was wet, and they were both suffering. The air pressure made it feel like they were much higher than they actually were. Finally, they reached the summit and felt victorious.
**C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m)**  
In September 1976, Doug and his friend Paul Braithwaite flew to Nairobi to climb Mt. Kenya. However, they ended up climbing Kilimanjaro instead. They got lost in the jungles at the bottom of the mountain, which was serious because water was hard to find. On the second day, they found some arrows painted on trees that led them to a rock pool. They tried to climb a steep wall but had to turn back due to falling rocks and ice. Instead, they took a safer route to the summit.
**D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)**  
In January 1992, Doug and his wife, Sharu, arrived at Aconcagua. They met a guide named Phil who suggested they join his group to climb a less crowded route. After waiting for bad weather to pass, they started climbing. The Polish Glacier was icy and windy, so they decided to take a different path to the summit. They walked with many other climbers and camped outside a refuge before reaching the top. At base camp, they met a group planning to climb the Seven Summits, which made Doug think about doing the same.
**E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)**  
Doug learned that climbing Vinson Massif could be funded by guiding others. In November 1992, his team left Britain for the South Pole. During this time, the sun stays up all day and night. On December 7, they started their climb. Despite strong winds and very low temperatures, they all reached the summit in eight hours, although they could barely see because of the storm.
**F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)**  
In the summer of 1994, Doug's team gathered in St. Petersburg. They faced some challenges with their guide but eventually started climbing Elbrus. After a few days of getting used to the altitude, they took a cable car up to 3,900m and then walked to a refuge. Two days later, they faced strong winds while climbing. They thought they reached the summit but found out there was still more to climb. They returned to the refuge and then descended the volcano.
**G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)**  
On their trip to Carstensz, Doug and his team wanted to create a new climbing route and spend time with the local Dani people. They were warned about possible dangers but decided to continue. On May 12, they started climbing. The weather got better, and they reached the summit by 11 am. Doug received a warm welcome for completing his seventh summit. Mission accomplished!"

The Merrion Hotel is a new five-star hotel in Dublin. It was created by changing four large old houses and took almost two years to complete. The hotel uses the latest technology to help both guests and staff.
General Manager Peter MacCann wants his staff to know the guests' names. For more details about what guests like, he uses a computer system. This system helps the hotel give special service to returning guests. It cost £250,000 to set up, but MacCann believes it will be worth it over time. He is happy with how well it works. For example, if a guest asks for certain music during their first stay, those same CDs will be ready for them when they come back.
Many hotel guests often complain about room temperature. The Merrion has a high-tech system that lets guests change the temperature in their rooms. They can adjust it by three degrees around the normal 18°C. The front desk can also change the temperature anywhere from 14°C to 25°C.
Business guests will find the technology in their rooms very useful. MacCann thinks that about 65% of the hotel’s business will come from this group. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that also works as a photocopier and printer, and a video-conferencing system. The hotel has prepared for future technology changes by adding extra cables. They rent televisions so they can easily replace them with newer models. DVD recorders can also be updated when needed.
Even with all this technology, MacCann wants guests to feel comfortable, not overwhelmed. The hotel has 145 large and well-furnished bedrooms that are cozy and inviting. There is also a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a lovely garden.
The food at the hotel is very important. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, who has two Michelin stars, has moved his restaurant to the Merrion. This change allows him to create a modern kitchen and improve parking for guests. For the hotel, having a famous restaurant means they can offer great food without taking financial risks. With good technology and a skilled staff, the Merrion Hotel is likely to be very successful."

Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. The large garden around her house gives her many ideas for her art. The garden is full of her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wildly and spread all over the garden. There is a beautiful mix of colors and shapes in the two long flower beds along the path that goes through the garden from east to west. This beauty is partly because of the previous owners who loved gardening and left plants that Susan likes. She also kept the gardener, Danny. Susan says, ""In fact, it was really his garden. We got along very well. At first, he would say, 'Oh, it's not worth it' for some of the things I wanted to add, but when I said I wanted to paint them, he understood what I meant.""
Susan likes to focus on painting individual plants instead of the whole garden. Sometimes she paints a group of plants, but usually, she picks one flower and takes it to her studio. She explains, ""I don't set everything up at once. I take one flower out and paint it, which might take a few days. Then I bring in another one and build the painting that way. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.""
Her busiest time is in spring and early summer when the tulips bloom, followed by the poppies. She says, ""They all come out together, and you're so busy."" But she also finds beauty in how flowers change as they wilt. For example, with tulips, she says, ""You bring them in and put them in water, then leave them for a day, and they change shape. They open up and look amazing. At first, you think they are boring, but they change all the time.""
Susan has always loved plants. She studied botany in school and collected wildflowers from the countryside. She didn't like garden flowers back then because they looked fake to her. She was fascinated by how wildflowers could grow in difficult places, like cracks in rocks or on cliffs.
Today, her garden has many plants from faraway places, but they look at home in her garden. She has a relaxed attitude towards her garden, like a caring aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don’t break anything. With two art exhibitions coming up and plenty of flowers to paint, she has found it hard to work in the garden lately.

Many trees in the Brackham area fell during the strong storms in March. The town lost two big lime trees from the old market square. This change made the town center look very different, which upset some of the older residents. Normally, Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, the head of the local police, would have been annoyed too. But during the storm, when the wind knocked down the walnut tree in his garden, he was too sick to care. 
Pelham, a big and healthy man, was seriously ill for the first time in his life with bronchitis. When he first felt pain in his head and tightness in his chest, his wife, Molly, wanted him to see a doctor. He thought the police needed him too much, so he ignored her and tried to keep working. This made him forget things and made him short-tempered. Eventually, his colleague, Sergeant Lloyd, took him to the doctor because he was too weak to argue. 
After seeing the doctor, he got medicine and went home to Molly, who sent him straight to bed. On Thursday morning, when Molly told him the walnut tree had fallen, he couldn’t believe it. Later that evening, he asked if the house was damaged and felt relieved when she said it was not. He then covered his head with the sheets. 
On Saturday, after taking his medicine, he felt better and got up. He was shocked to see that the loss of the walnut tree had changed the living room. The Pelhams’ big house had a large garden, which they loved. The garden made them feel private. Before, the view from the living room included the beautiful walnut tree, which created nice light and shadow in the room. This hid the old furniture they had brought from their last house. 
Now, without the tree, the room was too bright, and the old furniture looked worn out. The view from the window was not nice either. The tall house next door, which was hidden by the tree, was now visible. It had ugly purple bricks and many windows that seemed to watch the Pelhams. 
“Doesn’t it look terrible?” Pelham said weakly to his wife. But Molly, standing in the doorway, sounded happy instead of upset. “I’ve been saying this since we moved here. We need to buy a new sofa, no matter the cost.”"
FCE_16,B2,"**Living in the Valley**
We had been living in our valley for sixteen months when we first noticed the dangers in the hills around us. It was a year when storms came early, even before November ended. Until then, we felt safe in our valley, protected by the hills. But soon, snow began to fall. Within a day, it was about 15 centimeters deep. The snow almost blocked our lane and made the path by the stream slippery and dangerous. In the hills, the snow was much deeper and stayed longer. The wind was very strong up there. In our valley, we only felt some strong gusts of wind; the trees swayed, but their branches stayed strong. Still, we knew we had to be careful.
The snow and wind were annoying, but they did not really worry us. What worried us most was the river, the Ryburn, which usually flowed gently. We remembered that many years ago, the flow of water from the hills was controlled by dams. Soon, the snow started to melt. Day after day, we saw dark clouds gather over the hills to the west. These clouds looked dangerous and warned us of what was coming. We had watched the sky enough; now we focused on the river, which was getting fuller and wilder every day. The melting snow was mixed with rain from the clouds, and the reservoir in the hills was filling up quickly.
Then it happened - for the first time in years, the reservoir overflowed. It looked like Niagara Falls as the water rushed over the dam and into the stream below. The river became wild as the water poured down towards us. Just a few meters from our cottage, the stream was much deeper than we had ever seen, rushing angrily at its banks. For three days, we hoped it would stay below its edge. Luckily, our hopes were answered as the dam held, and the water began to go down.
In the past, before the dam was built, the river had flooded nearby villages many times. Now, the dam controls the river's flow, and usually, everything is fine. The water from the hills, caused by snow and heavy rain, stays behind the dam, with only a little overflow sometimes. Because of this protection, we can enjoy the big clouds over the valley and feel excited by the river's power. Thanks to the dam, we feel our home in the valley is safe and secure."
FCE_21,B2,"Film critic Mark Adams reflects on his ten years of work for a newspaper called The Front Page. Writing articles about films for this newspaper was his first real job. Before that, he wrote reviews for novels in other newspapers, films for a magazine, and did some work for the radio. He met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, who also worked in radio and television. Tom hired him, but he was not a journalist, so he did not choose his staff carefully.
Tom wanted a team of critics to cover different art forms like books, TV, theatre, film, and radio. They would have a weekly lunch to discuss what to write about, and there would be guests to make it fun. At that time, it felt like a dream to be part of a new newspaper. Mark thought it was surprising that a new paper could start in a busy market. He even felt like a millionaire was pretending to hire him because he lacked confidence. The first time he saw someone reading the newspaper on the London Underground with his review, he felt very shy.
Tom's idea for a team of critics did not work out as planned. They did not meet as a group, so they communicated by phone. It turned out that people preferred to have one reviewer for each subject, so Mark decided to focus on films. Without Tom's help, they would not have created the current system where Mark writes a long weekly article about one film. He enjoys this way of working. He would not like the usual role of a film critic, which means watching every new film. That routine would make him bored quickly. He would not want to sit in a screening room thinking, ""What terrible film do I have to watch now?""
Mark wonders what his role is in the public eye. He thinks people choose films based on stars, advertising, or the director. People often stick to what they like, so someone who dislikes westerns is unlikely to watch one just because of a review. If a film review is not a guide for consumers, what is it? Mark does not feel he must be ""right"" about a movie. He does not believe there should be a set number of ""great"" or ""bad"" films each year. His job is to present an argument. He does not see himself as a judge, and he does not want to be one."
FCE_46,B2,"**Why would a schoolgirl want to swim 1500m, cycle 40km, and then run 10km? Because ""it's fun.""**
**Teenager with a passion for endurance sports**
**WANTED:** A sports-loving training partner for a triathlete, preferably female. This is a chance to work with a potential Olympic champion. You should really enjoy distance running (regular 15km sessions), distance swimming (training in cold rivers is a plus), and distance cycling (enjoying 100km rides is helpful). You must be able to do all three activities without resting.
The triathlon is becoming one of the most popular Olympic sports. It attracts large crowds who are amazed (and sometimes shocked) by athletes who swim 1500m, cycle 40km, and then run 10km without stopping. It looks tough, but what makes these triathletes push their bodies so hard? And why would a talented 17-year-old, who does well in school, give up so much for this challenging sport?
Melanie Sears, a young triathlete, has not yet learned the usual phrases about personal satisfaction and mental challenges that many athletes use when asked why they compete. She explains, ""You swim 1500m, then run out of the water and jump on your bike, still wet. Of course, then you get cold. After the 40km bike ride, you have to run 10km, which is hard when you are tired. But it's really fun, and it's all worth it in the end.""
Melanie entered her first triathlon when she was 14. ""I won the junior section, but I was the only junior there. It felt so easy that I waved at my friends while I was racing."" Feeling confident, she entered the National Championships. Although she had the second fastest swim and the fastest run, she did not do well overall. ""I was following a man, and suddenly we ended up at the sea. We realized we had gone the wrong way. I ended up cycling 20 kilometers too far. I cried all the way through the run."" But she did not give up and is determined to keep trying. ""Sometimes I wish I could stop because then the pain would end, but I am afraid that if I stop just once, I would want to stop again.""
Her determination impresses Steve Trew, the sport's coaching director. ""I tested her fitness,"" he says, ""and she worked so hard on the running machine that it finally threw her off into a wall. She gave it her all, but while most people stop when they can't go further, she just kept going.""
Melanie was the top junior in this year's European Triathlon Championships, finishing 13th. ""I was almost as good as the top three in swimming and running, but I was much slower at cycling. That's why I'm working hard to improve."" She is trying to convince her parents, who will pay £1,300 for her trip to New Zealand for this year's World Championships, to buy a £2,000 bike (it's a special deal with £1,000 off) so she can compete in national 25 km and 100 km races later this year.
But there is a cost. Her tough training has made her a bit of a loner. ""I don't have a social life,"" she says. ""I'm not really into parties. After two hours of hard swimming on Friday nights, I just want to sleep. But I do call and write to the other girls on my team."" What do they talk about? Boys? Clothes? ""No, we talk about our times in races.""
Where will all this focus lead? Melanie has tried other events, like the triathlon ""sprint,"" where you only swim 750m, cycle 20km, and run 5km. She wants to enter even tougher events than the triathlon. ""The big problem is, I have no one my age to train with,"" she says. Funny, isn't it?"
FCE_70,B2,"**The Collectors**
Amanda Roy talks about collecting and why many people enjoy this hobby. Many adults, about one in three, like to collect things. Collecting can be exciting and fun. But if you want to collect something, make sure you really love it.
People have always liked to collect items. Long ago, early humans collected pebbles and wore them as necklaces. They liked the shapes and colors of the pebbles. This was their first way of gathering objects for personal reasons. Today, children still collect stones and seashells because they are beautiful.
I have been collecting things all my life. I have collected flowers like tulips, pottery, and paintings. My first collection was stones from my parents' garden. When I was six, I went to a school in a cold, windy place in England. When my parents visited, they took me to a local museum. I loved looking at the objects collected by people in the past. 
Many adults also enjoy collecting. Some people think that collecting is the only part of their lives where they feel in control. For me, it is just a fun activity. One famous collector was the Duc de Berry in France. He had a ""room of wonders"" with many interesting items, like cups made from coconut shells and pieces of china. Another collector, Catherine the Great of Russia, had over 4,000 paintings. 
You don’t need to be rich to start a collection. I have collected many different things, like tulip bulbs and china cups. I remember when I convinced another collector to sell me a special tulip. I planted it and took care of it, but one year it disappeared – stolen by another collector. 
I once collected 350 American rag dolls. I searched all over the USA to find different designs. Sadly, my collection was lost when my house caught fire. The next morning, I saw the remains of my furniture and my collection. I was very sad about both.
I find it interesting how collections change hands. For example, a silver spoon that belonged to a king or a poet can be very valuable. As certain items become popular among collectors, their prices go up. Toys from the 1950s are now worth a lot, especially if you still have the original boxes. Unfortunately, I threw away both the boxes and the toys!"
FCE_3,B2,"**My Line of Work**
Four people talk about their jobs.
**Lisa - Exhibition Programmes Organiser, Science Museum**  
I organize temporary exhibitions. This means I plan and design the exhibition and promote it. I read about the exhibition topic and talk to important people to find out the main ideas and goals. I decide what objects and pictures to show. I also make sure the public understands the exhibition by planning interactive displays, workshops, and theatre. I work with engineers and electricians to ensure the display is safe for visitors. Before the exhibition opens, I help create brochures and leaflets to inform people about it.
**Janet - Teacher of London Taxi Drivers**  
When I arrive at 7:30 a.m., I first check the accounts. Then, I see what new maps and documents we need for the taxi-driver test. By midday, about 50 students are in class, learning how to make the journeys. They find the best routes, using the correct one-way streets and turns. I help when there are disagreements, like whether a right turn is allowed at a junction. When they are close to the test, I give them a simple route but tell them they must take a different one because the road is closed. This helps them think of other options.
**Sarah - Marine Conservationist**  
I live by the coast and work from home. I answer phone calls, create educational materials, and set up training courses. Sometimes, I go to our main office, but I mostly work on the coast. I collaborate with schools and study centers and run courses for coastal managers. I take them out to sea in a boat to help them understand the life in the ocean. This often changes their views because it is very different from looking at a computer screen. I am lucky because conservation is my hobby, so I enjoy my job. However, I work for a charity, so I always need to find more money, which makes it hard to do everything I want.
**Chris - Map and Atlas Publisher**  
My job is quite varied. I make sure our publishing program meets market needs and that we have about 300 books in stock. We have high standards for information and content. We receive many letters from readers about things like international boundaries, and I must respond carefully. I discuss future projects and current sales with my co-publishers. I work with a great team, which makes the job enjoyable. However, like many jobs, there is too much administration, which leaves less time for more interesting tasks like product development and design."

Every June, we went to Ireland. Since the four of us started going on holidays together, we spent the first two weeks of the month at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. It is a big house by the sea, not far from the village of Ardbeag. The English couple, the Malseeds, who own the house, have made some changes to it, but they did it carefully. Strafe found Glencorn for us. He saw an advertisement when the Malseeds were still advertising. One evening, he said, ""How about this?"" and read the details. 
The summer before, we went to a hotel that friends recommended, but it was not good because the food was terrible. The four of us have been playing cards together for a long time: Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia, and me. They call me Milly, but my real name is Dorothy Milson. Dekko got his nickname at school; Dekko Deacon sounds nice, I guess. He and Strafe were in school together, which is why we call Strafe by his last name, like the teachers did. We are all about the same age and live close to the town where the Malseeds lived before moving to Ireland. We think it is a funny coincidence.
""How very nice,"" Mrs. Malseed said, smiling to welcome us again this year. She seems to know when guests are coming because she is usually waiting in the large hall that always smells of flowers. ""Arthur, take the luggage up,"" she told the old porter. She called our rooms by flower names: Rose, Tulip, Lily, and Geranium. Instead of numbers, Mrs. Malseed painted flowers on the doors. In winter, when not many people come to Glencorn Lodge, she takes care of little details like that, while her husband does repairs and redecorating.
""Well, well, well,"" Mr. Malseed said as he came into the hall from the kitchen. ""A hundred thousand welcomes,"" he greeted us in the Irish way. He was smiling, and his dark brown eyes sparkled, making us feel special, not just another group of hotel guests. Everyone smiled, and I could tell the others felt that our holiday had really started. Nothing had changed at Glencorn; everything was good.
Kitty from the dining room came out to greet us. ""You look younger every year, all four of you,"" she said, making everyone laugh again. Arthur led us to our rooms, carrying as much luggage as he could and going back for the rest. After dinner, we played cards for a while, but we didn’t play for too long because we were still tired from the journey. 
In the lounge, there was a man alone and a French couple. There were other people at dinner because Glencorn Lodge is always full in June. From our table by the window, we could see some guests walking on the lawns and others going down the cliff path to the beach. In the morning, we would do the same: walk along the sand to Ardbeag and have coffee at the hotel there, then return in time for lunch. In the afternoon, we would drive somewhere. I knew this would happen because over the years, we had developed this routine. Since we first came here, we had all fallen in love with the beautiful landscape."

Sarah Sutherland-Pilch is a chalet girl in Val d'Isere, France. She is 24 years old and comes from West Sussex. This is her second year in this job, where she cooks and cleans for visitors who come to ski and stay in wooden houses called chalets. Sarah studied French and History of Art at Oxford Brookes University and graduated last summer. She sees being a chalet girl as a fun way to spend a year or two before starting a more serious job. She enjoys meeting interesting people every week.
Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to work. The chalet can host up to 18 guests each week. She has her own breakfast before making breakfast for the guests, which includes porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants. After breakfast, she cleans up and either prepares afternoon tea or cleans the rooms, which she thinks is the worst part of her job. By 11 a.m., she is ready to ski. On good days, she can ski until 4:30 p.m.
After skiing, Sarah returns to the chalet to prepare dinner. She takes a shower first but does not sleep because it would make her feel bad. Dinner is served at 8 p.m., and coffee is ready by 10 p.m. After dinner, she cleans the kitchen because she dislikes coming back to a messy place in the morning. Sometimes she talks with the guests, but other times they prefer to be alone. She enjoys good guests who make her week fun, but some weeks are not as good.
Sarah lives in a chalet with her friends, and they usually go out around 11 p.m. They often start at a place called Bananas, then go to G Jay's, and maybe end the night at Dick's T-Bar. However, she does not stay out too late on Saturday because Sunday is her busiest day. She calls it a ""frightful day"" because she has to wake up early to cook breakfast for guests leaving at 7 a.m.
After the guests leave, Sarah cleans quickly. She clears the breakfast, strips the beds, and gets everything ready for the new guests. If she has not done the shopping on Saturday, she does it now. By around 3 p.m., after cleaning, she prepares tea for the new guests who arrive around 4:30 p.m. Sometimes the new guests are confused and have many questions.
Between tea and dinner, Sarah helps guests who need ski boots or skis and then gets a ride back to the chalet. Soon, it is time for dinner again, and sometimes she has a drink afterward, but if she is too tired, she goes to bed early."
FCE_27,B2,"Miss Rita Cohen was a small girl with pale skin. She looked much younger than Seymour's daughter, Marie, but she said she was six years older. One day, she visited Seymour's factory. She wore overalls and big shoes, and her curly hair framed her pretty face. Seymour found it hard to believe that she was studying at the University of Pennsylvania and doing research on the leather industry in New Jersey for her Master's degree.
A few times a year, someone would contact Seymour to ask if they could visit his factory. Sometimes, he would help students by answering their questions over the phone or giving them a short tour if they seemed serious. Rita was very small, almost like the children from Marie's third-grade class, who had visited the factory years ago to see how gloves were made. Seymour remembered how Marie loved to watch the workers shape and press the gloves using hot brass hands, which she called ""pancake hands.""
Rita asked Seymour, ""How many pieces come in a shipment?"" He replied, ""Between twenty and twenty-five thousand."" She took notes and asked, ""Do they come directly to your shipping department?"" Seymour explained, ""They go to the tannery first. We buy the material, and they prepare it for us. My grandfather, father, and I all worked in the tannery here in town. Have you ever been inside a tannery?"" Rita said, ""Not yet."" Seymour encouraged her to visit a tannery to learn more about leather. He offered to help set it up for her.
He told her that tanning is an old industry, with evidence of it found in Turkey from six thousand years ago. The first clothing was made from animal skins that were tanned by smoking. Seymour said, ""My father knows a lot about leather. If you talk to him about gloves, he could go on for two days. Glovemen really love their work.""
Seymour then asked Rita if she had ever seen anything being made. She replied, ""Not really, but I saw my mother make a cake when I was a child."" This made Seymour laugh. He thought Rita was eager to learn and reminded him of Marie, who was much taller than Rita but had the same bright spirit.
Seymour said, ""Let's do something fun. We will show you the whole process of making gloves. What size do you wear?"""

As a personal assistant to a pop star, she has to travel around the world quickly. Raquel loves her job and gets along well with her boss, but she has one small problem: she does not like flying. ""On a nine-hour flight to California, I usually take sleeping pills to help me relax,"" she says. Her worst experience was flying on Concorde because it felt very closed in with small windows. When she is not traveling, she works in offices in Manchester and London. She does some boring tasks like organizing schedules, attending meetings, and making travel plans. Raquel did not apply for this job. She met the manager of a pop group by chance and took a secretarial course in the evenings. Five years later, she was lucky when her boss needed a personal assistant.
**B. David Brown**  
David Brown has worked as an accountant and a golf caddy, which means he carries a golfer's bags. He prefers being a caddy because he loves golf. However, there are some downsides. He earns a small flat fee plus a percentage of the winnings, which usually totals between £25,000 and £35,000, but much of that goes to travel and hotels. He started caddying for golfer Greg Norman when he was 31. ""You are not just carrying bags. You give advice and try to understand the course,"" he explains.

""If people can afford it, that's their choice,"" he says. ""I would rather spend £120 on a meal I will remember than buy a microwave."" His friend, who was an editor, offered him a food column because Martin is a good cook. At that time, he was working in advertising and it helped him earn extra money. When he was 42, another newspaper offered him a full-time job. ""It meant I would earn 50% less money, but it was a chance to turn my passion into a job,"" he says. He still cooks at home and tries to stay fit by cycling to the nearest subway station.

""It's not easy; I have to work hard on them,"" he says. He usually writes in the mornings but does not wake up very early. After lunch, he spends a couple of hours typing what he wrote in the morning. He uses an old typewriter instead of a laptop.

FCE_66,B2,"In the lumberyard by the lake, there was an old two-story brick building. Around it, there were big piles of soft sawdust. That afternoon, Michael and his friends were bored, so they climbed up to the roof of the building. They sat with their legs hanging over the edge, looking at the lake. Suddenly, Michael said, ""I dare you to jump down."" Without thinking, he jumped off the roof and landed in the sawdust, rolling around and laughing. ""I dare you all!"" he shouted. ""You're all cowards!"" 
His friends looked scared but eventually jumped down one by one, smiling with relief. They lay on the sawdust, telling jokes until one of them said, ""Let's go back up and jump again."" They were not very excited, but they climbed back to the roof and started jumping off. Soon, only Michael was left. His friends called up to him, ""Come on, Mike! What's wrong?"" 
Michael wanted to jump down too, but he hesitated. He felt nervous and wondered why it seemed like a long drop this time. His friends thought he was just joking, but then they saw him clenching his fists. He tried to count to ten and jump, but he couldn't. They started laughing at him because they were tired of waiting. ""Come on, you're a coward! Do you think we're going to sit here all night?"" they shouted. When he still didn't move, they began to walk away, still teasing him. 
Michael felt alone and stared at the ground for a long time. He stayed on the roof while the sun set over the lake. He was nervous and sweaty. Finally, he closed his eyes and jumped down into the sawdust. He lay there for a long time, and the yard was quiet because the workers had gone home. He wondered why he had been unable to jump earlier. 
When he got up, he walked home feeling ashamed and wanting to avoid everyone. He was late for dinner, and his stepmother said, ""You should be able to get home on time by now. If you won't come home, maybe you should stay out tonight."" She was a strong woman with soft skin and a little grey in her hair, and she usually smiled patiently. But Michael, feeling gloomy, hardly listened to her. He was still thinking about his friends laughing at him."
FCE_44,B2,"**Careers Advice**
Are you unhappy in your job and not sure how to change it? Kitty Doherty offers some helpful advice. Many people who want to change their job go to a careers adviser. First, you will write a short history about yourself and then take some tests called 'psychometrics'. After the tests, you will get a summary of the results and suggestions for different careers, along with any retraining you might need.
I decided to try Career Analysts, a big organization that gives career advice. Taking the careers test felt like being back in school during science exams. I was with about ten other people, and we had to answer questions quickly. I reminded myself that it wasn’t about passing or failing. It was hard to see how the tests would show who I really am. The tests included finding mistakes in lists of names and numbers and matching similar shapes. 
After the tests, I talked with an adviser. He used my test results and our conversation to create a report with his observations and suggestions. I agreed with most of what he said, but I was a bit upset to learn that I did poorly in the scientific and practical tests. I’m glad I didn’t become a nurse! However, it was good to hear that I made the right choices in journalism.
Changing your career doesn’t always mean making a big change. Last March, Donna Laney, 25, lost her job as a marketing manager at an insurance company after five years. Her friends suggested she go to Career Analysts for help. Donna said, ""Losing my job was a chance for me to think about my career. I wanted to look at my skills and interests."" Some of the results surprised her. ""I didn’t know I was good at design. But I had to think about the cost of retraining in design and my financial situation,"" she explained. Other ideas included taking a year off to work in the Far East. In the end, she decided to use her existing skills and move into a job that suited her better. Now, she works as a Public Relations officer. She believes she could have reached this point without Career Analysts, but they helped her understand what she really wanted to do. She has sent several friends there, and they are all happy with the service.
Some people feel they would not have made important decisions without help. Juliet Greene, 26, visited Career Counselling Services and made life-changing choices. After working at a major bank for six years, she found her job boring and wanted a new challenge. She went to Career Counselling Services with an open mind. The tests showed she was interested in sciences. She had four meetings with an adviser. The third meeting was recorded, which helped her remember what she said. After the fourth meeting, she decided she wanted to study geology and plans to start a degree later this year. She thinks the advice from Career Counselling Services was worth the money. Now, she feels much happier and more positive.
However, career advice does not work for everyone. Amanda Margetts, 24, a sales representative, said, ""I was at a point in my career where I didn’t know what to do next. I thought a careers adviser might suggest something new. I got many ideas, but I rejected them because they either meant a big pay cut or a lot of retraining. I didn’t learn anything new about myself."" She felt that if she had told a friend the same things, they would have given her similar advice."
FCE_22,B2,"**Fun at the Dentist's?**
If you visit W. Lloyd Jerome's dental office in the center of Glasgow, you will see bright paintings on the walls and a stylish blue couch where patients sit while he checks their teeth. Jerome says, ""Fifty percent of people only go to the dentist when they are in pain instead of for regular check-ups. This is because they are scared."" To help with this, he has tried to make a place where people feel safe. That is why he decided not to wear a white coat, which many people connect with pain. He believes that dental treatment should happen in a relaxing and enjoyable atmosphere.
This idea is surprising for many people who think of dental visits as painful or very formal. Jerome says, ""If people are relaxed and entertained, they will forget their bad experiences."" One of his new ways to help patients relax is by using virtual-reality headsets. ""We were the first dental office in Britain to use them, and they are very popular. During the first check-up, the patient sits comfortably on the blue couch and watches a film about underwater wildlife while I check their teeth. Then the headset shows a special camera that gives the patient a view of their mouth.""
Most patients seem to enjoy this part of their visit. Another interesting thing is that the office smells more like a perfume shop than a dentist's office. Today, it smells like orange. Jerome explains, ""When people walk in, I want them to feel that it is not like a regular dentist's office. Smell is very important. The usual dentist smell can make people nervous if they are afraid of dentists."" I also found the nice smell in the office very pleasant.
Even though Jerome is known as Glasgow's most stylish dentist, he takes his work very seriously. The relaxation techniques are important, but the quality of the treatment is the most important thing. For example, Jerome uses a special tool that sprays warm water on the teeth to clean them instead of scraping. It feels a bit strange at first, but if people are relaxed, it is not painful at all.
Five years ago, Jerome went to the United States to learn about new dental techniques. ""I found out that when you make it easier for the patient, it is easier for you too,"" he explains. He believes that his patient-focused approach is the beginning of a change towards a less formal style in British dentistry.
At that moment, a patient arrives. Jerome quickly goes to him, offers a cup of tea (herbal or regular), asks what video he would like to watch, and gently leads him to the chair. The patient seems to enjoy this special treatment, and it is easy to see why. The office feels more like a fancy beauty salon than a regular dental practice."
FCE_39,B2,"**Bitter Water Hits the Big Time**
Chocolate comes from South America and is now a huge global business. In Britain, people spend over £230 million on chocolate at Easter, which is about eight percent of all chocolate sales. Only at Christmas do people buy more chocolate. 
The large production of chocolate started in the last century, but the cacao plant was first grown by the Aztec, Toltec, and Mayan civilizations in Central America over three thousand years ago. The cacao tree is a tropical plant found in Africa, South and Central America, the West Indies, and South-East Asia. Its fruit is the size of a melon and has 20-40 seeds. When dried, these seeds become cacao beans, which are used to make chocolate. In English-speaking countries, they are often called cocoa beans, but this is a mistake from the 17th century.
The Aztecs used cocoa beans as money and made a drink called xocoatl, which means ""bitter water"" in their language. They flavored this drink with spices for special occasions. The Spanish liked the drink better with cinnamon and sugar, but it took another hundred years for the recipe to reach the rest of Europe. 
In the late 17th century, chocolate houses opened in European cities where people could drink chocolate. Until the last century, the drink was made from solid chocolate blocks that had to be melted in hot water. In 1826, CJ van Houten from the Netherlands invented chocolate powder by removing most of the cocoa butter from the beans. 
The chocolate bar we know today started in 1847 when a company in Bristol, Fry and Sons, mixed cocoa butter with chocolate liquor and sugar to create a solid bar. A Swiss company later added milk solids to make milk chocolate. 
At the beginning of the 20th century, French companies dominated the British chocolate market. In 1879, the English company Cadbury named their factory Bournville, hoping to attract some French style. Then, in 1905, Cadbury introduced the Dairy Milk bar, which was first called Dairymaid. Smart advertising linked it to the healthy milk from the English countryside, making it popular against French brands. 
Today, British people eat about four chocolate bars each week. This has made chocolate companies look for new ways to attract customers. One new idea is to turn chocolate bars into ice cream, soft drinks, or desserts for those who want something different. 
However, cacao farmers are still struggling because cocoa bean prices fell in the late 1980s. Many small farmers went out of business. So, next time you enjoy a chocolate bar, think about the farmers who grow cacao."
FCE_18,B2,"**THE SHELL ARTIST**
Peter Cooke is 83 years old and is a master at making art from shells. He has been doing this for ten years and loves it. He also wants to try making paper and working with feathers in the future. 
As he shows me his work in his apartment, he asks, ""Am I boring you?"" He is very enthusiastic about his art, and his charm makes it easy to listen to him. He points to some beautiful shell-covered decorations above his fireplace. He says he doesn’t mind if people don’t buy them because he loves them. He never planned to sell his work, but about five years ago, some friends encouraged him to have an exhibition. They thought people should see his art, so they talked to an art gallery owner. 
His first exhibition was in London, and 70% of his pieces were sold. His second exhibition just opened yesterday. The prices for his work are high, around £2,000 for some pieces. Cooke says he doesn’t set the prices, but he knows his work is unique. The gallery owner told him that one day, when he stops making art, everyone will want his pieces.
Cooke wishes he had started making art earlier in his life because he believes he could have created even more amazing things. He feels he is more limited now because of his age, but he still makes beautiful art that is very different from the common shell items found in shops by the sea. He describes himself as having a ""miniature mind,"" which helps him create detailed boxes covered in tiny shells, pictures made from shells, and realistic flower baskets.
He has his own way of working and uses materials he finds. For example, he uses cardboard from laundered shirts for flower bases, a special glue from a sail-maker, and washing-up liquid to clean the shells. He says, ""I have an idea of what I want to do, and it just happens."" His work shows a lot of detail and care.
Cooke travels to many places to find beautiful shells, including France, Thailand, Mexico, South Africa, and the Philippines. He lies on the beach to look for shells. He only collects dead shells and defends himself against people who accuse him of harming the beaches. He explains that many shells are broken by people walking on the beach, and he would never take shells that still have living creatures in them. He believes that once the creatures are gone, it is okay to collect the shells. His argument is strong, especially when you see how beautiful his work is compared to the shells he collects."
FCE_62,B2,"**The Schoolgirl Model**
Kira Langer is a 15-year-old girl who is a model. When she is not traveling to exciting places or appearing on magazine covers, she studies for her school exams. Jane Laidlaw tells us more about her.
I was waiting to meet Kira, but the receptionist said she would be a little late. I thought about all the bad things I had read about models, like being difficult or vain. I worried that Kira might not come at all or that she would be in a bad mood if she was late. 
But when Kira arrived, she was smiling and relaxed, and she was with her mother. She was not wearing fancy clothes, just a simple black dress and trainers. Kira was very friendly and looked tall and pretty. She explained that all models under 16 must have an adult with them when they work. Her mother seemed like a proud and normal mom.
Kira seemed a bit surprised by her fame because it was unexpected. It was her older sister who encouraged her to enter a modeling competition. Kira said, ""I said no, but she sent some photos anyway."" When she found out she was a finalist, she was at school. This gave her the confidence to continue, and she won the competition easily. After that, a modeling agency in London offered her work.
Now, Kira has to balance her life as a model and a student. Her friends and teachers are proud of her, but some people at school are not nice. They say she thinks too highly of herself. Kira finds this hard to handle because she is not a selfish person. She said, ""They think I can't stay the same just because I'm a model. The only thing that has changed is that I am more confident.""
Being a busy model affects her social life. The agency can call her at any time for a job the next day. She cannot always make plans with her friends because she does not know what she will be doing. However, her friends understand and do not complain about her modeling.
Kira has the looks, talent, and support to have a great career. Not many people can say that before finishing school. At the end of the interview, I asked her what she would like to do if she were not a model. She thought for a moment and said, ""I would like to do what you're doing."""
FCE_49,B2,"**Father and Son Start Gold Rush**
Terence and Chris Madden have traveled from the cold north of Canada to the hot lands of Africa looking for gold. The father and son team, with Terence as an explorer and Chris as a mineral expert, believe their mine on a Welsh mountain could have up to 10,000 ounces of gold. After ten years of digging in the Welsh hills, they think they are very close to finding a gold vein worth five million dollars. Terence, 68, from Liverpool, said, ""As we dig, we are finding high levels of gold; now we just need to dig a bit more to reach where it is concentrated.""
They have dedicated their lives to finding gold. Their search started when Terence read about gold worth millions buried in the ""Dolgellau gold belt,"" an area near the town of Dolgellau in Wales. While reading old mining journals and newspapers at the Welsh National Library in Aberystwyth, they chose the best area of land to explore. After clearing away plants and finding pieces of gold in the rocks, they spent ten years getting permission to work, taking soil samples, and removing old cars and trash. They dug out 150 tonnes of greenstone rock to create a tunnel and a 10-meter shaft.
Now, they are running out of money. They have used their savings to follow their dream and need to find a backer to invest £50,000 to dig a bit deeper to reach the gold. Chris Madden says, ""Right now, it looks doubtful, but we have a few people we can contact.""
As news about their dig spread, many people in the area became interested in gold. Dolgellau depends on tourists, and residents are hopeful. Peter Woolven, manager of the Royal Ship Hotel, said, ""If they are right, it would bring more people here, but I hope millions of people do not come and damage the hillside.""
The Welsh gold industry has declined since its peak in the late 1880s when many people worked in hundreds of mines. One of the last mines, Clogau-St David's, which made wedding rings for the Queen and the Princess of Wales, closed a month ago. However, individual gold diggers are coming back. George Hall, another prospector, plans to dig a tunnel deep into the hill near the Maddens. Hall, 70, said, ""Searching for gold is very emotional. It's adventurous and exciting, the wonder of uncovering hidden treasure. Maybe I'll be lucky this time."""
FCE_31,B2,"**IN HOT WATER**
Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends a lot of time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She teaches and researches marine geochemistry, which means she studies the chemicals in the sea. Rachel works at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she is not teaching, she goes into a small steel vehicle that is like a car and dives three kilometers down into the ocean to study underwater volcanoes.
Inside the vehicle, there is very little space. Rachel says, ""I can reach out and touch the two pilots."" They cannot stand up or move around, and they must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last for 16 hours: three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours to collect rock and water samples, and three hours to come back up. If there is a problem and they need to get to the surface quickly, they can press a panic button. This releases a small escape vessel that goes quickly to the surface, but Rachel thinks it would not be a nice journey.
Rachel remembers her first time in the vehicle. She got in with an instructor who explained what to do in an emergency, like if the pilot had a heart attack. They wanted to see how she would react in such a small space. Now, Rachel has made six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian team. They went to a place five days away from the Canary Islands in the Atlantic Ocean, where there are many underwater volcanoes that release black smoke. The Russian team was dropping off equipment to study a project that would create a hole 150 meters through a volcano.
When Rachel is not at sea, she works in her office at the Oceanography Centre. She says, ""Two-thirds of my salary comes from teaching, which I love, but I do it so I can continue my research on the 'black smokers.'"" Black smokers are underwater volcanoes that release hot water that looks like black smoke. This water comes out at a rate of one meter per second and is very hot, at 350 degrees.
Rachel felt scared the first time she dived with an American team. They were towing equipment when suddenly there was an explosion. She heard a huge bang and thought, ""I'm going to die."" They waited in silence, and when nothing happened, they were very relieved to be alive.
Diving to the deepest part of the ocean is an adventure for Rachel. Every time she looks out of the porthole and sees the chimneys, she feels amazed. She thinks, ""Here I am at the bottom of the sea, and no one else has ever seen this."" Rachel studied black smokers for three years for her PhD, and when she finally saw them in person, it was an incredible feeling."
FCE_58,B2,"I was dirty, smelly, hungry, and a little sunburned. It was the end of my Inter-Rail holiday. My body was tired, and my mind was confused by foreign train schedules, money, and languages. ""Never again,"" I said as I arrived home. I said the same thing the next year and the year after that. 
All I needed was one train ticket, and because I was under twenty-five, I could travel anywhere in Europe for a whole month. After sleeping in train corridors, regular beds felt different. Carrying all my things in a backpack made me travel simply and sometimes wastefully, like burning socks that were too dirty or throwing away books I had finished. 
This way of traveling was part of the Inter-Rail spirit, where common sense could be forgotten. All it took was one of those tickets to feel free. A ticket that lets young people travel to many countries in one day is special. 
On my first trip, my friends and I didn’t know how much we could do with this ticket. We thought it was just a cheap way to get to our campsite in southern France. But we soon wanted to see more countries. The extra travel didn’t cost us anything. 
We were not completely uninterested in culture, but this was our first holiday without parents, like many other Inter-Rail travelers. We planned our own schedule and only saw the most interesting sights. It was a chance to escape guided tours and do something different. I was proud that sometimes all I wanted to see was the view from the train station. 
We were just trying to enjoy ourselves, like most other Inter-Railers who shared train corridors, food, money, and music with us. The excitement of travel comes from arriving in a place that was just a name before. It feels like the city didn’t exist until the train arrives, and you see it for the first time. 
Only by seeing Europe, watching the changing landscapes, and noticing different lifestyles can you really understand the continent. Everyone knows what is there, but it means nothing until you see it yourself. This is why other people's holiday photos can be boring. While the train trip may not show you new things in the world, it is a valuable personal experience. Europe is big, and Inter-Rail gives people a great chance to see this, even if it didn’t happen for us right away."
FCE_37,B2,"
Arriving at an airport in another country and finding out that your luggage is missing can be very disappointing. You might have to wear the same clothes for hours or even days until the airline finds your bags. If you are in a different climate, you may have to wear clothes that are not suitable for the weather.
Airlines do not often say how many bags they lose, but it happens to many travelers. Even good airlines can make mistakes, and it is hard for any airline to promise that your checked luggage will travel on the same flight as you, especially if you have to change planes.
Here is how it works: Airlines ask passengers to arrive at the airport early to give enough time for bags to be checked in and loaded onto the plane. The minimum connecting time (MCT) is the shortest time needed to change from one flight to another. This time is usually longer to help with baggage transfers. Normally, this system works well, but extra security checks and air traffic problems can cause delays. These issues can lead to lost luggage.
Human mistakes can also happen, like if the label on your bag gets torn off. This is more likely to happen at busy airports, called 'hubs', where many bags are processed. For example, last year, London’s Heathrow airport had over 41 million passengers, with nine million changing planes. British Airways alone had two million transfer passengers at Heathrow.
Even busy airports like Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Singapore, and Zurich can have problems. In the United States, Miami airport is known for losing luggage when passengers quickly change planes to go to Latin America.
To avoid losing your luggage, try to book direct flights when you can and check in early. If you must change planes, it is better to fly with the same airline. Allow extra time for connections by taking an earlier flight, and make sure to label your luggage with your home and holiday addresses, including your flight numbers.
If your luggage is still missing after all this, contact the airline staff in the baggage area and fill out a property irregularity report (PIR) before you leave the airport."
FCE_2,B2,"**The Kingfisher**
Wildlife photographer Charlie James knows a lot about the kingfisher. This is a beautiful blue-green bird that lives near streams and rivers and eats fish. Old trees hang over the stream, giving some shade to the shallow water. The main colors around are soft greens, browns, and different yellows from the sunlight. The sound of the water is gentle in the breeze. The kingfisher moves quickly and smoothly, like a flash of light. It is gone in a moment, but its image stays in your mind because it is so powerful for such a small bird.
Charlie James loved kingfishers from a young age. He feels a strong connection to this little bird, but he cannot explain exactly why. The kingfisher is part of many legends. In Greek mythology, it is a moon goddess that turned into a bird. Another story says that the kingfisher flew so high that its top became the blue of the sky, while its bottom was burned by the sun. There is some truth in this story. Even though kingfishers have many shades of blue, they do not have blue pigment in their feathers. Instead, the way their feathers are structured scatters light and reflects blue. This is why a kingfisher can look bright blue or rich emerald green depending on the light.
Many wildlife photographers love kingfishers. Their colors are beautiful, and even though kingfishers are shy, you can often watch them from a hidden spot. Charlie James's first hideout was an old blanket he put over his head while he waited near a kingfisher's favorite place. The bird came back in just a few minutes and sat only one meter away. However, it took him four more years to take his first good picture. During this time, the European kingfisher became a big part of his life. He spent as much time as he could by a stream where kingfishers lived. Unfortunately, school took away some of his time with the birds, and he missed classes, calling himself an ""academic failure."" But people started to notice his interest in the kingfisher, which is the most common kingfisher in the world and the only one that breeds in Europe. 
At 16, he was hired as an advisor for a nature magazine. He then worked as an assistant to the editor and eventually became a freelance wildlife film cameraman. Now, he wants to make the best kingfisher film. ""No speech, just beautiful images that say it all,"" he says. ""I like to photograph parts of kingfisher wings..."" His voice trails off as he thinks about the colors of the bird he has spent more than half his life close to, which still fascinates him. His photographs show some of his feelings, but Charlie knows that there is much more to his connection with the kingfisher than what his work can show."
FCE_68,B2,"**Conducting an Orchestra**
Giving directions to an orchestra is not easy. Anne Inglis talks to five new conductors about their experiences.
**A. ANNE MANSON**  
Anne Manson, 30, asked to watch conductor Claudio Abbado's practice sessions in Vienna. She ended up filling in for an assistant who was not there. Later, she was asked to help with another opera. ""I had to lead the first rehearsal for Abbado. I wasn't nervous. I always feel good about standing in front of an orchestra,"" she said. Manson, who is from America, works with a well-known opera company in London that focuses on modern music. She is also becoming known in other European countries, thanks to support from the British Arts Council. Since her first experience, she has helped Abbado with many projects.
**B. ANDREW CONSTANTINE**  
Andrew Constantine, 31, believes the hardest part of being a conductor is getting the right chances. He won a big competition in 1991 after trying twice before. Looking back, he feels lucky about the timing: ""If it had happened earlier, I would have been forgotten,"" he said. The competition gave him many chances to perform and work as an assistant to a famous conductor. However, he finds it hard to shake off the ""competition"" label. ""If in three years my name is still linked to the competition, I will be worried,"" he said. But orchestras like the English Chamber Orchestra, which hired him after the competition, are inviting him back. ""If this doesn't happen, my career will fall apart.""
**C. WASFI KANI**  
Wasfi Kani, who started Pimlico Opera, enjoys the long practice time needed for opera productions. ""The music deserves four weeks of attention,"" she said. Kani began conducting seriously in her late twenties. After university, she worked in London until Pimlico Opera became fully professional two years ago. Learning from Sian Edwards was a turning point for her. ""I saw her conduct and realized she was my size. I had always learned from much bigger people, which makes a big difference."" She likes the complex nature of opera: ""There are many arguments, and you have to think about the singers' personalities.""
**D. ROGER VIGNOLES**  
Roger Vignoles, 48, said, ""Conducting surprised me, but I find it very interesting."" He started as a musician in an opera house and worked with good conductors. Last year, he was asked to direct Handel's Agrippina from the piano at a festival, which he had never done before. ""It was easier than I thought. I knew the music well and what I wanted it to sound like. I tried my best to get the performance I wanted. People respect my skills as a musician. I learn from every experience I've had, both in music style and performing. Now, I will do whatever people ask me to find out what I enjoy.""
**E. WAYNE MARSHALL**  
In 1986, conductor Simon Rattle noticed Wayne Marshall, a young assistant conductor, and told his agent about him. Now 32, Marshall soon found himself conducting a musical in London on short notice, which was a tough start. He even had to deal with some relaxed musicians reading newspapers during the show. ""I was firm with them. I always gave a clear beat and did my best,"" he said. Many orchestral musicians he has seen do not seem to need advice from a conductor. ""But I'm never afraid to say what I want. If people see you're worried, it gets worse. I have never studied conducting formally, and no book teaches you how to conduct, but people have been kind to me. I am determined and know what I like."""
FCE_23,B2,"**Variations on a Theme**
If you want to take children to a theme park, there are many options in Britain. We asked five families to try some of the best parks.
**Fun Island - The Burns Family**  
Last year, we visited a big theme park in the US and thought Fun Island would be boring. But we were surprised! The park is great for younger children, so our three-year-old had fun too. The kids loved the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. There is a special dodgems ride for little kids, which was a big hit. For older kids, there are scarier rides like Splash Out, where you jump into a pool! After five hours, my husband Steve and I were tired, but the kids wanted to stay because they were having so much fun. Our only complaint is that the park could have a better atmosphere and nicer scenery. However, the staff were very helpful, and the park was clean and safe.
**Wonderland - The McMillan Family**  
None of us had been to a theme park before, so we didn’t know what to expect. We thought Oscar might be too young, but he loved it! He enjoyed the Mountain Train and liked Little Land, which has small models of famous buildings. The older kids liked the ferris wheel and driving toy cars on a real road. We spent six hours there and were happy to find places to relax. The park looked beautiful, and the staff were friendly. There was something for everyone, even adults.
**Adventure World - The Jeffree Family**  
After seven hours, we still wanted to see more. The kids loved the Big Top Circus, which had an amazing trapeze act. We tried the Terror Line, and even though the girls were scared and kept their eyes shut, they said they enjoyed it. Their favorite ride was Running River, where you think you will get wet, but you don’t. Toy Land is also very fun for younger kids. The children wanted to try the new ride, Fear Factor, but we were relieved they were too small for it! The park is so well designed that waiting in line isn’t boring. It was very clean, and the staff were great. One staff member even helped when I couldn’t sit with both girls on a ride.
**The Great Park - The Langridge Family**  
We arrived at one o'clock and were sad that the park closed at 5 p.m. This park is perfect for younger children because the rides are not too scary. I am a bit scared of rides, but I had fun too. We all loved Exotic Travels, a boat ride that starts slow and then becomes very exciting. We waited for half an hour for Lightning River, and it was over too quickly! I wouldn’t go on the Big Leap, but it looked fun if you are brave. If the children were a bit older, they might have found it too easy, but they were the right age and loved it.
**Fantasy World - The Break-all Family**  
The park says there is ""No Limit to the Fun,"" and we agree! The tallest roller-coaster in Europe, the Rocket, is very impressive. Ben thought it was the scariest ride, but Jennie said the Hanger, where you hang upside-down 30 meters above the ground, was even scarier! There are many main rides, and the older kids went on them several times. Sarah was too small for some rides but enjoyed the Long Slide. The staff were nice to younger children, but some were not very welcoming. You need a whole day to enjoy Fantasy World. We wouldn’t have told the kids we were going home early!"
FCE_60,B2,"**Running a Business in the Countryside**
Five women share their experiences of starting a business in the countryside.
A. **Christine Hogan** runs a computer-aided design business that makes over £200,000 a year and has four full-time employees. She says, ""My customers are friends."" Christine moved from London to the countryside when her children were young. She wanted a job she could do at home. Since she had worked with computers before, her husband suggested she start a computer-aided design business. It was hard at first and needed a lot of money. Christine was careful with her spending and kept the bank manager informed. Working from home saves money, and she can work in the evenings if she wants. Her business is small, and most customers come to pick up their work.
B. **Maggy Sasanow** is a greetings card designer who works from home. She studied art at university and wanted to work in a museum, but when she moved to the countryside, there were no jobs like that. So, she started her own business and now makes 50 different greetings cards that she sells to museums. She works in a big room upstairs. The downside of working from home is that there are always chores to do, like mowing the lawn. Maggy does not advertise; her business grows by word of mouth. She is cheaper than other artists, so people send her work from London. Although she misses sharing ideas with others, she finds more advantages than disadvantages.
C. **Delia Turner** has a curtain-making business that has had ups and downs. She started her business eight years ago when it was growing. In two years, her income increased from £24,000 to £80,000, and she had six full-time workers. However, she had to let them go when the economy got worse, which was hard because jobs are not easy to find in her area. Now, she makes curtains at home with her husband’s help and works with women who also work from home. Delia has to lower her prices sometimes and look for new opportunities.
D. **Tessa Strickland** runs a children's book publishing business from her farmhouse. She moved to the countryside three years ago for two reasons: it was cheaper than London, and she loves the countryside. Tessa enjoys being able to work when she wants. Most of her income comes from deals with Australia, the Far East, and North America, so she has to take calls at unusual hours. The challenge is to stay focused and close the office door when needed. She publishes children's books from different cultures and collaborates with authors and artists. At first, she felt lonely because all her work experience was in London.
E. **Meg Rivers** runs a cakes-by-post business and a shop that makes £250,000 a year and employs six people, some part-time. She started her business ten years ago at home. Meg is interested in health, so she began making fruit cakes with high-quality ingredients. Friends and family asked for her cakes, and soon she was sending them all over the country. Seven years ago, she rented a small building where everything is made. Now, she has a baker, an assistant, and a professional cake decorator. Meg does not bake anymore; she manages the business. Her biggest challenge has been the financial side, as she did not have a lot of money to start with."
FCE_1,B2,"**Meet the Amazing Watkins Family**
The Watkins family is very talented. The sons are musicians and composers who have won awards, and their dad makes musical instruments. 
John and Hetty Watkins are schoolteachers from South Wales. When they needed a cello for their son Paul, who was ten years old at the time, they found that buying one was very expensive. John thought about making a cello himself. He found a school nearby that taught instrument making and took evening classes for about three years. 
After trying to make violins and violas, John finally made his first cello. Paul, now 28, says it turned out great. John made another cello for Paul later, and he used it until a few months ago. John has now retired from teaching and makes violins full-time. He makes about twelve violins each year. One of his violins was sold to a famous American player, Jaime Laredo, which made John very happy.
Paul and his younger brother, Huw, started playing music when they were young. Paul remembers climbing up to play the piano as soon as he could. He tried playing the violin because his dad played the viola and needed another violin for his music group. But Paul didn’t enjoy it much. Instead, he liked the cellist in his dad's group and asked him for lessons. 
Huw, who is now 22, says their parents were supportive but not pushy. He felt inspired by Paul’s success instead of feeling jealous. Huw is now starting to make a name for himself as a pianist and composer.
Paul has done very well with the cello his dad made. He won a competition called the BBC Young Musician of the Year. At just 20 years old, he became the main cellist for the BBC Symphony Orchestra, using his father's cello until last year. Now, he plays a very old cello on loan from the Royal Academy of Music. 
Paul jokes that his dad's cello will get better with age, just like his new one, which is already 304 years old. Soon, Paul will perform on television playing Elgar's Cello Concerto. However, he won’t be able to watch it because he will be playing at the Cheltenham Festival that same night. Huw will also be busy, as his String Quartet will have its premiere in London at the same time. John and Hetty will have to work hard to keep up with all their sons' music events in the coming weeks."
FCE_53,B2,"**Looking after the Countryside: The National Trust**
The National Trust is an organization that works to protect the British countryside. Gill Page visits the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and talks to Gareth Roberts, a warden who helps take care of the beautiful areas owned by the Trust.
Gareth believes that a National Trust Warden needs common sense and good people skills. He often works with farmers, visitors, conservationists, and building companies. Gareth grew up on the Lleyn Peninsula and worked on his parents' farm until he got married. Many people wanted the job of National Trust Warden, but Gareth got it because of his local knowledge and farming experience, even though he did not have formal training.
Gareth still helps on his parents' farm, which helps him understand the farmers' problems. He says, ""They can't trick me!"" His farming background also helps him with the physical work of the job, like building fences, planting trees, and making walls. Since joining the Trust, Gareth has learned more about nature conservation. He remembers picking flowers and collecting butterflies when he was younger. Now, he wonders where all those flowers and birds' nests are. He realizes that farming has changed the countryside, but it is not the farmers' fault; they were just following government rules.
When Gareth started his job, farmers and conservationists did not get along. They both wanted things done their own way. Now, they are talking and understanding each other better. Gareth says, ""We are close to bringing them together.""
Gareth's work includes conservation, allowing the public to visit the Trust's land, planting trees, and working with tenant farmers. He wants to finish jobs efficiently and enjoys seeing projects completed. However, he spends a lot of time on reports and paperwork.
Gareth loves his job and enjoys talking to the public, but he finds some people's attitudes frustrating. He says, ""Some people come in, demand everything, and leave as if they own the place. It annoys me to be nice to them!"" But Gareth believes that common sense is important.
If you have common sense and like working outdoors, you might consider becoming a warden like Gareth. However, there may not be a job available on the Lleyn Peninsula for a long time!"
FCE_55,B2,"**The Netball Captain**
In our series about women in sports, Suzie Ellis met England's netball captain, Kendra Slowinski. Kendra is the captain of the England netball team. When I met her, she had a busy day. She taught at a local school and then had a training session in a supermarket car park. I asked her, ""Don't you get strange looks?"" She replied, ""I focus on my movements and my feet, so I don’t notice much else. I might see cars slow down a little, but that’s it.""
Kendra said, ""My whole life is about being my best for the Championships."" She follows a strict schedule to be very fit for the games. This is her fourth World Championships, and it will be the biggest one yet, with 27 countries participating. She said, ""We will have home support, which is very special. It’s important to improve the reputation of netball in our country. There will be more pressure because people expect us to do well.""
Their first game is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. Kendra mentioned, ""We have always beaten them, but they will be exciting to play against because they are very skilled."" The England team is currently ranked fourth in the world. Kendra explained that the Championships will be tough. ""You have to push yourself every day. There is no rest between games. In a series, you can still win if you lose the first game, but in the Championships, you only have one chance.""
In the fifteen years she has played at a high level, the sport has become harder and faster. Players are more aggressive on the court. Kendra said, ""You train hard to win, but after the game, we are all friends."" 
Netball is also using more science for fitness testing. Kendra said, ""It is important for us to think and train like world-class players. As captain, I need to have a strong mindset and lead by example. I want to support and encourage my team.""
Kendra has planned her netball career carefully. She decided that this competition would be her last as a player. She will likely coach young players in the future, but right now, she is focused on her final big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she might have tears in her eyes."
FCE_50,B2,"**SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS**
What should you do if your child has great musical talent? It can be hard to know how to help them grow their skills. Some parents might not see their child's needs until they show frustration or act out. While regular schools can help students who are good at subjects like math or science, they may not understand the needs of musically talented children. These children might do better in a specialist music school.
In Britain, there are five specialist music schools. These schools help children aged seven to eighteen develop their musical skills with the help of professional musicians. Students at these schools spend a lot of time on music, including individual lessons, playing in orchestras, voice training, and music theory. They practice in special rooms and also study important subjects like English, math, science, and languages.
All five schools are independent, meaning they are not run by the government. Classes are small, so teachers can give more attention to each student. Most students live at the school, which helps them be around others who share their interests.
However, there are some problems. One big issue is the cost; it can be very expensive, with fees between £12,000 and £17,000 a year for students who live at the school. The schools try to help families with scholarships and financial aid. Another concern is that not all parents want to send their young children away to live at school. The directors of these schools worry about admitting very young children because the environment is strict and intense. They want to help children grow into well-rounded individuals.
There can be stress for musically gifted children. Sometimes, their talent may fade during their teenage years, and the pressure to succeed can make them feel like they are failing. However, the schools monitor each student's progress and provide help when needed. 
Many former students say they gained a lot from the high-quality music education, but some worry about the limited academic subjects. Many talented young musicians are also smart and want to learn more in school. Because of this, it might be better to wait until a child is older and can make their own choices about their education. 
Students who are good at both music and academics can do well in regular schools with strong music programs or by taking music lessons on weekends at music colleges. However, this option may not be available for families living far from big cities like London."

Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. The large garden around her house gives her many ideas for her art. The garden is full of her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wildly and spread all over the garden. There is a beautiful mix of colors and shapes in the two long flower beds along the path that goes through the garden from east to west. This beauty is partly because of the previous owners who loved gardening and left plants that Susan likes. She also kept the gardener, Danny. Susan says, ""In fact, it was really his garden."" They got along well. At first, Danny would say some of her ideas were not worth it, but when she told him she wanted to paint them, he understood her vision.
Susan likes to focus on painting individual plants instead of the whole garden. Sometimes she paints a group of plants, but usually, she picks one flower and takes it to her studio. She explains, ""I don't set the whole thing up at once. I take one flower out and paint it, which might take a few days, and then I bring in another one."" Sometimes, it can take her a couple of years to finish a painting.
Her busiest time is in spring and early summer when the tulips bloom, followed by the poppies. She says, ""They all come out together, and you're so busy."" But she also finds beauty in how flowers change as they wilt. For example, with tulips, she says, ""You bring them in and put them in water, then leave them for perhaps a day, and they each form different shapes. They open up and are fantastic. When you first put them in a vase, you think they are boring, but they change all the time.""
Susan has always loved plants. She studied botany in school and collected wildflowers from the countryside. She didn't like garden flowers back then because they reminded her of fake flowers sold in shops. She was fascinated by how wildflowers could grow in difficult places, like cracks in rocks or on cliffs.
Today, her garden has many plants from faraway places, but they look at home in her garden. She has a relaxed attitude towards her garden, like a caring aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don’t cause serious trouble. With two art exhibitions coming up and plenty of flowers to paint, she has found it hard to work in the garden lately. She now has an extra gardener, but she knows that to stay connected to her art, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""

Sarah Sutherland-Pilch is a chalet girl in Val d'Isère, France. She is 24 years old and from West Sussex. This is her second year in this job, where she cooks and cleans for visitors who come to ski and stay in wooden houses called chalets. Sarah studied French and History of Art at Oxford Brookes University and graduated last summer. She sees being a chalet girl as a fun way to spend a year or two before starting a more serious job. She meets many interesting people every week.
Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to work. She has her own breakfast before making breakfast for the guests. They enjoy a big breakfast with porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants. After breakfast, which ends around 9:30 a.m., Sarah cleans up and either prepares afternoon tea for the guests or cleans the rooms, which she thinks is the worst part of her job. By 11 a.m., she is ready to ski. On good days, she can ski until 4:30 p.m.
After skiing, Sarah returns to the chalet to prepare dinner. She takes a shower first but does not sleep because it would make her feel tired. Dinner is served at 8 p.m., and coffee is ready by 10 p.m. After dinner, she cleans the kitchen because she does not like coming back to a messy place the next morning. Sometimes she talks with the guests, but other times they prefer to be alone. She enjoys good guests who make her week better, but some weeks are not as fun.
Sarah lives in the chalet with her friends, and they usually go out around 11 p.m. They start at a place called Bananas, then might go to G Jay's, and finish at Dick's T-Bar. However, she does not stay out too late on Saturday nights because Sunday is her busiest day. She calls Sunday a ""frightful day"" because she has to cook breakfast for the guests by 7 a.m. After the guests leave, she cleans quickly, clears the breakfast, and prepares for the new guests.
If she has not done the shopping for the week on Saturday, she does it on Sunday. By around 3 p.m., after cleaning, she prepares tea for the new guests who arrive around 4:30 p.m. Sometimes they are confused and have many questions. Between tea and dinner, Sarah helps guests who need ski equipment and then gets a ride back to the chalet. Soon, it is time for dinner again, and she might chat with friends, but sometimes she is too tired and goes to bed early."

Mandie Currie is a zoo-keeper. She spent a day at the magazine Marie Claire. ""Choosing my clothes for Marie Claire was hard because I usually wear a uniform at the zoo. First, I went to a photo studio, then to press previews, all before lunch. The zoo is a calm place, but I was rushing around when I could have been quietly cuddling an animal. Some people on the fashion team seemed stressed, but my job is not very stressful. At a fashion shoot in the afternoon, I laughed because I usually clean cages or handle rats. I find it interesting to see how magazines work, but I really love my job at the zoo, so I will stay there.""
Alice Cutler is a fashion assistant at Marie Claire. She spent a day at London Zoo. ""I arrived at the zoo in my leather boots and dark blue trousers. The zoo gave me a green polo shirt to wear, which was good because I got very dirty. While I was petting an elephant, I thought Mandie was probably packing clothes. By five o'clock, I smelled bad, but I had a great day. When I retire from fashion, I could see myself working with elephants, maybe in Africa.""
Karen Hodson is a nurse at Hammersmith Hospital. She worked with the television gardening show Ground Force. ""I was very excited to meet the team, and Alan Titchmarsh, the presenter, was really nice. I liked being outside because I sometimes don’t see daylight at work. Even though it was hard work, it was fun. I thought I was strong, but I felt weak compared to the team. I didn’t expect gardening to be so hard or need so much planning. I enjoy gardening, but I don’t plan to quit my nursing job.""
Charlie Dimmock is a landscape gardener on Ground Force. He worked a shift at Hammersmith Hospital. ""I made beds and gave out medicine. I thought I would feel faint doing some tasks, but I was surprised that it didn’t bother me. The friendship among the nurses was great, and it felt very different from my usual work with men. I think my job is not as important as nursing. My day at the hospital was not easy, but it made me feel good.""
Lucy Harvey is a personal trainer. She spent a day with Ryanair as cabin crew. ""I changed into the uniform, and when I put it on, I felt different—people looked at me. Before the flight, our supervisor talked about safety and what to do if someone has a heart attack, which I knew from my training. When the passengers boarded the flight to Paris, I handed out magazines. Everyone stared at me, and I felt nervous. On the way back, we had 80 schoolchildren on board who wouldn’t sit still. I wished I was back in the gym with one sensible adult.""
Sonia McDermott is an air hostess with Ryanair. She spent a day as a personal trainer in a gym. ""I was worried about this swap because I don’t exercise. I was surprised by how much attention you give to one person. In my job, I meet 130 passengers four times a day. At lunch, I saw that some trainers didn’t eat very healthily, but they all drink a lot of water. I wouldn’t change my job for this, but it inspired me to join a gym and try to be healthier."""

**Andrea Thompson - Newsreader**  
I fell in love with the south of France a long time ago and try to visit as often as I can. There is a local train from Cannes that goes along the coast and crosses the border into Italy. It takes you past beautiful sea views. No matter the weather or the time of year, the journey is always magical. Out of the other window, you can see some of the best gardens and homes in France. It feels like you are looking into the lives of rich and famous people. The passengers are always lively because there are many tourists and locals, all enjoying the amazing trip.
**Raj Patel - Explorer**  
I have had many great train journeys, but my favorite is the Nile Valley Express, which travels across the desert in northern Sudan. When I was young in South Africa, I missed a family train trip from Cape Town to Kruger National Park because I was considered too young and was sent to stay with my aunt. When I moved to England as a teenager, I still had not traveled by train. London Waterloo was the first real train station I saw, and its big glass roof amazed me.
**Betty Cooper - Novelist**  
I am very thankful for one train in particular: the Blue Train. It took my husband and me on our honeymoon across France to catch a boat to Egypt. On the train, my husband gave me a pink dress, which I loved. Someone said that pink is good for the brain, and I have worn it ever since. The journey was wonderful as we traveled through France and then by boat up the Nile. It was the perfect way to relax after all the wedding planning.
**Martin Brown - Journalist**  
We were working on articles about a trip around the world and needed to cross a desert in Africa. There was no road, so we took the Desert Express. The schedule was not reliable; we were just told to be ready on a certain day. We heard that the driver would wait for days if he knew people were still coming. When the train arrived, many people rushed to get on, and some even traveled on the roof for free. At night, the train went through some of the most beautiful landscapes I have ever seen. It felt like a dream, like traveling on the moon.
**Arisu Mezuki - Actress**  
Most people have favorite memories of trains from when they were children, but I do not. I grew up in Singapore and Cyprus, where I saw very few trains. It was not until I was a teenager that trains became important in my life. I made a film that featured a railway in Yorkshire. Most of the filming was on an old train line that volunteers had taken care of. That is where my love for steam trains started. When we were not filming, we took every chance to ride the train, and when I returned last year, everything was just as it was, even the gas lights on the station platform!"
FCE_8,B2,"**Trying to Get Published?**
If you want to publish your story, our expert Margaret Stubbs has some helpful advice. Many readers of this magazine ask, ""I have written a story or book. Who should I send it to?"" The first thing you need to do is research where to send your work and learn about publishers. You also need to practice your writing skills. Knowing how to sell your writing is important.
No matter what you write, you should understand the markets you want to reach. One of the best ways to do this is by reading a lot. Visit your local library and bookstores. Reading different materials will help you see what kinds of writing publishers are looking for. Remember, this information changes often because new magazines and books come out all the time.
If you are not sure what to write, let’s say you want to write short love stories. First, find out which magazines publish love stories. This market is quite small now, so get recent copies of those magazines. Look at the types of stories they buy and who their readers are. Readers expect different things, and the editor wants to meet their needs.
Sometimes, new writers send me their stories and say, ""This has been rejected three times. Am I wasting my time?"" As a former teacher, I don’t want to discourage anyone, but it is likely that their work is not ready for publishing. Many new writers are too quick to send out their work before it is good enough. If you have only written one story or article, it is very unlikely to be published. Most successful writers have spent years in the publishing world before they found success.
When you finally send out your work, keep writing more stories while you wait for a reply. Write ten or even twenty more stories. Each one will be better than the last, and you will start to see yourself as a writer. Your skills and confidence will grow. Instead of giving up on your stories, try to improve them. 
In the beginning, it is best not to show your work to others. Remember, every successful writer has faced many rejections before they succeeded. Do everything you can to improve your writing career. Look for a creative writing course near you, or join a local writers' group. This will help you gain ideas and confidence by meeting other writers. Think of yourself as a writer and practice writing every day if you can."

On the last day of a bad year, I was waiting at the Baltimore railway station for the 10:10 train to Philadelphia. There were more people than I expected. The station didn’t feel as nice as usual. Older couples filled the benches, and college students had their bags all over the floor. 
A grey-haired man was walking around talking to different people. He looked wealthy with his tanned skin and nice clothes. He asked a woman sitting alone if she was going to Philadelphia, but she said she was going to New York. Then he asked a girl near me, who had long blond hair. She also said she wasn’t going to Philadelphia. 
Next, he asked an old lady, but she was going to Wilmington. I was curious about what he was doing. I was going to Philadelphia, but I guess he thought I didn’t look trustworthy. He quickly looked at me and then moved on. 
He seemed stressed. He asked a woman reading a book if she was going to Philadelphia. She was about thirty-five years old and looked like a school teacher. She said she was going to Philadelphia. The man asked her for a favor. I stood a little away, pretending to check my wrist, even though I didn’t have a watch. I could tell the woman was becoming cautious. 
The man explained that his daughter was flying out that afternoon for a study year abroad. He had put her on a train that morning and then went home to find his wife upset. His daughter had forgotten her passport and called from the station in Philadelphia, not knowing what to do. The woman listened sympathetically, but I thought it was strange. 
He said he told his daughter to stay at the station and that he would find someone to bring her passport. I wondered why he didn’t go himself if it was so important. The woman asked him the same question. He said he couldn’t leave his wife alone because she was in a wheelchair. I thought this was a weak excuse. 
I noticed the man was holding a padded envelope, not a regular one. It was the size of a small book and looked stapled shut. I thought to myself, “Be careful, lady.”"

John Moore, the owner of a restaurant, talks about his son Gary, who is a famous TV chef. John believes everyone gets a chance in life. His chance was to run a restaurant, and Gary's chance was to cook.
When John found out about the restaurant, he quickly went to see it. The place was in bad condition, but it was perfect for his plans. Running the restaurant reminded him of his childhood. He remembers being sad when his mother went to work and left him alone. Because of this, he wanted to have time for family. His wife took care of their children and managed the accounts while John ran the restaurant. They lived above the restaurant and always made time to eat together. This helped their children, Gary and Joe, become confident. From a young age, they would talk to the regular customers, which gave them a good start in life.
Gary was a lively child. When he was about seven, he jumped into the corner bath like it was a swimming pool and hurt himself. As he grew older, he had to earn pocket money. He started with small jobs and by age ten, he was working in the kitchen every weekend, so he always had money at school. He was very disciplined and would wake up early. In a family business, everyone helps out, and John liked seeing Gary work.
Gary was not very good at school, but he was great in the kitchen. By age 15, he was as skilled as the adult cooks and sometimes even managed the kitchen. He could make over a hundred meals, and John knew Gary would work in catering because he had talent. When Gary needed work experience for school, John sent him to a friend’s restaurant.
Recently, Gary started playing the drums and formed his own band. John worries about what will happen to Gary's cooking if the music becomes successful. He advised Gary to focus on one thing at a time to be successful. John told him that if he wanted to achieve something, he needed to do it by age 30, or it might be too late.
At 17, Gary went to catering college. On his first day, he finished his work quickly while the other students were still learning. He even helped others with their tasks. Everyone is amazed at how successful Gary's TV cooking show has become, and John is very proud of him. He always tells Gary that to get what you want, you must work hard because nothing is given for free. Gary has seen his chance and taken it.
As parents, we talk to our children as they grow up. If they remember even a little of what we say, we should be happy. John feels that Gary must have listened sometimes because of the things he says and does."
FCE_7,B2,"**Finding a Flat in Dublin**
Finding a good flat in Dublin that you can afford is very hard. The best way to find one is through personal contacts. If you know someone who knows someone else who is moving out, that can help. But if, like Jo, you just arrived in Dublin, you don’t have those contacts. So, Jo had to stay in a hostel and look for a flat. For Jo, Dublin felt very new and unknown. She didn’t think about why she was going there. Everyone at her school thought she would leave her small town. They all wanted to escape and see more of life. Some of her classmates went to towns like Ennis or Limerick, where they had family to help them. But Jo was going to Dublin alone.
Jo’s mother thought it would be good for her to stay in the hostel forever. It was run by nuns, so her mother believed she would be safe. Her father hoped the hostel was warm because they are often cold. Jo’s sisters, who worked as waitresses, thought she was crazy for staying in a hostel for a whole week. But Jo didn’t know they were worried about her while she looked for a flat in Ringsend. The advertisement said, ""Own room, own television, share kitchen, bathroom."" It was very close to her job at the post office and seemed too good to be true. Jo hoped it would be nice and that the people would like her, and that it wouldn’t be too expensive.
There wasn’t a long line for this flat because it was more like ""Third Girl Wanted"" than ""Flat to Let."" The mention of ""own television"" made Jo think it might be too fancy for her, but the house looked normal. It was a simple red-brick house with a basement. The flat was upstairs. As Jo climbed the stairs, a cheerful girl with a college scarf came down. She looked unhappy and said, ""Desperate place. They’re both awful. Common as dirt.""
Jo asked, ""What did she do?"" The girl replied, ""She didn’t do anything. She just looked around and acted like it was terrible in a posh accent. We wouldn’t want her here, would we, Pauline?"" Pauline, who had bright, colorful clothes and hair, was a punk. Jo was surprised because she had seen punks on the street but never talked to one before.
Jo introduced herself, saying, ""I’m Jo, I work in the post office and I called about the flat."" Nessa, the girl with the college scarf, said they were about to have tea. She brought out three mugs: one with ""Nessa,"" one with ""Pauline,"" and one with ""Other."" Nessa said, ""We’ll put your name on a mug if you come to stay."""
FCE_43,B2,"**Behind the Dolphin's Smile**
People love dolphins. We enjoy watching them in seaside areas, movies, and TV shows. However, the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society says that dolphins are in serious trouble. Mark Simmonds talks about the decline of dolphin populations.
Dolphins are special to us. They are very smart animals, they can feel human emotions, and they make us dream of freedom in the ocean. Our love for dolphins has grown because of TV shows. First, there was Flipper, and now we have Darwin from Seaquest. But these happy images hide the truth about dolphins living in polluted and overfished seas today.
The number of North Sea harbour porpoises, a type of dolphin, has dropped by up to 89,000. You might think that such popular animals would be protected by law and cared for in special marine areas. Unfortunately, this is not true, and the lack of protection could lead to a big wildlife disaster.
There are forty different types of dolphins in the world. In northern Europe, the most common are striped dolphins, common dolphins, bottlenose dolphins, and smaller harbour porpoises. The striped and common dolphins usually live far out in the ocean and are seen in small groups. We know very little about them. Bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises used to be seen near European coasts. Bottlenose dolphins are very social and were often found along the Channel coast and in rivers like the Thames. Now, they can only be found in a few places, like the Moray Firth in Scotland and Cardigan Bay in Wales. The few that are left show signs of stress from injuries on their skin.
It is hard to know exactly why dolphin numbers are decreasing. Overfishing is taking away many fish from the ocean, which also affects dolphins and porpoises. Porpoises need to find food quickly, and if fish are removed from one area, they may not have enough time to find food elsewhere. They can also get caught in fishermen's nets, which they cannot see. Many modern fishing methods use large nets that can trap dolphins. In recent years, many dead dolphins have washed up on beaches in France and Cornwall. Marks and cuts on their bodies show that they died because they were caught in these nets.
Dolphins can also store harmful substances in their bodies. For example, pesticides can build up in dolphins because they are fat-soluble. This means that when female dolphins produce milk, it can contain high levels of these poisons, which can harm their young. There is already one case of a young dolphin dying from its mother’s poisoned milk.
Another serious threat to dolphins is noise pollution caused by humans. Dolphins live in groups and use sound to understand their environment. In the ocean, noise travels much better than in the air. This noise from ships and oil wells may disturb dolphins in ways we do not fully understand."
FCE_51,B2,"**GETTING FIT**
Exercise is very important for your mind, body, and spirit. It helps you feel balanced, especially when life feels chaotic. You might think this is just another article about fitness, but there are many good reasons to exercise, and very few reasons not to.
Exercise helps improve your muscles and can change your body shape quickly. It makes your muscles stronger and helps you stand and sit better. It can also prevent injuries by fixing muscle imbalances. Exercise can quickly improve areas like your thighs, stomach, and arms. It is good for your heart, lungs, and blood circulation.
You may have heard many reasons to exercise before, but here are some new ones: exercise can help reduce feelings of depression and tiredness, and it can help you sleep better. It also helps manage stress and can relieve some health problems. 
If you are not convinced yet, just remember that exercise is good for you. There are many types of exercise you can try, like aerobics, jogging, or using weights. However, be careful not to push yourself too hard or lift too much weight, as this can cause injuries. If you are unsure about what is best for you, talk to your doctor.
Good posture is also important. If you have bad posture, it can make you look and feel less energetic. To improve your posture, imagine that a balloon is pulling the top of your head up. This can help you breathe better and make your body look slimmer.
Stretching is another important part of exercise. It helps you move better and keeps your muscles from getting hurt. If you stretch four or five times a week, you will become more flexible and fit. 
A good exercise routine should include a warm-up, stretching, a workout, and a cool-down period."

What makes film-makers Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman stay away from home for many months? They are looking for the perfect shot. In the jungles and plains of East Africa, it can be hard to find producer Amanda Barrett and cameraman Owen Newman. Right now, they are in the Ngorongoro Crater, which has had six months of almost non-stop rain. This has caused some unexpected problems. Newman said they had to buy an expensive piece of equipment so that if one of their vehicles gets stuck in the mud, Amanda can pull him back to safety.
Their teamwork has created some of the best wildlife films on TV, like their popular film about leopards. While this film was being shown, they were already back in the field, this time following the shy jackal. This is common for film-makers who travel the world to film exotic wildlife since television began.
I talked to Newman about their partnership while he was having a rare meeting with other people at a safari lodge. He said, ""We do have occasional arguments, but we get over them quickly."" Neither of them sees themselves as the leader. They get along well because they both understand animals in a similar way.
When they travel, they set up their tents each night. But now, they are working from a fixed camp. They leave at 5 a.m. each morning, so they make tea the night before and keep it warm in a flask. Their daily meals are pre-packed and heated by whoever is available. Newman said, ""It's not unusual for us to be out for up to eight weeks, so cooking can be a bit stressful.""
Life can be tough, but being in remote areas allows them to get close to the animals. Newman remembers filming a family of lions. One lioness would often go off alone, but when she returned, she would greet all the other lions, and eventually, she would greet their car too.
Newman first worked with Barrett in 1988 on a film called ""The Great Rift."" Two years later, they started working together to film Arctic foxes. Since then, they have learned to spend four months in one location to gather enough material for each half-hour film. Before they can start filming, they must submit a script for approval.
Newman said, ""Amanda and I had a good working relationship from the start because we shared the same ideas and vision. We want to create a film that captures the true spirit of the place and the animals, and that touches people's hearts. I believe if you can make people feel something, it is better than just making them think."""

In our series about women in sports, Suzie Ellis met England's netball captain, Kendra Slawinski. Kendra is the captain of the England netball team. When I met her, she had a busy day. She taught at a local school and then trained in a supermarket car park. I was surprised to hear about her training place. I asked her, ""Don't you get strange looks?"" She replied, ""I focus on my movements and my feet, so I don’t notice much else. I might see cars slow down a little, but that’s it.""
Kendra said, ""My whole life is about being my best for the Championships."" She follows a strict schedule to be very fit for the games. This is her fourth World Championships, and it will be the biggest one yet, with 27 countries participating. ""We will have support from home, which is special,"" she said. ""It’s important to improve the reputation of netball in our country. There will be more pressure because we are playing at home. People expect us to start the tournament with a good game.""
Their first match is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. Kendra believes they have always won against them, but it will still be exciting to play because Barbados has talented players. The England team is currently ranked fourth in the world. However, Kendra knows the Championships will be tough. ""You have to push yourself every day. There is no rest between games like in a series. In the Championships, you only have one chance, so you must be ready.""
In the fifteen years Kendra has played at a high level, the sport has become harder and faster. Players are more aggressive now. ""You don’t train hard to lose,"" Kendra said. But after the game, everyone is friendly. 
Netball is also using more science for fitness testing. ""We must think and train like world-class players,"" Kendra explained. As captain, she believes it is important to have a strong mindset and to lead by example. ""I support and encourage my team.""
Kendra has planned her netball career carefully. She decided that this competition would be her last as a player. She may coach young players in the future, but right now, she is focused on her final big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she might have tears in her eyes, knowing her loyal supporters are with her."

We cannot stand up or move, and we must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside."" A dive can last for 16 hours: three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours to collect rock and water samples, and three hours to come back up.
If there is a problem and they need to get to the surface quickly, they can press a panic button. This makes a small escape vessel come out, which goes quickly to the surface, like a ping-pong ball in water. No one has tested it yet, but Rachel thinks it would not be a nice trip.
Rachel remembers her first time in the vehicle. She got in with an instructor who explained what to do in an emergency, even if the pilot had a heart attack. They wanted to see how she would react in such a small space. Now, Rachel has made six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian team. They went to a place five days away from the Canary Islands, where there are many underwater volcanoes that blow out black smoke. The Russian team was dropping off equipment to study a project that would make a hole 150 meters through a volcano.
When Rachel is not at sea, she works in her office at the Oceanography Centre. ""Two-thirds of my salary comes from teaching, which I love, but I do it so I can continue my research on the 'black smokers.' This is another name for underwater volcanoes, where hot water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke. It comes out at a speed of one meter per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees.""
The only time Rachel felt scared was during her first dive with an American team. They were towing equipment when suddenly there was a loud explosion. She thought, ""I'm going to die."" They waited in silence, but when nothing happened, they felt incredible relief—they were still alive!
Diving to the deepest part of the ocean is an adventure. Every time Rachel looks out of the porthole and sees the chimneys, she feels amazed. She thinks, ""Here I am at the bottom of the sea, and no one else has ever seen this."" Rachel studied the black smokers for three years for her Ph.D. When she finally saw them in real life, it was an amazing feeling."
FCE_56,B2,"**Interview Tips**
First impressions are very important. Studies show that people make judgments about us in the first few minutes of meeting. They notice how we dress, our eye contact, our body language, how fast or slow we talk, our voice volume and tone, and the words we use.
Mary Pearce wanted to be a teacher. She worked hard to get her degree and felt confident when she graduated. She applied for a job at a nearby primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher. On the day of the interview, she saw a small hole in her jacket. She thought about changing, but she didn’t want to be late because she believes it is important to be on time. Unfortunately, Mary did not get the job. A friend who works at the school told her that the Head Teacher said, ""If someone doesn’t take the time to look their best at an interview, what kind of teacher will they be?""
Simon Grant, a hotel manager, says that people who care about their appearance are more likely to care about their jobs. Many people think that what is inside matters most, but in an interview, you should try to present yourself well.
Janet Goodwood worked for ten years as an administrative assistant in a big accounting firm. When the office manager retired, she applied for the job but did not get an interview. She thought it was a mistake and asked the Director of Personnel what happened. He told her she did not fit the image of an office manager and suggested she improve her wardrobe before applying again. Janet was shocked because she believed her work was good and that her clothes should not matter.
Body language and gestures also affect how an interviewer sees a candidate. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian found that only 7% of our message comes from the words we use, 38% from our voice, and 55% from our facial expressions. If our words and facial expressions send different messages, the listener will pay more attention to the non-verbal message. So, it is important that your words match your body language. Mixed messages can confuse the interviewer.
It is also important not to seem too desperate for the job or too eager to please. Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, applied for a promotion and did so well in her interview that she was offered the job right away. She was very happy but showed too much excitement. The boss realized she would accept the offer, so he gave her a lower salary than she wanted. Sheila believes she could have asked for more money if she had controlled her excitement.
Finally, what you say and how you say it can help you succeed in an interview. David Artesio, a manager of an employment agency, suggests learning about the company before the interview. For example, the annual report can tell you about the company’s work. Mentioning something that interests you during the interview can show your interest in the company.
Business consultant Marian Woodall advises having a few questions ready and avoiding long, confusing sentences. She says, ""Poor communicators talk in paragraphs. Successful communicators talk in short sentences and key points."""

**The Farmer**  
Matt Froggatt used to work as an insurance agent in London, but now he runs a sheep farm. He worked in the City for 14 years, but he felt it became boring and no one was enjoying their work anymore. He did not plan to leave his job yet, but he was suddenly made redundant. He did not get a lot of money when he left, but it was enough to start his farm. His big break came when he met the head chef of a well-known hotel restaurant. By supplying meat to them, he became more popular, and now he also sells meat online. Matt is happy to be out of the office, but he still works long hours, about 80 to 90 a week, and he is still selling a product.
**The Painter**  
Ron Able White was a manager in advertising, but now he is an artist. He started painting as a hobby and found it much more exciting than his job. When he was made redundant, he decided to become an artist. A career counselor helped him, and he told the counselor that he did not want to go back to his old job. This surprised the counselor because most people in their forties need to find work quickly for money. Ron and his wife moved to the north of England, where they did not know anyone. They left their friends behind, but they have been lucky because their friends still visit them.
**The Hat Maker**  
Katherine Goodison worked as a lawyer for five years before starting her own hat-making business in her London flat. She enjoyed being a lawyer and earned a lot of money, but the hours were very long. She did not want to become a senior partner and work even more, so she decided to leave. Many people thought she would get bored, but that has not happened. She keeps busy with deadlines for her fashion business, which helps her stay organized. Katherine feels happier and less stressed now, but she misses talking to colleagues. She loves being responsible for her own work. If she does a bad job, she knows she is the one to blame, and that makes her care more about her work.
**The Masseur**  
Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16 years before becoming a masseur at the Life Centre in London. He started working in finance at 22, but he did not find it rewarding. In 1989, he almost lost his job, so he decided to resign and travel for a year. During that year, he thought about what he wanted to do. He was interested in health, so he visited many gyms and talked to their owners about starting a business. Paul knew he needed qualifications to change careers, so he took courses in massage. Then he got a part-time job at the Life Centre. He has no regrets about his decision. He feels more in control of his life now and enjoys having peace of mind."
FCE_6,B2,"**Dedicated to Their Sports**
Four young sports stars talk about their lives.
**A. Darius (Runner)**  
I have always loved sports. I played many sports, but I was best at football and athletics. When I was 14, I tried out for a professional football club, but I chose to focus on athletics instead. My biggest moment was when I competed for my country in the youth team and won a medal. Unfortunately, it did not get much attention in the media, which was disappointing. I hoped to get some sponsorship because training is expensive. I train at home all winter and then go to Florida for three weeks before the season starts. It is fun there because the facilities are great and the nightlife is exciting. However, I have to be very disciplined. If my friends invite me out the night before training, I have to say no. I wish I could go, but being dedicated is important in this sport. My main goal is to compete in the next Olympics - that would be amazing.
**B. Gabriel (Surfer)**  
The surfing community is small, so I meet the same people at competitions. Professional surfers are serious, and the best waves are often at dawn. To succeed, I have to avoid late-night parties. I don’t mind this too much, but I love sleeping in, which I often have to give up. However, it is worth it because my dedication helped me win the National Championships last year. After a win, I always celebrate with a big night out, and if I win money, I treat myself to a nice trip. Winning the championship also allowed me to present a surfing series on TV, so now I am a bit of a celebrity.
**C. Dieter (Yacht Racer)**  
When I am on a boat with my friends, we have a lot of fun. We are traditional and celebrate our wins in style. Some people say we act a bit childish, but we don’t look for media attention. Sometimes, reporters care more about our celebrations than our race results. I spend eight months a year away, so it is nice to come back and hang out with my friends who do different things. You can’t focus on sports all the time; it’s not healthy. I am known in sailing, but I am not recognized much in public, which I like. I get nice letters from fans asking for signed pictures, and I reply to every one, even if it takes time.
**D. Tomas (Tennis Player)**  
It feels great to walk onto the court and feel the crowd cheering for me. At my last tournament, it got a bit crazy with fans crowding around. I enjoy being recognized by fans when I am out shopping, but it has some downsides. My last girlfriend didn’t like it when I got too much attention from female fans. Tennis players travel a lot, and that is why we broke up. It was hard, but sacrifices are part of any sport; you have to be serious and professional. I am focused on my game now and will catch up on other things in life after I retire, which happens early in this sport."
FCE_33,B2,"**Young Shoppers**
Shopping in a supermarket with children can be very difficult for some parents. One mother says, ""It feels like a battle. They want everything they see. If it’s not the newest sugary cereal, it’s a Disney video or a comic book. Usually, they want all three. I can’t afford all of this, and when I give in, I feel guilty for buying unhealthy things. But I also feel bad for saying no all the time, and I get stressed before we even leave the house. I try to avoid taking them shopping, but then I worry that they are missing out on learning how to make choices. I just can’t win.""
Research shows that children ask for something to buy every two minutes when they go shopping. More than £150 million is spent each year on advertising aimed at children, mostly on television. This amount is likely to grow, and supermarkets are a big part of this advertising. Children often do not understand why their parents say they cannot buy certain things. Arguments about how bad sugar is for teeth are not convincing when they see fun and exciting ads on TV.
Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, ""Most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, but these ideas are not always correct. It is good for parents and children to talk about food. If children only hear about products from TV ads, they get a very one-sided view. Parents feel frustrated because they have to compete with advertising and often disappoint their children.""
The Independent Television Commission, which controls TV ads, does not allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy things. But Dibb points out, ""The goal of advertising is to make people want to buy something. So even if they can’t say, 'Tell your mom to buy this,' that is still the effect.""
Shopping with children can be stressful for parents because they have to decide which requests to agree to and which to refuse. One mother says she tries to be patient when talking about food with her children, but she still feels unsure about how to handle their requests. ""My son pays attention to ads, but he is critical of them. We talk a lot about different products and look at labels together. I’ve talked about it so much that he thinks all ads are bad. Now, we have very few arguments in the supermarket because the children don’t ask for things I don’t want to buy.""
Parents also admit they are not always consistent with their children’s requests. Mike, a father of a seven-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter, says, ""We don’t buy him the sweets he wants because we say they are bad for him, but we buy double cream and chocolate for ourselves. It’s nice to buy good things, and it’s normal for children to want to share that. But I still get annoyed by their requests. It depends on my mood. If I’m feeling good, I’m more likely to say yes. It’s hard to be consistent.""
Supermarkets could help reduce the conflict between parents and children by removing sweets from checkout areas or providing supervised play areas. Even if parents spend less money because their children are not with them, the idea of shopping without their children’s demands might attract more customers."
FCE_20,B2,"**Five-Star Luxury with Modern Technology**
The Merrion Hotel is a new five-star hotel in Dublin. It was created by changing four large old houses and took almost two years to complete. The hotel has the latest technology to help both the staff and the guests.
General Manager Peter MacCann wants his staff to know the guests' names. For more details about what guests like, he uses a computer system. This system helps the hotel give special service to returning guests. It cost £250,000 to set up, but MacCann believes it will be worth it over time. He is happy with how well it works. For example, if a guest asks for certain music CDs during their first stay, those CDs will be ready for them when they come back.
Many hotel guests often complain about room temperature. The Merrion has a high-tech system that lets guests change the temperature in their rooms. They can adjust it by three degrees around the normal 18°C. The front desk can also change the temperature anywhere from 14°C to 25°C.
Business guests will find the technology in their rooms very useful. MacCann thinks that about 65% of the hotel’s business will come from this group. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that can also copy and print, and a video-conferencing system. The hotel has prepared for future technology changes by adding extra cables. They rent televisions so they can easily replace them with newer models when needed.
Even with all this technology, MacCann wants guests to feel comfortable, not overwhelmed. The hotel has 145 large and well-furnished bedrooms that are cozy and inviting. There is also a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a lovely garden.
The food at the hotel is very important. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, who has two Michelin stars, has moved his restaurant to the Merrion. This change allows him to create a modern kitchen and improve parking for guests. The hotel benefits from having a great restaurant without taking financial risks. With good technology and a skilled staff, the Merrion Hotel is likely to be very successful."
FCE_40,B2,"**Where I Get My Energy**
Emma Marsden asked six women how they find energy in their lives.
A. **Jeanette Kupfermann, Journalist and Author:** ""I get my energy from excitement. I need challenges and learning new things. Right now, I am learning flamenco dancing, which is very energizing. If I am bored, I feel tired. Doing something meaningful, even small things, gives me energy.""
B. **Linda Kelsey, Magazine Editor:** ""I have a lot of work, but I enjoy it. If you like what you do, it doesn’t feel hard, even if you are tired. I need enough sleep to feel good. When I only get six hours, I feel a bit low. Exercise helps me feel energetic, but I have to find the energy to do it! I go to a yoga class once a week and try to work out at home. After exercising, I feel much better. I often feel tired in the afternoon, so I think it’s good to eat something then.""
C. **Annie Nightingale, Disc Jockey:** ""I don’t eat very healthily for energy; I think it comes from being enthusiastic and positive. I dislike negative people. I believe we should enjoy life and set goals. I love my job and the last two years have been exciting. I work with many lively young people, which keeps me energized. I enjoy taking photos, even if I’m not the best at it. I also write words for fun songs when I travel.""
D. **Floella Benjamin, Author and Children's TV Presenter:** ""My energy comes from doing things I enjoy. I believe in what I do, both at work and with my family. Being positive helps a lot. I love working with kids because they are full of energy. Smiling at others can make you feel good. I try to eat healthily and don’t smoke or drink, but I don’t have a strict exercise plan. I get my energy from playing with kids.""
E. **Deborah Moggach, Author and Playwright:** ""I love creating gardens from empty land. I once turned a concrete area into a garden by breaking the concrete and adding soil. This gives me more energy than any workout. Knowing that someone wants to read my writing also motivates me. I enjoy exploring nature, even if it’s on private land. It feels fun and childlike.""
F. **Katherine Monblot, Therapist:** ""I think it’s important to care about what you do. I like taking risks and get bored easily, which keeps me motivated. Doing things I don’t want to do makes me tired. I used to be part of many committees, but I didn’t like the time they took. You have limited energy, so focus on what matters most to you."""
FCE_45,B2,"**ICE SKATING**
Ice skating has been around for thousands of years. Archaeologists have found skates made from animal bones. These bone skates were used until iron skates were made in Scandinavia around 200 AD. For the rich people in Scandinavia, skating was an important skill. In the early 1900s, skating was seen as elegant, but at the 1924 Winter Olympics, an 11-year-old girl named Sonja Henie showed a more athletic style, which made skating very popular.
Today, skating combines art and sport. It is both beautiful and physically challenging. For beginners, balance and control are very important. You can only go faster as you get better. The way you position your body helps with balance. Keep your legs slightly bent and your knees relaxed. Your body should lean a little forward.
Relaxation is very important in skating. To start, your heels should almost touch, and your feet should point outwards. When you push with your back foot, make a small movement with the other foot. It’s not too hard! If you practice this for a while, you can slowly make bigger movements as you get better.
Learning how to fall is one of the first things a skater should know. Even professional skaters fall sometimes. To fall safely, try to stay relaxed. This helps reduce the impact when you hit the ice. To get up, use your hands to kneel, and then stand up.
Once you feel confident on the ice, you can try different styles like figure skating, freestyle, distance skating, speed skating, and skating in pairs. It is best to start with figure skating and then learn basic freestyle. Most ice rinks have teachers who can help you learn the basic moves, turns, jumps, and spins.
If you watch good skaters, you will see how relaxed and smooth they are. To skate well, you should practice exercises regularly. It can be dangerous to skate when your body is stiff, so warm-up exercises are important. Focus on your legs, back, shoulders, ankles, and knees. After skating, do the same exercises to avoid stiffness.
Skating helps improve balance, coordination, relaxation, and movement. It also makes your heart and lungs stronger and helps your body become healthier. When combined with swimming or jogging, skating is a great way to stay fit."

Seeing a talented child win a medal can make anyone cry with joy. Julia Gregson talked to three young stars and their mothers about the good and bad parts of their lives.
A. **Annika Reeder, 15**  
Annika won a gold medal in gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games. She wants to be a physiotherapist and compete in the next Olympics. ""Right now, my training is very hard. I don’t have time to watch TV, go out with friends, or do much besides gymnastics and school. I take it one day at a time. When I feel really tired, my coach sometimes gives me a day off, but usually, I keep going. You can’t take too many days off because it makes your body stiff.""
B. **Annika's Mother**  
""From a young age, Annika showed great talent. I’ve seen some parents push their kids, but that doesn’t work. To perform at Annika’s level takes a lot of time and energy, and she has to want it herself. People often say we, as parents, have given up a lot, but they don’t see what the sport has given us. We love it and what it has done for Annika. Before gymnastics, she was a shy girl who hid behind me, but now she has met people from all over the world and gained confidence.""
C. **Sarah Stokes, 12**  
Sarah started show-jumping at age 10 and has won the British National Championship. ""It’s good that my parents like show-jumping because they train me and take me everywhere in the horse box. The shows can last from one to five days. I never get tired of it; I love it! Even if my parents weren’t there, I would still do it because I am determined. I want to qualify for the British young riders (under-18) team this year, and my big dream is to win a gold medal at the Olympics.""
D. **Sarah's Mother**  
""From the moment Sarah sat on a horse at age 1, I knew she had a passion. When she was 5, she would wake up early to exercise her pony. To qualify for big shows, we travel all over England. To save money, we sleep in the horse box. Sarah is very organized and is happiest when she is on a horse. Watching her succeed at something she loves is amazing.""
E. **Jane McShane, 10**  
Jane is the Under-14 Chess Champion in Britain. ""Tournaments are really friendly. I know everyone, and it’s fun. When I play, I don’t concentrate as much as I should. I just look around and don’t think too much. I’m not worried about being proud; I don’t talk about my success at school because I don’t like to feel embarrassed.""
F. **Jane's Mother**  
""Jane played her first chess game when she was 5. My father wanted to see if she liked it. I was bored when he tried to teach me, but Jane loved it right away. By the end of that day, she had memorized all the moves and was beating adults by age 6. I’m happy when she wins, but if she wanted to stop playing tomorrow, I would support her. I don’t want to hold her back because she is so talented. If she has this gift, I want her to reach her full potential."""
FCE_29,B2,"
It's true - we are all getting taller. Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy. The teacher joked, ""What do you want to be? The flagpole on a ship?"" This was funny because Chris was already almost two meters tall. Today, he is Britain's tallest man at 228 cm.
Every ten years, the average height of people in Europe increases by one centimeter. More tall people are being born, but this does not mean we are becoming a super race. Instead, we are returning to how we were as cavemen. We are starting to lose the effects of many years of poor diet. Professor Chris Stringer, a palaeontologist, says, ""We are becoming like Cro-Magnons again, the people who lived on Earth 40,000 years ago.""
For most of human history, our ancestors ate a variety of foods. Women gathered herbs, fruits, and berries, while men hunted animals. One study found they ate from 85 different wild plants. But about 9,000 years ago, farming started, and this changed everything. Farmers took over many green areas, and now just three plants - wheat, rice, and maize - provide more than half of the calories we eat today. This poor diet has harmed our health. 
In Ohio, scientists found that when they started to grow corn, healthy hunter-gatherers became sick and underweight farmers. Tooth decay and diseases increased. Corn, which was thought to be good, actually caused health problems. However, farming spread because one piece of land could feed ten times more people than hunting could.
Today, many people are still poorly nourished, but this is slowly changing in wealthier countries. In Europe, the US, and Japan, diets are becoming more like our ancestors' diets. Now, the average man in the US is 179 cm tall, in Holland 180 cm, and in Japan 177 cm. This is a good trend, but it has its own problems. 
Even though people are getting taller, standard bed lengths have stayed at 190 cm since 1860. Also, legroom in planes and trains seems to be getting smaller, and clothing companies have to change their sizes often. The question is: how tall can we get? 
Some scientists think we might reach a height of 193 cm this century. However, there is a twist. While people may be growing taller because of better nutrition, as a species, we are actually getting smaller. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, humans were a bit rounder and taller to keep warm. Now that the climate is warmer, we seem to be getting thinner and shorter, even when we eat well. As the planet continues to warm, we might shrink even more. So, our growth could be affected by global warming."
FCE_57,B2,"**Studio Audiences**
What is it like to be in the audience when a television show is being made? Cosmo Landesman found out. Studio audiences are a common part of making television, but many people do not understand them. When we watch game shows, we see the audience getting excited and wonder, ""Who are these people?""
Some people think that studio audiences are not very important. I have heard that even people who work in television do not think highly of them. One cameraman even said they are treated ""like cattle."" I used to think that studio audiences were just made up of silly people wanting a moment of fame. But there is no typical studio audience. They come from different backgrounds, jobs, and income levels. Television shows try to attract different types of people for different programs.
Many of us who watch television at home do not understand why anyone would want to be in a studio audience. Why would someone apply for tickets, travel far, and sit for hours in a studio just to watch what they can see at home? One reason is that people hope to be on television for a moment. I did not believe this until I spoke to Angela, who said she came for a chance to appear on TV. Another reason is that people are curious to see how a show is made. But the most common reason I heard was, ""A friend gave me a ticket.""
Most of us have never been in a studio audience, but we think we know what it is like. You sit close to strangers while someone holds up cards that say ""APPLAUD"" or ""LAUGH,"" and you do what the card says. This is true for some shows, but not all. As one studio manager said, ""We always assume a show will be good enough not to need these signs.""
Is there a real difference between being in a studio and watching at home? For Claire, being in a studio is ""more exciting."" Charlotte liked being part of live television. She said, ""Last year I saw my favorite comedian. When you watch him at home, you miss a lot."" What I missed was seeing the live actors. I could only see the back of someone’s head. The opening scenes were so far away that I ended up watching the show on a monitor.
Going to a studio may not be the best way to watch television, but that is not what matters. For most people in the audience, it was just fun and a free night of entertainment."
FCE_9,B2,"**Favorite Places**
**Bruce**  
I don’t like wild landscapes. I prefer places with people. When I travel, I enjoy lovely villages with old temples, not empty deserts. When I was eight, I went to school in England. On Saturdays, I would ride my bike to the village of Lastingham in its beautiful valley. Cycling helped me relax from school. I loved exploring the hills, valleys, and old villages. Coming from Scotland, the landscape felt familiar but also different. I still visit there today. I used to write about my adventures in my diary. This was my first try at travel writing, which I later became known for.
**Sophia**  
There is a small train that goes from Hythe to Dungeness, run by volunteers. I always travel first class because it doesn’t cost much more than regular tickets. The views are not amazing. The train goes across Romney Marsh with its sheep and next to a canal. But there is one part of the journey I always look forward to - when the train goes through back gardens. For a few moments, we see people doing everyday things, like making tea or folding a chair. I see myself in their eyes, a woman in a tiny train, looking into their homes. I like the simple landscape of fields, sheep, and a distant grey sea. It makes me look closer and find something new.
**Matthew**  
The Hartland Peninsula is a quiet and beautiful coast. The beaches are hard to reach and have many rocks, so there are not many people here. A few brave surfers come, but most visitors enjoy the beauty of the sea. This coast faces the Atlantic and is known for shipwrecks. There are walking paths along the coast that you can combine with trips into beautiful valleys with oak trees, ferns, and wildflowers. We stay in a simple self-catering place with a family in the village of Southole.
**Annette**  
My favorite place in England is the Trough of Bowland, a wide-open moorland that is great for hiking. There are not many people living there or visiting. It is a quiet and remote area, and I like the feeling of space. I found this place by chance when I was a student, and I visit every year, either alone, with my boyfriend, or now with my son. It has not changed much since my first visit. Having a child makes these visits special. I feel sad that he is growing up in a city.
**James**  
I bought Glenthorne, my favorite house in Britain. I wanted peace and to reconnect with my English roots. I grew up in what is now Sri Lanka, but when I was twelve, I went to school in Devon, in the west of England. I used to ride my bike around the moors and village streets. There was a story about a place we would never cycle past: if you went down the driveway, you would never return. That place was Glenthorne. It is my dream place. It is a magical, quiet, romantic house. You can only hear the sea, wind, and birds."
FCE_42,B2,"**HAPPY HUNTING GROUND**
We are a family that loves animals. One afternoon, my daughter called me at work to tell me she found a beautiful pine snake. She asked, ""Can we keep him?"" I said, ""Yes, but only for one night."" We had a special tank ready for animals like this, so we could look at it and learn more from our natural history book.
I got home late and quickly started boiling some water. Suddenly, I heard my sons screaming, ""Oh, Mother! Help! Do something!"" I ran to their bedroom. The problem was with Domino, our cat, and Bianca, the white mouse I got for Mother's Day. Domino had caught the mouse and was running around the room, trying to escape with it. 
In the chaos, I tripped and fell on the floor. I saw the snake escaping from the table and slithering across the floor. The room was full of kids, the cat, and the mouse, all jumping and screaming. The dog was barking loudly, and my pot boiled over in the kitchen. I quickly turned off the gas and went back to help.
I managed to grab Domino by the tail and saved the little mouse from his mouth. The mouse was wet but unharmed. This same mouse was caught by Domino three more times but lived a long life.
Feeling good about saving the mouse, I looked at the snake. It seemed strong and wild. I sat on the floor, trying to calm it down. Slowly, the snake relaxed and rested its head on its body. I carefully lifted the snake and walked to the end of the garden. I wanted to let it go near a tree.
When I finally let go of the snake's head, I was scared it would bite me. Instead, it slid over my shoulders like a colorful scarf. We stood there in the evening light, with my four children, me, and the snake. My oldest son, DJ, broke the silence and said, ""Mum, you are warm, and the shed is not.""
I asked the kids to help me encourage the snake to move. Slowly, it started to go up the wall and disappeared over the roof. As the last part of its tail vanished, my three-year-old son Clay sighed and said, ""Wow, that was one big snake!"""

In our fast world of phones and computers, writing letters is at risk of disappearing. But for me, receiving a letter is special and cannot be replaced by other ways of communication. There is excitement when a letter arrives, joy in seeing who it is from, and happiness in reading what it says.
I have been writing letters for a long time. It started with little notes to my mother. She always made me write thank-you letters for Christmas and birthday gifts. It didn’t matter if they were short or messy, as long as they were letters. When I left home at 18 to study medicine in London, I wrote to my parents every week, and they wrote back. My father sometimes wrote long, funny letters, which I loved. Most of the letters were about everyday life with my parents and their friends. We also made phone calls, but I remember the letters more.
I also received letters from my boyfriends. Many of them had to work or study far away, so we kept in touch by writing. Writing letters helped our relationships because I could express my feelings better in writing than by talking. I enjoy letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. Notes are nice, but it’s even better to get a lot of news in a letter! I love receiving letters from different places, like Sri Lanka, Australia, and Vancouver. I also have a friend in France. We started talking in a restaurant while on holiday, and I asked for her address. If she hadn’t replied, we would have missed out on a great friendship. Now, we write to each other regularly. I can practice my French with her since she doesn’t speak English. We have visited each other’s homes.
My best letter-writing experience was this summer when my family and I visited my American penfriend in Texas. We had been writing to each other for 29 years but had never met. People were surprised that our friendship lasted so long, and the local newspaper even wrote about it!
I am happy that my children are continuing this tradition. Like my mother, I make them write their own thank-you letters. My daughter writes me little letters, just like I did for my mother. She and my son have penfriends in Texas, thanks to my penfriend. I encourage everyone not to let letter writing become a lost art."

Many ancient pictures carved into rocks at a famous tourist site in France are being damaged. Scientists worry that the 36,000 drawings on rocks in Mont Bego in the French Alps are being harmed so quickly that they may not last for future generations. 
The mountain is thought to have been a place for prayer and worship, and it has drawings that are about 4,000 years old. These drawings show cows with horns, fields, and different gods and goddesses. However, as more people visit the site, the pictures are being ruined by careless graffiti. 
Jean Clottes, the chairman of the International Committee on Rock Art, says, ""People think that because the pictures have been there for so long, they will always be there. But if the damage continues like this, there will be nothing left in 50 years."" He has seen tourists stepping on the drawings, which wears away the rock and makes the artwork less clear. Some visitors even take pieces of the rock home as souvenirs. He also mentions that when people cannot take a good photograph, they rub the drawings to make them look clearer. 
Other researchers have noticed that some people bring long sticks with sharp ends to scratch their own drawings or names into the rocks. Experts disagree on the best way to protect the drawings. 
Henry de Lumley, the director of the Museum of Natural History in Paris, believes the only way to save the site is to make the whole mountain a ""no-go"" area, allowing the public to visit only on guided tours. He says that if this does not happen, the site will be completely destroyed, and important research will be lost. 
Clottes disagrees with this idea. He says, ""Henry de Lumley's plan is very strict, and while it may work, it will also upset local people."" He reminds us that the site was declared a historic monument by the Ministry of Culture, and we must do everything we can to protect it. 
David Lavergne, a regional architect, also wants to keep the site open. He says, ""Henry de Lumley's idea is not perfect. Our department believes that people should be able to see the site, but it is hard to stop visitors from causing damage because the area is so large. I would like everyone to see it, but we do not have enough money to hire enough guards. We may need to think about charging a fee since there is no government funding."" 
In Nice, Annie Echassoux, who has also studied the site, is worried that as the mountain becomes easier to reach, the damage will increase. She believes the best solution is to block off the area and provide guides. ""We cannot say the plan cannot happen because there is no money,"" she says. ""That is not good enough. Money must be found because the Ministry of Culture has classified this area as a historic site. If we do not act, we will be responsible for losing these drawings for future generations."""
FCE_32,B2,"**Young Shoppers**
Shopping in a supermarket with children can be very difficult for parents. One mother says, ""It feels like a battle. They want everything they see. If it’s not the newest sugary cereal, it’s a Disney video or a comic book. Usually, they want all three. I can’t afford all this, and when I give in, I feel guilty for buying unhealthy things. But I also feel bad for saying no all the time, and I get stressed before we even leave the house. I try to avoid taking them shopping, but then I worry they are missing out on learning how to make choices. I just can’t win.""
Research shows that children ask for something to buy every two minutes when they go shopping. Over £150 million is spent each year on advertising aimed at children, mostly on TV. This amount is likely to grow, and supermarkets are a big part of this advertising. Children often do not understand why their parents say no to certain things, especially when they see fun and persuasive ads. 
Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, ""Most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, but these ideas are not always correct. It is important for parents and children to talk about food. If children only hear about products from TV ads, they get a one-sided view. Parents feel frustrated because they have to compete with advertising and often disappoint their children.""
The Independent Television Commission, which controls TV ads, does not allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy things. But, as Dibb explains, ""The goal of advertising is to convince people to buy products. Even if they can’t say, 'Tell your mom to buy this,' that is still the effect.""
Shopping with children can be stressful for parents because they have to decide which requests to accept and which to refuse. One mother says she tries to be patient when talking about food with her children, but she still feels unsure about how to handle their requests. ""My son notices ads, but he is critical of them. We talk a lot about different products and look at labels together. I’ve talked so much that he thinks all ads are bad. Now, we have less conflict in the supermarket because my children don’t ask for things I don’t want to buy.""
Parents also admit they are not always consistent with their children’s requests. Mike, who has a seven-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter, says, ""We don’t buy him sweets because we say they are bad for him, but we buy double cream and chocolate for ourselves. It’s nice to buy treats, and it’s normal for children to want to share that. But I still get annoyed by their requests. It depends on my mood. If I’m feeling good, I’m more likely to say yes. It’s hard to be consistent.""
Supermarkets could help reduce the conflict between parents and children by removing sweets from checkout areas or providing supervised play areas. Even if parents spend less money without their children, the idea of shopping without their kids’ demands might attract more customers."
FCE_65,B2,"**Going Up the Wall**
In the past, climbers went to the mountains to climb. Now, people can climb in many places, both indoors and outdoors. A crowd watches in excitement as the French climber Francois Lombard hangs upside down by two fingers on a climbing wall. He is competing in the World Cup Climbing Championships at the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham. This arena is better known for the TV show Gladiators, but both events have one thing in common - The Wall. 
The ability to have these events is thanks to new technology. Before the mid-1960s, climbers practiced on cliffs where there were good climbing spots. In winter, they had to deal with cold weather, go for walks, or climb on snow and ice in Scotland. As climbing became more popular, it was important for climbers to stay fit. Since they could not use cliffs for much of the year, they started to climb on brick edges or stone buildings. This helped them keep their fingers strong and avoid getting bored.
Soon, many sports centers built climbing walls using special bricks. One of the first climbing walls was made by Don Robinson, a physical education teacher, in a corridor at Leeds University in the mid-1960s. He created a wall with natural rock set in concrete. Many climbing walls like this were built in sports halls in the 1970s, but they had some problems. These walls were only straight up and down, while real cliffs have different shapes like overhangs and slanted rocks. Once the walls were built, they could not be changed, and climbers would get tired of the same routes.
In 1985, a Frenchman named Francois Savigny created a new material that could be shaped like the holds on real cliffs. These holds could be attached to any wall and removed when climbers wanted something new. French companies also started to make climbing walls with steel frames. Steel was lighter than concrete, so it was easier to build overhanging walls. This new system allowed climbers to have many different holds to choose from."
FCE_61,B2,"**So You Want to Be an Actor**
If you tell someone you want to be an actor, they will probably say it is a risky choice. Acting is indeed a risky career because there are many actors but not enough jobs for them. When you decide to become an actor, some people you thought were your friends might think you are making a mistake, while others may support you. Everyone will give you different advice, but this is a personal choice, and you are responsible for your own dreams.
There are no easy ways to become an actor. There are no tests to pass, and even after training, there is no guarantee you will get a job. Success depends on luck and talent. However, there is always a need for new actors, and acting can be exciting and rewarding.
Many people ask what talent is. I think talent is a mix of natural skill and imagination. Imagination is hard to measure. It also depends on a person's courage and belief in what they are doing. 
Why do people want to act? It can be hard to explain. In theater, the important moment is when the actor connects with the audience. This connection is what motivates actors to perform. 
When you ask successful actors how they achieved their success, they might not have a clear answer. They know some things about their skills and techniques, but they also understand that their success can change quickly. 
Disappointment is a big challenge for actors. Last month, you might have been without work, doing other jobs. Then, you might get a chance to audition for a role. But even if you really want the job, you might not get it. Because of this, actors often avoid talking about their chances of getting a role. They find ways to cope with the stress of competition and the fear of rejection. No one likes to be rejected, and this fear is present from the moment you start auditioning. 
When you say you are available for acting jobs, you are showing that you are willing and hopefully talented enough. In many ways, it is up to you. If you do not care about your acting career, others may not care about you either."

It's true - we are all getting taller. Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy. The teacher joked, ""What do you want to be? The flagpole on a ship?"" This was funny because Chris was already almost two meters tall. Today, he is 228 cm tall, making him Britain's tallest man.
Every ten years, the average height of people in Europe increases by one centimeter. More tall people are being born, but this does not mean we are becoming a super race. Instead, we are returning to how our ancestors looked. We are starting to lose the effects of many years of poor diets. Professor Chris Stringer, a palaeontologist, says, ""We are becoming like Cro-Magnons, the people who lived 40,000 years ago.""
For most of human history, our ancestors ate a variety of foods. Women gathered herbs, fruits, and berries, while men hunted animals. One study found they ate from 85 different wild plants. But about 9,000 years ago, farming started, and this changed everything. Farmers took over many green areas, and now just three plants - wheat, rice, and maize - provide more than half of the calories we eat today. This poor diet has harmed our health. 
In Ohio, scientists found that when they started farming corn, healthy hunter-gatherers became sick and underweight farmers. Tooth decay and diseases increased. Corn, which was thought to be good, actually caused health problems. However, farming spread because one piece of land could feed many more people than hunting could.
Today, many people are still poorly nourished, but some countries like those in Europe, the US, and Japan are starting to eat better again. As a result, the average height of men is now 179 cm in the US, 180 cm in Holland, and 177 cm in Japan. This is a good change, but it also brings problems. 
Even though people are getting taller, standard bed lengths have stayed the same at 190 cm since 1860. Also, legroom in planes and trains seems to be getting smaller, and clothing companies have to change their sizes often. 
The question is: how tall can we get? We cannot keep growing forever. Some scientists think we might reach a height of 193 cm this century. However, there is a twist. While some people are getting taller because of better nutrition, as a species, we might actually be getting shorter. 
During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, people were a bit rounder and taller to keep warm. Now that the climate is warmer, we seem to be getting thinner and shorter, even when we eat well. As the planet continues to warm, we might shrink even more. So, while some people are growing taller, the overall trend for humanity could be the opposite."

FCE_5,B2,"**A Winning Game**
Two brothers are discovering that their childhood game is great for business. Dave and Norm Lagasse, two bearded brothers in their forties, are at home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA, playing a game called pichenotte. This game is special to them because their grandfather, Lucien Rajotte, brought it from Quebec, Canada, to the USA. The family played pichenotte every weekend and holiday, and they always had a lot of fun.
When the family moved to New Mexico, they kept playing pichenotte with the board that their grandfather made from old wooden crates. Visitors were often curious about the game because it was unknown in the southern USA. Three years ago, Dave noticed that their old pichenotte board was damaged, so he decided to make a new one. His new board was beautiful, and soon relatives and friends wanted their own.
One night, the brothers took a new board to a sports bar in Santa Fe. At first, people thought it was a silly game, but then they started to play and enjoyed it. When people asked about the game’s history, Dave researched it. He found that pichenotte likely comes from India, where a similar game called 'carroms' is played. This game changed into 'squails' in Britain, and British people brought it to Canada. The name pichenotte comes from the French-Canadian version of the game in Quebec.
Pichenotte can be played by two to four people. Each player has 12 pieces, or 'pucks', which they flick across a round board using their fingers. If a puck goes into a small hole, it scores 20 points. There are also three rings around the hole that score 15, 10, and 5 points. The game has eight small posts that act as obstacles, and it usually lasts about two minutes.
Seeing how popular the game was at the bar, the Lagasse brothers made more boards and took them to markets and craft fairs. Many people came to watch and buy the game, and soon they started holding championships with a trophy called the 'Lord Pichenotte Cup'. As more people learned about the game, the brothers sold boards quickly.
They decided to make pichenotte their full-time business. They set up a workshop in their garage and have made over 450 boards so far. Each board is made of birchwood and mahogany, weighs 12 kg, and is 1 cm thick. Norm says, ""They're very durable because they need to last a long time."" Each board costs $595 and can be bought from their website.
Currently, there are no professional pichenotte players or TV shows about the game. However, the brothers hope that one day their garage will be home to a luxury car instead of tools and wood. For now, they are happy to spend their free time playing the game they love and hope will bring them success."
FCE_41,B2,"**WELCOME TO THE MODEL VILLAGE**
When you first come to the Model Village, it is hard to believe that a few years ago this was just a flat piece of land covered in weeds. For a long time, people thought it was useless. But one man, with the help of his wife, worked very hard to change this land into the beautiful village you see today. 
Many tons of soil and clay were moved to change the flat land into a lovely landscape. Machines like bulldozers helped, but a lot of hard work was also done by hand. After shaping the land, about 1,000 tons of topsoil were added to create lawns, flower beds, and rock gardens. Hundreds of trees and bushes were planted, chosen carefully to survive near the sea and strong winter winds. Most plants came from local garden centers, but some were brought from Canada and New Zealand.
Colin Sims created the whole village and made over 100 models by himself over nine years, starting in 1972. The models are made from different materials like stone, concrete, treated wood, and plastic to last in all kinds of weather. At first, Colin needed help from experts to learn about these materials, but soon he became an expert himself. 
You will notice that everything is built to the same scale, and even the smallest details are carefully made. This took a lot of patience and special building techniques. The Model Village is very popular and is known for its high quality and good care. The methods used here have been copied in other model villages in England and even taught in some colleges.
All the buildings in the village show traditional British styles and are not based on one specific place. One of the most impressive buildings is the Manor House, which is a typical 13th-century stone building with a brick tower. As you walk around, you will also see a Castle, St Mary's Church, a zoo, and a mini golf course, which is the newest addition.
Please stay on the paths during your visit and do not touch the models, as any damage can take a long time to fix. You can take photos from the pathways only. Dogs are welcome if they are on a short lead.
To make your visit more fun, you will find buttons in front of some models. Press these buttons to see the models move. At the end of your visit, we would love to hear your comments. We are always planning new models, and your ideas can help us create a more interesting display. We also want to know if any models did not meet your expectations, as we are always updating them.
We hope you enjoy your visit and look forward to seeing you again. Don’t forget to tell your friends about us!"

Every week, British tabloid newspapers publish pictures that invade people's privacy and break the rules set by newspaper editors. While some pop stars do take pictures with paparazzi sometimes, this is not common. More often, these pictures cause great harm to famous people when their private moments are shown on the front page. However, very few people ask for help from the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), which was created to handle these problems. These pictures are rarely in the public interest. For example, do private photos of pop stars help solve a crime? How does a picture of a famous actress on a hotel balcony help keep people safe? The actress has complained about long-distance photos before, and since she was in a hotel, where people expect privacy, she had a good reason to complain, but she did not take any action. It is a scandal that the PCC did not start an investigation. 
The PCC should also look into a recent shocking story about a pop star's love life. Like the actress, the pop star has not made a formal complaint. Shouldn't the PCC take action on this and other unfair stories? This seems like a good idea. It could lead to many decisions against newspapers. Other newspapers would report on this, and it would be on TV and radio. The public would not support these newspapers, and editors would have to stop publishing such stories. Photographers would also be affected, as they would not be able to hide and take pictures of celebrities anymore. 
If the PCC decided to act like a ""police officer,"" there would be some problems. How would it decide to start an investigation? Should it talk to the victim and encourage them to complain? And if the person still did not want to complain, should the PCC still investigate? Celebrities and royal family members might expect the PCC to take action on their stories, and they could be upset if it does not happen. The job of the PCC is very big. How could it monitor all of the British press, including national and regional newspapers and magazines? 
There is also the issue of embarrassment. Even if someone's privacy is invaded, would they want the added embarrassment of an investigation? Many people just want to forget about it and move on with their lives. Some might have other reasons to stay quiet. They might have a worse story that they do not want to become public if they complain. In this way, the PCC could become a problem for them. 
One British comedian faced issues with the press when he and his wife were secretly photographed on their honeymoon. He did not complain then, and he also did not complain when he and his family were photographed during a holiday. He was afraid that the newspaper would publish the pictures again with a new story about his anger, saying they thought it was just a joke and that he would find it funny because he is a comedian. This fear is understandable. People think they will be targeted again if they challenge the tabloids. It is hard to find an easy solution to this serious problem."

When I left school, I was very shy and thought I would always be that way. When I was about twenty-five, I helped at my daughter’s school. I was nervous, but I did well. Someone suggested I take a university course. On my first day, I was very anxious, but my confidence grew over time. Working at the school changed my life and helped me become more outgoing.
**B. Michaela**  
Four years ago, my father got sick, and I had to take over the family business. I was scared and became too aggressive. I learned that to be confident, you need to believe in yourself. If work gets too hard, I don’t feel guilty about leaving some tasks for the next day. When I face something difficult, I remind myself that I have nothing to lose. Fear can make you feel less confident, so I talk to myself to calm those fears.
**C. Lisa**  
People think I am very confident, but I often feel scared inside. I learned to look confident because it is important in my job in TV. Interviewing people showed me that many of us feel nervous in important situations. My mother once told me that everyone is too busy worrying about themselves to notice me. I remember this advice often. I also believe you gain confidence by facing your fears. I was very nervous during my driving test, but I passed. After that, I felt I could handle anything.
**D. Barbara**  
My confidence comes from enjoying my work, but I have built it up over the years. If you keep working and learn from mistakes, you will feel more confident next time. I work hard and am liked at the restaurant, but not everyone will like you. It’s important to like yourself and not try to be what others want. My company offers training courses, which have helped me feel better about myself. Setting small goals helps too, as it shows you are achieving something.
**E. Kim**  
After college, I worked as a secretary and often sat in meetings without speaking up. Eventually, I found the confidence to share my thoughts. When I started working in politics, I was very nervous about speaking in public. I told myself that many people do this every day, so I could too. Writing down my points helped me feel more prepared. I believe everyone feels a bit nervous when speaking in public. The real secret to confidence is to keep telling yourself, “Nothing is impossible.”"

Paul Forster goes to a kite-flying festival and spends a nervous night in the forest. Adnan Ali smiled when I gave him his broken kite. ""You have to keep it,"" he said. ""It's traditional - if the line breaks, the finder keeps it... and I have many more."" He pointed to a pile of beautifully decorated kites at his feet. All the kites were 120 cm wide and long, made of tissue paper and bamboo. We sat in the shade of the tall trees behind the Beach of the Seven Lagoons in Kelantan, looking at Malaysia's biggest kite festival.
In the middle of the beach, there were 10 platforms where helpers held up the kites. A line of nervous competitors held the lines of their kites, waiting for the countdown. When the whistle blew, the crowd cheered, and the kites flew into the sky like rockets. More than 500 men and boys had signed up for the competition, which lasts for five days every year. Each person entered four different kite designs, which were judged on decoration, stability in the air, and how well they flew. 
""Flying kites isn't hard,"" said Adnan, ""but making them takes real skill. Come to my house, and I'll show you how to make one."" I received five invitations that day, and I decided to accept his. At his house, I drank cold milky tea and ate fish crackers in a big, nice room. As it got dark, he asked me to come back the next day to help rebuild his kite, but I couldn't. Instead, I explored the southern part of the state, driving towards Kuala Lumpur, through beautiful mountains with thick rainforests.
I took a wrong turn, and the smooth road ended at a river. A small boat was waiting to take people across. Nearby, I saw a sign that said: ""Jelawang Jungle 3 km."" Before I started walking, it would have been good to know that most of the path was steep and slippery. When I reached the track, I met a man named Baba, who took care of a kitchen and some bamboo huts. I decided to stay there, trying not to think about the insects under my thin mattress. 
At night, it was very dark, and I heard many different sounds. A waterfall was loud nearby, and many creatures were moving and making noise. In the morning, I saw a great view of five green mountain ranges. In the afternoon, it rained. First, there was wind, then lightning hit the trees. I got soaked. As I slid down the hill, I wondered how the big butterflies avoided the rain. I also worried about my car getting washed away (it sometimes happens) and if I would drown if I opened my mouth. Luckily, my car was still there, covered in mud, at the bottom of the hill.
In Kota Bahru, the capital of Kelantan, everyone asked me questions: ""Where are you from?"" ""How old are you?"" But they were friendly. Kelantan is known for its kites, but I will remember it more for the kindness of its people."
FCE_48,B2,"**What kind of shopper are you?**
We all go shopping, but we have different shopping styles. Do you know what type of shopper you are? Abby Edwards asked some people about their shopping habits.
A. **Melanie, 22, dancer**  
""I love shopping! I can't spend enough money. When I have cash, I go shopping and feel happy. I can't walk past sale signs. My boyfriend is the same, so we often shop together. We are both addicted to shopping!""
B. **Brenda, 40, office manager**  
""I don’t like shopping much. My husband does most of the food shopping because he cooks and knows what he likes. I take my kids shopping for clothes, but we all have different tastes, so it’s not fun. I don’t spend money on myself often, so when I do, I feel guilty and tell my husband I spent less than I really did.""
C. **Juliet, 28, personnel manager**  
""I only shop for what I need. I hate shopping and only go when I have to. When I do go, I know exactly what I want and I don’t want anything else. Shopping makes me tired, and I would rather be doing something else.""
D. **Anita, 35, TV producer**  
""I like to look around sometimes, but I usually know what I want and where to find it. I don’t waste time and try to shop quickly. However, I have bought things I didn’t really need, so maybe I’m careful but sometimes make mistakes.""
E. **Lizzie, 41, secretary**  
""I really don’t like shopping. I find it hard to find clothes I want, and the shops are too noisy and messy. Luckily, I don’t have to shop for clothes often because I get most of my clothes for free. For food, I go to the supermarket once a week and do it quickly.""
F. **Lisa, 22, actress**  
""I’m a happy shopper. Sometimes I go shopping with my friends, and we often end up buying things. I don’t usually go with a specific item in mind, but if I see something I like, I buy it.""
G. **Suki, 26, art gallery assistant**  
""I’m a careful shopper. I enjoy shopping, but I don’t buy a lot. I usually know what I want and don’t spend too much. Sometimes I shop to feel better, but then I feel worse because I spent too much money.""
H. **Ann-Marie, 29, nursery worker**  
""I love shopping, but only on certain days and never on Saturdays because it’s too busy. I’m a careful shopper. I have an idea of what I want and I look in different shops to find the best price. It takes me a long time!""
I. **Linda, 32, restaurant manager**  
""I don’t like shopping, maybe because I work in the city and the shops don’t interest me anymore. When I have to shop, I go but don’t try things on because it’s too much trouble. The clothes I buy don’t always fit, but I don’t mind making mistakes."""
