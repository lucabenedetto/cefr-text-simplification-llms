**Garbage in, garbage out**
Charging families for each bag of rubbish they produce seems like a good idea for the environment and the economy. However, it may not be as effective as it seems. In many developed countries, the way we collect rubbish is quite similar. Rubbish bags or bins are regularly picked up by special trucks and taken to a landfill. Economists find this system strange because, in most places, it is free. Households pay for this service through local taxes, but a family that produces a lot of rubbish pays the same as a couple that produces very little. However, rubbish disposal is not free. The more rubbish people throw away, the more collectors and trucks are needed, which increases costs for local authorities.
This creates a basic economic problem: if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. A common solution is to make households pay for the disposal of their waste. This would encourage them to throw away less and recycle more, assuming local governments provide recycling options. However, research by economists Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman shows that this logical solution can lead to complicated and sometimes disappointing results.
Their research looked at several American towns that have started charging households for rubbish. The most common method is to sell stickers or tags that must be attached to rubbish bags or cans. Only bags with these tags are collected each week. In a study published last year, Fullerton and Kinnaman focused on a program started in July 1992 in Charlottesville, Virginia, a town with about 40,000 residents. Residents were charged 80 cents for each tagged bag of rubbish. While this seems like a good use of market forces, the authors found that the benefits of the program did not cover the costs of printing materials, paying sellers, and managing the program.
Although the number of bags collected fell by 37%, this was mainly due to a behavior called the ""Seattle stomp,"" where people compacted more rubbish into each container instead of buying more tags. This method is less efficient than using machines at landfills. The actual weight of rubbish collected only decreased by 14% in Charlottesville, while in 25 other Virginian cities without a pricing scheme, it fell by 3.5%.
Additionally, some people chose to illegally dump their rubbish instead of paying for collection. Although hard to measure, the authors estimate that illegal dumping may account for 30-40% of the reduction in collected rubbish. On a positive note, there was a 15% increase in the weight of recycled materials, suggesting that people preferred to recycle (which is free) rather than pay for rubbish removal. However, many residents were already participating in a voluntary recycling program.
In a more recent study, Fullerton and Kinnaman looked deeper into the economics of rubbish. They found that while pricing does reduce the amount of rubbish, the effect is small. On average, a 10% increase in sticker prices only reduces rubbish by 0.3%. This is less than in other studies, but it makes sense. To significantly reduce rubbish, people would need to buy less of almost everything. A small tax on rubbish is unlikely to have a big impact.
This raises the question of whether other factors, like income and education, are just as important as price. For example, wealthier towns tend to produce more rubbish and have less time for recycling. Should we conclude that charging households for rubbish is a bad idea? Not necessarily; free disposal is likely too cheap. However, the effects of seemingly simple policies can be complex. Detailed economic models are often needed to understand these issues, and sometimes the outcomes are not as positive as we hope."
CPE_19,C2,"Theodore Zeldin explores how our work lives might change in the future. Do you feel respected and valued in your job? Simply being successful in your career is no longer enough. Many professions feel they are not appreciated or understood, and even those who are famous often feel bitterness behind their success. Until recently, enjoying your work was enough to be part of a lucky few. Now, you must consider how your job affects you as a person, including your mind, character, and relationships. This is an important question. No matter how skilled you are, if your work makes you dull and unable to connect with others outside your field, or if you are so focused on details that you lack wisdom, imagination, or humor, then no amount of status or money can make up for your shortcomings as a person.
I am trying to find ways for work to prioritize personal fulfillment instead of just serving industrial needs. Work should not only create wealth but also provide a meaningful lifestyle, help us discover hidden talents, and foster diverse human connections. However, this change will not eliminate unemployment. This is too simple a goal because as more people get educated, they seek jobs that are enriching, interesting, and useful. We should view a lifetime of work as a work of art, with the fulfilled individual at its center. Even middle-class professions, like doctors and accountants, are losing their appeal. Doctors often feel more stressed than their patients, and accountants worry about their profession's ethics. Many architects do not get to use their creativity, and administrators are stuck in bureaucracy. Middle managers, who once felt proud of their status, are losing their confidence, as a European study shows. Meanwhile, the companies and institutions they work for are shrinking. Efforts to decentralize decision-making and improve skills have not succeeded in gaining employee commitment. In Britain, only 8% of employees feel their values align with those of their organizations.
I have started a study of various occupations to see how they shape and sometimes harm individuals. I have looked at how different cultures have expanded the idea of human potential and how courage can be developed. I have focused on important issues like happiness, love, friendship, and respect. Now, I am examining how to find more satisfying ways to earn a living. Many experts focus on increasing the profits of companies, but we also need to reflect on ourselves as human beings and consider the kind of people we want to work with. How many of us feel truly alive at work? How many are like part-time slaves, feeling trapped by our qualifications and careers, working not to improve ourselves but because we see no other choice?
Take hotel workers as an example, as 10% of the workforce is in the hospitality industry. There is a huge amount of untapped potential. Many intelligent and lively people endure low pay and long hours because the concept of a hotel has not changed much since the days of the Ritz, which had a narrow view of luxury. A hotel is not just a place for travelers to sleep; it is like a small United Nations where people from around the world meet, often without speaking to each other. Many hotel staff are foreigners eager to learn a new language and culture, but they often have only superficial interactions with guests. Hotels could become cultural centers, connecting guests with the city and each other. Hotel owners could utilize the knowledge of their student employees instead of assigning them only basic tasks. If they paid attention to their staff's true ambitions, they would see many other services hotels could offer. However, they are often limited by accountants who advise focusing on one main activity to maximize profits. 
It is time to rethink what this means from a human perspective, not just a financial one, and to move beyond traditional categories. For me, work is about relationships. Many people now want more than just obedience in their jobs; they want to express their independence and personality. They should have the opportunity to design their own roles and choose their colleagues and customers, within practical limits. This requires the ability to communicate across different professional languages and connect with people who may seem very different at first. While everyone understands the importance of communication, true conversation is different. The kind of conversation people crave today is more intimate, creating a bond of respect and allowing for a deeper understanding of one another. This type of interaction is not just relaxing; it is the most effective way to establish equality. Each meaningful conversation we have can change the world, even if just a little."
CPE_24,C2,"**BROADCASTING: The Social Shaping of a Technology**
The term 'broadcasting' originally referred to the act of spreading seeds widely by hand. This idea is not just about farming; it also represents a hopeful view of modern progress. It suggests planned growth that can lead to a fruitful outcome if conditions are favorable. The metaphor implies that there are central resources available for spreading and reproducing this growth.
We need to explore why a new technology that sends words and images electronically was organized in a way that fits this agricultural metaphor. Although television is linked to two-way communication technologies like the telegraph and telephone, it was designed from the start to be a centralized 'mass' medium. This means that it was set up to send signals from a central source to private homes, which matched the social and economic structures of modern societies.
Attempts to create different forms of television organization mostly remained as experiments. However, two lesser-known alternatives are worth mentioning because they show what television could have become in a different social environment. In the early 1930s, radio enthusiasts in Britain experimented with two-way television as a possible alternative to regular telephones. Popular science magazines like Radio News published articles on how to build television transmitters and receivers, and many amateur experimenters were active across the country. But in 1938, the British Radio Manufacturers Association established standards for television equipment and channel regulations, which pushed these grassroots innovators out of the picture. This marked the end of a potential counter-cultural development of television as a widely accessible and egalitarian form of communication.
Broadcasting was not only influenced by strong economic interests but also by the fundamental structures of modern societies. Despite the efforts of TV amateurs, television in the early 1930s was mainly a medium for public entertainment in the USA and was seen as a competitor to the film industry. In fact, during the 1930s, most people experienced television in public spaces rather than at home, especially in Britain and Germany.
The idea of grassroots or amateur two-way television was unlikely to succeed, while systems based on collective public viewing were operating in several countries during the 1930s. However, these systems did not pose a real threat to the rise of domestic television. Manufacturers recognized the potential for mass sales of home television sets once prices dropped. Given the separation between public and private life in modern society, centralized broadcasting to a wide domestic audience was the most effective way to organize the medium.
As working-class people improved their living standards and joined consumer society from the 1920s onward, the dream of the home as a center for entertainment and cultural experiences became a reality for many in Western countries. This trend is now happening globally. There is a clear link between social modernization and the structures of broadcasting. While social and economic changes led to more centralization of power and capital, the breakdown of traditional communities created new lifestyles. People became more mobile, both socially and geographically, which often left them feeling isolated compared to those in more stable communities.
Centralized broadcasting addressed the need for governments to efficiently inform all citizens and helped create a sense of unity within the nation-state. The widespread nature of these processes made broadcasting the dominant form for both radio and television. However, it is important to also consider the positive role of broadcasting in supporting democracy. During the period between the World Wars, many countries recognized broadcasting as a way to ensure equal access to information necessary for informed participation in political, social, and cultural life.
Television is evolving, and there is a possibility that the term broadcasting may become outdated or insufficient. If that happens, this metaphor will only refer to a specific organization of audio-visual technology during a certain centralized phase of social modernization."
CPE_13,C2,"**Clutter**  
Sometimes, it feels like no matter how many things you own, you still don’t feel secure. It’s natural to want to create a home that meets your needs, but there comes a point when the desire to acquire more possessions becomes excessive. Modern advertising is designed to exploit our insecurities, often sending the message that if you don’t have certain items, you are somehow less valuable. To see how much advertising influences you, try not to look at any billboards the next time you walk down the street. These expensive advertisements constantly shape our thoughts in persuasive ways, often without us realizing it. We are surrounded by them—on television, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, t-shirts, and the internet—all urging us to buy more.
**Caves**  
Research institutions and universities worldwide have spent years studying caves, focusing on their origins, water systems, and ecosystems. Caves are a small but intriguing part of nature that sparks our curiosity and desire for knowledge, leading to significant research efforts. Their natural presence has been studied for a long time, especially in areas where caves impact our lives. However, exploring caves requires physical skill, which means that cave research often involves both professional scientists and amateur enthusiasts who visit caves for recreation.
**Weather Watch**  
Many observant people, using only their senses, laid the groundwork for meteorology, which has evolved into a complex science since the 17th century. Today, satellites and electronic devices provide us with a constant stream of weather information almost instantly, while computers can solve complicated calculations much faster than humans. Meteorological terms can be difficult for non-professionals to understand, and it may seem like there is no place for simple weather knowledge. However, human experience remains essential in turning data into accurate weather forecasts. Personal observations can still offer valuable insights that help professionals understand the complexities of the atmosphere."
CPE_16,C2,"**MUSIC AND THEATRE**
Until recently, I believed that opera was mainly about theatre. However, after working at a national opera house, I realized that music is actually the most important part of opera. This makes sense, but I come from a theatre background, where the words and the actors are the main focus. In theatre, once the performance starts, there is no one directing the action, and the performers and audience usually share a common language.
At any musical performance, whether in a concert hall or an opera house, there are often many people, like me, who do not have a deep understanding of music. Some may feel embarrassed about their lack of knowledge, while most are simply amazed by the talent of the musicians. A skilled singer or a great string section is easy to admire. Even a decent musician shows the results of years of hard work. Watching top-class music performances is similar to watching athletes compete; we know they are doing something we can relate to, but we also see how much better they are than us.
In contrast, theatre audiences have different expectations. They often do not fully appreciate the skills of actors and may not be impressed by a long, difficult speech, even though actors frequently get asked how they memorize their lines. This does not mean that theatre audiences are less demanding than concert-goers; in fact, many people enjoy both. However, in theatre, audiences and performers often connect on a more equal level, regardless of how challenging the material is.
The question arises: does music need to learn from theatre about this relationship? I believe it does. I have seen how a different approach can enhance the experience for concert-goers. Live music is inherently theatrical, filled with emotions like passion, humor, and intimacy. It can also be unpredictable, engaging the audience's imagination both individually and collectively. 
Current music presentation often follows strict rules, such as formal dress codes and excessive respect for conductors and soloists, which can create a sense of hierarchy between performers and listeners. On the other hand, contemporary audiences sometimes interrupt performances with applause between movements or after impressive pieces, which, while a genuine expression of appreciation, can disrupt the overall flow of the work.
Is there a solution? Yes, many initiatives are underway to attract new audiences to concert halls and opera houses and to break down the barriers that make people feel that ""serious"" music is not for them. I recall a remarkable event, the community opera *In Search of Angels*, which took place in various locations within a cathedral and the surrounding town. This experience was not only musically enriching but also transformative for many audience members, who were actively involved in the performance.
What I long for in music is more of the risk and creativity that the best theatre can offer. This can come from using unusual or challenging locations that disrupt normal expectations, leading to surprising effects for both performers and audiences. While some plays are presented in conventional ways, I believe there is potential for change in how music is experienced.
As an enthusiastic supporter of both theatre and music, I want both art forms to flourish and for more people to enjoy the joy I find in being part of the audience."
CPE_21,C2,"**Sand**  
While I appreciate how sand can be turned into useful things like glass and concrete, I don’t really like it in its natural form. To me, it feels like an annoying barrier between a parking lot and the sea. It blows into your face, gets into your food, and can even swallow important items like car keys and coins. When you’re wet, it sticks to you like glue and is hard to remove, even with a powerful hose. However, the strange thing is that as soon as you step onto a beach towel, get into a car, or walk on a clean carpet, it falls off you easily. For days, you find it mysteriously appearing on the floor every time you take off your shoes, and even more comes out when you remove your socks. Sand seems to stay with you longer than some illnesses. So, I would prefer to avoid sand altogether.
**Lock and Key**  
The desire for a safe home, privacy, and security has been around since people first built permanent homes. While old wooden beams have been replaced by electronic locks that use plastic cards with many combinations, the need to keep out intruders remains. The idea of a lock and key is partly psychological. Recently, some companies have tried using computerized locking systems, where smart cards control electronic locks. However, people generally don’t like these systems. You might accept them at work, but at home, most people prefer the comfort of using a physical key. Because of this, when a locksmith company created a new electronic system, they made sure to include a traditional metal key.
**Modern Art**  
I felt nervous about visiting the new Tate Modern gallery because, like many people, I find modern art confusing. I do enjoy some pieces, especially furry objects, neon light sculptures, and large photographs. Maybe if I knew more about modern art, I would have stronger opinions. However, art isn’t meant to be understood in a strict way; it should connect with you. This is a great idea, but it hasn’t worked for me in the past. The new gallery tries to give visitors real insight into the meaning behind the artworks. The first thing I noticed was the informative labels that provide context and explain what the art is about. Instead of just staring at the pieces as I used to, these helpful details allowed me to understand them better."
CPE_46,C2,"**Every Picture Tells a Story**
Adapting novels into films often requires cutting down and simplifying the original material. This can be frustrating for writers, but it can also provide new insights. While working on a script, I realized that I could remove much of the dialogue and description from a scene in the novel and still convey the same message. This doesn’t mean that the original dialogue and descriptions were unnecessary; rather, it reflects how each medium engages the audience differently. 
In novels, ""redundancy"" refers to the repeated mention of character traits and speech tags like ""he said."" A character's trait only needs to be described once, but reminders help the reader understand better. In dialogue, we can often tell who is speaking from the context, but speech tags make it easier to follow. In stage plays, which focus on dialogue, this redundancy mimics real conversation, sometimes to the point where the dialogue seems overly repetitive, serving only to connect the speakers without clear communication.
**Watching Movies**
When watching movies, viewers can feel completely immersed in the film's world, escaping from reality for the duration of the movie. This experience can make it seem like what happens during the film is not important. However, once the movie ends and the lights come on, that illusion is shattered, and we return to our everyday lives. Many people, especially from older generations, viewed movies as mere entertainment rather than art. While they enjoyed being entertained, they did not appreciate films as a serious form of artistic expression.
**The Film Studios**
The Leiper Film Company studios were a confusing mix of buildings. Although there were some recognizable places, like the Script Department, most of the studio consisted of small, similarly furnished rooms. These rooms were used for both official meetings and informal discussions, and they were hard to tell apart, identified only by a strange system of letters and numbers. The studio lacked a clear main entrance, having three equal entrances that did not help visitors find their way. For outsiders, the layout was very confusing, but the employees, who were familiar with the place, managed to navigate it well. Through their teamwork, they created films that allowed audiences to escape from everyday problems and enjoy stories of romance and adventure.
**Film-Makers**
Many people dream of making movies. Bookstores are filled with guides on scriptwriting and film production, and universities offer related courses. There are even competitions that reward aspiring filmmakers with equipment, like the camera used by Robert Rodriguez for his film *El Mariachi*, which cost only $7,000 and launched his career. Rodriguez reflects on his early success, noting that he felt pressure to achieve his breakthrough film before turning 26, just like famous directors Orson Welles and Steven Spielberg did.
In the past, filmmakers were expected to take their time to develop their skills, often working behind the scenes as editors or writers before directing. For example, John Huston was 35 when he made his first film, *The Maltese Falcon*, and Fred Zinnemann, who directed *High Noon*, found success in his forties. Today, without the support of studios or television, aspiring filmmakers often have to forge their own paths."
CPE_3,C2,"In the past, the council houses were spread across the western part of the city, forming rows of small, worn-down homes made of orange brick or pale white stucco. In the summer, the chemicals from the May and Baker factory, located two miles away, created a strong smell of sulphur that lingered around the doors and gardens. One common sight in that area of Norwich in the morning was a paperboy wrinkling his nose in disgust as he walked along someone’s front path. I have forgotten much of my early life, but I remember sitting near an upstairs window, looking at the houses as they disappeared into the distance. 
There are also other memories, like my mother ironing towels in a house that I don’t think was ours, and snow falling on the turrets of a large mansion in Earlham. It is not surprising that my mother appears in these early memories. I remember her as a small, precise, and often angry woman, and I never fully understood the reason for her anger, so I couldn’t do anything to make it better. Even as a child, when I went with her to the small shops in Bunnett Square or on longer trips into the city, I sensed something unusual about her personality. She was the most solitary person I have ever known, feeling just as alone in a crowded room as she would on a moor. 
Her solitude was combined with a strict sense of propriety that was unusual for the West Earlham estate. This sometimes resulted in intense spring-cleaning sessions or her telling me to ""behave properly."" I found this moral code hard to understand, and even now, I’m not sure I fully grasp it. It meant not wandering into neighbors' gardens or damaging their rose bushes while walking down the street. It also meant sitting quietly for long periods in a dining room, hands folded, listening to radio programs my mother enjoyed. There were many rules and restrictions.
Over time, other figures appeared in these strict early memories. Despite her solitude, my mother had friends. There was Mrs. Buddery, who was obsessed with the Royal Family; Mrs. Winall, who rarely spoke except to agree with others; and Mrs. Laband, who was more lively and not always approved of by the others. Later, I realized how poor their company was. They formed a gloomy group, often talking about their bad legs, the cold weather, and ungrateful children, a category I often felt I belonged to. Looking back, it felt like a heavy weight made up of the West Earlham houses, my mother, her friends, and the pressure to ""behave properly"" was resting on my shoulders, and I felt it was my duty to grow up and free myself from it. 
However, this was not easy. Growing up in West Earlham followed a strict routine. Until you turned five, you stayed at home and got in your parents' way. I remember long, aimless days when I was about four, playing on a rug while my mother sat coldly in an armchair. Then, in September after your fifth birthday, you were sent to Avenue Road infants school, half a mile away. The lucky children had mothers with old bikes and child seats, which were unusual but helpful. I think my mother let me go with other children from the street for this journey. 
If I remember anything from those early years, it’s the summer holidays, when I caught glimpses of the world outside West Earlham. There was a vague old man next to Mrs. Buddery who told stories about his time in the Merchant Navy. Once, there was a charity fair at a house far away on Christchurch Road, where a kind woman offered lemonade and tried to get me interested in something called the League of Pity, a kind of junior charity. However, my mother dismissed it, saying the organizers were ""only after your money."" 
My mother often talked about mercenary motives, and she had a deep contempt for politicians. If she thought about the House of Commons, which I doubt she did, she probably imagined it as a fancy post office where wealthy people opened letters filled with money sent by gullible citizens. I might be exaggerating and overlooking her good qualities while focusing on her flaws. But there was little kindness in my mother; it seemed to have been drained from her. 
To be fair, she was aware of her role in my education. Occasionally, on Sundays, she would take me, dressed in my ""good clothes,"" on the 85 bus to the Norwich Castle Museum. Hand in hand, we would walk through rooms filled with paintings by the Norwich School of Artists. My mother didn’t completely dislike this activity and eventually developed some opinions about the art. I remember her stopping in front of a painting of a Roman soldier in full armor and saying, ""Well, I wouldn’t want to meet him on a dark night!"" This was one of the few times I recall my mother trying to make a joke."
CPE_10,C2,"**Philadelphia Avenue**
I walked down the odd-numbered side of Philadelphia Avenue. The evening was getting darker, and the air was humid with a light drizzle that made my walk feel secretive. I knew this side of the street well; I remembered our neighbors, the Matzes and the Pritchards, Han Kieffer's grocery store, and the houses of my first playmates, all girls. Although I didn’t know everyone by name, each house was as familiar to me as the small channels in the sidewalk that carried rainwater from the roofs to the street, which I would skate or scoot over. 
As the street sloped downwards, I noticed a slight decline in the social status of the houses: the porches were lower, and the front yards were smaller. Over the years, things changed: wooden porch railings were replaced with wrought iron in a style that reminded me of the South or Spain. In Shillington, houses I remembered as homes had turned into stores, and strangely, some stores, like Pep Conrad's and Han Kieffer's, had become homes again. I wondered how the residents adapted to these changes and lived with the lingering smells of the goods that used to be sold there.
**Bachelor Fads Furniture Designer Rick Gilbert**
Rick Gilbert, a furniture designer, lives in a former curtain warehouse. His flat has the typical features of a loft, like exposed brick and large doors that once allowed curtains to be moved from trains. However, Gilbert did not want an empty, open space. He found it difficult to separate his living area from his work area in his last home. To create a more defined space, he used a large piece of corrugated plastic near the entrance. This not only hid his office but also created a hallway and directed attention to the kitchen in the middle of the flat. He wanted the kitchen to be a neutral space where he could cook for friends or make coffee for clients. 
To balance the modern look of his plastic screen and stainless steel kitchen, Gilbert chose light wood for the floors. His flat is filled with futuristic chairs and sofas, but it also contains sentimental furniture given to him by his parents or found at markets.
**Bruce Chatwin**
Bruce Chatwin's life was a mix of adventure and mystery, making it a topic of literary discussion. He was a talented and original writer, known for his first book, *In Patagonia*, published in 1977. This book changed travel writing, combining elements of a thriller, romantic fiction, and deep literary insight. Even in this work, Chatwin blended fact with fiction, often altering reality to enhance his stories. He suggested that through travel, one could uncover rich histories meant to inspire future explorers.
**Swimming**
During a warm summer rain, I rushed across my lawn and jumped into the pool. As I swam, I kept my eyes just above the water. Each raindrop created small splashes that turned into bubbles. The best moments were when the rain intensified, drowning out the birdsong, and steam rose from the water as if the pool was reaching up to the sky. 
In the summer of 1996, while enjoying this rain, I began to think about swimming across Britain. I wanted to follow the rain as it traveled to the sea, escaping the frustration of my usual swimming routine, which felt like pacing in a cage. 
Many of us live in a world where everything is labeled and interpreted, which can make reality feel less genuine. This is why activities like walking, cycling, and swimming are so important; they allow us to reconnect with the wild and ancient parts of our world by stepping off the beaten path and breaking free from the official narratives. A swimming journey would let me explore the mysterious parts of our world, like dark forests or high mountains."
CPE_67,C2,"**Crying**
Charles Darwin believed that crying did not have a clear purpose in human evolution. However, recent research suggests he was likely mistaken. Scientists, including psychiatrist John Bowlby, have emphasized the importance of crying in forming the bond between a mother and her child. Many people think that tears, especially in children, mainly show feelings of helplessness. 
Understanding why adults cry is more complicated. It appears that the sound of crying is less important than the visual message it sends. Crying may have been beneficial for early human groups by helping to build trust and social connections. 
There are also other reasons for crying. We might cry to show sympathy for those facing great injustice. Sometimes, tears come unexpectedly, even when we feel embarrassed, such as when we hear touching music or powerful speeches. We often cry while watching emotional movies, and interestingly, this happens more when we are with others than when we are alone. The social role of crying seems clear, but research on this topic is ongoing."
CPE_27,C2,"**The Heat is On**
We have all heard about global warming, but how much warmer will the Earth become, and how will it affect our lives? Most people understand the basic idea of global warming, but the specific consequences are less clear. A warmer climate is likely to change the weather everywhere in the world. Since the atmosphere is closely connected to every part of our planet, any climate changes will significantly impact plants, animals, water, and soil. Humans have learned to use these natural resources to our advantage, allowing us to grow food, build cities, and support a population of six billion. Therefore, any changes to these resources must be taken seriously.
The challenge we face is understanding how the world will change and what is causing these changes. Over the last century, human activities have greatly increased the levels of certain gases in the atmosphere, which are linked to global temperatures. These rising gas levels are likely already affecting the global climate, but our limited understanding of the Earth's heat balance makes it hard to predict the current and future situations accurately.
We know that greenhouse gas levels have varied in close relation to global temperatures over the past 40,000 years, suggesting a strong connection between the two. Evidence indicates that the Earth's surface has warmed by about 6°C in the last century. Most scientists believe this warming is not entirely natural and is partly due to human pollution.
A lot of research has been done to predict the effects of higher global temperatures. Most of this research uses computer models called general circulation models (GCMs). These models run on powerful computers and use the laws of physics and chemistry to analyze how temperature, pressure, solar radiation, and other factors interact to predict climate conditions for the past, present, and future. However, these models simplify reality and have many limitations. Their predictions are only rough estimates, and they can be slow and costly to run. We do not fully understand all the processes in the climate system, even though we recognize its complexity.
Despite these challenges, most experts agree on one crucial point: the rate of climate change will be faster than anything we have experienced before. The predictions from GCMs provide some insight into the world we will live in over the next few generations. They suggest that by the year 2100, the average global surface temperature could rise by between 1°C and 3.5°C, sea levels could increase by 15-95 cm, and changes in rainfall patterns will occur. Scientists also expect extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, floods, and droughts, to become more common in some areas. These forecasts highlight the potential impact of climate change on both the natural environment and human life.
Climate change could alter the locations of ecosystems like forests and grasslands, the variety of species they support, and their ability to provide essential resources for society. This includes food production, water supply, and human settlements. Many of the effects could be negative and possibly irreversible. However, not all impacts will be harmful. Some scientists have identified positive environmental trends linked to the warming that has already occurred. For instance, in Australia, research shows that wheat yields have increased by about 0.5 tonnes per hectare since 1952, partly due to rising minimum temperatures, which have reduced frost damage to crops.
On the other hand, even small climate changes can affect water availability, either through long-term drying or more frequent droughts. Problems are likely to arise first in dry regions and in areas where demand or pollution have already caused shortages. The Mediterranean Basin is one example, where decreasing rainfall has been observed in recent decades, particularly in western-central areas. In southern Portugal's Alentejo region, rainfall has become more concentrated in autumn and winter, while spring rainfall has decreased.
Another concerning effect of climate change is its impact on glaciers, which will affect ice levels and, in turn, vegetation, wildlife habitats, and human infrastructure. There is a strong possibility that the Arctic ice cover will completely melt, making marine transport and oil exploration easier but increasing the risk of icebergs.
Perhaps the most dramatic effect of global warming will be the rise in sea levels. This will happen due to the expansion of warmer ocean water and melting ice. With about half of the world's population living in coastal areas, rising sea levels could have severe consequences. Increased flooding and inundation are likely outcomes, threatening cities like London, New York, and Tokyo. Many people could lose their homes and livelihoods, leading to millions of environmental refugees. The most severe impacts may be felt by small, low-lying island nations, which could disappear entirely if worst-case scenarios occur. This would be devastating not only for the people and cultures of these islands but also for the countries that would need to accommodate those displaced."
CPE_66,C2,"**Mission to Mars**
Wanted: a middle-aged, married couple for a 501-day round trip to Mars. Applicants must be physically and emotionally strong. This will be the profile of the first astronauts on Mars if multi-millionaire Dennis Tito's plans to launch a capsule on January 5, 2018, succeed. The capsule will take the crew to about 160 km above Mars. The spacecraft will use Mars' gravity to return to Earth without using extra fuel, as fuel efficiency is very important. The 2018 deadline is set because the next time Mars and Earth will be aligned for a launch is in 2031. 
It is a challenging task, but there is a race to develop new technologies for this mission. If these technologies are ready in time, the spacecraft may succeed. Even if the mission does not launch, the work done to reach these ambitious goals will still be valuable for future missions."
CPE_44,C2,"**AESTHETICS**
Ironically, the existence of artworks, which is essential for developing aesthetic theory, can actually hinder our understanding of them. This is because artworks are physical objects, like buildings, books, paintings, or statues, that exist separately from human experience. However, the true essence of an artwork lies in how it interacts with our experiences, which complicates our understanding.
Moreover, the perfection and long-standing admiration of certain artworks create established ideas that can block new insights. Once an artwork is considered a classic, it often becomes disconnected from the human experiences that led to its creation and the effects it has on our lives. When we separate artworks from their origins and their impact on our experiences, we create a barrier that makes it difficult to grasp their broader significance, which is what aesthetic theory aims to explore. Art then exists in a separate world, detached from the materials and goals of other human endeavors.
Therefore, anyone writing about the philosophy of fine arts faces a significant challenge: to reconnect the refined experiences that artworks provide with the everyday events and struggles that everyone recognizes as part of life. Just as mountains are not isolated but are part of the earth's processes, artworks should not be seen as separate from human experience.
If we accept this idea, we may reach a surprising conclusion. To truly understand artistic products, we may need to temporarily set them aside and focus on the ordinary experiences that we usually do not consider aesthetic. We must take a detour to reach a deeper understanding of art. While it is possible to enjoy flowers for their beauty and scent without knowing about plants, understanding how they grow requires knowledge of the interactions between soil, air, water, and sunlight.
To grasp the essence of art, we must start with raw experiences—those moments and scenes that capture our attention and bring us joy. However, many people are so influenced by the idea that art is something distant and separate that they might be surprised to learn that they enjoy their everyday activities partly because of their aesthetic qualities. 
The arts that resonate most with people today often do not fit the traditional definition of art. For example, movies, jazz, comic strips, and even sensational news stories are forms of expression that many people enjoy. When art is confined to museums and galleries, people seek enjoyment in their daily lives instead. 
Even those who criticize the museum view of art may still hold onto the mistaken belief that art should be separate from ordinary experiences. The times when people appreciate art the most are when it is closely linked to everyday activities and objects."
CPE_22,C2,"**Observing Lions**
Many people imagine lions hunting as a beautiful display of teamwork. In the fading light of sunset, a group of stealthy lions appears like skilled hunters, surrounding their unsuspecting prey. They seem to be perfect social animals, setting aside their differences to work together for a common goal: their next meal. However, after years of studying these animals in the wild, we have a different perspective. 
When we began our research in 1978, we wanted to understand why lions hunt together, raise their young, and scare off rivals with their loud roars. If we measure an animal's success by how many offspring survive, then cooperation might not be beneficial. If one animal is too generous, it may end up helping others at its own expense. So, why do lions seem to ignore the rules of self-interest? We thought we could answer this question in two to three years, but lions are very good at being inactive. We would add them to the list of unreactive noble gases like krypton, argon, and neon. It has taken various research methods to find clues about their behavior. Since wild lions can live up to 18 years, we are only now starting to understand the answers to our questions.
**Pop Music Review**
The release of Bedrock's third album marked a significant moment in the career of a talented but previously unstable band. ""New Life"" started a movement that changed the direction of rock music in this country for the rest of the decade. Gone were the serious themes, dull clothing, and heavy guitars of the past; instead, a lighter mix of catchy local styles emerged. This album combined social commentary and strong emotions with sounds from fairground organs and brass bands. Humor and irony were prominent, and the singers proudly expressed their backgrounds.
The album showed Bedrock as skilled collectors and observers, as well as clever songwriters. They playfully addressed traditional English themes like sunbathing and lazy Sundays. However, the true strength of the album lay in its deeper, more emotional tracks, such as ""So Low,"" a beautiful song loosely based on weather, and ""To the Brink,"" a serious ballad. The beauty of ""New Life"" is its consistently high quality—16 tracks with no filler, making it an outstanding record in an era of long CDs.
**Extract from an Autobiography**
As a child, I was always intrigued by stories of 'The Sibyl,' the wise women who had great influence in ancient times. Initially, I only knew of one from a story my mother told me. An old woman from Cumae offered King Tarquin of Rome nine books for 300 gold pieces. When he refused, she burned three books and offered him six for the same price. After he refused again, she burned three more. He eventually bought the last three for the full price. I realized there was a deep lesson in this story about salesmanship and life.
As an only child, I often felt lonely. I would ask to play with other children, but they would say no. My mother advised me to do something so interesting that the other kids would want to join me. It worked, and it’s a lesson I’ve never forgotten. When I had the opportunity to write a travel book, I needed to find a topic that mattered to me. I’m not a keen traveler; I even sent my editor a long list of places I didn’t want to visit. I’m mainly interested in ruins because I prefer to travel through time in my mind.
**What Happens to Your Manuscript?**
When you submit your manuscript, it will likely join a pile of other submissions waiting to be reviewed, known as the slush pile. The person sorting through these submissions is usually either a junior member of the editorial team (often under 18) or an experienced freelancer who works a few mornings a week. Neither has much power, but they are generally looking for something original— the junior hopes to make a name for themselves, while the freelancer wants to justify their job.
If they find your novel promising, they will pass it to a senior editor, and it will eventually be discussed in an acquisition meeting. The editor who supports your novel must explain why it deserves to be accepted based on its quality and potential sales. They also need to consider whether you, as an author, seem like a long-term investment, which you should have assured them of in your letter. Additionally, they will evaluate how marketable you are, as this is crucial for promoting a new novel. For this reason, publishers often prefer to meet potential authors before making an offer."
CPE_39,C2,"**Advertising on Trial**
If you work in an advertising agency, the early 1990s were likely very challenging. The recession was worse than expected, affecting industrialized countries for thirty years. In Britain, 1991 saw a decline in the economy, high interest rates, reduced consumer spending, job losses for over half a million people, and many homes being repossessed. Every business was impacted, with some sectors, like vehicles and construction, seeing a 30% drop in activity. Many people and companies around the world faced difficulties.
While advertising professionals were not the only ones losing jobs, those who remained often felt intense pressure. They were seen as responsible for helping companies improve their financial performance, which meant they were closely watched by their colleagues and bosses. Additionally, they had to manage increasingly difficult tasks with shrinking budgets, being told that ""less is more."" Despite these challenges, the importance of marketing grew. Companies began to focus more on creating products and services that customers actually wanted, rather than just what was easy for them to produce. 
As a result, marketing activities started to receive more attention from management, leading to a better understanding of the field and some brands being effectively marketed. This shift raised the status of marketing professionals but also increased their workload. Marketing began to be viewed as a solution to many problems, even though it is not a guaranteed fix. Since about half of marketing budgets go to advertising, the pressure on advertising professionals intensified. 
The 1980s were a prosperous time for advertising, but the early 1990s marked a significant downturn for the industry. This decline was partly due to the economic situation, but deeper changes were also occurring. The recession led clients to reassess their advertising budgets and question the effectiveness of their spending. Many companies struggled to see the return on their advertising investments, making them skeptical about its value. 
As a result, clients demanded better strategies, targeting, creativity, media placement, and overall thinking from their advertising agencies. They wanted the best talent working on their accounts and expected outstanding results. While this situation does not necessarily evoke sympathy for advertising professionals, it highlights that they faced the same challenges as their clients: how to achieve more with less.
Several factors made effective advertising even harder to produce. Some were direct results of the recession, such as debates over production costs and a reluctance to take risks, which are often essential for good advertising. Other changes were happening regardless of the economy, including demographic shifts, the growing power of retailers, changing consumer needs, the rise of sponsorship, and stricter advertising regulations. Additionally, some companies faced the new challenge of advertising in foreign markets.
These issues, combined with the economic climate, forced advertising professionals to reconsider the famous saying by Lord Leverhulme: ""Only half my advertising works. The trouble is I don't know which half."" The pressure to increase the effectiveness of advertising has never been greater. Unfortunately, support for those looking to improve their advertising strategies is not readily available. Companies and agencies have been too busy managing these challenges to share their experiences, and those who have succeeded often keep their strategies private. 
While conferences and seminars may offer some insights, the available literature on advertising often fails to provide practical guidance. Many books treat the advertising process with excessive reverence, suggesting that the work produced by agencies is always of high quality and value, which is not the case. This misconception does not help the employees at client companies who are ultimately responsible for the outcomes."
CPE_18,C2,"**The Allure of Cooking**
When I was in university, I decided I wanted to become a chef. This choice was unusual among my peers, as cooking was not a popular career. Many saw it as an unattractive profession. Chefs often have tough lives: the work is long, stressful, repetitive, and poorly paid. However, these factors did not discourage me. I was unhappy at university; the studies were difficult, and the social life felt closed off and self-important. Becoming a chef seemed like the perfect escape from the pretentiousness of college life. It offered a sense of seriousness and integrity that I felt was missing in my studies.
My desire to cook was not just a reaction to my university experience; it also reflected my appreciation for beauty in food. This appreciation began when I had a meal at a well-known restaurant in London. It was a life-changing experience. I still remember my starter vividly. After that meal, I felt so moved that I wanted to kneel and thank the chef. I felt light and happy for days. This inspired me to learn the secrets of this wonderful art. I turned my student life into preparation for my future in cooking. My history degree felt meaningless, distracting me from my true passion. I learned about cooking by reading cookbooks, exploring markets, and preparing elaborate meals.
**The Swimming Instructor**
The swimming instructor at my school was a former drill sergeant, small but muscular, with tattoos on his arms. When I asked him to teach me how to dive, he instructed me to sit on the edge of the pool, raise my hands above my head, and roll forward, pushing off with my feet. I practiced this until the lesson ended. The next time, he had me stand up and dive off the edge. He was strict, and every time I surfaced, he looked at me disapprovingly, saying things like, ""Don't look down, look up!"" and ""Keep your legs straight!"" 
The following week, I climbed up to the high diving board. It felt incredibly high as I stood there, trying to gather my courage. Gradually, the noise around me faded, and I felt like I was in a bubble of silence. I waved my arms as I had been taught, tried to look up instead of down, and jumped into the air. For a brief moment, I felt like I was flying. When I hit the water, I landed awkwardly, and my legs flailed. The instructor looked at me with disappointment, but even he couldn't take away my joy. I thought to myself, ""This is what they mean by 'free as a bird.'""
**The Traveler**
For those of us who value comfort, safety, and the likelihood of living a long life, the idea of a traveler can seem strange and fascinating. These are people who willingly take risks, climbing dangerous mountains, sailing alone on small boats in rough seas, and eating whatever they can find, even if it’s not appetizing. They can live for months in uncertainty, always seeking the unknown. 
It’s easy to see these travelers as odd or eccentric, like hermits or extreme sports enthusiasts. While they do exist, their unusual world is far from our daily lives, and we often dismiss it as irrelevant. We can simply return to our comfortable lives, grateful that our risks are predictable, like crossing a busy street.
**Sailing**
Jonathan Raban is afraid of the sea, which is likely why he spends so much time on it. He doesn’t claim to be an expert sailor, but he is skilled. As a writer, he enjoys sailing because it gives him stories to tell. His small boat has a device that shows his exact location anywhere on Earth. While he appreciates this technology, he also believes that the invention of the compass harmed the connection between humans and the sea. 
Raban argues that since the compass was invented, sailors have focused too much on it and not enough on understanding the ocean. The sea, once full of life and activity, has become just a space to navigate. Because of this, a sailor can often rely on autopilot, which may be why Raban has time to observe the waves closely."
CPE_62,C2,"**Holiday Reading**
Summer brings us two great joys: escaping home and reading books. These joys are closely connected. Books can help us feel more at home in the wider world. We can relate our own experiences to those in classic books from the past or from different cultures because there are more similarities among people than differences. In the stories of others, we find our own thoughts, feelings, and struggles. Authors can express emotions we thought we were alone in feeling, using words that capture our experiences with clarity and insight. What we feel shy or confused about is clearly articulated by them, which is even more impressive if the author is from a distant place or a different time. We feel thankful to these writers for helping us understand ourselves better.
Through reading and traveling, we break free from our daily routines. Our awareness is heightened when we first arrive in a new place, just as it is when we read a great book that reveals things we might have overlooked before. Our minds become more alert, noticing the colors of the sky, the expressions on faces, the insincerity of friends, or a sadness we didn’t realize we felt. 
**Author's Note**
These reflections on travel were published as articles in the Observer newspaper over seven years. I have made some small edits to restore parts cut by the editor for space, but I have added very little. I corrected a few obvious mistakes, but only minor details that I should have gotten right initially. With hindsight, I could have made more improvements, but that would have been endless. For instance, in my second article about China, I thought the Hong Kong dollar would remain stable, but it fell a year later. If I rewrote it to include this prediction, it would no longer reflect my thoughts at that time. Like any traveler in Southeast Asia or elsewhere, I was there in the moment, unaware of what would happen next, focused on understanding what had already occurred. This is the essence of modern air travel: the world opening up to people who have no special qualifications to explore it, except for the price of a ticket. However, I believe my fellow travelers were not completely unaware. Even a simple postcard can have a purpose.
**Ecotourism**
If there were awards for tourism terms that have been misused, ""ecotourism"" would win first place. This term appeared in the early 1980s, reflecting a growing awareness of environmental issues and a realization by tour operators that many travelers wanted to ensure their trips would not harm the places they visited. It quickly became a popular marketing term for vacations. Today, ""ecotourism"" can refer to anything from a two-week stay with remote tribes to a one-hour boat ride through an Australian gorge. Any tour that includes cultural experiences, beautiful natural sites, wildlife, or a bit of adventure is likely to be labeled as ecotourism. While the original intentions were good, the lack of clear regulations and definitions has left many travelers confused in the ecotourism landscape.
**Transylvanian Journey**
I lost my notebook from my journey in Transylvania for 50 years, but I was lucky to find it a few years ago. It has helped me remember that time and write about it, but it hasn’t been as reliable as I hoped. In Transylvania, I had a much easier experience than I expected, moving from one welcoming country house to another and often staying for weeks. When I settled in during these long stays, I stopped writing, thinking there was nothing to record. I was slow to start writing again when I moved on, and sometimes I only made brief notes instead of detailed accounts. Worried that some details might be out of order when I began writing this book, I surrounded those sections with many qualifications. However, I realized that these pages were not meant to be a guidebook, so I decided to let the story unfold naturally without too many restrictions."
CPE_49,C2,"**Fashion**
Fashion is often thought to be a recent development, mainly influenced by capitalism in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. However, many fashion historians argue that the concept of style and design has a much longer history. They often trace its beginnings to the growth of trade in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. As societies have become more complex, populations have grown, and new technologies for creating various types of clothing and accessories have emerged, the meanings associated with dress have also become more intricate and significant. Therefore, it is challenging to determine what any piece of clothing or accessory truly represents today. For instance, a man's suit, which is often seen as a symbol of uniformity, can have very different meanings depending on the context and the person interpreting it.
**Writer**
Media reports about publishers competing for popular manuscripts can create a misleading image of life for most novelists. In my experience, which is far from being at the top of the best-seller lists, there are two main ways to make a living. The smartest writers work in the evenings and have other full-time jobs that provide security, even if their books are not quickly published or made into films. Others, like me, take on various writing-related jobs, such as teaching, conducting workshops, and writing articles. I have heard of a writing job at a chocolate factory, but I have never found anything like that. Nevertheless, by balancing part-time jobs, using credit cards, and often relying on the kindness of those mentioned in the Acknowledgements section of books, I manage to write my novel.
**Sudden Fame**
The small venues where we performed across the country were starting to sell out, and we needed extra security to manage the growing number of excited fans. We had to use secret entrances to avoid being overwhelmed by admirers at the village halls and ballrooms where we played. On the few nights we were not performing, it was hard to leave home without being followed by enthusiastic fans. In just a few days, we became celebrities. Our actions were closely watched by our fans, and our management took care of all our needs. Although my natural shyness never completely disappeared, it was replaced by a strange, naive confidence that only those who are usually shy and suddenly find themselves in the spotlight can understand. In short, I felt completely out of my depth emotionally."
CPE_31,C2,"**Music - The Challenge Ahead**
Technological advancements are changing our lives in many areas, including music. Susan Hallam examines how these changes affect music in Britain. In the late 20th century, there was a significant increase in ways to listen to music, such as through radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, videos, and new multimedia technologies. However, this growth has led to a decrease in live music performances and full-time jobs for professional musicians.
It is clear that access to music will keep expanding, as it meets many human needs. Music is essential for national events and offers many activities for individuals, both formal and informal. A society without music is hard to imagine. The real question is not whether music will exist in the 21st century, but what type of music it will be and whether people will still feel the need to learn to play instruments.
I believe there will still be a strong interest in learning instruments. The music industry is a major source of income in Britain, and musical skills will remain important for various professions, especially in media-related fields. Additionally, research shows that playing an instrument can help develop skills early on. Studies in the USA suggest that listening to or making music positively affects spatial reasoning, a measure of intelligence. Although these findings need further confirmation, other European studies indicate that group music lessons can improve social relationships in schools and help children focus, especially those with behavioral issues.
Current research is also exploring how playing an instrument might develop transferable skills. For example, regular practice can lead to better study habits and concentration, while performing in concerts can teach punctuality and organization. Therefore, there will likely be a continued demand for instrumental teaching in the near future.
Looking further ahead, will there be a change in focus, and if so, what will it be? I see two likely possibilities. First, the types of music people listen to will become more varied, with new genres emerging that blend different styles. Second, technology will play a larger role in composing and performing music, making it easier for more people to create music without needing advanced technical skills. However, this may also reduce the need for live performances and musicians focused solely on that.
At the same time, more people of all ages may want to engage in music-making, often in community settings that reflect local musical traditions. If this future is to happen, the music profession must prepare. Instrumental teaching will need to adapt to help more people learn various instruments throughout their lives. This will require changes in the curriculum and assessment methods to stay relevant for a wider audience.
Training for musicians will be essential. They must learn to motivate and teach students of all ages, work with diverse groups, and develop skills in communication, social interaction, entrepreneurship, and community management. This represents a significant shift from traditional methods and will require accountability to the public. 
Positively, this change offers a chance for those in music education to showcase the high quality of music teaching available. Finally, we must work to elevate the importance of music in our lives, as it is often taken for granted. Everyone in the music profession should collaborate to ensure that music receives the recognition it deserves."
CPE_58,C2,"**The Actor's Craft**
Actors sometimes face criticism and disdain, often fueled by their own words during interviews about their craft. Instead of sharing deep insights, they often resort to clichés or gossip. The actor Paul Scofield once wrote that an actor's work is most alive when performed, but loses its essence when discussed. He believed that acting has no strict rules, except perhaps for being heard. Each time an actor performs, they start anew, learning from the characters and the playwright. After a performance, they often feel empty until the next role, and this emptiness is evident in discussions about their work.
**A Review of Hamlet**
Adrian Lester's portrayal of Hamlet captures the character's transition from boyhood to manhood with simplicity and confidence. His control over the text and his physical presence elevate him from a promising actor to a leading performer. Lester plays Hamlet as a young man filled with anger, yet he balances this with sharp wit and humor, making him both intimidating and endearing. His physicality, such as the way his arms hang, suggests a character waiting to be brought to life. Similarly, Handy's portrayal of Horatio conveys a sense of being moved by an inner force, both known and unknown.
**What is Acting?**
This raises the question: What is acting? Is it merely copying behavior, or does it evoke something deeper? What gives life to these characters, both morally and physically? This is a fundamental question in theatre.
**One Director's Approach to Rehearsal**
One director's rehearsal method is called ""dropping in."" In this process, the stage manager displays the script on a screen while actors listen quietly. When it’s their turn to speak, they read the first line, reflect on its meaning, and wait for the impulse to speak. For example, if the line is about queuing in the rain, they might visualize a memory related to that experience. The director encourages actors to be open-minded and trust that something will emerge naturally during the rehearsal.
**The Perfect Theatre**
The ideal theatre should make the audience feel their presence matters. Attending a live performance should feel special, and the staff should share this sense of importance. It can be alienating if the front-of-house staff seem indifferent. The theatre must create a connection between performers and the audience, ensuring that everyone feels engaged and not distanced from the action on stage. The design of the auditorium is crucial; it should complement the human voice and body. If the space feels too large, it detracts from the experience. Many theatres built in the late nineteenth century successfully created an intimate atmosphere that embraces the stage. I appreciate theatres that carry a sense of history, like worn stone steps in a church, reflecting layers of human experience. 
When it comes to plays, it’s impossible to please everyone. You cannot predict what an audience will want to see. When you go to the theatre, you seek something unexpected; otherwise, you might as well stay home."
CPE_37,C2,"**Paul Simon**
Rock and roll in the 1950s was mainly a music movement for young people, but it also had a significant effect on the middle class and older generations. This genre opened doors for future rock stars, who listened to it with admiration, knowing that this unique and exciting sound would be connected to their futures. For Paul Simon and many other young people in the US, the best way to hear this new music was through Alan Freed's radio show, Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party. Freed's show became essential listening for a whole generation of aspiring rock stars. Just like young John Lennon, who was 3,000 miles away in Liverpool, listening to Radio Luxembourg—the only European station playing rock and roll—Paul Simon was captivated by the music from Freed's show. He was getting ready for the next big step for a teenager obsessed with rock and roll: moving from listening to creating his own music.
**Snow**
I couldn’t see a clear path, but I thought I would be fine if I walked carefully. The wind was strong, pushing me over as I struggled on the icy ground. Suddenly, the snow that looked harmless gave way beneath me, and I fell into a hole about four feet deep. The snow had formed a roof over a gap between two rocks, and when it melted, it left only a thin layer that I fell through. I managed to pull myself out, feeling shaken and worried about what would have happened if the hole had been much deeper. I leaned against a pine tree sticking out of the snow to think about my situation. After an hour, I had only gone about half a mile. It was clear that I would have to change my plans.
**Qualitative Research**
Many books now offer guidance for researchers on qualitative research. While there is a lot of information about how to collect data, these books often do not explain how to analyze that data. There is still a lot of confusion about how researchers go about analyzing their findings. To address this, we invited various social scientists who have worked on qualitative projects to share the methods they used. The goal was to provide insights into the process of qualitative data analysis, rather than create a guidebook for new researchers. This task involves clarifying the hidden steps in the analysis process. Although this may seem easy, we found it quite challenging. Therefore, we allowed our contributors to present their work in different styles, including personal stories and more formal approaches."
CPE_2,C2,"**Screen Learning**
Recently, I saw my six-year-old son eating noodles in a funny way. He was pretending to be a dinosaur, pulling the noodles up with his teeth and trying to look fierce. When I asked him what he knew about dinosaurs, he didn’t remember much. There is a current trend to use the internet and computers for learning, but is this method effective? One writer shared his experience with an interactive program he tried with his son. The father read the words while the son played with the pictures. The father thought that if his son had spent ten minutes reading a book, he might have learned something. Research shows that learning is more effective in environments where there is conversation with teachers or parents. While using new technology to teach children is fine, traditional education still plays a crucial role.
**Hollywood**
By 1918, most of the world’s film production had moved to Hollywood. The local residents were not happy, seeing their neighborhood in Los Angeles taken over by these newcomers. However, they eventually accepted this change because of the American value of success, measured by box office earnings. Hollywood can recognize a good film, one that can create stars and make money. In less than a century, Hollywood transformed from a small village to a town as famous as New York, Rome, or Paris. Physically, it has changed a lot; a hundred years ago, you would walk through orange groves to reach the village store. Yet, in some ways, it still feels like a village, focused mainly on films: how much they earn, who is dating whom, and who is involved in which project. Many successful people try to escape the area, working there but living elsewhere. Still, it remains the main destination for anyone important in show business.
**Photography**
Photography was created by artists in the nineteenth century as a way to capture their surroundings. They wanted a lasting record of what they saw, and photography provided that. The combination of light, lenses, shutters, and light-sensitive surfaces produced images that were more detailed and realistic than what painters could create in a long time. This innovation surprised other artists, and while some initially enjoyed the new images, critics soon claimed that photography could not be considered art. They argued that photography was too reliant on reality and mechanical processes to be a true expression of creativity. Despite this criticism, photographers recognized that they had discovered a new art form. They used their tools to interpret the world, presenting their vision of nature, objects, and people.
**Book Illustration**
During the black-and-white era of book illustration, it was widely accepted that every children's book needed illustrations. This also applied to novels for older readers, although the number of illustrated books decreased over time. Children's publishing remained active, but it was often low-budget, leading to many average-quality works, even though the best artists always submitted their finest work. As a result, the collection of black-and-white illustrations is a mix of both valuable and less impressive pieces, making it a great resource for research and exploration. The true treasures from this period are likely to be displayed again, either through reprints of classic titles or new publications about the artists. There are signs that interest in this artistic period is growing, and soon, a creative publisher will likely produce a series of classic children's book illustrations, either as reprints or new editions using the original artwork."
CPE_68,C2,"**Blogging: Sharing Our Lives Online**
Not long ago, a website warned about the dangers of public check-ins, which are online updates about where you are. The message was clear: while you might think you are simply saying, ""I'm here,"" you are also revealing your location to many people, some of whom you might not want to meet. This highlights a growing concern that sharing too much online can have negative consequences. 
The internet offers exciting chances to share our lives with a global audience, promising wealth and fame. However, as we dive into this digital world, we often share personal stories and photos without realizing the risks involved. It can feel overwhelming and unsafe, but there is hope. We can learn from those who explored the internet before us—early bloggers who faced many challenges and learned valuable lessons.
In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started sharing his life online. At that time, the web was mostly used by graduate students and scientists. Hall saw a chance to share his personal experiences. He created a blog filled with his thoughts, photos, and art. By January 1996, he began posting daily, attracting many readers who were fascinated by his boldness. Hall was open about everything, and while some saw him as an exhibitionist, others appreciated the artistic side of his work.
However, one day, visitors to his blog found it replaced by a video titled ""Dark Night."" Hall revealed that he had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it, his partner told him to choose between the blog and the relationship. Hall chose to remove the blog, expressing that sharing his life online made people distrust him. This situation raises an important point: while sharing online can be enjoyable, it can also lead to disappointment if you expect it to bring you closer to others.
In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a young woman in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, a colleague shared her blog's address with the company's executives, including those she had criticized, which led to her losing her job. This situation illustrates what experts call the ""online distribution effect,"" where people feel they can say things online that they would never say in person. However, our online and real lives are connected, and ignoring this can lead to serious mistakes.
Armstrong's story had a positive outcome. Although she was upset and stopped blogging for a while, she eventually got married and started a new blog focused on her family. Today, she is a well-known ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her household. Once a cautionary tale about the risks of sharing online, she has now mastered the art of sharing her life wisely. 
Armstrong's experience teaches us an important lesson: the internet allows us to say anything, but that doesn't mean we should."
CPE_23,C2,"**Enough Sleep?**
Tiredness is often seen as a common issue in modern life. As wealthier and busier countries have developed, sleeplessness and anxiety have also increased. Research in the USA shows that 40 million Americans suffer from chronic sleep problems. Some popular novels in Britain even feature characters who cannot sleep or are set in sleep research labs. This growing interest in sleep focuses on its patterns, benefits, and the problems people face with it. A leading sleep researcher states, ""People need more sleep."" Many people reduce their sleep when they are busy, often waking up early to avoid traffic.
Recently, a sleep researcher conducted an experiment where participants were allowed to sleep for up to 14 hours a night for a month. After three weeks, they settled into an average of eight hours and fifteen minutes of sleep, showing a significant need for rest that they had been missing.
In Europe, a university sleep research lab in the English Midlands has studied various topics, including how fatigue affects sailors, the impact of airport noise on sleep, and the risks of driving while tired. They recruit participants through student newspapers, offering £5 an hour and asking them to change their sleep patterns as instructed. Dr. Louise Reyner reassures participants who worry about having electrodes placed on their heads, explaining that the lab focuses on physical aspects of sleep.
In a dark room, there is a driving simulator with a large screen. Participants are asked to arrive at 2 PM, a time when people naturally feel sleepy, especially after little or no sleep. They drive while answering questions, facing a bright, endless road. Many young men insist they will not fall asleep. Dr. Reyner has recorded one participant trying to stay awake. At first, he sits up straight, but soon he starts to blink more frequently and nod off. Eventually, he falls asleep briefly, causing the car to drift off the road. Dr. Reyner suggests that drinking two cups of coffee can help someone stay alert for at least half an hour. She also recommends various products like energy drinks and caffeinated gum, especially for shift workers.
Despite these findings, there is still much uncertainty about sleep. It is known that humans, like other mammals, follow a daily sleep cycle. When asleep, we go through four stages, from light sleep to deep sleep. Dreams usually happen during light sleep, and the brain temporarily paralyzes the body to prevent injuries. There are theories that sleep helps repair the body, restore muscles, or rest the part of the brain responsible for speech and creativity, but it is unclear if these processes happen faster during relaxed wakefulness.
Scientists agree that women tend to sleep about half an hour longer than men, and older people generally need less sleep, although the reasons for this are unknown. Some researchers describe sleep in grand terms, saying, ""Sleep is a way to travel through time without harm.""
Historically, sleep patterns were different. A history professor studied British sleep habits from 1500 to 1850 and found that people would go to bed early, wake up after midnight for a while, and then sleep again. This break allowed time for reflection, remembering dreams, or even nighttime activities. The poorest people benefited most from this quiet time, escaping their daytime struggles. However, by the 17th century, as artificial light became more common, wealthier people began to adopt the more efficient sleep patterns we have today. The industrial revolution further changed sleep habits, making most people work longer hours in lit buildings.
In many non-Western cultures, the old sleep patterns still exist. People may sleep for a few hours, wake up, and then sleep again. The idea of a solid night's sleep is not universal. In some tribal societies, sounds from humans and animals, along with the need to tend to fires and watch for dangers, make continuous sleep difficult. It appears that people everywhere are in great need of more sleep."
CPE_60,C2,"We are talking about very expensive cowboy boots. I stood in my 800-dollar designer cowboy boots on the rocks of an old formation in the Arizona desert. Money was not a concern. I wore a complete cowboy outfit, and if you had the outfit, you might be seen as a cowboy. But I was not one. I realized that I did not belong there. As I looked into the morning sun at the Arizona mountains, I had to admit that I was not at home in the wild. 
I had flown in from Denver just after dawn, feeling like I could pass for a cowboy arriving from the sky. However, that feeling disappeared when I saw a real cowboy at the Phoenix airport. He was wearing a dirty shirt, needed a shave, and was picking up a worn canvas bag when he noticed my new cowboy boots. He raised an eyebrow and left without saying anything. 
I thought there should be a set of clothes that an ex-racing driver could wear without feeling out of place. Something that would make me feel comfortable wherever I went, without the feeling that everyone else was moving at a slower pace. I loved being a racing driver and driving fast cars. It was my passion, but I no longer do it. I couldn't even if I wanted to. 
I wondered what I should do now. A racing driver should have other identities ready for when they stop racing. I thought I had some options, but when I tried to reach for them, they vanished. I considered becoming a commentator for races, but there were many former drivers ahead of me for that job. I also thought about starting a business selling classic cars, but that plan fell through because no one was buying old Ferraris that year. Eventually, I stepped back from that idea before it became a bigger problem. 
Being an ""ex"" anything can be disheartening. Who really wants to hear about how I almost became the World Champion? No one wants to hear a story that ends with ""almost."" Even if I had been the champion, you would probably only want to listen for a few minutes before losing interest. Last year's champion is just that—last year. 
I don’t want sympathy, and I don’t get any. Why should I? I had a successful career, made money, and saved enough. But I miss the thrill of getting into a powerful racing car, feeling the speed of zero to one hundred fifty miles per hour in just 4.9 seconds. I even miss the danger of racing. I miss the exciting people and the reporters who treated my words as important. Being somewhat famous had its perks; businessmen and politicians would brag about knowing me, and young fans would sneak under fences to get my autograph. 
Now that I no longer race, my life feels empty. Just last week, my phone rang twice, and I realized I have a lot of free time. I looked up at the clear blue sky, and there were no buzzards flying above. Maybe Arizona doesn’t have buzzards. But I noticed some small brown birds in a cactus nearby, warning me to leave their nest alone. I never thought the desert had songbirds. It made me realize that a fake cowboy in designer boots still has much to learn."
CPE_1,C2,"**Vancouver**
In the past ten years, many people from around the world have moved to Vancouver, a city in western Canada. In the evenings, residents enjoy walking through the streets, and if you join them, you will likely hear different languages being spoken. People are attracted to Vancouver because of its mild weather, beautiful location between the ocean and mountains, clean and safe environment, and good educational and job opportunities. Although some locals complain about the rapid construction of new buildings, it is clear that the new residents and growing tourism have contributed to a vibrant city revival. Vancouver was once called 'Terminal City' because it served as a gateway to other places. While this name is less common now, Vancouver is still a major gateway.
**Putting Pen to Paper**
As a journalist, I often struggle with writing letters. Some say this is because we dislike writing for free, but I think it’s more about how we aim for the best impact in our work, which makes writing a letter feel less spontaneous. True artists, who may rewrite their work many times, do not face this issue. I believe that understanding the impact of their words is a key sign of a real artist. For example, when Shakespeare wrote his famous lines, he likely did not think about how the use of longer words made them powerful, even though it showed his talent.
**Supermarket Opening**
In Britain, the opening of a new supermarket used to be a big event. You could expect a celebrity, like a soap star or a member of the royal family, to cut the ribbon. Now, new supermarkets seem to open every day, making celebrity appearances less necessary. Why pay a famous person when anyone can do it for free? Last week, when a new Superbuy branch opened, the waiting customers didn’t care who the guest was, as long as they were at the front of the line. A rumor spread that the first five men to enter would receive a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women would get flowers. This news created a sense of pride among those at the front and jealousy among those who arrived later."
CPE_53,C2,"**Citizen Kane**
When the film *Citizen Kane* was released in 1941, it created a lot of excitement, but it was not a financial success. The release was delayed because the distributors were worried about the possible negative reaction from William Randolph Hearst, who was thought to be the inspiration for the main character. Despite this, the film received very positive reviews. It was television that later brought the film back into the public eye. *Citizen Kane* is often seen as the film that has motivated many people to become filmmakers. This is surprising because it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles believed that its success came from his lack of knowledge about the rules of filmmaking; he simply went ahead and created it. He also had a talented team, including cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and special-effects expert Linwood Dunn. When Welles and Mankiewicz decided to create a story about a newspaper tycoon who resembled Hearst, Welles realized he had found the perfect role for himself as both director and actor, and he approached the project with great enthusiasm.
**Dermot and Carmel**
That morning, Dermot thought Carmel seemed a bit strange. He had mentioned twice that he might be late and that he might stop by the golf club on his way home to talk to someone. Carmel had nodded politely, as if she didn’t really understand. “Will you be okay? What are your plans for today?” he asked. She smiled and replied, “It’s funny you ask. I was just thinking I have nothing to do today, so I’ll take a walk downtown and look at the shops. I feel like it’s almost a waste to spend the day doing nothing.” Dermot smiled back, saying, “You deserve to enjoy yourself. And if I’m late, I won’t need anything to eat, so don’t worry about it.” “That’s fine,” she said.
**Title Race**
“Tea boy? Do you mind? I’m a mobile lukewarm beverage resource facilitator.” Human nature often leads to amusing situations. A recent study revealed that job titles are a major source of jealousy and dissatisfaction at work. A survey by a well-known recruitment firm found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees believe that job titles create divisions among coworkers. Surprisingly, 70% of office workers said they would give up a pay raise for a more “motivational” or “professional” job title. If our desire for status is so strong that it overshadows our basic need for money, we are in a troubling situation. In the early twenty-first century, no one wants to be called subordinate. The job titles being discussed focus on skills (like specialist or coordinator) but are really just fancy words."
CPE_55,C2,"**The Vienna Assignment**
I was in Vienna to take photographs, which was usually my main reason for being anywhere. Photography was not just my job; it was a big part of my life. I was always inspired by how light fell on different surfaces. I believed that a single photograph could capture the essence of a moment, a place, or a person. I lived by the idea that I could take the perfect picture at any moment, as long as I had film in my camera. My motto was simple: finish one roll, load another, and keep my eyes open. This had been my approach for a long time.
Once, I had a brief moment of fame when a photo I took of a smoke plume from a burning oil well became popular worldwide. It was mostly luck, but they say you create your own opportunities, both good and bad. After that, I decided to work as a freelance photographer, which seemed like a smart choice. However, life took some unexpected turns, and the mid-nineties were not as successful as I had hoped, especially after my photo made it to the cover of Time magazine. That’s why I found myself in Vienna instead of a more exciting location. But I was still taking photographs and getting paid for it, which I didn’t mind.
This assignment came about by chance. I had previously taken photos for a coffee-table book called *Four Cities in Four Seasons*, which featured London, Paris, Rome, and Vienna. I had received a good commission for capturing my city in different seasons. I had my own unique style, showcasing the beauty of daffodils in Hyde Park and the busy atmosphere of Piccadilly. However, I knew that much of my work would be overlooked since it was just a picture book, not meant to challenge anyone’s views.
After a cold snap over Christmas, I submitted my winter photos of London and learned that the Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, had left his job in Vienna for unknown reasons. Instead of hiring someone new, they offered me the chance to take his place. The Austrian publishers liked my work, and I was available, unlike the French and Italian photographers. I was eager to go because things at home were not going well. A week in snowy Vienna sounded like a welcome change.
They arranged for me to stay at the Europa hotel in the heart of the old city. My last visit to Vienna had been a busy summer trip with my wife, where we rushed through many palaces and museums. It had been hot and chaotic, and I hadn’t taken many photos. This time, being alone in the cold January weather felt different. I could tell from the moment I arrived and saw the beautiful light over the snow-covered roofs that I was going to enjoy this trip and take great pictures.
On my first day, I didn’t rush to take photos. Instead, I rode the trams around the Ringstrasse, getting on and off to experience the city’s atmosphere. The weather was cold and still, reflecting the grand history of the city. I hadn’t seen what Schussner had captured in the other seasons, and I didn’t want to. This was going to be my Vienna, and I was ready to let it reveal itself to me. 
A photograph captures a moment, but you have to wait for the right moment to come. So, I took my time, observing everything until I felt ready. The next morning, I woke up early. The overnight snow made Stephansplatz beautifully white and almost empty. I struggled to find a way to photograph the cathedral, which towered high into the grey sky but appeared massive at ground level. I realized I might have to focus on just part of it. In that weather and at that time, it could still be magical.
Photography has always had a sense of magic. Even the early pioneers felt this before they fully understood the chemistry behind it. You can watch a blank sheet of paper transform into a photograph in a dark room. Even when you know how it works, the mystery remains. Perhaps that’s why what happened at Stephansplatz that morning didn’t surprise me in a strange way."
CPE_50,C2,"**Kinetic Art Exhibition**
Exciting news: London's Hayward Gallery has changed from a serious space into one filled with wonder. This transformation is not due to a big-budget event, but rather a unique exploration of a lesser-known part of the last 60 years. A new exhibition looks at the history of kinetic art, which is art that involves movement, throughout the twentieth century. It shows that creating art that moves on its own or explores the idea of movement has been an important, though often overlooked, theme in some of the most interesting creative work of this century. 
Curator Guy Brett, who has studied kinetic art for many years, has gathered a wonderful collection of paintings, drawings, documents, and films. These are mostly presented without much text, allowing visitors to enjoy discovering connections and insights on their own.
**David Hockney**
David Hockney's art attracts many people who might not usually be interested in art. This could be because his work is figurative and easy to understand, or because it focuses on themes of leisure and escape from daily life. Some might even be drawn to Hockney's charming personality and his clever comments that make him popular in the media. However, this raises the question: does this popularity mean his art lacks serious purpose? 
Some critics believe Hockney is an overrated artist. Yet, one could argue that his popularity today is seen as a negative rather than a reflection of his work's quality. Hockney himself is realistic about his abilities and believes it is not fair to judge his work based on an abstract idea of greatness. He does not claim to be a great artist and understands that only future generations can truly assess his significance.
**Window-Shopping: An Art Exhibition**
In recent years, I have attended many contemporary art exhibitions, some brilliant and others mediocre. What frustrates me are shows that seem to push a specific agenda, suggesting a common viewpoint among certain artists. Sometimes this approach works, revealing new trends in seemingly unrelated works. More often, however, it highlights a questionable angle or a forced idea. 
As a curator, I wanted to create a show that opposed this trend. Along with seven artists, I took over an empty warehouse for an exhibition called ""Window-Shopping."" This was meant to showcase individual artworks that connected only by being labeled as art. For example, Sam Cole's knitted cats chased each other on a toy train track, while Matthew Crawley filmed a video camera as he opened it and poked around until it broke, creating a flickering display on a monitor. 
These pieces did not fit into a specific theme and would not usually be shown together, but I believe they complemented each other through their differences. While I did not make grand statements about contemporary art, I think it is important to recognize that art is often a personal activity where artists define their own boundaries.
**Art History**
People who appreciate paintings sometimes hesitate to analyze them, fearing it will ruin their enjoyment. Some believe that art historians, who focus on theory rather than practice, overlook the joy of simply looking at art and the special act of creating it. This idea is similar to thinking that knowing how a dish is made takes away from its taste. 
Understanding the importance of enjoyment does not mean we cannot also have a deep knowledge of what we appreciate. In fact, knowing more about an artwork can enhance our pleasure. Additionally, our enjoyment is complex. How we respond to art is influenced by our senses and is shaped by the values of the society we live in. 
While it is essential to value our instinctive reactions to art, the belief that intellectual understanding diminishes enjoyment is an outdated idea that once promoted art as a substitute for thought."
CPE_25,C2,"**Metals**  
Stone Age people may have been interested in metals because they wanted to decorate themselves. While sitting by a river, one of our early ancestors might have found a shiny yellow pebble and picked it up. This pebble did not feel like stone, but it was beautiful. This could be how gold first became important to primitive people. Because gold is easy to shape, it quickly became a popular material. Copper may have also been discovered by chance. Once people realized how useful copper tools were, they actively searched for copper ores and ways to extract the metal. This led to the development of metalworking, which added to the skills that helped our ancestors improve their lives.
**St Ives**  
We struggled to carry our bags down the narrow, cobbled street that led to the town center, trying to stay upright against the strong wind and avoiding the icy waves crashing over the walkway. The streets were empty, and every cottage by the water had its shutters tightly closed against the storm. We had seen the weather get worse as we arrived in St Ives on a small train. With the dark skies above, visiting Cornwall in the off-season without a car didn’t seem like a good idea anymore. I had convinced my friend to join me by promising beautiful walks along the Cornish coast and cozy evenings by the fire.
**Computer Modelling**  
Studying the past is challenging because it is gone. The people who lived in times of peace and those who faced conflict and drought are no longer alive. The reasons why they settled in certain places or formed families and communities have been forgotten. Archaeology gives us some clues, but we cannot test our ideas with experiments on past cultures. We cannot rewind time to see what happened. However, computer modelling allows us to recreate ancient landscapes and environments, filling them with virtual communities that have some of the needs and abilities of real humans. We can set rules for these communities and simulate social groups. Then, we can change the weather or increase the population and observe how these digital cultures and their artificial people respond."
CPE_34,C2,"**Vervet Monkeys**  
Cheney and Seyfarth studied a group of vervet monkeys and observed the dominant male noticing a strange male nearby. The stranger wanted to join the group, which would likely lead to the dominant male losing his position. To keep the stranger away, the dominant male cleverly made an alarm call that vervets use to warn of a leopard. This caused the stranger to retreat back into the trees. This tactic worked several times until the dominant male made a mistake. He called out the alarm while casually walking across the open ground, which confused the situation.
**What Cats Catch**  
In a survey in the English village of Felmersham, residents recorded what their cats caught over a year. Seventy cats caught over 1,000 prey items. An American professor estimated that this means cats in Britain kill around 100 million birds and small mammals each year. However, this number is misleading. Most cats live in towns and catch fewer animals than those in the survey. The important question is whether these numbers are sustainable. The answer seems to be yes. In winter, many people feed birds, and gardens provide nesting sites, keeping bird populations above natural levels. The survey shows that while cats are significant predators, they are not destroying Britain's bird population.
**Buffalo's Day**  
Buffaloes are very important to the marshmen, who care for them deeply. Each morning, the buffaloes, after sleeping near their owners, slowly make their way to the distant reed beds. They often groan about their tiredness before finally moving into the water. Once in the water, they seem to forget their purpose and wallow there, making low sounds of complaint. Their movements away from the house are so slow that they go almost unnoticed. Eventually, they swim, appearing to struggle to keep their noses above the water. They spend the day among the reeds, grazing on green shoots at their eye level.
**Picasso, Pablo**  
In early spring 1940, while in the fishing port of Royan, Picasso painted several still lifes of fish. One painting shows a fishmonger’s slab with a crab and some soles. Despite being on the slab, the fish look alive. The painting is complex, with overlapping transparent shapes and delicate colors, creating a calm underwater feel. However, there is tension as the fish seem to be preparing for a fight with the crab. The sharp shapes in the painting, including the scales and a chain around one fish, add a sense of danger and hidden violence, giving the artwork a deeper meaning."
CPE_12,C2,"**Photography**
Over the last 150 years, photography has been a powerful tool for capturing all aspects of human life. This relatively short history has seen photography develop its ability to record moments in time and space, allowing us to see both the vast and the tiny. It has provided images from faraway places, distant parts of our solar system, and the complex social issues of modern life. Photography has become one of the most important ways to express what it means to be human.
However, the idea of recording events visually has a much longer history. The earliest forms of visual recording date back to the Upper Paleolithic period, around 35,000 years ago. We may not know the exact reasons for early cave paintings—whether they depicted real hunting events, served as magic to attract animals, had religious significance, or were simply made for decoration—but these images are deeply connected to human culture.
Throughout history, people have questioned how accurate visual images are and what role they play in society. The saying ""seeing is believing"" has given special importance to visual images. When photography was invented in the mid-1800s, it seemed to promise an automatic way to create truthful records. The camera was seen as a tool that worked like the human eye, capturing images that closely resembled what we see in reality. The chemical process used in photography allowed for the preservation of these images, which were considered a natural phenomenon.
At the same time, photography was viewed as a sophisticated cultural achievement, producing images that artists had long struggled to create. Ironically, because photography seemed so realistic, it was thought that everyone could easily understand photographs. In 1933, photographer August Sander suggested that even the most isolated person could understand a photograph of the sky, whether it showed the sun, moon, or stars.
However, as global communication increased in the late 20th century, we must consider how well photographic images can cross cultural boundaries. Is photography as influenced by cultural norms as other forms of communication, like language? Has our familiarity with photographs led us to overlook the complex ways they convey vivid impressions of reality? 
Photography is often seen as a convincing form of evidence, making it easy to confuse our perception of the world with its photographic representations. For example, it is common for someone to show a photograph and say, ""This is my grandson."" Since its invention in 1839, photography and the attitudes towards it have changed significantly. This change may be due to photography moving into what we might call ""mythic time."" Its original role as a record-keeper has evolved, and photographs, once closely tied to the photographer and subject, have become historical documents. These images often reveal as much about the people and society that created them as they do about their subjects.
I aim to show that the camera is not just a silent recorder of events. Photography does not merely reflect culture; it can also inspire social and political change. For instance, it is hard to imagine the cultural shifts of the Italian Renaissance without acknowledging how the development of perspective changed visual representation. Similarly, photography has played a significant role in shaping the media culture of our time, while also bringing the harsh realities of the world into our everyday lives."
CPE_26,C2,"**How to Write Poetry**
Teaching people how to write poetry can be tricky. While creativity is important, one wrong move can lead to confusion. I believe that for beginners, the best advice is to read a lot, write often, and let your imagination flow freely, as long as it doesn’t lead to chaos. Some people need a stable life to write poetry, while others find inspiration in their struggles. Some writers follow a schedule, while others wait for a moment of inspiration. All approaches are valid, as long as they don’t follow strict rules. The key is to find your own voice, nurture it, and let it grow. Eventually, it will be strong enough to stand on its own.
**The Short Story**
In a short story, it’s important not to overcrowd it with too many characters or long descriptions. Flashbacks should be brief and only used when necessary to clarify a point. One effective way to include a flashback is through a character’s memory, which can help move the story forward without slowing it down. Dialogue is also very useful; it can show different perspectives quickly and keep the reader engaged. Avoiding excessive writing is crucial, but being concise doesn’t mean the story should feel incomplete. A short story should maintain conflict and action just like a novel, but every word must be meaningful in the limited space.
**Screenplays**
Writing a screenplay is similar to playing chess. Many chess players make mistakes throughout the game. We may not know exactly what will happen next, but we can anticipate a few moves ahead. As we improve, we start to understand that chess is more about long-term strategy than short-term tactics. We begin to see the game as a whole, recognizing patterns and strategies, such as openings and end games. The more we practice, the more we understand the complexities of both chess and screenplay writing.
**Looking at Writing**
Humans naturally communicate, as seen in how children speak. However, writing is not an instinct. Charles Darwin noted that while language is a human trait, written language is not. All societies have language, and while languages evolve, they do not necessarily become better. Children learn to speak without formal lessons, and when they lack a common language, they create their own. In contrast, writing systems have been developed only a few times in history and often started as simple codes. Until recently, many children did not learn to read or write, and even today, some struggle with it. Children are naturally inclined to speak, but learning to write is a skill that requires effort and practice. We need to understand how writing works and how to help children learn it effectively."
CPE_8,C2,"I have never started a novel with so much uncertainty. I call it a novel only because I don’t know what else to name it. I have a small story to share, and it doesn’t end with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave my readers hanging. This book is about my memories of a man I only met occasionally, and I don’t know much about his life in between our meetings. I could invent details to make the story more complete, but I don’t want to do that. I just want to write down what I know.
To protect the identities of living people, I have given the characters in this story made-up names and taken care to ensure they cannot be recognized. The man I am writing about is not famous, and he may never be. When his life ends, he might leave no more mark on the world than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the water’s surface. If my book is read, it will be for its own interest. However, it’s possible that his way of life and the unique qualities of his character could influence others, and long after he is gone, people may realize that a remarkable person lived in this time. Then it will be clear who I am writing about, and those interested in his early life may find useful information in my book.
I believe my book, despite its limitations, will be helpful for those writing about my friend. I do not claim that the conversations I recorded are exact. I never took notes during our talks, but I remember well what matters to me. Although I have put these conversations in my own words, I believe they accurately reflect what was said. I mentioned earlier that I have invented nothing, but I have taken the liberty that historians do by creating dialogues for characters that I did not hear. I did this to make the scenes more lively and believable, as they would be dull if simply told. I want my book to be engaging, and I think it’s reasonable to do what I can to achieve that. A thoughtful reader will notice where I have used this technique and can choose to ignore it.
Another reason I feel uneasy about this work is that the people I focus on come from a different culture. It is hard to truly know someone, and I believe we can only fully understand our own countrymen. People are shaped not just by themselves but also by their birthplace, their childhood experiences, the games they played, the food they ate, the schools they attended, and the literature they read. These experiences shape who they are, and you can only understand them if you have lived through similar experiences. Since you can only know people from a different nation through observation, it is challenging to portray them convincingly in a book. I have only written about my own countrymen, and when I have written about others in short stories, it was easier to give broad descriptions and let the reader fill in the details. In this book, I do not claim that my characters see themselves as they truly are; they are viewed, like my main character, through my perspective."
CPE_4,C2,"**POETRY RECITALS**
Throughout history, the world of literature often seems confusing to those experiencing it. However, later generations can see clear patterns and important figures in literature. Currently, there is a complex mix of different styles of poetry, various groups of poets, and differing opinions on how poetry should be presented, criticized, and taught. 
A major discussion in contemporary poetry is the tension between serious 'literary' poets, who write poems meant to be read on the page, and 'popular' poets, who prefer to perform their work for an audience. This division is not strict. Over the last twenty years, public poetry readings have become more common in many forms. Small literary groups in towns hold readings in community spaces or members' homes. Schools and colleges invite poets to share their work with students, and arts festivals often feature readings by well-known poets.
The impact of these events on poets is varied and uncertain. For 'pop' poets, who write specifically for live performances, public readings are beneficial. Their poems are usually simple and can be easily understood in one listening. However, when these poems are read on the page, their weaknesses in thought and technique may become apparent.
On the other hand, dedicated poets, who strive to create deep and meaningful work, may not be appreciated by audiences who are hearing their poems for the first time. The risk is that these poets might choose to read only their simplest work to connect quickly with the audience, which may not represent their best writing.
Attending poetry readings cannot replace reading poetry from a book, but it can be a fun and educational experience. Hearing skilled poets read their work, even if they are not great speakers, helps the audience understand where to focus their attention. It is best if the audience has the text in front of them or knows the poems beforehand.
The main reason for popular poetry recitals, which sometimes include music, is to help audiences enjoy poetry and see it as an art form accessible to everyone, not just a select few."
CPE_30,C2,"**Oral History**  
Historians increasingly use oral evidence, but this approach has challenges. It is overly simplistic to think that a person's testimony is a clear reflection of their past experiences. During an interview, both the historian and the informant influence each other. The historian chooses who to interview and what topics to discuss. Even if the historian only listens, their presence can change how the informant remembers and talks about their past. The final account is shaped by the historian's social position and their understanding of history, which may be communicated to the informant. Therefore, historians must acknowledge their role in creating new evidence. The challenges continue even after the historian leaves. The informant's memories are not direct connections to the past; they can be influenced by other sources, like the media, or colored by nostalgia or feelings of loss from their childhood. The emotions and attitudes expressed can make the testimony seem convincing, but they may actually reflect later experiences rather than the time being discussed.
**Animal Science**  
Animal science has two main approaches: physiological and whole animal. Physiologists focus on how the body functions, including how nerves, muscles, and senses work together to create complex behaviors. Those who study the whole animal look at the behavior of animals in their natural state and the factors that influence it. Within this approach, there are psychologists and ethologists. Psychologists often conduct experiments in labs with a limited number of species, like rats and pigeons, while ethologists study natural, unlearned behaviors in wild animals. Although these distinctions still exist, there is now a productive blending of the two fields. Physiologists often claim that their methods are more fundamental. However, understanding how nerve cells work does not eliminate the need to study behavior itself, which has its own structure and units. Trying to explain a bird's nest-building behavior by only looking at nerve cells would be like trying to read a book with a powerful microscope.
**The Social Sciences**  
Students studying social sciences for the first time face a dual challenge. They need to learn both the content of their new subject and the methods used to study it. This means they must understand not only the knowledge and research findings in textbooks but also the methods used to gather and organize that knowledge. These two aspects are closely connected. While we all have experience with social life, social sciences go beyond common sense. Each discipline focuses on specific aspects of social life, uses particular research methods, and has its own set of concepts. These basic ideas form the ""logical basis"" of the subject, allowing social scientists to move beyond everyday understanding and differentiate one discipline from another.
**Classical Architecture**  
In the classical world of Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building structures. According to the Roman architect Vitruvius, architecture involves order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, propriety, and distribution. He also provides Greek equivalents for some of these terms, likely based on earlier Greek sources that are now lost. While utility and function are not part of his initial definition, Vitruvius later discusses the best forms and arrangements for different types of buildings. At the start, the focus is on aesthetics, viewing architecture as an art. The origins of classical architecture are complex, with a long history of simple structures in Greece and Italy that did not meet Vitruvius' artistic standards. Although these early structures were not artistic, they contributed essential elements that influenced later architectural concepts. Despite its elaborate appearance, the classical temple essentially resembles a simple, single-room hut."
CPE_7,C2,"The two sisters kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for a while. Lily would drive around the gardens and the railway, even jumping over a small bridge, which was her only mistake. Afterward, they would pass the gasworks, which smelled of sulphur. Surprisingly, Chen found it funny that Lily was driving without telling him. ""So you can really drive, Lily? Well done!"" he said. Mui thought it was strange that her brother-in-law was not upset. Instead, he was excited and made plans with Lily for a trip. They decided to go on a Monday at the start of next month, the quietest day of the week, leaving early and returning by noon to avoid losing customers. Meanwhile, Lily would practice driving around the gardens. Despite her doubts, Mui bought a road map and got a ten percent discount, which impressed Chen. However, Lily felt a bit insulted by Mui's lack of trust in her navigation skills.
Within an hour of leaving home, they were looking at the English Channel. Lily drove very well. Even Mui, who was in the back seat ready to give directions, had to admit this. On the way, Lily overtook some slow cars with great skill, making Mui hold back her comments. Chen even applauded her. After passing the gasworks and the lagoon with its small boats, they drove smoothly along the empty promenade. Lily parked in a quiet street with many empty spaces. She was unsure about the road signs and preferred to pay for parking rather than risk a fine or being towed. She hoped this carefulness would ease Mui's worries. 
While driving, Lily noticed her sister's tense face in the mirror. She thought it best not to add to Mui's worries. Lily locked all the van doors and checked them carefully. ""Don't worry,"" Chen joked. ""No one will want that old thing."" The sisters were offended. Lily accused Chen of being ungrateful, and Mui scolded him for being too easily fooled by appearances. Surprised, Chen took Man Kee to see the grey sea. He held his son close and thought about how he would raise him. Chen wanted Man Kee to have a good education, especially in numbers, and to own many restaurants one day.
As Chen looked at the sea, he felt a mix of sadness and hope while planning for Man Kee's future. He noticed smoke on the horizon and then saw a ship shining in the sunlight. He put a coin in a telescope and tried to find the ship. After some effort, he finally spotted it—a small, rusty tramp steamer. He lifted Man Kee to the telescope. ""Do you see the ship, Son?"" he asked gently. ""It's a special ship for us. It's small and old, but we know it will take us back home when we are done here. It will take you to your homeland, which you have never seen."" Chen kissed Man Kee's head. 
Lily and Mui joined them, and Lily put her arm around Chen's shoulders. ""The little old ship,"" Chen said. ""Let your mother see, Son."" Man Kee didn't want to let go of the telescope, and when he finally did, the view was just a blurry circle of light. By the time Chen found another coin, the ship had disappeared over the horizon, leaving Lily with a view of seagulls searching for food in the water."
CPE_43,C2,"**THE WELL**
I once read that if you dig deep enough, you can see the stars on a clear day. I convinced you to help me with my plan. You watched, surprised, as I pulled up the well bucket, balanced it on the wall, and then climbed in. I asked you to lower me down. I didn’t consider how heavy the bucket would be or that you might not be strong enough to hold it. You held the handle, trying to help as I pushed the bucket away from the well's edge. As soon as it was free, I fell straight down. You screamed and tried to stop it, but then you let go. I landed in the well and hit my head. At that moment, I didn’t realize I had achieved part of my plan. I saw strange lights, confusing and odd. Later, I connected these lights to the cartoon stars I had seen when characters got hurt. At first, I felt dazed, then scared, then relieved, and finally angry at you for letting me fall, worried about what Mother would say.
You called down to check if I was okay. I opened my mouth to shout, but then I heard panic in your voice, and I couldn’t speak. I lay still, peeking at you through my eyelashes. You disappeared, calling for help. After a moment, I quickly climbed back up and pulled myself over the edge, landing on the courtyard stones. I heard alarmed voices coming from the castle. I ran away to hide in the shadows by the moat bridge. Mother and Father arrived with you and old Arthur; Mother was screaming and waving her hands. Father shouted for Arthur to pull on the winch handle. You stood back, looking pale and shocked. I hid in the shadows, feeling a rush of excitement. Then I noticed the drops of water I had left from the well to where I stood. I looked in horror at the dark spots on the dry stones. A small pool of water formed at my feet. I glanced back at the courtyard, where Father was shining a flashlight into the well. The drops sparkled in the sunlight. I couldn’t believe no one had noticed them. Mother was now screaming loudly, a sound I had never heard before. It shook me deeply. What should I do? I had gotten back at you, but things had become more serious than I expected. What started as a fun prank quickly turned into a situation that would lead to serious consequences, likely for me.
I regretted not thinking this through. In just a few minutes, my clever plan had turned into a disaster. Suddenly, an idea came to me like a lifeline. I gathered my courage and stepped out of my hiding place, staggering and blinking. I called out softly, then yelled louder when no one responded. I stumbled a bit further and then dramatically fell onto the stones. Sitting up, comforted by my crying mother, I sighed and said, ""Oh dear,"" smiling bravely. I claimed I had found a secret tunnel from the bottom of the well to the moat, and that I crawled and swam through it until I got out and climbed up the bridge. I thought I was almost getting away with it until Father squatted in front of me. He asked me to repeat my story. I hesitated. His eyes narrowed. Thinking I was covering up a mistake, I said the secret passage had collapsed after me, so there was no point in checking. I insisted the well was dangerous and that I had barely escaped with my life.
Looking into my father's eyes felt like staring into a dark tunnel with no light at the end. It was as if he was seeing me for the first time, and I was seeing how adults view the world and the lies children tell. My words got stuck in my throat. ""Don't be ridiculous, boy,"" he said, his tone full of contempt. He stood up and walked away. Arthur looked down at me, his face showing regret and concern. He seemed to want to shake his head, not because I had a scary adventure and was unfairly disbelieved by my father, but because he could see through my desperate lie. He worried about the character and future of a child who lied so easily. His pity felt like a harsh rebuke, even more painful than my father's words. It made me realize that this was the adult judgment of my actions, and it affected me deeply."
CPE_51,C2,"**REMOVAL DAY**
Now that her children are grown, Susan, who is a widow, must leave her family home. The moving van was labeled 'Removers of Distinction', and indeed, everything that made the house special was being taken away. Fred, the removal man, carefully packed all the fragile items with his large hands, while his team was less gentle. Susan was leaving a beautiful four-story house that overlooked a small harbor. The memories of her children growing up there lingered in the air, like dust. When they first bought the house, her son Robert, who was five at the time, had asked, ""Mum, how do you get a house home?"" It was easy to miss the little boy he once was, especially now that he was helping with the move and making sure Susan didn’t mention the piano. Francesca, their daughter, was also there, being bossy and insisting that only she could take care of the valuable Steinway piano.
Fred noticed Susan was not crying. ""That's something,"" he said. ""Do people cry?"" Susan asked, curious. ""You'd be surprised,"" Fred replied. ""They seem happy while packing, but then they start crying in an empty room. They’re fine once they get to the new place; it’s just hard to see everything taken apart."" Susan could understand that feeling. If it were up to her, she would have warned the movers about the piano before they started. But Robert insisted it was the movers' responsibility to notice any issues. The piano was now the last item to be moved, standing proudly in the best room of the house.
Sitting on the bottom stair, with all the chairs gone, Susan remembered the day they moved in. Today felt like that day played in reverse—the piano had been the first thing brought in, but it got stuck on the stairs. The movers struggled for nearly two hours, trying to get it up. Little Robert watched in fascination while Francesca cried, ""We can’t live in a house without a piano!"" They had to find a way to get it inside, and her late husband, Peter, had solved the problem. They left the piano outside while they moved in the other furniture, which was much less back then. The next day, a builder was hired to remove the first-floor window. A crane was borrowed from a local farmer, and the piano was carefully lifted through the window while the excited children danced with joy. However, it cost so much that they couldn’t afford to have it tuned for months. ""That’s there forever,"" Peter had said. But forever is a long time. The children were now too busy to visit often, and Susan found it harder to move around the house.
Thinking about the stairs made her realize the banister rails were still not perfectly aligned from that day long ago. She should have warned the movers, but it was too late now. Any moment, they would discover the piano. Feeling dazed and anxious, she looked around. ""Are you okay?"" Fred asked. ""Just the piano left, and then we’ll be done."" She stepped away from the stairs, her heart racing. Robert and Francesca appeared in the hallway to watch. ""No tears then?"" Fred asked casually. Truthfully, she was close to crying. It was strange how moving things made them feel so important. Chairs, cups, and countless other items that seemed unimportant before now felt full of emotion, and she felt she might cry.
Just then, the piano appeared at the top of the stairs, with Fred guiding it down. ""Easy does it!"" he called out as they carefully brought it down and placed it behind the van. Robert was the first to laugh, and soon they were all laughing, relieved that it was over. They leaned against each other, gasping for breath and laughing uncontrollably. ""What’s so funny?"" Fred asked, but his question only made them laugh more. As they walked down the path for the last time, the only tears Susan shed were tears of laughter."
CPE_11,C2,"**Online Literary Criticism for Everyone: Is DIY Literary Criticism Just Fun?**
From the beginning, one of the main ideas behind the Internet was to make information accessible to everyone. In theory, anyone could publish their thoughts or share music online. However, in the early days, some technical skills were needed. Still, there was one area that truly opened up to the public: literary criticism. 
By visiting Amazon.com, the first popular online bookstore, anyone could try writing book reviews. Amazon allowed anyone to share their opinions and rate books with up to five stars. This seemed like a great idea because it meant that readers could see reviews from other readers, not just professional critics. Each book had its own page, and new reviews appeared automatically, giving Amazon free content and helping potential buyers make informed choices.
Other online bookstores, which also had physical locations, offered similar features. However, Amazon was the largest, controlling over 80% of the online market. This popularity led to many reviews being submitted daily, making it hard for Amazon to check them all. A team of editors monitored the site to ensure reviews followed the rules, such as not allowing one-word reviews or personal attacks on authors. However, since reviewers could remain anonymous, it was easy for some to misuse the system. For instance, authors could write positive reviews for their own books. 
One author, Lev Grossman, was upset by the negative reviews of his first novel, so he wrote some positive ones under a fake name to balance things out. His trick worked until he revealed it in an article, and then Amazon removed the fake reviews. Authors could also comment on their books through a special link, but Amazon did not always verify that these comments were genuine. 
The situation became more complicated with reader reviews. When James McElroy's book about a cheerleading team was published, it received good reviews from critics, but many people mentioned in the book felt hurt and expressed their anger through negative reviews on Amazon. These reviews often disappeared quickly. Despite this, Amazon saw the high level of engagement from readers as beneficial for business. 
Amazon monitored reviews closely, especially for bestsellers, to ensure they followed the rules. This meant that silly reviews were more likely to appear on pages for less popular books. For example, a classic children's book called *The Story about Ping* inspired humorous reviews that compared its plot to Internet technology. However, most reviews on Amazon were serious and provided a good indication of whether a book was worth buying.
The writer George Orwell once said that reviewing too many books made it hard to have genuine feelings about them. This highlights the importance of allowing everyone to participate in the review process, which can be a positive development."
CPE_14,C2,"**Art in Modern Times**
In recent years, especially over the last two hundred years, we often think that every artist must challenge the art of their time. Art is celebrated for being unique, revolutionary, and sometimes shocking. We enjoy admiring artists whose work was not valued in the past. However, when it comes to contemporary art, we often hesitate and claim that some artists have gone too far, suggesting that their work is no longer art. The media often reflects this sentiment, and we tend to agree because we expect art to constantly surprise us. This expectation makes us overlook the traditional themes and techniques that are still present in modern art.
We expect artists to be different from ordinary people, possessing special talents and energy that break free from conventions. In the past, people commissioned artists for specific purposes, and art was a part of everyday life. Today, we leave artists to work independently and often become frustrated if they try to connect with the public.
**Picture This**
Let me describe a situation and ask an important question. An artist selects a text from an art book that discusses the variety of pictures. The text asks, ""What are they all about?"" and concludes that there are countless types of pictures. This may seem simplistic, but bear with me. The artist then asks someone to prepare a canvas and take it to a sign painter. He instructs the sign painter to write the chosen text on the canvas in a straightforward manner, without any decorative elements. The sign painter follows these instructions and writes the text in simple black letters on a white canvas. My important question is: is this final product a painting?
**Underground Encounters**
At the Mercury Gallery in London, there is an unspoken rule for painters: once you find a successful style, you should stick to it. Collectors expect artists to continue producing similar work, and if they try something new, it is often met with disappointment. I’m not sure why this is the case. Gallery owners prefer to take safe risks, and perhaps art buyers feel more secure with familiar styles. However, some artists break this pattern and succeed, like Picasso and Hockney. Eric Rimmington is another artist who is now trying something different, and it will be interesting to see if he succeeds. His new exhibition replaces the still lifes that made him famous with paintings inspired by the London Underground. Rimmington finds a unique charm in railways. His earlier drawings of King's Cross Station led him to explore the underground world, resulting in ""Underground Encounters,"" an exhibition of 40 paintings and drawings that capture the intriguing atmosphere of this hidden world.
**Extract from a Novel**
I have come to this island with a few books. I use the word ""escape"" because the villagers jokingly say that only someone unwell would choose such a remote place to recover. So, I suppose I am here to heal. Besides an old peasant woman who comes daily to clean, I am quite alone. I feel neither happy nor sad; I exist in a state of reflection. I mentioned the futility of art but did not express its comforting aspects. The true comfort of my work lies in the ability to reshape reality through art. Our everyday actions often hide deeper meanings, like a rough cloth covering something beautiful. For artists, art offers a joyful way to confront the struggles of daily life, allowing us to fulfill our true potential through imagination. Otherwise, why would we cause each other pain?"
CPE_63,C2,"**Family Business**
""Listen, this isn't good!"" my dad said. We were driving back to London. He had just picked me and my trunk up from the fancy girls' school I attended, after sitting through Parent's Day. I had received the Latin prize and the award for the best end-of-school exams. He had a long talk with my headteacher, and now we were heading home for the holidays.
""What isn't?"" I asked, although I had a feeling I knew what he was thinking since he was unusually quiet. Normally, he was very talkative. ""You can't trick me. You'll do what you want now,"" he said. ""With all those certificates, I heard you might get a scholarship to Oxford.""
""So?"" I replied, trying to act tough. ""Wouldn't that be useful?"" 
""I also heard,"" he continued, and I knew a confrontation was coming, ""that you want to be a barrister. A barrister, of all things!"" My dad knew a lot about barristers and the law. 
""I just said that,"" I replied. ""I couldn't think of anything else!"" 
""And apparently,"" he went on, ""you have the right personality. You can quickly understand complex information, you’re good at speaking, and you enjoy performing."" 
""I’m not so sure about that,"" I said. ""All I know is what I see on TV dramas."" 
""Regardless,"" he said, gathering himself, ""I feel like your heart isn't in the family business anymore. Clearly, you'll go to Oxford, and after that, I can't see you wanting to join us."" 
The problem was, like many children of family businesses, I felt trapped by my family's expectations. I saw many career options and wanted to explore them. At the same time, I didn't want to upset my dad. I wasn't as scared of him as my brother Maurice was—I was the favorite—but I still found him intimidating. 
""It's too early to know,"" I said weakly. 
""I tell you, you won't want to join us,"" my dad said, who often turned out to be right about these things. ""It's a shame because you have the talent—the intelligence, the courage, the vision."" 
""There's still Maurice,"" I said, feeling down. My dad scoffed. We both knew Maurice disliked the business. 
""Anyway,"" I continued, ""you could always use me as a consultant."" My mother had passed away when I was young, and my dad had raised me and Maurice. I was two years older than Maurice, and since he was motherless, I had taken care of him from an early age. It wasn't a burden; I loved him. 
Because the business was successful, we lived comfortably—in a big house in London, attended nice schools, wore good clothes, and enjoyed parties, theaters, and operas. My dad knew many interesting people—politicians, actors, and businesspeople—and our home was always lively with great conversations.
""I have an idea,"" my dad said. ""You can help us during the holidays until you leave Oxford, and then if you decide to leave us, you can. It will give you some pocket money and really help me."" 
""Okay,"" I said, relieved to avoid making immediate choices and especially to avoid the sadness my dad would feel if I disagreed with him. This was how he controlled us. 
So, it happened. In my last term at school and during university breaks, I helped out, never more than twice a year and always with easier tasks. I became one of the top students, had a small house, a nice white car, designer clothes, and a black dress from Paris that I planned to wear for my final exams.
In my last term, my dad came to visit me and took me to a village for a meal and a chat. There were only a few weeks left until my exams. My tutor predicted I would get a First Class degree in Law, and I knew that if I focused and organized my thoughts, he might be right. I felt ready and confident. 
But then my dad told me that he needed me to do one last important task for the family business, the biggest one they had ever attempted, and he promised it would be worth my while. 
""But Dad,"" I protested, ""I have my final exams coming up, and I need to focus on that. It's really important for me to do well, and I don't want to think about anything else right now."" 
I could tell my dad didn't understand the pressure I was under (or maybe he was jealous of my life away from him), and he would see my refusal as a betrayal. As he explained the task, I realized more than ever how determined he was—the clarity and energy he brought to his work were impressive. In his own way, he was a genius, and I admired that in him. It made my own dreams seem less significant. 
""Okay,"" I said. ""I'll do it."""
CPE_56,C2,"Simon Costello realized that buying the house in Pembroke Square was a mistake within a year of moving in with Lois. Owning a home that requires strict budgeting is often not worth it. At the time, however, it seemed like a smart and appealing choice. Simon had been winning cases regularly, and Lois had returned to her job at the advertising agency just two months after giving birth to their twins, receiving a salary increase to thirty-five thousand. Lois strongly pushed for the move, and Simon did not resist her arguments, which seemed convincing at the time: their flat was not suitable for a family, they needed more space, a garden, and a separate area for an au pair. They could have found these in a less trendy part of London, but Lois wanted more than just extra space. Mornington Mansions was not a suitable address for a rising barrister and a successful businesswoman. Even saying the name made her feel it lowered her social and economic status.
Lois decided that one of them should save money by using public transport, and it was clear that Simon would be the one to do so since her office was on the other side of London. The crowded tube ride became a frustrating thirty minutes of resentment and negative thoughts. He often thought of his grandfather's house in Hampstead, where he had spent time as a boy, remembering the comforting smells of dinner and his grandmother's care for her husband after a long day in court. She had been a supportive lawyer's wife, active in legal causes and present at all lawyer events, seemingly happy with her life. But that world was gone. Lois had made it clear before they married that her career was just as important as his. This was a modern marriage, and both their jobs were crucial for their lifestyle, which depended on two incomes.
Now, their hard work was at risk because of Venetia, who had come to their office in a bad mood. Something had upset her, and it was clear she was furious. He regretted being in his room; if he had left earlier, their confrontation might not have happened, and she could have had time to think things over. He remembered her angry accusations clearly. She had defended Brian Cartwright that day, who claimed that when Simon was his lawyer four years ago, he knew about jury bribing and did nothing. Simon denied it, but his response felt weak even to him. He felt guilty, and the shameful memories of his headmaster's punishments flooded back. When he looked into Venetia's eyes, he saw her disbelief and contempt.
He wished he had said, ""Cartwright told me after the trial, but I didn't believe him then, and I don't believe him now. He just wants attention."" Instead, he had told a more dangerous lie, and she knew it was a lie. But why was she so angry? What did his past actions have to do with her? Who made Venetia the judge of their legal practice? Was her own behavior always perfect? Did she have the right to ruin his career? He was uncertain about what she could do, but if this rumor spread, it could destroy him."
CPE_36,C2,"I chose to live in this place because I thought I could be anonymous among people who didn’t mind the worn-out condition of rented houses or messy gardens. However, I was wrong. The shopkeepers, who are living their lives, soon start to recognize me. The beautiful roses from my neighbor’s garden remind me that gardens were once cared for. Usually, I stay inside to forget about the summer outside, but tonight I am watching the swifts flying between the trees and rooftops. I have trimmed some rosemary and lemon balm to make room for a chair, and my arms are stinging from scratches. It’s a small London garden where plants have to grow tall or spread out to survive.
“Been doing some clearing, I see,” says my upstairs neighbor, Jaz, leaning out of her window. She has written several unpublished manuscripts, and I sometimes have to discuss them as part of my job as an English teacher. I have her latest manuscript with me now. “How’s the work going, Jaz?” I ask. “Honestly, in no other job do people ask you about your work so many times a day,” she replies, her voice trailing off before she continues, “I have something to drink in the fridge. I’ll bring it down.” I don’t want Jaz in the garden, and I realize it looks messy and sad. The only way to access the garden is through my flat, and Jaz is knocking on my door. 
“So, you’re on holiday now, lucky you,” she says, lounging in shorts and a tank top while I drop a cushion onto what used to be a small lawn. “Cheers,” she says, acting young. “I should’ve become a teacher—writers don’t get holidays. But you know what they say, those who can, do; those who can’t, teach.” And then there are those who can do neither. “So, what are your plans for the holidays?” All my worries about the end of the school year come rushing back. Empty days, hot sidewalks covered in melted gum, the walk to the shops, and the lonely park bench.
“Actually, I’m going to Stonebridge tomorrow. Can you feed the cats while I’m gone?” My heart races as I ask. “Of course,” Jaz replies, knowing she will be around. “Where will you stay? A fancy B&B?” “No, I’ll be with my oldest friend, Ruby, at the Rising Sun. We’ve known each other since we were eight.” This isn’t true, but I often deal with fiction. “Going back to your roots. What do you think of my manuscript?” My silence makes Jaz ask about her work, The Cruelty of Red Vans, which I have barely read. I like the title and tell her so. I can see how red vans could be cruel, always delivering gifts to others and returning her manuscripts in silly bags.
Something makes me speak honestly for once. “Let me give you a little advice,” I say. “What?” she asks, looking offended. “Try writing about nice people for a change, people who want to be good: a little less self-centeredness, a bit more fiction…” “Teachers!” Jaz responds like a rebellious student ready to defend her work. “I keep a journal where I write something good about each day, no matter how small.” My words sound a bit pretentious. “Keep a journal! Nice people! Get a life, Ann.” Oh, I have a life. I work, go out sometimes, and read on the tube. When we finally go inside, my calm kitchen offers a moment of comfort, but suddenly I remember my old geography teacher, Miss Tarrantine, who was about my age now, winking at us and saying, “I’ve had my moments.” We nearly died laughing."
CPE_6,C2,"**Heritage**
Heritage is important because it connects people and communities to their past. We often feel connected to our personal heritage, knowing about our grandparents and hearing stories about their lives. However, there is also a broader need to understand our history to help us shape our individual and national futures. Heritage represents a desire for continuity; knowing about the past helps us feel secure about the future. Just as we inherit our genes, we also inherit a culture passed down through generations. There may be parts of our national heritage that we do not like, but it is still a part of who we are, and it can be comforting to feel connected to something larger. Heritage teaches us a lot and is essential for our well-being, influencing everything from traditions to material culture. 
In the past, we learned about our heritage through stories and legends from our ancestors. However, modern society has disrupted many communities and families, leading to a loss of this oral tradition. Now, we often rely on places and buildings to remind us of our past. It is crucial to preserve and restore these connections as a tribute to our ancestors' identities.
**The Fens**
Some time ago, I started writing a novel called *Waterland*, where the landscape of a region in England known as the Fens became very important. After the book was published, people often asked why I, a Londoner with no personal ties to the area, chose to write about it. The simple answer is that I found the Fens appealing because they seemed like a flat and empty backdrop for my story. However, I soon realized that the Fens are not flat or empty at all. They are uniquely English yet also strangely captivating. It is surprising that in the heart of England, there is a place that many English people find oddly foreign, especially since many other distinct areas of Britain have become part of the national culture. The Fens are both empty and full, cultivated yet wild, seemingly simple but deeply mysterious. 
While writing my novel, I did not explore the Fens extensively; I have not yet visited places like Wisbech or Prickwillow. As a fiction writer, I prefer to create imagined worlds rather than seek strict factual evidence. However, trying to envision the Fens has its own logic, as shown in Edward Storey's scholarly work, which suggests that the Fens are not just a landscape but also a state of mind.
**Museums**
Museums need to make their collections easy to access. In the past, this meant simply putting items in display cases with long descriptions that were hard for the average person to understand. Today, accessibility should involve more than that. Displays can be engaging and use creative techniques to attract visitors and evoke emotions. However, museums should offer more than just displays; they should reach out to the widest community possible. For example, some museums provide loan boxes of objects for teachers, and recently, this idea has expanded to help elderly people with memory loss.
Museums focus on real artifacts and specimens, not replicas. They exist to provide an authentic experience, showcasing items that have historical significance. This authenticity is what sets them apart from heritage centers, theme parks, books, and digital media. Museums that embrace this challenge and create exciting, accessible displays and outreach programs will find that their competitors in ""virtual history"" can actually help spark interest in the real experiences that museums uniquely offer.
**Architecture and Environment**
The desire to preserve our surroundings is not new, but the rapid changes in our towns affect everyone. This can lead some people to become passionate preservationists while encouraging others to think more deeply about the nature of our towns and their future. It can be argued that people who have lived through significant events, like world wars, are more inclined to value preservation than previous generations, as anything that represents stability becomes important. If there is a psychological need for preservation, planners must consider it. Change is not necessarily negative if we learn how to manage it. Physical changes in our towns reflect social changes, including shifts in population, welfare, and demands."
CPE_33,C2,"**Einstein**
If you stop anyone on the street and ask them to name a scientist, they will likely say Albert Einstein. His image is often used to promote products that suggest intelligence, like computers and encyclopedias. Most people know little about Einstein's work, except that he created complex theories called 'relativity', which are known for being hard to understand and for making strange predictions that seem to go against common sense. Einstein was part of a major shift in scientific thought, a revolution that marked the beginning of modern science in the twentieth century. Physicists and mathematicians were trying to develop a new, more logical way to describe the universe by examining the connections between matter and natural forces. Einstein made significant contributions by rethinking the basic concepts of time, space, matter, and energy. Earlier theories were based on Isaac Newton's idea of a universe where stars and planets moved in a fixed space and time. Einstein challenged this idea, arguing that time and space are not fixed but relative.
**Young Readers**
As children, Lydia and I were skeptical of any book that won awards because we thought it would be boring. Our mother often criticized our lack of appreciation for serious literature, while our father would happily give us small coins for each chapter we read from more challenging books. He would also include a few better books among our Christmas and birthday gifts, clearly marked with the note, 'This Book is NOT Literature'. Although we often dismissed his choices as 'boys' books', he did introduce us to some shorter, quality fiction and, on one occasion, to a well-known collection of poetry.
**Language**
Jacob Grimm wrote in 1851, 'The origin of human language is truly secret and marvellous.' This mystery has led to many unusual theories. For example, Charles Caller suggested in 1928 that early humans made sounds like ""meuh"" when they sensed danger. This sound is quite sad. The early human who traveled through dangerous lands filled with wild animals might have made desperate noises, and some words in our languages still reflect this, like 'malaria', which means ""fever"", or the Latin word 'mors', which means ""death"". Because of such strange ideas, many people avoided discussing the topic, seeing it as a place for odd theories. However, recently, the study of how language began and evolved has become an important area of research. Language likely developed in East Africa about 100,000 years ago. Initially, speech was mainly used for friendly communication and played a key role in power dynamics. Sharing information was probably not the main purpose of early language, which goes against the ideas of philosopher John Locke, who described language as a 'great conduit' for sharing knowledge."
CPE_20,C2,"**Writing Reviews**
Frank Kermode discusses the art of writing reviews from the perspective of someone who practices it. Most reviews are created and shared in ways that limit their lifespan. They often have strict deadlines and length restrictions, and once published, they are only relevant for a short time—usually a day, a week, or at most a month. The temporary nature of reviews often affects how they are viewed. Many people, including the writers themselves, believe that reviewing is not a desirable job and is often done out of necessity, like needing extra money or because one cannot spend all day working on a novel or serious book.
However, writing reviews is a skilled and complex task. Writing a concise review of six to eight hundred words for a newspaper is different from crafting a detailed review of six to eight thousand words for an international journal. A review of fifteen hundred words in a weekly magazine combines challenges from both short and long formats. Reviewers must consider their audience, which can range from casual readers to those deeply interested in the subject.
Additionally, a reviewer needs to have a broad knowledge base and must write in a way that is clear and enjoyable for intelligent readers. This often means that reviewers are also writers of other types of work. For example, the American novelist John Updike, who is somewhat critical of criticism, still engages in reviewing while writing his novels. He collects all his reviews, no matter how brief, into books with modest titles.
Some might think that less prominent writers should accept the temporary nature of their reviews, but it is understandable if they want to preserve their work and take pride in it, especially if they feel their best writing is hidden in reviews. I share this sentiment about my own work. My main focus has been academic writing, and my serious books are typically academic in nature, which is what professors are expected to produce.
In the English-speaking world, there is no strict separation between reviewing and literary study, unlike in some other cultures. It is common for the same individuals to engage in both activities. The past criticism from other academics towards professors who review has diminished, as has the concern from non-professors that professors are taking opportunities away from them. This change is partly due to the increase in reviewing opportunities, allowing more people to participate, and because the rewards for reviewing are often minimal.
I believe this situation benefits both readers and professors. Readers can trust that reviewers have some expertise, and professors can maintain their sanity through this work. It also serves as a reminder for professors to communicate clearly with non-professors. While they may feel the need to use complex language among themselves, they should strive to be understandable when addressing a broader audience.
Ultimately, despite its value, reviewing is often a secondary activity. It is something that can only be done well if one is also engaged in another primary occupation."
CPE_40,C2,"Ralph unlocked the door to his apartment and, as he stepped into the dark, still hallway, he felt a brief sense of ownership. Even after three years, this feeling sometimes hit him when he returned home alone at the end of the day. When he first bought the flat, he would come back eagerly, curious about what had happened while he was away. The flat felt like a welcoming space where he could focus without distractions. He knew he should worry about possible intruders or broken pipes, but his flat always seemed to be waiting for him, reflecting either independence or neglect, depending on how tidy he had left it.
Over time, Ralph began to see the flat as an extension of himself, a place where his thoughts and feelings overflowed. He grew frustrated with its inability to change. There were always a few letters piled up by the door and the answering machine blinking with messages when he returned. He was thankful that his windows were intact and that nothing had been stolen, but he often wondered what the flat would look like if something did happen.
From his dull office on the third floor, Ralph looked forward to his quiet evenings at home. After leaving the busy office, he felt a sense of himself returning during his bus ride, but he still struggled with the need for solitude. At his desk, he longed for time alone with his belongings, but once he escaped, he felt empty and lost. He suspected that the unfulfilling work he did had changed him, distancing him from who he believed he was.
As the night went on, he would read or listen to music, but he often questioned why he did these things. His sense of direction in life had faded, and thoughts would come and go without making sense. He remembered a time when he felt more in control, but he had been so eager to find something meaningful that he followed the first opportunity that came his way, as if it was meant to be.
After university, he had tried to create a plan for a better life, but he was not surprised to find that he only wanted to get by. He applied for jobs he heard about from friends, trailing behind them as they moved forward, unable to see how he could find happiness in his work. He attended one interview with gratitude, not thinking to evaluate the job itself—a vague editorial position at a local free newspaper. After a pleasant conversation with Neil, his future boss, he was offered the job on the spot, learning that he was the only graduate who had applied. At the time, Ralph took this as a compliment, though he didn’t fully understand what it meant for his future."
CPE_45,C2,"**Goat Racing**
I was about to see goat racing on Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. I pushed my way through ice-cream vans, large crowds, food stalls, and loud music. Although everyone was moving towards the racecourse, I tried to find a good spot to watch. An area was set up as a course for the goats. It wasn’t as formal as regular racecourses, but the idea was similar: spectators lined both sides of a stretch of ground where the goats would run. Keeping a few selected goats in line was challenging, especially since goats are known for eating almost anything they find.
**Canoe Trip**
As the day ended, I began to worry about the night ahead. The canoe was too wet to sleep in, and there were no places to stop. We hadn’t seen any villages or huts since early morning. In the dim moonlight, we could barely see the cliffs, and our flashlight batteries were dying. We replaced the batteries, but they didn’t work. Clearly, we wouldn’t find a camping spot. A few miles later, Lesley shouted that she saw a flickering light, and we felt hopeful. However, the light turned out to be moonlight reflecting on the waves. Soon, we heard the loud sound of rushing water, but we couldn’t see what was happening. Time seemed to stand still as we continued on.
**How to Be Presentation Perfect**
I am not naturally good at making presentations, but as managing director, I often need to present to my colleagues and major shareholders. How can I improve my presentation skills and confidence? You are not alone in this. Presenting requires different skills than running a company, yet many senior executives are expected to be good at it. To convince your audience, you must first believe in what you are saying. Show your belief through the passion and enthusiasm you bring to your presentation. This means you need to prepare well. Test your ideas beforehand and ask colleagues to help identify tough questions your audience might ask. You should also create a positive atmosphere from the beginning. Start with something everyone can relate to and gradually lead to the conclusion you want to reach."
CPE_64,C2,"Some activities cannot be rushed; they require their own time. For example, if you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you are impatient with mayonnaise and add the oil too quickly, it will curdle. Similarly, if you pull on a tangled fishing line in frustration, the knot will only get tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some functions happen very quickly, while others take longer—seconds, minutes, hours, days, or even years. We can speed up some tasks, like solving crossword puzzles or doing math, but others cannot be rushed. If we try to hurry them, they may fail, just like the mayonnaise or the fishing line.
The idea of ""Think fast; we need results"" can be as unhelpful as trying to shorten a night's sleep. We learn, think, and understand in various ways, and these different modes of thinking work at different speeds and are suited for different tasks. There are three main processing speeds in the mind. 
The first is faster than thought. Some situations require an immediate, instinctive reaction. For instance, when my motorbike skidded on a wet road, my body and mind quickly coordinated movements to keep me safe, and only afterward did my conscious mind catch up. This quick response can be called our ""wits."" 
The second speed involves actual thinking, where we analyze situations, weigh options, and solve problems. A mechanic figuring out why an engine won’t start, a scientist interpreting an experiment, or a student working on an assignment are all using this logical, deliberate thinking, often referred to as ""intellect."" People who excel at these tasks are often called ""bright"" or ""clever.""
The third speed is slower and less direct. It is more relaxed, playful, or dreamy. In this mode, we reflect or contemplate. For example, sitting on a rock by the sea, lost in thought, is different from planning a meal or writing a letter. This slower way of thinking is just as valuable as the faster ones. Allowing our minds to wander is essential, especially when life gets busy. We need this ""tortoise mind"" as much as the ""hare brain."" 
Some everyday problems are better approached with a slow mind. Complex situations often require a relaxed, open attitude. Research shows that patient, less deliberate thinking is particularly effective for understanding complicated or unclear situations. Deliberate thinking works well for straightforward problems, like planning a holiday. But when the situation is unclear or subtle, we need to use our tortoise mind. 
For example, if we are trying to manage a difficult team at work or deciding whether to change careers, it may be wiser to sit and think rather than rush for answers. This type of intelligence is linked to creativity and wisdom. Poets and philosophers have long recognized the limits of conscious thinking and have sought to develop these slower, deeper ways of knowing. Recently, scientists have begun to study these slower modes of thought. The field of cognitive science is showing that our unconscious mind can accomplish many complex tasks if given enough time. It can recognize patterns that our conscious mind might miss, understand complicated situations, and resolve difficult issues more effectively than our active intellect."
CPE_29,C2,"**Surviving in a Foreign Land**
I have been welcomed warmly in a very isolated place. There are about forty people here, including scientists, students, and weather experts, all living in a close community where everyone helps each other. My basic French is just enough to communicate, but I struggle with casual conversation. I miss the subtle meanings in conversations, and my phrasebook is not helpful during breakfast. While this is not a practical problem, it did affect my self-confidence at first. I felt nervous about mealtimes, unsure of which table to choose, and I was anxious when I spoke. I still smile awkwardly or feel panicked when people talk to me. I think my occasional sadness comes from losing the social confidence I used to have.
**Elliot**
When I first met Elliot, I was just a young author, and he didn’t pay much attention to me. He remembered faces, though, and would greet me politely when we met, but he didn’t seem interested in getting to know me better. If I saw him at the opera with someone important, he would often ignore me. However, when I became successful as a playwright, I noticed that Elliot started to show more interest in me. One day, he invited me to lunch, and I thought he was testing me. After my success brought me many new friends, I began to see him more often.
**Alfred Hitchcock**
The film director Alfred Hitchcock always claimed that he didn’t care about the story or the acting in his films. Instead, he focused on the visuals and the sound. For Hitchcock, it wasn’t a message or a great performance that moved the audience; he believed that people respond to the pure experience of film, no matter their cultural background. He thought that if a film is made well, audiences from Japan and India should react at the same moment. Hitchcock was very clear and logical in his self-assessment. He was a rational man and a brilliant craftsman who loved to see audiences react strongly. He didn’t engage in speculation or abstract ideas, and he didn’t explore his characters deeply. His focus was on film itself and the precise, measurable beauty of what film can do to an audience."
CPE_57,C2,"**Amateur Astronomy**
Astronomy has changed a lot in the last fifty years. Until about thirty years ago, there were not many charts and catalogues available. The telescopes were basic, and there were few practical astronomy books. Today, there is a wide variety of telescopes and equipment available for everyone. Electronic calculators and computers have greatly improved the production of almanacs and charts, making it easier to analyze observations and publish results. This could be seen as the golden age of amateur astronomy. However, some things have been lost. Now, you might have to travel 80 kilometers to find a dark sky, which was easier to find in cities fifty years ago. Daytime skies are often filled with trails from airplanes, which can last for hours and create clouds, making it hard to observe the sun and stars at night.
**Too Much Choice**
Today, people face ""overchoice."" There are too many things to do and too many options available. In our modern economy, the desire for new products and services has become an addiction, and technology speeds up this constant change. New products appear quickly, and just as you get used to one, another one is launched. This can be overwhelming and tiring, leading to a feeling of disconnection from life. While choice is celebrated in our economy, having too many options can cause stress, take up time, and create complexity. As a result, many people are looking for ""simplexity""—the simple things that bring meaning to our complicated lives. However, simplifying life is challenging in a world filled with excess. There are more brands of detergent and breakfast cereals than we could ever need, along with countless software updates and plans to choose from.
**McAndrews Hotel**
Every summer, my family spends two weeks at McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. This tradition started with my grandmother and has become very important to us. Nothing can disrupt this ritual. We are a unique group of guests at McAndrews: perhaps old-fashioned or even snobbish. I dislike the rude behavior of shop assistants that is often mistaken for equality today. I also find it annoying when waiters act overly friendly, as if they are trying too hard to be casual. I know the names of many other guests, as they have been coming here since childhood like me. However, I appreciate that when I see them in the hotel, we only exchange polite greetings, without any need for deeper conversation. This respect for personal space and dignity is rare in today’s commercial world."
CPE_9,C2,"**Othello**  
The move of an outstanding production of Shakespeare's play *Othello* from Stratford to London gives me a chance to correct an unfair review I wrote when the show first opened last spring. At that time, I criticized Ray Fearon for being too young for the title role and I unfairly judged his acting. I still believe that changing the age difference between Othello and Desdemona distorts the tragedy, but I take back my negative comments about Mr. Fearon's excellent performance. The entire cast is impressive. Notable scenes include the one where Cassio's competitive games with other young officers spiral out of control, and the moment when Iago starts to lose his composure and struggles to regain control. I challenge anyone not to be moved to tears during the scene where Emilia helps Desdemona prepare for bed. The pace and tension throughout the play are fantastic. Do not miss this production.
**Lake Vostok**  
In the center of Antarctica, there is complete stillness. On the edges of the continent, there are many penguins, seals, and birds. However, in the vast white interior, life cannot survive. The exception is a large hidden body of freshwater called Lake Vostok, which lies beneath nearly 4 kilometers of ice, directly under the coldest place on Earth. This water has been isolated from air and sunlight for up to 25 million years. Biologists are eager to explore its mysterious depths and find out what unusual organisms may exist there. Geologists and glaciologists are also very interested. For the past two years, researchers worldwide have been planning ways to uncover the secrets of the lake, and if they succeed, we will soon enter the decade of Lake Vostok.
**Scientists**  
Last week, I heard an interesting discussion on the radio. A group of scientists is debating what motivates them to become scientists; the phrase ""because it's there"" comes to mind. We all know that the quest for knowledge drives us, the desire to understand everything from atoms to black holes. However, these scientists want to understand why we have this desire for knowledge and why science cannot explain this motivation. I believe it is more important to focus on whether what we scientists are doing is right, rather than getting caught up in discussions about the purpose of science. The key issue is not why we pursue science, but to recognize that science is a tool, and we should decide how, where, when, and why to use it."
CPE_42,C2,"**Food**  
Our relationship with food is very basic and fulfilling. Many people who enjoy cooking buy cookbooks like this one, but often we think that cooking is only worth it for special occasions or complicated dishes. This is not true. For example, if you chop some carrots, a leek, celery, and herbs and boil them in water, you can make a delicious soup. This is much more rewarding than buying a pre-made one. Instead of purchasing a sugary chocolate mousse filled with preservatives, you can quickly make a tasty dessert that both adults and children will enjoy. Cooking is also a way to show care and love by sharing your creations, no matter how simple. Food has deep meaning in our lives, which is why we celebrate important events like birthdays and anniversaries around the table. No one would choose to have takeout for a wedding or anniversary, nor would anyone want to discuss a business deal over canned soup.
**In the Elevator**  
This morning, Alistair tried to tidy up his office, but papers were still scattered everywhere. Tax forms and other documents were overflowing from drawers and boxes, waiting for a day when he felt like organizing them. He also had a lot of paperwork from owning an apartment building. The many books and journals were only close to the new bookshelves. As the elevator took him to his floor, he knew Mallory would arrive on time for their meeting. She would knock on his office door exactly at the hour. She was very punctual and neat. He wondered how she would react to the mess; she might think someone had broken in. He could pretend to be shocked when he walked in after her. Mrs. Wilson, his cleaning lady, had come while he was trying to clear some space on the floor. When he peeked out of his office as she was unlocking his apartment, he smiled at her, hoping she would help. But her expression was cold, and she seemed to think there was no way she would go into his messy office, which was not her responsibility. He knew Mrs. Wilson saw him as someone from a different world, not someone who belonged to her familiar Brooklyn neighborhood.
**KAREN**  
Karen had a simple wish: not to be like her mother. This desire inspired her to create her own story, one that emphasized her uniqueness and strength. In her personal narrative, there were important moments, like when she was twelve and her brother accidentally hit her in the eye with a golf club. At that moment, she feared she would go blind. Fortunately, her bone protected her, as the doctor later confirmed. The club had missed her eye, leaving her with just a few stitches that healed over time. When she opened her eyes in the doctor's office, she saw her mother, who was predictably talking about miracles and small blessings. In that moment, Karen realized she was saved for a reason.
**Miss Fogerty**  
Miss Fogerty was hurrying back to her work across the wet grass of the village green, feeling both excited and sad about what she had just seen. It is thrilling to be the first to learn something important, especially in a small community where life can be quiet. However, she was also deeply saddened by Dr. Bailey's health issues. He had been her doctor for many years, and she appreciated his care during her frequent laryngitis episodes, which were her only health concerns. Miss Fogerty valued Dr. Bailey's ability to make her feel like there was always enough time to talk about her worries. This quality made him beloved in the village. He was always willing to share his time, knowledge, and humor, which earned him great loyalty and affection from the community."
CPE_59,C2,"**Joanna's Lessons**
Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist, but she has also started writing books for young children who are learning to play the piano. Her performances are exciting and impressive, showcasing her incredible skill on the piano. Recently, during a concert for kids, a small boy asked her if she could play the theme from ""Match of the Day."" This request surprised many experienced musicians, but Joanna found it amusing. She realized that, in the boy's eyes, she needed to play that piece to be considered a true pianist.
Joanna is unique among top concert pianists because she cares about how young children learn music. Despite her packed schedule, she has published a beginner's piano book called ""Joanna MacGregor's Piano World."" This summer, she is involved in many music festivals and collaborations, and she runs her own recording label, Sound Circus. She loves working with other artists and often suggests new projects.
She believes that the early lessons in music are very important. Many music teachers focus on training exceptional talent, but Joanna thinks that most people enjoy music in a more everyday way. She wants to make music accessible to everyone, regardless of their skill level. 
Joanna has experience teaching beginners, as she taught many children piano between the ages of 18 and 25. Growing up, she was surrounded by children of all backgrounds who wanted to play different types of music. She believes that just like everyone should learn to swim or speak a little French, everyone should have the chance to learn the piano.
Some children learn quickly, while others take their time and may give up. This can happen at any stage of learning. Some kids find the beginning too hard, while others feel pressured to perform like the talented children they see on television. Joanna worries that some parents use music as a way to push their children to achieve, rather than letting them enjoy it. She thinks that children often quit because they feel they cannot meet their parents' expectations.
When asked if she thinks other piano teaching books are not good enough, Joanna is careful not to criticize them. She acknowledges that her books are colorful and engaging, but they are not the only ones available to help beginners enjoy learning. To make her books appealing, she includes stories and music on CDs that accompany the lessons. This way, learning becomes fun and interesting.
As children progress, they face new challenges, such as learning to read music instead of just playing by ear. Joanna understands this struggle because she relied on her ear when she was younger. However, she believes that practice is the most important part of learning. She encourages children to play pieces multiple times and to set clear goals for their practice sessions. 
Joanna admits that she did not practice seriously until she attended the Royal Academy of Music, where she developed a challenging repertoire. Now, she enjoys practicing for eight hours a day, which she considers essential to her musical life. She empathizes with those who find practice difficult and believes it is a common issue that is not discussed enough. 
To make practice effective, she suggests planning what to focus on, rewarding yourself by playing through pieces, and mixing difficult pieces with easier ones."
CPE_54,C2,"**Writing by Hand and on Screen**
Dr. Johnson believed that ""what is written without effort is usually read without pleasure."" This means that good writing often requires hard work. When I look back at my handwritten school essays, I notice they had very few corrections. Today, I would rewrite them many times. I think this is because writing by hand was physically challenging. The slow pace of writing helped me think carefully. In contrast, typing on a computer can lead to careless mistakes. Many writers find that the time spent fixing early drafts on a computer is about the same as the time spent writing by hand. 
Also, emails, unlike handwritten letters, often lack emotional depth. While many love letters are now sent via email, they can feel less personal. At least these emails are written in some form of English and grammar. However, words on a screen can feel dull. Writers may not fully understand the impact of their words and often exaggerate their meaning. Quick, typed messages can lack the thoughtfulness and personality of handwritten notes.
**The CD**
I put down my cup and went to look at the CD. The case was disappointing, but the shiny disc inside looked interesting. ""Wonderful little things, aren't they?"" Mr. Warriston said as he entered the room. I agreed and handed the disc to him carefully. ""It's amazing they can fit seventy minutes of music on these,"" he continued, turning on the hi-fi. Lights lit up, and he pressed a button to open a small drawer. He placed the disc inside, pressed the button again, and the drawer closed. ""Some people say they sound sterile, but I think they..."" 
""Do you have to turn them over like records?"" I asked. 
""What? No,"" Mr. Warriston replied, surprised. ""You only play one side."" 
""Why?"" I asked. He looked puzzled and then thoughtful. ""You know, I have no idea. I don't see why both sides couldn't be playable to double the capacity..."" He stared at the machine. ""You could use two lasers or just turn it over by hand... hmm."" He smiled at me. ""Yes, good point."" He gestured to my wooden chair. ""Anyway, come on, let's get you sitting in the best spot for the stereo effect, okay?"" I smiled, happy to have asked a technical question that Mr. Warriston couldn't answer.
**Books vs. Electronic Text**
When comparing books and electronic text, the author Malcolm Bradbury made a good point. He said that if matches had been invented after cigarette lighters, we would have admired the improvement. Many people excited about new technology claim that electronic text is as significant as the invention of printing and that it is almost complete. However, they overlook the fact that changes in how we think take generations. This attitude is called chronocentricity, the belief that our generation is at a crucial point in history. 
For example, a book from 1979 predicted that by the 1980s, traditional books would slowly fade away. So far, this has not happened. Reading long texts on a screen is often frustrating, so many people avoid it. Additionally, the way information is organized on computers encourages people to skim rather than read deeply. Some tech enthusiasts argue that this quick reading leads to new storytelling forms, but non-linear reading is not new. Many books, like religious texts and poetry collections, have never been read from start to finish. What is different now is that computers do not encourage the deep thinking that comes from reading a text in its entirety.
**The Office**
Charles walked into the office and found a perfectly organized space. The carpet was clear of the papers that had once covered it, and the dark wooden desk looked just as he remembered from the Sotheby's auction five weeks ago. Neat file holders were being placed in their correct drawers, and twelve years' worth of trade journals filled one wall's shelves. Kathleen struggled to close the filing cabinet and then turned to him. ""You have to use computers, Charles. This is just too much."" 
""Hello, Kathleen. Oh, this is amazing,"" he said, admiring the room's antique furniture. He couldn't imagine a computer or any mechanical device in this space, not even a pencil sharpener. ""Simply amazing,"" he said, avoiding the topic of computers. Over the two years he had known her, they had discussed this many times. She could never understand why he resisted technology, especially since he was skilled with computers and had even published an important paper on computer-mode giftedness, inspired by her. She could easily manipulate software to create something new and exciting."
CPE_32,C2,"""You don't take sugar, do you?"" shouted his secretary, not really asking but stating a fact. She had been making Lancelot coffee for many months. Her excuse for forgetting was that he usually wasn't supposed to be there. However, he had started coming in all the time, realizing that staying away only led to more problems. He thought about how he had gone from being a respected advisor, meeting authors and playwrights over lunch, to a stressed worker trying to keep everything from falling apart, struggling to find parking when he arrived at the office.
""This came,"" she yelled, waving a manila folder before placing it in front of him. ""From that guy in Los Angeles. You wanted to see it."" A label on the folder read: ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert,"" and below it, ""An Expanded Synopsis."" Lancelot felt uneasy about the word ""synopsis."" He wanted to see a label that said ""A First Draft."" He had already seen a synopsis of this book and didn't want to see another one, even if it was revised. Ian Cuthbert had received a large advance for this book when Lancelot had bought the company. Ian was one of several old friends Lancelot had mistakenly commissioned books from. He was a clear example of how someone with a difficult personality often becomes even harder to manage when given a chance.
Lancelot skipped the introduction he had read many times and looked at the synopsis. He recognized almost every phrase. He closed the folder and pushed it aside. Clearly, at this rate, Ian's manuscript would never arrive. The synopsis lacked the brilliance Ian was known for, and beneath its playful tone, it felt empty and unconvincing. Lancelot remembered stories of a famous author whose last book was published incomplete after his death, written chapter by chapter for payments that were never given. In Ian's case, he had received a huge advance, which went against the usual rule that authors must deliver a manuscript before getting paid.
Lancelot, who had studied modern languages at Oxford, recalled when Ian Cuthbert was seen as a promising talent in Cambridge, a place full of potential. Ian's peers aimed to take over British theatre, and they succeeded quickly. But Ian seemed lazy compared to them. He wore his overcoat like a cape and spoke about a famous French writer as if he had been there. Yet, for some reason, Ian's creative talent remained hidden. While less talented people succeeded, Ian withdrew further. Even at the height of his influence, he was difficult to work with. Appointed to edit a major arts magazine, he wasted the budget for many issues without producing anything. His renewed contract with a fashion magazine led to stories about his high pay, which increased in an attempt to make him produce more, and then even more to get him to produce anything at all.
At editorial meetings, where famous photographers were always present, Ian would criticize others' ideas harshly. Ten years later, he could hardly be counted on to show up for his own funeral. Lancelot was close to admitting that ""A World History of the Short"" had been a mistake from the very beginning."
CPE_65,C2,"**England's Breakfast Revolution**
Health experts agree that a good breakfast is very important. However, in history, breakfast is a relatively recent development in England. You rarely find mentions of breakfast in medieval literature. There are some references to travelers eating a meal at dawn before long journeys and to sick people having breakfast for health reasons, but most people did not eat breakfast unless they were kings or nobles.
In the sixteenth century, breakfast started to become common for everyone, not just the wealthy. Some writers believe this change happened because food became more available. However, they often overlook other significant social changes. For instance, new work patterns meant that more people had jobs with set hours, often starting very early in the morning. As a result, eating a meal first thing in the morning became necessary and was no longer just a sign of social status."
CPE_61,C2,"**Photography**  
When a photographer takes a picture, they choose visual information based on their technical skills, personal views, and experiences, as well as social and cultural norms. Throughout this book, we will explore how these factors influence the style, content, and meaning of a photograph, and how viewers perceive and react to these images. For instance, a casual newspaper reader may have an instinctive understanding of the photographs in the paper. However, instead of accepting the photograph as it is, we might ask if it truly represents the scene as it appeared at that moment. Alternatively, does it express the photographer's perspective? Is the exact moment captured the most important part, or should we see the photograph as a symbol of a larger situation in the world?
**More than a Game**  
For me, sport has always been more than just a game. The most successful athletes have complete self-confidence. To succeed in sports, you need to focus intensely and prioritize your goals. The path to being the best is challenging, and you must be prepared to make sacrifices. Sport is competitive, and no one will do the hard work for you. It’s a matter of survival. Sport has taught me discipline and determination, but it also shows the value of teamwork. My sport allows me to shine individually, yet it is still a team effort, and I must balance both aspects. This is similar to life—while you can achieve personal success, you should always remember the people around you. Sport has given me a lot, not just financially. It has opened many opportunities for me and allowed me to see parts of the world that others may never experience. However, you also have to give up a lot to enjoy these benefits.
**Tuning In**  
Some experiences are so vivid that they create clear memories in our minds. For me, one such moment happened many years ago in California when I lay awake, listening to the beautiful song of a mockingbird hidden in a tall tree in my neighborhood. I don’t have trouble sleeping, but the bird's amazing singing kept me awake. As I listened to its complex melodies, I found myself in a surprising artistic experience. To appreciate the bird's patterns, I drew on my knowledge of jazz and Indian classical music. The bird made me feel like I was enjoying an incredible live performance filled with stunning improvisation. I reacted with joy and excitement as each unexpected musical variation followed another through the open window until I finally fell asleep."

Human culture has always had strong feelings about birds, whether we love, fear, or admire them. But what does this say about us? Paul Evans explores this idea. 
In a greenhouse, a little brown bird, a wren, is bumping against the glass. This bird is often seen as a symbol of important messages or omens. Is it trying to tell me something from a world beyond my understanding, or is it just a bird trapped inside? Depending on how you look at it, both could be true. 
Wrens have been part of British culture for a long time. In medieval times, people believed that the direction in which wrens flew could predict their luck. Today, images of wrens can still be found in many British homes. Although some old beliefs may have faded, the wren still holds a special place in our hearts. A place without wrens feels empty and lacking. 
This connection to birds is rooted in folklore, which reflects how people once understood the world around them. In the past, when survival depended more on nature, people developed a way to communicate the importance of other creatures. However, cultural changes can alter how we view these animals. 
For example, the red kite was once admired in London for its ability to take food from children. Over time, it became seen as a pest and nearly disappeared from many areas, except for Wales. Recently, red kites have been celebrated again as symbols of conservation, and efforts have been made to reintroduce them to their former habitats. 
Our bond with birds goes back to our early human history. The first birdwatchers likely paid close attention to birds because they signaled danger, weather changes, and food availability. Birds also connected them to their dreams. When we wonder why birds matter to us, we are also exploring what it means to be human. The concepts of flight, song, and freedom reflect our own identity in relation to nature. 
Some may think these feelings are outdated, remnants of our past. However, like certain body parts that we no longer need, these feelings are still part of us, and losing them would be difficult. This is why birds have become symbols of environmental change, serving as indicators of ecological health. In Britain, 30 bird species are now endangered, which is troubling not only because we are losing these beautiful creatures but also because it represents a significant cultural loss. 
Birds carry deep cultural meanings. For instance, the skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing represent different kinds of love and magic. Readers of poets like Shelley and Shakespeare feel a sense of loss for these once-common birds. Yet, the disappearance of other birds that are not part of literature or folklore often goes unnoticed. 
Folklore is crucial. The stories and legends that have survived through time create a stronger connection to their subjects than scientific terms do. This connection evokes emotions and attitudes that are often hidden beneath the complexities of modern life. Whether we watch wildlife documentaries or observe birds in our gardens, our experiences with birds cannot be fully explained by science. Birds engage us in ways that are difficult to express, and the stories we tell about them help us understand what they might be communicating. 
The wren in the greenhouse connects the present with a distant past, holding onto its song and moving into the future—a mystery that keeps me intrigued."
CPE_28,C2,"**Maps**
The main purpose of a map is to visually show the relationships between different points and features on the Earth's surface. These relationships are based on distance and direction. In ancient times, distance was often described in terms of time, such as ""a few hours' walk"" or ""a day's journey by river."" These descriptions were more about how easy it was to travel through the local terrain rather than the actual distance. Direction was also important, but for most travelers, the key questions were ""Where do I go from here?"" and ""How far is it?"" Therefore, precise direction was not always crucial. For a long time, written directions were just as popular as maps. Even today, some maps, like those showing train routes, do not always represent true directions.
Initially, important landmarks along a route were marked by signs, which could be realistic or symbolic, and their size indicated their significance. The conventions used in maps varied based on their purpose and location, so understanding these conventions is essential when studying early maps. The history of map-making, or cartography, is mainly about improving the accuracy of distance and direction and expanding the content of maps. To achieve this, cartography has incorporated knowledge from other sciences. For instance, instead of determining direction by observing shadows or stars, people began using the magnetic compass and developed tools to measure angles accurately.
As exploration expanded our understanding of the world, astronomers found that the Earth is not a perfect sphere but slightly flattened at the poles, leading to further improvements in mapping large areas. The needs of map users also changed significantly. Travelers and merchants were no longer the only ones using maps. Soldiers, especially after the invention of artillery, required accurate maps to understand the terrain for military purposes. This need led to the creation of contour maps. Later, archaeologists, historians, and modern geographers each had their own specific mapping needs.
Today’s cartographers have developed methods to map various distributions, such as geological layers, climate zones, and land use. The growing recognition of the importance of maps in many scientific fields has sparked a modern revival in cartography. However, it is important to note that the development of mapping has not always been smooth. There have been times of stagnation and periods of rapid progress, where old ideas coexisted with new ones. Cartographers have often understood the theoretical basis for advancements but had to wait for better tools to implement their ideas. Since it is easier to create a map by copying an existing one, and because map publishers have sometimes resisted new ideas, maps should not be blindly accepted as accurate representations of current knowledge and techniques.
The many thousands of maps we have today are the result of significant human effort and thought. They provide an invaluable record for those studying human history. This aspect makes the study of historical cartography both fascinating and educational."
CPE_35,C2,"
I was taken into a young man's drawing room, which was a calm and cultured space surrounded by a messy collection of rooms where the less ambitious family members lived. Moving from the kitchen to his room felt like going from economy to business class. In this room, I saw the largest collection of records I had ever encountered, the first stereo record player and tuner I had seen, and surprising evidence that a teenager had spent money on Georgian wine glasses, pictures, and furniture. This teenager was Andrew Lloyd Webber. He had received a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford, to study history, and he had nine months before starting, during which he wanted to become England's version of the composer Richard Rodgers. My own dreams were just as unrealistic; I wanted to be a pop star for the usual reasons: women, money, and fame. However, my dreams were not as crucial to me as Andrew's were to him. If I had failed, it might have felt like a big deal, but I was able to say that now. So, when Andrew suggested that I try to become a famous lyricist like Oscar Hammerstein, I was open to the idea. This was partly because, within ten minutes of meeting him, he played me three of his own tunes on the piano, and I could tell he was very talented. As he confidently played selections from the many shows he had created at school, I was reminded of the best show albums from my parents' collection. He needed a new lyricist for his work. I didn’t have much to impress him with, except for my genuine praise for his music and a seven-inch single of a song I had written that an unknown pop group had recorded, which had not helped their struggling career. We said goodbye, promising to meet again and write something together. I was still more interested in pop charts than in West End theatre, but on the bus back to my flat, I realized I had met someone with rare talent and determination, and I would be foolish to miss the chance to work with someone who was likely to succeed in musical theatre very soon. Even if we didn’t become top composers, we could try to compete with the Beatles and Rolling Stones later in the summer. The Everly Brothers had just made a comeback and would need new songs. 
The next day, back at my desk in the office where I was training to be a lawyer, the excitement I had felt about a life in show business with Andrew Lloyd Webber had faded a bit. I would still look at small ads in Melody Maker for groups needing a singer and write a few more simple songs that wouldn’t show off my limited singing ability. However, it was likely that I would finish my exams and become a respectable lawyer by the time I was twenty-five. By then, I would probably have outgrown pop music, as my father had predicted I would by twenty-one. This worried me—if he was right, I only had a few more months to enjoy it. But for now, I felt I had nothing to lose by seeing Andrew again. It would be fun to go to a musical with him and write lyrics that mimicked musical lyricists instead of pop stars. Andrew was an interesting person who talked about Good Food Guides and Victorian architecture, and he supported the Leyton Orient football team. I wasn’t sure about the idea for a musical he had been working on for the past year, but in 1965, I was rarely sure about anything. His talent was undeniable, and he claimed to have all the right contacts. Soon, I was back in his drawing room. The idea was about the life of Dr. Thomas Barnardo, a nineteenth-century philanthropist who founded orphanages. His story was important, but it didn’t really inspire me. The hero seemed too perfect in Andrew's version, and the idea felt unoriginal, too similar to Lionel Bart's hit show, Oliver. However, Andrew's strong belief in his music's brilliance was contagious and somewhat justified. What did I know about musicals? As David Land, who would later be my agent for over twenty-five years, often said, if there is a demand for one hamburger bar on the block, there is room for two. We could be the second hamburger joint. I started working with great enthusiasm, especially on the funny songs. Andrew explained the plot, played me the tunes, and often gave me the titles, most of which had likely been thought up by his former school friend who had already tried writing. I even skipped a day at the law office, pretending to be sick, to write my first set of theatrical lyrics. I didn’t realize it at the time, but that day marked a change in my career."
CPE_5,C2,"**Language**  
You and I are part of a species with a unique ability: we can influence each other's thoughts with great accuracy. Language is so deeply connected to human life that it is hard to imagine living without it. If you see two or more people together anywhere in the world, they will likely start talking to each other. When people are alone, they often talk to themselves, their pets, or even their plants. I like to think of language as an 'instinct.' This means that people know how to communicate in a way similar to how spiders know how to spin webs. Web-spinning was not created by a brilliant spider and does not require special education or skills in building.
**Climate and Weather**  
Climate and weather, which are mainly influenced by the air around us, greatly impact the lives and locations of animals and plants. Climate can strongly shape the appearance of landscapes. For instance, warm and wet conditions throughout the year support the growth of tropical rainforests, which are rich in diverse species. In contrast, cold and windy regions can only support a limited variety of life. The daily weather patterns that contribute to the overall climate are caused by large air masses rising and mixing, as the atmosphere is always in motion. Some of this movement is due to the fact that the layer of gases is on a spinning planet. Because air is light, it does not move at the same speed as the Earth and tends to lag behind. However, a more significant cause of air movement is the sun.
**Coffee**  
As a barista, my job included serving drinks, but I was also responsible for making coffee, which was a big deal. In Lygon Street, Melbourne, a restaurant's success can depend on its coffee quality. I underwent several days of intense training on how to make coffee, learning more than I ever wanted to know about cleaning and maintaining the restaurant's shiny espresso machine. I also learned the key principles for making a perfect, creamy cappuccino. By the end of the first week, I realized that making good coffee was not as simple as it seemed, and I feared I would be assigned to cleaning duties again. Fortunately, my boss was understanding. He told me, ""Making coffee is both an art and a science, and you need time to develop your skills."""
CPE_41,C2,"**Art on TV**
Why does television often struggle with programs about visual arts? Painting and sculpture are perfect for the camera, which can show an entire artwork and zoom in on details. However, there are few TV series that truly capture the joy and complexity of viewing art. A clear example of this issue is Robert Hughes's eight-part series, *American Visions*. Hughes is a respected critic with a strong presence, and he has nearly eight hours to introduce British viewers to a type of art that is often overlooked in British galleries. I expected the series to highlight great artworks, but instead, it focused on how American history and culture are reflected in its art and architecture.
**Dealing in Metals**
For 20 years, I worked as an international metals dealer and became known as a speculator. The metals market is less regulated than others. With some luck, a willingness to take risks, and a good understanding of the market, it is possible to earn a lot of money. Risk-taking is a normal part of this industry, which fits well with a free-market global economy. However, free-trade economists who believed that the market would keep the prices of scarce metals stable have discovered the opposite is true. More minerals are being extracted, and the cost of raw materials is falling. When considering inflation, the prices of most metals are now about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to investigate claims against a multinational company that benefits from these low-cost raw materials.
**Extract from a Holiday Brochure**
Abaco and its offshore cays are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas, stretching from Florida to Cuba. Each island has its own character and attractions. To explore the islands and cays of Abaco, a boat is essential. If a boat is not included with your accommodation, don’t worry. There are many ferries and water taxis available, or you can rent a boat if you prefer to explore on your own. Sailing is the most popular way to travel here, and Abaco is known as 'The Sailing Capital of the World' for good reason. The calm, protected waters are also perfect for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The cays and their beaches extend for 200 miles, resembling a string of pearls. At night, the lights from the restaurants and cafes in Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay shine brightly, adding to the beauty of the area."
CPE_69,C2,"**Build Your Own Bamboo Bike at the UK’s First Workshop**
Join a course at the Bamboo Bike Club, led by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan, where you can create your own custom bike frame and enjoy a fun weekend of bike-building. It’s Saturday morning in Hackney Wick, east London, and the Bamboo Bike Club is busy with activity. This is the only place in Britain where you can learn to build bikes from bamboo, a material that is becoming popular in bike construction.
Bamboo bikes have a long history, with companies like Calfee Design from California and Bamboo Bikes from Yorkshire bringing back this method, which dates back to 1894. However, many cyclists find ready-made bamboo frames too expensive, costing around $2,995 or £1,868. This high price motivated James and Ian to spend years working in a shed in Brecon, Wales, to create a bamboo bike business that is affordable for regular cyclists. They wanted to do more than just sell frames; they aimed to share the joy of making something unique and sustainable.
The Bamboo Bike Club is more of a community than a traditional business. Both James and Ian have full-time jobs—James works on wind turbines, and Ian is a civil engineer. They run monthly courses where participants can build their own bikes at a reasonable price. 
As someone who struggles with DIY projects, I was curious about the quality of the bikes. On the first day, James and Ian teach us how to choose strong bamboo and create sturdy joints. We start by assembling the front triangle using 40 mm diameter bamboo, then move on to the thinner parts for the seat and chain assembly. Alloy tubes are added for the handlebars and other parts that need extra strength. This process requires careful cutting and technical skills, but James and Ian are there to help, ensuring everything is done correctly.
The chance to build your own bike is a big draw for many participants, especially since most of them are engineers. Ian reassures us that mistakes are normal, and if something goes wrong, we can just try again with a new piece of bamboo. Each bamboo length is checked for quality, allowing us to choose the look of our frame—plain bamboo, black, or mottled.
On Sunday, we focus on building the lugs, which involves wrapping hemp bindings around the joints and using epoxy resin to create a strong bond. After adding a waterproof coating, the bike is ready for wheels, brakes, gears, and personal touches. James and Ian claim that their bamboo bikes are just as strong as metal ones. Ian has been riding his for over a year, and James has tested his bike off-road for three months without any issues.
While bamboo bikes may not look as polished as professional frames, they have a unique charm. James and Ian emphasize that individuality is important. Personally, I prefer a bike that offers a relaxed ride, so I choose a 'Classic English' frame for a smooth experience. 
When I take James’s bike for a ride, I find it light and comfortable, thanks to bamboo’s ability to absorb vibrations. James believes that the real joy of these workshops comes when you ride the bike. They are light and fun to ride, and the price is also appealing—less than £500."
CPE_38,C2,"**Self-Help Books**  
Dione Reverend was just an editor at Random House in New York when she first encountered a manuscript by an unknown pop psychologist, Dr. John Gray. ""I took one look at the title and knew it would be a bestseller,"" she recalls, and she was correct. Dr. Gray has since become a multimillionaire, and Diane Reverend has started her own company. Dr. Gray's short book on improving communication between men and women has become a symbol of a large and growing self-help industry that, according to its supporters, addresses many of Americans' desires for self-improvement. However, it also capitalizes on these desires, creating even more needs and supporting the entire New York publishing industry. In Britain, the genre has shown that it can produce many books that are as questionable and dramatic as their covers. For every self-help book published, thousands are rejected for being too similar or too niche. This is a small mercy. As a new type of powerful editor searches for the next big hit, the quality of writing is often overlooked. What matters most is marketability. ""How promotable is the author? What's the 'hook'? Is it universal enough?"" Ms. Reverend lists the important questions, then admits, ""If someone comes to me with a catchy title, that's two-thirds of the battle won. You know you can reach people.""
**Autobiographies**  
There must be an unspoken agreement between an autobiographer and the reader that the truth is being shared. However, this agreement is often not fully honored. There are many reasons why a writer might hold back. They may have thoughts or actions they find too shameful to reveal. They might also decide that certain details are not significant enough to include. Additionally, there are more complex reasons for breaking this agreement. An autobiographer might believe that the ultimate goal of their work—revealing the truth about themselves—can be better achieved by creating stories that capture the essence of their experiences more effectively than sticking strictly to the facts. Alternatively, they may choose to disregard the agreement from the start, labeling their book an autobiography simply to create a sense of trust in the reader, which can be useful for their storytelling. This can lead readers to believe they have read a true account when, in fact, they have only encountered fiction. This can happen without any intention of being deceitful.
**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**  
Scholars of detective fiction have suggested that the rise of this genre reflects the social conflicts of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The detective story serves as an allegory. The crime symbolizes deep human desires like lust or greed, and its resolution represents the restoration of order in society, calming its chaotic impulses so that it can function properly again. In Hammett's unique version, society is restored, but it is revealed to be corrupt and false. The detective and the criminal represent two sides of the same character. The private investigator and his target understand each other and share a strange comfort. The detective exists in both worlds: he is too honest for the criminals and too shady for the law. He embodies both a criminal and a competitor. His mission is sometimes influenced by his sense of guilt, and at other times, his desire for justice is heightened by his awareness of this conflict.
**Science Writing**  
Stephen Jay Gould is considered one of today's best scientific essayists. To discuss his craft and hear his insights, I met him at the Grand Hotel, where he was promoting his new book. Neither of us felt particularly comfortable in such a pretentious setting. Regarding writing in such an environment, Gould remarked, ""I couldn't do it; Trollope might, but he understood the culture. Knowing the culture is essential for being a successful writer. Science, for instance, is its own civilization. Therefore, only scientists can effectively present it. If you don't belong to the community and don't grasp its rules, you're at a disadvantage from the start."" One of Gould's key principles is to never write down to the reader. ""Make no concessions,"" he advises. ""You can simplify the language but must never dilute the argument. Above all, if readers feel patronized, your piece will fail."""
CPE_17,C2,"**Air-conditioning**  
At Cannons Gym, a popular spot for City of London workers during lunch, the air feels very cold. To cope with this summer's high temperatures, the gym has used a lot of air-conditioning. At quiet times, it can feel like being in the Arctic. This shows how we often misuse air-conditioning in today's world. It has become a common part of our lives, symbolizing our ability to control the climate. However, many buildings with air-conditioning could use other cooling methods. They could benefit from natural light and ventilation, and have thicker walls that keep heat out during the day and release it at night. These ideas may seem simple, but they can be very effective and would greatly reduce the need for air-conditioning.
**Sundials**  
It is interesting that as we enter a new millennium, there is a growing interest in sundials, which measure time based on the sun's position. A hundred years ago, sundials were essential for keeping clocks accurate. As clocks and watches improved, sundials became less important and were seen mainly as decorative garden pieces. Now, they are being appreciated again. David Harber, a maker of sundials, believes their charm comes from their connection to the planets. He says there is a magical moment when a sundial starts to work. They are calm and beautiful objects that remind us of our place in the universe.
**Paint Your Own China**  
My idea of china-painting came from a visit to an arts and crafts exhibition long ago, where serious-looking older women showed how to paint delicate flowers on teacups with skillful brushstrokes. It was fascinating to watch, as each stroke created a perfect petal or leaf. Their hands were steady, and the paint never smudged, making it seem like they had either practiced for years or had a special talent. Remembering this, I wondered what kind of people would join a china-painting class. Would beginners have a natural talent? However, the atmosphere in the class was friendly and relaxed. Everyone was there to enjoy themselves, and even the teacher did not paint with the same speed I had seen before."
CPE_47,C2,"**The Wrong Country**
Uncle chose a package holiday for Keith and Dawne at a good price: a flight from Gatwick Airport and twelve nights in Venice, at the Pensione Concordia. When they went to the travel agency to book, the clerk told them that the other travelers were a school group from the south coast, all learning Italian. However, something went wrong. Due to a mistake at the travel agency, the check-in desk, or a computer error, Keith and Dawne ended up in a hotel called the Edelweiss, in Room 212, somewhere in Switzerland.
At Gatwick, they gave their tickets to a girl in a yellow-and-red uniform. She checked their details and said everything was fine. An hour later, they were surprised to hear older people on the plane speaking with accents from the North of England. Keith thought there might have been a cancellation or that the Italian class was on another flight. They ordered drinks, and then more drinks. 
When they landed, a stout woman with glasses told them to stay together. The brochure hadn’t mentioned an overnight stop, but when the coach arrived at its destination, Keith realized that was what was happening. It was close to midnight, and tired from traveling, they didn’t question the beds they were offered. However, the next morning, they were alarmed to find out they were supposed to stay there for their entire holiday. 
The receptionist cheerfully explained, ""We have the lake and the water birds, and you can take a steamer to Interlaken."" Keith calmly told him, ""There’s been a mistake. We were meant to be in Venice, at the Pensione Concordia."" The receptionist replied, ""I don’t know that name, sir. This is Switzerland."" 
Keith insisted, ""An official said a coach would take us on. She was here last night."" The receptionist said, ""Your group is booked for twelve nights at the Edelweiss Hotel. If you’ve changed your minds..."" 
""We haven’t changed our minds. There’s been a mistake,"" Keith repeated. The receptionist shook his head, unaware of any mistake. Dawne then interrupted, describing the bald man with glasses who made the booking and naming the travel agency in London. 
A woman, who was the stout one Keith had seen at Gatwick, approached them. ""My name is Franks,"" she said. ""I’m married to the man with the bad leg."" Dawne asked, ""Are you in charge, Mrs. Franks? We’re in the wrong hotel."" 
Keith explained, ""We got into the wrong group. We reported to the Your-Kind-of-Holiday girl and left it to her."" Dawne added, ""We should have known when they weren’t from Dover; we heard them talking about Darlington."" Keith wished she would let him speak. 
""We noticed you at Gatwick,"" Keith said. ""We knew you were in charge."" Mrs. Franks replied, ""I counted you, although you probably didn’t see me. Let me explain: Your-Kind-of-Holiday offers many different holidays at various prices. There are villa holidays for adventurous people under thirty-five, and treks to Turkey and the Himalayas."" 
She continued, ""All tickets and labels look similar, yellow with two red bands. If you followed others with the yellow-and-red label, you might think you could end up anywhere!"" She laughed, adding, ""But that couldn’t happen."" 
Keith insisted, ""We’re not meant to be in Switzerland."" Mrs. Franks unexpectedly walked away, leaving them standing there. The receptionist was gone, and they could hear typing. 
""She seems kind,"" Dawne whispered, but Keith was lost in thought, trying to remember everything that had happened: handing over the tickets, waiting, and then boarding the plane. 
An elderly man interrupted his thoughts, introducing himself as Mr. Nottage. He and his wife, both in their eighties, said they had the best night’s sleep in years, thanks to the lakeside air. 
""That’s nice,"" Dawne replied. Keith walked out of the reception area, and Dawne followed. Outside the hotel, they didn’t mention the irony of their situation. On their first holiday since their honeymoon, they had ended up on a package tour with elderly people, when they had wanted to escape the demands of older age. Uncle had said so himself when they tried to convince him to join them."
CPE_48,C2,"**HE WAS A PEOPLE PERSON**
American business leaders are looking to the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a model for good management. Eluned Price reports.
Most people in Britain know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and have a general idea of his achievements. However, America has only recently discovered him. The Wall Street Journal described Shackleton as ""an Antarctic explorer whose feats went largely unnoticed for most of the 20th century,"" which is an exaggeration. Now, Americans are enthusiastically learning about him. Biographies and stories about his voyage on the Endurance are being published quickly. The American Museum of Natural History is organizing a major exhibition, and Columbia Tristar is making a film about Shackleton's life.
Some American managers have also adopted Shackleton as a role model. They admire his actions and draw lessons about leadership and communication from his experiences. They even refer to each other as ""speaking Shackleton."" Shackleton, known for his determination and resourcefulness, has become a symbol for modern management consultants.
Jim MacGregor, managing partner of Abernathy MacGregor Frank in New York, has looked up to Shackleton for years. His firm focuses on communication during mergers, acquisitions, and corporate crises. For example, they deal with situations like ""the plant exploded"" or ""half the workforce must be laid off."" While it may seem challenging to connect Shackleton's survival skills in extreme conditions to managing a corporate crisis, MacGregor believes Shackleton's leadership qualities are relevant. 
""Even if a company handles its crises well, poor communication can still cause harm,"" says MacGregor. ""Shackleton is a model for management because he was a strong leader and communicator. He had clear values and was at his best when he and his team had a lot at stake, including their lives."" One of Shackleton's most remarkable decisions was to turn back when he was only 97 miles from the South Pole. This choice demonstrated his commitment to the safety of his men.
In a crisis, people want to know who is in charge. While many managers today may avoid responsibility, Shackleton was willing to take charge. His 1914 expedition became legendary when his ship, the Endurance, was trapped in ice for nine months and eventually sank. When the ship went down, Shackleton reassured his men, saying, ""We should all eventually reach safety if you do your best and trust me."" Throughout the ordeal, it was clear that Shackleton was always in control.
""Shackleton planned for every situation, kept his men informed, and valued their opinions,"" says MacGregor. ""He was flexible, ready to change plans when necessary. We have developed effective principles based on Shackleton's example. Clients can relate to his story without feeling criticized.""
Shackleton believed that an explorer needs optimism, endurance, and patience. ""One of the hardest things to do in tough times is to wait, especially in America, where there is a strong desire to fix problems quickly,"" says MacGregor. ""If you invest in bonds and make a wrong guess about interest rates, it's better to hold on and wait for your money to come back rather than sell and take a big loss. Similarly, if a new product isn't successful, don't keep selling it.""
Shackleton led by example. On the return journey from the Endurance, he noticed Hurley, the expedition photographer, without gloves. He insisted Hurley wear his gloves, threatening to throw them overboard if he didn't. Another crew member recalled Shackleton doing something similar during a previous expedition when they were starving: he said he would leave a biscuit in the snow rather than eat it, emphasizing its value.
As Caroline Alexander, author of *Endurance*, notes: ""The public's interest in heroic efforts is growing. Shackleton highlights the lack of heroism in today's world. He stands out as a true embodiment of the ideals we long for."""
