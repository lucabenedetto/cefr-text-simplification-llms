CPE_15,"**Garbage in, garbage out**

Charging families for each bag of rubbish they throw away seems like a good idea for the environment and for saving money. However, it might not be as effective as it seems. In many developed countries, rubbish collection happens regularly. Rubbish bags or bins are taken away by special trucks to be disposed of. Economists find this strange because, in most places, this service is free. Families pay for it through local taxes, but a family that produces a lot of rubbish pays the same as a couple that produces very little. 

The cost of rubbish disposal is not zero. The more rubbish people throw away, the more collectors and trucks are needed, and the more local authorities have to pay for landfills. This creates a basic economic problem: if rubbish disposal is free, people will produce too much rubbish. A possible solution is to make households pay for the amount of rubbish they produce. This would encourage them to throw away less and recycle more, assuming local governments provide places to recycle.

However, economists Don Fullerton and Thomas Kinnaman found that this logical solution can lead to complicated and sometimes disappointing results. They studied several American towns that started charging households for rubbish. The most common method was to sell stickers or tags that families had to attach to their rubbish bags. Only bags with these tags would be collected each week.

In a study published last year, Fullerton and Kinnaman looked at a scheme introduced in Charlottesville, Virginia, where residents were charged 80 cents for each tagged bag. While this seemed like a good use of market forces, the benefits of the scheme did not cover the costs of printing tags, paying sellers, and running the program. Although the number of bags collected fell by 37%, this was mainly because people started cramming more rubbish into each bag instead of buying more tags. This method of compacting rubbish is not as effective as using machines at landfills. The actual weight of rubbish collected only fell by 14%. 

In 25 other Virginia cities without a pricing scheme, rubbish collection also fell by 3.5%. Some people even chose to dump their rubbish illegally instead of paying for collection. Although it is hard to measure, the authors estimate that illegal dumping might account for 30-40% of the reduction in collected rubbish. 

On a positive note, there was a 15% increase in the weight of materials recycled, suggesting that people chose to recycle (which is free) instead of paying for rubbish removal. However, many residents were already participating in a voluntary recycling program before the fee was introduced. 

In a more recent study, Fullerton and Kinnaman looked deeper into the economics of rubbish. They found that while pricing does reduce the amount of rubbish, the effect is small. On average, a 10% increase in sticker prices only cuts rubbish by 0.3%. This is less than in other studies, but it makes sense. To significantly reduce rubbish, people would need to buy less of everything. A small tax on rubbish is unlikely to make a big difference. 

It is also important to consider other factors, like income and education. For example, richer towns tend to throw away more rubbish and have less time for recycling. Should we say that charging households for rubbish is a bad idea? Not really; free disposal is probably too cheap. However, the effects of simple policies can be complex. Detailed economic models are often needed to understand them, and sometimes the results are not what we expect."
CPE_19,"**Work and Change: Theodore Zeldin's Ideas**

Theodore Zeldin explores how our work life could improve. Do you feel respected and valued in your job? Simply being successful in your career is not enough anymore. Many people in different professions feel that their work is not appreciated, and even famous individuals often feel unhappy despite their success. 

In the past, loving your job was enough to make you feel special. Now, it’s important to think about how your job affects you as a person, your mind, character, and relationships. This is a vital question. No matter how skilled you are, if your work makes you boring or unable to connect with others, then no amount of money or status can make up for that. 

Zeldin wants to find ways to make work more fulfilling and meaningful for everyone, not just a way to make money. Work should help us live better lives, discover new talents, and meet different people. However, simply trying to eliminate unemployment is not enough. As more people get educated, they want jobs that are interesting and meaningful.

Even traditional professions, like doctors and accountants, are facing challenges. Doctors often feel more stressed than their patients, and accountants worry about their profession's ethics. Many architects do not get to use their creativity, and middle managers are losing their confidence. Companies and organizations are becoming smaller, and many employees feel disconnected from their work. In Britain, only 8% of workers feel that their values match those of their organizations.

Zeldin is studying different jobs to see how they affect people. He is looking at important topics like happiness, love, friendship, and respect. He believes we need to think about who we want to be and how we want to live, not just focus on making money.

For example, in the hospitality industry, which employs 10% of the workforce, many talented people work in low-paying jobs with little recognition. Hotels could be more than just places for travelers to sleep; they could be cultural centers where people from different backgrounds meet and connect. Hotel staff, many of whom are eager to learn and explore, often have only superficial interactions with guests. 

If hotels paid attention to their employees' ambitions, they could offer more services and create a richer experience for guests. However, many businesses focus only on maximizing profits, which limits their potential. 

Zeldin believes that work should be about relationships. As people seek more independence in their jobs, they should have the opportunity to design their own roles and choose their colleagues. This requires good communication skills, which go beyond just talking. 

True conversation creates a bond of respect and understanding between people. It allows us to connect deeply and can change our perspectives. Every meaningful conversation can make a small difference in the world."
CPE_24,"**BROADCASTING: The Social Shaping of a Technology**

The term 'broadcasting' originally referred to spreading seeds widely by hand. This idea is not just about farming; it also represents a hopeful view of modern progress. It suggests planned growth and the potential for a good outcome if conditions are right. The metaphor assumes there are central resources available for spreading and sharing information.

We need to explore why a new technology that sends words and pictures electronically was organized in a way that fits this farming metaphor. Television, as a technology, is connected to other forms of communication like the telegraph and telephone. However, from the beginning, it was seen as a centralized 'mass' medium. This means that it was designed to send information from a central source to many homes, which matched the social and economic structures of modern societies.

There were attempts to create different ways of using television, but these remained just experiments. Two lesser-known alternatives are worth mentioning because they show what television could have been in a different social setting. In the early 1930s, radio enthusiasts in Britain experimented with two-way television as a possible replacement for regular telephones. Popular science magazines like Radio News published articles on how to build television transmitters and receivers, and many amateurs were active in this field.

However, in 1938, the British Radio Manufacturers Association set standards for television equipment and channel regulations, which pushed these grassroots innovators out. This marked the end of a chance for television to develop as a more democratic and community-based form of communication in Britain.

Broadcasting was not only influenced by strong economic interests but also by the deep structures of modern societies. Despite the efforts of TV amateurs, television was mainly used for public shows in the USA during the early 1930s and was seen as a competitor to the film industry. In fact, most early audiences in Britain and Germany experienced television in public places rather than at home.

The idea of grassroots or amateur two-way television was unlikely to succeed. Instead, television systems based on public viewing were operating in several countries in the 1930s. However, manufacturers recognized the potential for mass sales of home television sets, and as working-class people improved their living standards from the 1920s onwards, the dream of having a fully equipped home for entertainment became a reality for many in Western countries. This trend is now happening globally.

There is a clear link between social modernization and the structures of broadcasting. As societies modernized, there was more centralization of power and capital, and traditional communities broke apart, leading to new lifestyles. People became more mobile, both socially and geographically, which made them feel more isolated compared to those in stable early communities.

Centralized broadcasting was a way for governments to efficiently reach all citizens with important information. It also helped create a sense of community within the nation-state. These processes made broadcasting the dominant form of both radio and television.

However, it is important to recognize the positive view of broadcasting as a tool for democracy. During the time between the World Wars, many countries saw broadcasting as a way to ensure equal access to information, which is necessary for informed participation in political, social, and cultural life.

Television is changing, and there is a risk that the term broadcasting may become outdated or insufficient. If that happens, this metaphor will only refer to a specific way of organizing audio-visual technology during a certain phase of social modernization."
CPE_13,"**Clutter**

Sometimes, it feels like no matter how many things you own, you still don’t feel secure. It is normal to want a comfortable home that meets your needs, but there comes a point when the desire to own more things becomes excessive. Modern advertising is designed to take advantage of our insecurities. We often receive messages that suggest if we don’t have certain products, we are not as good as others. To see how much advertising affects you, try not to read any billboards the next time you walk down the street. These expensive advertisements influence us in ways we may not even notice. We are surrounded by them on television, radio, newspapers, magazines, posters, t-shirts, and the internet, all encouraging us to buy more.

**Caves**

Research institutions and universities around the world have spent many years studying caves, focusing on their origins, water systems, and living organisms. Caves are a small but fascinating part of nature that spark our curiosity and desire to learn. Because they are natural features, they have been studied for a long time, especially in areas where caves impact our lives. However, exploring caves requires physical skill, which means that cave research often involves both professional scientists and amateur explorers who visit caves for fun.

**Weather Watch**

Many observant people, using only their senses, laid the groundwork for meteorology, which has developed into a complex science since the 17th century. Today, satellites and electronic tools provide us with quick weather information, and computers can solve complicated calculations much faster than humans. Meteorology uses many technical terms that can be hard to understand for non-professionals. However, human experience is still essential for turning data into weather forecasts. Personal observations can offer valuable insights that help professionals understand the mysteries of the atmosphere."
CPE_16,"**MUSIC AND THEATRE**

Until recently, I believed that opera was mainly about theatre. Now, I think differently. After working at a national opera house, I realized that music is actually the most important part of opera. This makes sense, of course. However, I come from the world of theatre, where the words and the actors are the main focus. In theatre, once the performance starts, there is no one directing the action, and the performers and the audience usually share the same language.

At any music performance, whether in a concert hall or an opera house, there are many people, like me, who do not have a deep understanding of music. Some may feel embarrassed about their lack of knowledge, while most are amazed by the talent of the musicians. A skilled singer or a great string section is easy to admire. Even a good musician shows us the results of years of hard work. Watching top-class music is similar to watching an athletics event. We know that athletes are doing something similar to what we do when we run for a bus, but we also see how much better they are.

Theatre audiences have different expectations. They often do not understand the skills of actors and may not be impressed by an actor delivering a long speech, even though they often ask, ""How do you remember all those lines?"" This does not mean that theatre audiences are less demanding than music audiences; in fact, many people enjoy both. However, in theatre, audiences and performers often meet on more equal ground, regardless of how difficult the material is.

The question is whether music can learn anything from theatre about this relationship. I believe it can. I have seen how a different approach can improve the experience for concert-goers. Live music is very theatrical, filled with emotions like passion, humor, and sadness. It connects with the audience not just as individuals but as a group. The traditional ways of presenting music, such as strict dress codes and showing too much respect for conductors and soloists, create a clear divide between performers and listeners, which can feel uncomfortable.

On the other hand, when contemporary music audiences applaud between movements or after a difficult piece, it can disrupt the flow of the performance. While this is often a genuine expression of appreciation, it can also be disrespectful to the overall work.

Is there a solution? Yes, a lot is being done to attract new audiences to concert halls and opera houses and to break down the barriers that make people feel that ""serious"" music is not for them. I remember a special event, the community opera ""In Search of Angels,"" which took place in different locations within a cathedral and then moved into the town. It was an incredible musical experience where the skills and generosity of the professional musicians were key, and it changed the lives of many audience members, who were not just there to watch and listen but also to participate.

What I wish for in music is a bit more of the excitement and boldness that theatre can offer. This can come from using unusual or challenging locations that change our expectations. This can create surprising effects for both performers and audiences. Sometimes, we may have to give up comfort; the sound might not be perfect, or it could be a bit cold. However, theatre audiences have learned to be brave and follow artists into unexpected places.

I know that most plays are performed in a traditional way, similar to concerts. However, I believe that we can and should change how we experience music. I can only speak as a fan: I love theatre and enjoy going to music performances as much as I can. I want both to succeed and for more people to enjoy the pleasure I find in being part of the audience."
CPE_21,"**Sand**  
Although I appreciate how sand can be turned into useful things like glass and concrete, I do not like it in its natural form. To me, sand is mostly a barrier that separates a parking lot from the beach. It blows into your face, gets into your food, and can even hide important items like car keys and coins. When you are wet, sand sticks to you and is hard to remove, even with a strong hose. However, once you step onto a beach towel, get into a car, or walk on a clean carpet, the sand falls off easily. For days, you will find sand everywhere when you take off your shoes, and even more will fall when you remove your socks. Sand seems to stay with you longer than some illnesses. So, I would prefer to avoid sand altogether.

**Lock and Key**  
The need for a safe home, privacy, and security has been important since people first built houses. While old wooden beams have been replaced by modern electronic locks that use plastic cards, the desire to keep out unwanted visitors remains. The idea of a lock and key is partly psychological. Recently, some companies have tried using computerized locking systems with smart cards, but many people do not like them. People may accept these systems at work, but at home, they prefer the comfort of using a physical key. Because of this, when a locksmith company created a new electronic lock, they included a traditional metal key in the design.

**Modern Art**  
I felt nervous about visiting the new Tate Modern gallery because, like many people, I find modern art confusing. I do enjoy some pieces, especially furry objects, neon light sculptures, and large photographs. Maybe if I knew more about modern art, I would have stronger opinions. However, the goal is not to analyze art like a school essay but to let it speak to you. This is a nice idea, but it has not worked for me in the past. The new gallery tries to help visitors understand the art better. The first thing I noticed was the informative labels that explain the context and meaning of each piece. Instead of just staring at the art, these explanations helped me to understand it better."
CPE_46,"**Every Picture Tells a Story**

Adapting novels into films usually means reducing and simplifying the story. This can be frustrating for writers, but it can also be enlightening. While working on a script, I realized that I could remove a lot of dialogue and descriptions from a scene in the novel and still convey the same message. This doesn’t mean that the original dialogue and descriptions were unnecessary. It’s about how each medium engages the audience and the type of repetition they use.

In novels, repetition can help readers remember character traits and understand who is speaking. For example, we often see phrases like ""he said"" to make it easier to follow the conversation. In stage plays, the dialogue mimics real speech, sometimes to the point where it feels repetitive and doesn’t clearly communicate the message.

**Watching Movies**

When we watch movies, we can feel completely absorbed in the story, escaping from our everyday lives for the duration of the film. However, once the movie ends and the lights come on, we return to reality. Many people, especially from older generations, did not see movies as art; they viewed them as simple entertainment. While they enjoyed watching films, they did not consider them to have artistic value.

**The Film Studios**

The Leiper Film Company studios were made up of many different buildings that were confusing to navigate. There were a few main areas, like the Script Department, but most of the rooms looked the same and were hard to find. There were three main entrances, but none of them provided clear directions for newcomers. Most people who worked there knew their way around, and it was their teamwork that brought stories of romance and adventure to life on screen.

**Film-Makers**

Many people dream of making movies. Bookstores are filled with guides on scriptwriting and film production, and universities offer related courses. There are even competitions that give away cameras like the one used by Robert Rodriguez to make his film *El Mariachi*, which cost only $7,000 and launched his career. Rodriguez reflects on his early success, noting that famous directors like Orson Welles and Steven Spielberg made their breakthrough films at a young age.

In the past, filmmakers had to take their time to learn the craft, often starting in smaller roles like editing or writing. For example, John Huston was 35 when he directed his first film, *The Maltese Falcon*. Today, without the support of studios or television, new filmmakers often have to find their own way to succeed."
CPE_3,"In the past, the council houses were spread all over the western side of the city. They were rows of small, old buildings made of orange brick or pale white plaster. In the summer, the chemicals from a nearby factory created a strong smell of sulphur that filled the air around the houses. One common sight in that part of Norwich in the morning was a paperboy making a face as he walked up to someone’s front door. I have forgotten much of my early life, but I remember sitting near an upstairs window and looking at the houses as they disappeared into the distance. 

I also have memories of my mother, who I remember ironing towels in a house that I don’t think was ours, and snow falling on a big mansion at Earlham. My mother appears in these early memories because I remember her as a small, precise, and often angry woman. I never really understood why she was angry, so I couldn’t do anything to make her feel better. Even as a child, when I went with her to small shops or on longer trips into the city, I sensed that she was a very lonely person, feeling alone even in a crowded room. 

My mother had strict ideas about how to behave, which were not common in our neighborhood. This sometimes led to intense cleaning sessions or her telling me to ""behave properly."" I never fully understood her rules, which included not going into neighbors' gardens or risking their rose bushes while walking down the street. It also meant sitting quietly for long periods in a dining room, listening to radio shows that my mother liked. There were many rules I had to follow.

Over time, I noticed other people in our lives. Despite her loneliness, my mother had a few friends. There was Mrs. Buddery, who loved the Royal Family, Mrs. Winall, who rarely spoke except to agree with others, and Mrs. Laband, who was more lively but not always liked by the others. Looking back, I realize that these women were not very good company. They often talked about their bad legs, the cold weather, and ungrateful children, a group I often felt I belonged to.

I felt a heavy weight from the houses, my mother, her friends, and the pressure to ""behave properly."" It felt like my job to grow up and free myself from this weight, but it was not easy. Growing up in West Earlham followed a clear pattern. Until you were five, you stayed at home and bothered your parents. I remember long, boring days playing on a rug while my mother sat coldly in a chair. Then, after your fifth birthday, you went to Avenue Road infants school, which was half a mile away. Some lucky kids had mothers who could ride them on a bike, but my mother usually let other children take care of me on the way.

If I remember anything from those early years, it’s the summer holidays. During those days, I caught glimpses of the world outside West Earlham. There was an old man next to Mrs. Buddery who told stories about his time in the Merchant Navy. Once, there was a charity event at a house far away where a kind woman offered lemonade and tried to get me interested in something called the League of Pity, a kind of junior charity. However, my mother dismissed it, saying the organizers were ""only after your money."" 

My mother often talked about money and had a very low opinion of politicians. If she thought about the House of Commons, she imagined it as a place where rich people opened letters filled with money sent by gullible people. I might be exaggerating, and I know she had some good qualities, but she didn’t show much kindness. 

To be fair, my mother was aware of her role in my education. Sometimes, she would take me on the bus to the Norwich Castle Museum. We would walk through rooms filled with paintings by local artists. My mother didn’t completely dislike this activity and eventually started to have opinions about the art. I remember one time she stopped in front of a painting of a Roman soldier and said, ""Well, I wouldn’t like to meet him on a dark night!"" This was one of the few times I remember her trying to make a joke."
CPE_10,"**Philadelphia Avenue**

I walked down the odd-numbered side of Philadelphia Avenue. The evening was getting darker, and the air was humid with a light drizzle that made my walk feel secretive. I knew this side of the street very well; I remembered our neighbors, the Matzes and the Pritchards, Han Kieffer's grocery store, and the houses of my first friends, all girls. Even though I didn’t know everyone by name, each house was clear in my memory, just like the small channels in the sidewalk that carried rainwater from the roofs to the street. As the street sloped down, I noticed that the houses changed too: the porches got lower, and the front yards became smaller.

Over the years, things changed. Wooden porch railings were replaced with iron ones that looked a bit Southern or Spanish. In Shillington, some houses I remembered as homes became stores, and strangely, some stores, like Pep Conrad's and Han Kieffer's, turned back into homes. I wondered how the people living there divided their space and how they dealt with the smells of the products that used to be sold there.

**Bachelor Fads Furniture**

Rick Gilbert, a furniture designer, lives in a flat that used to be a curtain warehouse. It has the typical features of a loft, like exposed brick walls and large doors that used to let curtains in from the nearby train tracks. However, Gilbert didn’t want a completely open space. He found it hard to work when his living area was so close. To create some separation, he used a large piece of corrugated plastic to divide the entrance area. This not only hid his office but also created a hallway and led the eye to the kitchen in the middle of the flat. He wanted the kitchen to be a neutral space where he could cook for friends or make coffee for clients. To balance the modern look of the plastic and stainless steel kitchen, he chose light wood for the floors. His flat is filled with modern furniture, but it also has sentimental pieces from his parents or things he bought at markets.

**Bruce Chatwin**

Bruce Chatwin's life was a mix of adventure and mystery, making him a fascinating writer. His first book, *In Patagonia*, published in 1977, changed travel writing. It reads like a thrilling story, full of imagination and insight. However, Chatwin often mixed facts with fiction, changing details to make his stories more interesting. He believed that through travel, one could discover hidden histories that were meant to inspire future explorers.

**Swimming**

During a warm summer rain, I quickly ran across my lawn and jumped into the pool. As I swam, I kept my eyes just above the water. Each raindrop created little fountains that burst into bubbles. The best moments were when the rain got heavier, drowning out the sound of birds and creating a mist over the water, as if the pool was rising to meet the sky. It was during this summer in 1996 that I started to think about swimming across Britain. I wanted to follow the rain as it traveled to the sea, escaping the frustration of swimming back and forth in a pool, like a tiger pacing in a cage.

Many of us live in a world where everything is labeled and explained. This makes our reality feel more like a visual experience. That’s why activities like walking, cycling, and swimming are so important. They help us reconnect with the wild and old parts of our world by taking us off the usual paths and away from the official stories. A swimming journey would let me explore the mysterious parts of our world, like dark forests or high mountains."
CPE_67,"**Crying**

Charles Darwin believed that crying did not have a clear purpose in human evolution. However, recent studies suggest that crying has important social functions. Psychiatrist John Bowlby emphasized how crying helps create a strong bond between a mother and her child. Many people think that tears, especially in children, show feelings of helplessness. 

Understanding why adults cry is more complicated. The sound of crying may not be as important as the visual message it sends. In early human communities, crying might have helped build trust and connections among people. 

There are many reasons why we cry. We might cry to show sympathy for someone facing injustice. Sometimes, we cry without meaning to, like when we hear touching music or speeches. We are also more likely to cry when watching a sad movie with others rather than when we are alone. 

The social role of crying is clear, but research on this topic is still ongoing."
CPE_27,"**The Heat is On**

We have all heard about global warming, but how much warmer will the Earth get, and how will it affect our lives? Most people know what global warming is, but many are unsure about its effects. A warmer climate will likely change the weather around the world. Since the atmosphere is connected to everything on our planet, any climate changes will significantly impact plants, animals, water, and soil. Humans have learned to use these natural resources to grow food, build cities, and support billions of people. Therefore, any changes to these resources are serious.

The challenge we face is understanding how the world will change and what is causing these changes. Over the last 100 years, human activities have greatly increased the levels of certain gases in the atmosphere, which are linked to global temperatures. These increased gas levels are likely affecting the global climate, but our limited knowledge makes it hard to predict the future accurately. 

We know that greenhouse gas levels have changed in line with global temperatures over the past 40,000 years, suggesting a strong connection between the two. Evidence shows that the Earth's surface has warmed by about 6°C in the last century. Most scientists believe this warming is not just a natural occurrence but is partly due to human pollution.

A lot of research has been done to predict what will happen with higher global temperatures. Scientists use computer programs called general circulation models (GCMs) to analyze how temperature, pressure, sunlight, and other factors interact to predict climate conditions. However, these models are simplifications of reality and have many limitations. Their predictions are only rough estimates, and they can be slow and costly to run. 

Despite these challenges, most experts agree on one important point: the rate of climate change will be faster than anything we have seen before. Current predictions suggest that by the year 2100, the average global surface temperature could rise by 1°C to 3.5°C, sea levels could increase by 15 to 95 cm, and changes in rainfall patterns will occur. Scientists also expect more extreme weather events, like heatwaves, floods, and droughts, in some areas. 

These predictions highlight the potential impact of climate change on the environment and humans. Changes in climate could affect where ecosystems, like forests and grasslands, are located, the types of species in these areas, and their ability to provide resources that societies depend on. This includes food production, water supply, and human settlements. Some effects may be irreversible and could be harmful in many regions, but not all impacts will be negative. 

In some places, climate change may have positive effects. For example, in Australia, research shows that wheat production has increased by about 0.5 tonnes per hectare since 1952, partly due to climate trends. Warmer temperatures have led to fewer frosts, which helps crops grow better.

However, many predicted effects of future warming are concerning. Even small changes in climate can affect water availability, especially in dry areas or places already facing shortages. For instance, in the Mediterranean Basin, there have been decreasing rainfall trends in some regions, with rain becoming more concentrated in a shorter time each year.

Another worrying effect is the change in glaciers, which will impact ice and water resources, wildlife habitats, and human structures. There is a strong chance that Arctic ice will melt completely, making transport easier but increasing risks from icebergs.

The most dramatic effect of global warming will likely be rising sea levels. This will happen because warmer water takes up more space and because of melting ice. Since about half of the world's population lives in coastal areas, rising sea levels could have severe consequences. Increased flooding is a major concern, with cities like London, New York, and Tokyo at risk of significant disruption. Many people could lose their homes and livelihoods, leading to millions of environmental refugees.

The most serious consequences may be faced by small, low-lying island nations, which could disappear if worst-case scenarios occur. This would be devastating for the people and cultures of these islands and would also create challenges for countries that would need to help those displaced."
CPE_66,"**Mission to Mars**

Wanted: a married couple in their middle age for a 501-day trip to Mars. Applicants must be strong both physically and emotionally. This will be the profile of the first astronauts on Mars if millionaire Dennis Tito's plans to launch a spacecraft on January 5, 2018, succeed. 

The spacecraft will take the crew to about 160 km above Mars. It will use Mars' gravity to return to Earth without using extra fuel, which is very important. The 2018 launch date is set because the next time Mars and Earth will be in the right position for a launch is in 2031. 

This is a challenging task, but there is a race to create new technologies for the mission. If these technologies are ready in time, the spacecraft might succeed. Even if the mission does not happen, the work done will help improve future space missions."
CPE_44,"**AESTHETICS**

The way we think about art can sometimes make it hard to understand it. This is because art exists as physical objects, like buildings, books, paintings, or statues, separate from our experiences. People often see art only as these objects, not considering how they affect us when we experience them. 

Additionally, some artworks are so admired that they create certain ideas or standards that can block new ways of thinking about them. Once a piece of art is considered a classic, it can feel disconnected from the human experiences that created it and the feelings it brings to life. When we separate art from its origins and its effects on our lives, we make it harder to see its true meaning, which is what aesthetic theory tries to explore.

A key task for anyone writing about art is to connect these refined works of art back to everyday experiences and feelings that everyone understands. Just like mountains are part of the earth and not floating alone, art is also part of our human experience. Those who study the earth, like geographers and geologists, show how the earth works. Similarly, those who study art must do the same.

To truly understand art, we sometimes need to set it aside and focus on the everyday experiences that we usually don’t think of as artistic. We need to take a different path to reach a deeper understanding of art. For example, while we can enjoy flowers for their beauty and smell without knowing much about plants, if we want to understand how they grow, we must learn about the soil, air, water, and sunlight that help them thrive.

To grasp the essence of art, we should start with the raw experiences that catch our attention and bring us joy. However, many people might be surprised to learn that they enjoy their everyday activities partly because of their aesthetic qualities. The arts that people find most engaging today are often things they don’t think of as traditional art, like movies, jazz, comic strips, and even sensational news stories. 

When art is only seen in museums and galleries, people often seek enjoyment in their daily lives instead. Many who criticize the museum view of art still hold onto the idea that art is separate from everyday experiences. However, the best appreciation of art happens when it is closely connected to the ordinary things we do."
CPE_22,"**Observing Lions**

Many people think of lions hunting as a beautiful display of teamwork. In the fading light of sunset, a group of lions quietly surrounds their prey like skilled hunters. They seem to be perfect social animals, working together for a common goal: their next meal. However, after years of studying lions in the wild, we have a different view. 

When we began our research in 1978, we wanted to understand why lions hunt together, raise their young, and scare off rivals with their loud roars. If we measure an animal's success by how many offspring survive, then working together does not always help. If one animal is too generous, it may lose out while others benefit. So, why do lions seem to ignore the rules of self-interest? We thought we could answer this question in two to three years, but lions are very good at being inactive. 

It has taken various research methods to learn more about their behavior. Since wild lions can live up to 18 years, we are only now starting to find answers to our questions.

**Pop Music Review**

The release of Bedrock's third album was a significant moment for a band that had struggled in the past. ""New Life"" started a movement that changed rock music in this country for the rest of the decade. Gone were the serious themes and heavy guitars of the past; instead, a lighter mix of catchy local styles emerged. 

The album combined social commentary and strong emotions with sounds from fairground organs and brass bands. It featured humor and honesty, with voices that proudly showed their roots. Bedrock proved to be talented collectors and observers, as well as clever songwriters. They wrote about traditional English themes like sunbathing and lazy Sundays. However, the album's true strength was in its deeper, sadder songs, such as ""So Low,"" which had a beautiful melody related to weather, and ""To the Brink,"" a serious ballad. 

The beauty of ""New Life"" lies in its high quality—16 tracks with no weak songs, making it a standout album in an era of long CDs.

**Extract from an Autobiography**

As a child, I was always intrigued by stories of 'The Sibyl,' wise women who had great influence in ancient times. At first, I only knew of one from a story my mother told me. An old woman from Cumae offered King Tarquin of Rome nine books for 300 gold pieces. When he refused, she burned three books and offered him six for the same price. He still refused, so she burned three more. In the end, he bought the last three for the full price. I understood that there was a valuable lesson in this story about sales and life.

I was often a lonely only child. When I asked to play with other kids and was turned down, my mother advised me to do something so interesting that they would want to join me. It worked, and it’s a lesson I’ve never forgotten.

When I got the chance to write a travel book, I needed to find a topic that mattered to me. I’m not a keen traveler; I even sent my editor a long list of places I didn’t want to visit. I’m mainly interested in ruins because I prefer to travel through time in my mind.

**What Happens to Your Manuscript?**

When you send in your manuscript, it will likely join a pile of other submissions waiting to be reviewed, known as the slush pile. Usually, a junior member of the editorial team (often under 18) or an experienced freelancer will look at it. Neither has much power, but they want to find something original. The junior hopes to make a name for themselves, while the freelancer wants to keep their job.

If they think your novel has potential, they will pass it to a senior editor, who will discuss it in a meeting. This editor must explain why your novel is good and how well it might sell. They will also consider if you, as an author, seem like a long-term investment, which you should have mentioned in your letter. Additionally, they will think about how marketable you are, as a new novel needs all the support it can get. Because of this, publishers often prefer to meet potential authors before making an offer."
CPE_39,"**Advertising on Trial**

If you work in an advertising agency, the early 1990s were likely very challenging. The recession was worse than expected, affecting many industrialized countries for about thirty years. In Britain, in 1991, the economy shrank, interest rates were very high, and consumer spending dropped significantly. Over half a million people lost their jobs, and around 75,000 homes were taken back by banks. Every business was impacted, with some industries, like vehicles and construction, seeing a 30% decline in sales. Many people and companies around the world faced difficulties.

Advertising professionals were not unique in losing their jobs during this tough time, but those who remained often felt a lot of pressure. They were seen as responsible for helping companies make money, which meant they were closely watched by their colleagues and bosses. At the same time, they were asked to do more with smaller budgets, being told that ""less is more."" Despite these challenges, the importance of marketing grew. Companies began to realize they needed to create products and services that customers actually wanted, rather than just what was easy for them to make. 

In the last ten to fifteen years, many companies have started to take marketing seriously. This has improved the status of marketing professionals, but it has also increased their workload. Marketing is often mistakenly seen as a solution to all problems. Since about half of marketing budgets go to advertising, the pressure is on advertising professionals to deliver results. While the 1980s were a great time for advertising, the early 1990s brought significant challenges due to the economy. 

The recession forced companies to rethink their advertising budgets and strategies. Many companies began to question the effectiveness of advertising, especially when they were trying to account for every dollar spent. They wanted to know what return they were getting on their investment. As a result, advertising was put under more scrutiny than ever before. Companies wanted better strategies, targeting, creativity, and media placement. They aimed to have the best people from advertising agencies working on their projects and wanted them to produce excellent work.

While this situation does not necessarily call for sympathy for advertising professionals, it does mean they face the same challenges as their clients: how to achieve more with less. Additionally, other factors have made effective advertising harder to create. Some of these issues are due to the recession, such as debates over production costs and a reluctance to take risks, which are often necessary for good advertising. Other changes, like demographic shifts, the growing power of retailers, changing consumer needs, the rise of sponsorship, and stricter advertising laws, have also played a role. 

Moreover, some companies now face the challenge of advertising in foreign markets. Together with the economic situation, these factors have led many advertising professionals to reconsider the famous saying by Lord Leverhulme: ""Only half my advertising works. The trouble is I don't know which half."" There is now more pressure than ever to ensure that advertising is effective.

Unfortunately, help for those looking to improve their advertising is not easily available. Companies and advertising agencies have been too busy dealing with these challenges to share their experiences. Those who have managed to succeed often want to keep their successful strategies private. As a result, while conferences and seminars may offer some useful insights, the available books on advertising often do not provide practical guidance. Many of these books treat the advertising process with too much respect, suggesting that the work produced by advertising agencies is always of high quality and value, which is not true and does not help the employees responsible for the advertising."
CPE_18,"**The Lure of the Kitchen**

When I was in university, I decided I wanted to become a chef. This was an unusual choice among my friends. Most people did not see cooking as a desirable job. Being a chef is often seen as a tough profession: the work is long, stressful, and not well-paid. However, these factors did not discourage me. I was unhappy at university. The studies were difficult, and the social life felt closed and self-important. Becoming a chef seemed like a great way to escape this environment. It offered a sense of purpose and honesty that I felt was missing in my college life.

My desire to cook was not just a reaction to my university experience; it also reflected my love for beautiful food. I first realized this when I had a meal at a famous restaurant in London. It was an amazing experience. I still remember my starter clearly. After that meal, I felt so inspired that I wanted to learn everything about cooking. I changed my student life into a preparation for my future in the culinary world. My history degree felt meaningless compared to my passion for cooking. I learned by reading cookbooks, visiting markets, and cooking elaborate meals.

**The Swimming Instructor**

The swimming instructor at my school was a tough ex-drill sergeant, small but very strong, with tattoos on his arms. When I asked him to teach me how to dive, he told me to sit on the edge of the pool, raise my hands above my head, and roll forward, pushing off with my feet. I practiced this until the lesson was over. The next time, he had me stand up and dive off the edge. He was strict, and every time I came up from the water, he looked at me disapprovingly: ""Don't look down, look up!"" ""Keep your legs straight."" ""Point your toes!"" 

The following week, I climbed up to the high diving board. It felt very high as I stood there, trying to gather my courage. Slowly, the noise around me faded, and I felt like I was in a bubble of silence. I waved my arms as I had been taught, tried to look up, and jumped. For a moment, it felt like I was flying. But when I hit the water, I fell awkwardly, and my legs were everywhere. The instructor looked at me with disappointment and shook his head. But even he could not take away my happiness. I thought, ""This is what they mean by 'free as a bird.'""

**The Traveller**

For many people, having a comfortable bed, running water, and the chance to live a long life are very important. In contrast, the idea of a traveller can seem strange and fascinating. These are people who choose to take risks, like climbing dangerous mountains or sailing alone on small boats. They might eat insects if there is nothing else to eat and can live for months in uncertain conditions. 

It is easy to see these travellers as unusual or eccentric, like hermits or extreme sports enthusiasts. While they do exist, their world is very different from ours, and we often think of it as irrelevant. We can feel relieved to return to our own lives, where the risks we face are more predictable, like crossing a busy street.

**Sailing**

Jonathan Raban is afraid of the sea, which is probably why he spends so much time on it. He does not say he is a world-class sailor, but he is skilled. As a writer, he enjoys writing about his sailing experiences. Sailing gives him many exciting stories to tell.

Raban's small boat has a device that tells sailors their exact location anywhere on Earth. While he appreciates this technology, he also believes that inventions like the compass have changed the way people relate to the sea. He thinks that since the compass was invented, sailors have stopped paying attention to the waves and the ocean. Instead of being a lively place, the sea has become just a space to navigate. Because of this, a sailor can often let an autopilot take over, which may be why Raban has time to observe the waves closely."
CPE_62,"**Holiday Reading**

Summer brings us two great joys: escaping home and reading books. These joys are closely connected. Books can help us feel more at home in the world. We can relate our own experiences to those in great books written long ago or in faraway places. There are fewer types of people than there are individuals, so in the stories of others, we find our own thoughts and feelings. Authors can express our emotions and situations in a way that we might struggle to do ourselves. What we feel shy or confused about is clearly described in their words, which is even more impressive if the author is from a different time or place. We feel thankful to these writers for helping us understand ourselves better.

Through reading and traveling, we can break free from our daily routines. Our eyes are most open when we first arrive in a new place, just like when we read a great book that shows us things we might have ignored before. Our minds become more aware of the details around us, like the colors of the sky, the expressions on people's faces, or feelings we didn’t know we had.

**Author's Note**

These reflections on travel were published as articles in the Observer newspaper over seven years. I have made some small changes to restore parts that were cut for space, but I have added very little. I corrected a few mistakes, but only if they were minor details I should have gotten right. Looking back, I could have made more improvements, but that would have taken too long. For example, in my second article about China, I thought the Hong Kong dollar would stay strong, but a year later it fell. If I rewrote it to include that prediction, it would no longer be a report of what I experienced at that time. Like any traveler, I was there, not knowing what would happen next, just trying to understand what had already happened. This is the story of modern air travel: the world opening up to people who can afford a ticket. However, I don’t believe all my fellow travelers were completely unaware. Even a simple postcard can have a purpose.

**Ecotourism**

If there were awards for tourism phrases that have been misused, ""ecotourism"" would win first prize. This term appeared in the early 1980s, showing a growing awareness of environmental issues and a desire from travelers to minimize their impact while abroad. It quickly became a popular marketing term for holidays. Now, ""ecotourism"" can mean anything from a two-week stay with remote tribes to a one-hour boat trip through an Australian gorge. Any tour that includes cultural experiences, beautiful nature, wildlife, or a bit of adventure is likely to be labeled as ecotourism. While the original idea was to help travelers make informed choices, the lack of clear rules and definitions has left many confused in the ecotourism market.

**Transylvanian Journey**

I lost my notebook from my trip to Transylvania for 50 years, but I found it again by chance a few years ago. It has helped me remember that time and write about it, but it wasn’t as helpful as I hoped. In Transylvania, I had a much easier time than I expected, moving from one welcoming house to another and often staying for weeks. When I settled down for a while, I stopped writing, thinking there was nothing important to record. I was slow to start writing again when I moved on, and sometimes I only made quick notes instead of detailed stories. Worried that some details might be out of order when I began writing this book, I added many warnings. But then I realized that these pages were not meant to be a guidebook, so I let the story unfold without too many restrictions."
CPE_49,"**Fashion**

Fashion is often thought of as a modern idea that developed because of capitalism in the 19th and 20th centuries. However, many fashion historians argue that fashion, especially in terms of style and design, has a long history. They often start their discussions with the growth of trade in the 16th and 17th centuries. As societies have become more complex, populations have grown, and new technologies for making different types of clothing have emerged, the meanings of what we wear have also become more complicated. Because of this, it is hard to say exactly what any piece of clothing means today. For instance, a man's suit, which is often seen as a sign of uniformity, can have very different meanings depending on the situation and the person.

**Writer**

Reports about publishers fighting over popular new books can give a false idea of what life is like for most novelists. For those of us who are not best-selling authors, there are two main ways to make a living. The smartest writers work in the evenings and have other full-time jobs that will still be there if their book is not quickly published or made into a movie. Others, like me, take on various small jobs, such as teaching, running workshops, and writing articles. I have heard of a writing job at a chocolate factory, but I have never found anything like that. Somehow, by balancing part-time jobs and using credit cards, and often thanks to the help of friends mentioned in the Acknowledgements, I manage to write my novel.

**Sudden Fame**

The small places where we performed around the country were starting to sell out, and we needed extra security to manage the growing number of excited fans. We had to use secret entrances to avoid being overwhelmed by our supporters. On the few nights we were not working, it was hard to go out without being followed by fans. In just a few days, we became celebrities. Our fans watched our every move, and our management took care of all our needs. Even though I still felt shy, I also experienced a strange, naive confidence that many shy people can understand when they suddenly find themselves in the spotlight. In short, I felt completely out of my comfort zone."
CPE_31,"**Music - The Challenge Ahead**

Technological advances are changing our lives at work, home, and during our free time. Susan Hallam talks about how these changes affect music in Britain. In the late 20th century, there was a quick rise in ways to listen to music, such as through radio, TV, records, tapes, CDs, videos, and new multimedia technologies. However, this has led to fewer live music performances and fewer full-time jobs for professional musicians.

It is clear that access to music will keep growing because it meets many human needs. On a national level, music is present at all major state events. For individuals, music offers many activities, both formal and informal. A society without music is hard to imagine. The real question is not whether there will be music in the 21st century, but what kind of music it will be and if people will still feel the need to learn to play musical instruments.

I believe that people will continue to learn instruments. The music industry is a major source of income in Britain, and musical skills will remain important for various jobs, especially in media-related fields. Additionally, there is evidence that playing an instrument can help develop skills early in life. Research in the USA suggests that listening to or making music positively affects spatial reasoning, which is one part of measuring intelligence. While these results need more confirmation, studies in Europe show that group music lessons can improve social relationships in schools and help children focus, especially those with behavioral issues.

Current research is also looking into how playing an instrument might help develop skills that can be used in other areas. For example, regular practice can lead to better study habits and concentration, while performing in concerts can teach punctuality and organization. Because of these benefits, there will likely be a continued demand for instrumental teaching in the near future.

What about the long-term future? Will there be a change in focus, and if so, what will it be? I see two likely possibilities. First, the types of music people listen to will become more varied, with new genres combining different styles. Second, technology will play a bigger role in composing and performing music. This will make it easier for more people to create music without needing advanced technical skills, but it may also reduce the need for live performances and musicians focused only on that.

At the same time, more people of all ages will want to participate in making music. These activities will likely be community-based and reflect the musical traditions of those communities. If this future is to happen, the music profession must prepare. Instrumental teaching will need to change to help more people learn different instruments throughout their lives. This will require changes in the curriculum and how progress is measured to stay relevant for a wider audience.

Training for musicians will be essential. They will need to inspire and teach learners of all ages, work with large and diverse groups, and develop skills in communication, social interaction, entrepreneurship, and management for community work. This represents a big change from traditional methods and will require a response to demands for public accountability. 

Positively, this is an opportunity for everyone involved in music education to show the high quality of music teaching available. Finally, we must work to raise the importance of music itself. Music is vital in our lives, but it is often taken for granted. Those in the music profession need to collaborate actively to ensure this changes."
CPE_58,"**The Actor's Craft**

Sometimes, actors face criticism and disrespect. This negative view often comes from the actors themselves when they are asked to talk about their work in interviews. Instead of sharing their true feelings, they often use boring phrases or get caught up in gossip. The actor Paul Scofield once wrote to a friend that an actor's work is only interesting when it is performed. He believed that discussing it makes it feel empty and unimportant. Each time an actor performs, they start fresh, learning about their character and the writer's ideas. After a play ends, they feel empty until they perform again, and this emptiness shows when they talk about their work.

**A Review of Hamlet**

Adrian Lester's performance as Hamlet shows a young man caught between childhood and adulthood. His acting is simple yet confident. He skillfully handles the text and shows great control over his body and emotions. Lester portrays Hamlet as a young man filled with anger but also humor, making him both strong and likable. His physical presence, like the way his arms hang, suggests he is waiting to be brought to life. Another actor, Handy, plays Horatio in a way that also feels like he is being moved by an inner force. This raises questions about acting: Is it just copying real behavior, or is it something deeper? What brings these characters to life? 

**One Director's Approach to Rehearsal**

This director's rehearsal process starts with a method called ""dropping in."" The stage manager shows the script on a screen while the actors listen quietly. When it is their turn to speak, they look at the screen, think about the first line, and find the reason to say it. For example, if the line is about waiting in the rain, they might picture a memory of standing in a queue. They should not plan their response in advance but instead trust that something will come to them in the moment.

**The Perfect Theatre**

The ideal theatre should make the audience feel that their presence matters. Attending a live performance is special, and the staff should understand this. It can feel very isolating if the people working at the theatre seem uninterested. The theatre should create a connection between the performers and the audience. The audience should be close enough to hear and see everything clearly. The design of the auditorium is important; it should fit the human voice and body. If the space is too large, it can feel wrong because drama is about human experiences. Many theatres built in the late 1800s got this right by creating spaces that feel welcoming. I appreciate theatres that have a sense of history, like old stone steps that show the presence of many people over time. 

When it comes to plays, you cannot please everyone. You cannot predict what the audience will want to see. When you go to the theatre, you want to experience something surprising and unique; otherwise, you might as well stay home."
CPE_37,"**Paul Simon**

Rock and roll in the 1950s was mainly popular among young people, but it also had a big effect on the middle class and older adults. This music opened doors for the next generation of rock stars, who listened to it with excitement, knowing that this unique sound would be important in their lives. For Paul Simon and many other young people in the US, the best way to hear this exciting new music was through Alan Freed's radio show, Moondog Rock'n'Roll Party. Freed's show was essential listening for many young rock stars. Just like John Lennon, who was 3,000 miles away in Liverpool, listening to Radio Luxembourg, Paul Simon was captivated by the music from Freed's show. He was getting ready to make the next big move for a teenager who loved rock and roll: creating his own music.

**Snow**

I couldn’t see a clear path, but I thought I would be okay if I was careful. The wind was strong, pushing me over as I slipped on the icy ground. Suddenly, the snow that looked safe gave way, and I fell into a hole about four feet deep. The snow had formed a roof over a gap between two rocks, and when it melted, it left only a thin layer that I fell through. I managed to climb out, feeling shaken and worried about what would have happened if the hole had been much deeper. I sat against a pine tree that was sticking out of the snow to think about my situation. After an hour, I had only gone about half a mile. It was clear that I would have to change my plans.

**Qualitative Research**

There are many books that help researchers understand qualitative research. While a lot has been written about how to collect data, these books often do not explain how to analyze that data. There is still a lot of mystery about how researchers study their data. To help with this, we invited various social scientists who have worked on qualitative projects to share their methods. The goal was to provide insight into the process of analyzing qualitative data, rather than creating a guidebook for new researchers. This task involves making unclear processes clearer. Although this may seem easy, we found it to be quite challenging. Therefore, we allowed our contributors to present their work in different styles, including personal stories and more formal writing."
CPE_2,"**Screen Learning**

Recently, I saw my six-year-old son eating noodles in a funny way. He was pretending to be a dinosaur and said, ""I'm a little dinosaur."" He was acting out a scene from a TV show, so I asked him what he remembered about dinosaurs. He didn’t remember much. 

There is a trend to use the internet and computers for learning, but is this a good way to learn? One writer shared his experience with an interactive program he tried with his son. The father read the words while the son played with the pictures. The father thought that if his son had spent ten minutes reading a book, he might have learned more. 

Research shows that learning happens best in an environment where there is conversation with teachers or parents. Technology can help teach our children, but traditional education is still very important.

**Hollywood**

By 1918, most of the world’s film-making had moved to Hollywood. The local people were not happy about this, seeing it as a bad influence. However, they eventually accepted it because success is a key American value, and success is measured by box office earnings. 

Hollywood has changed a lot in less than a century. It has grown from a small village to a town as famous as New York, Rome, or Paris. A hundred years ago, you would walk through orange groves to get to the village store. Yet, in some ways, it still feels like a village, focused mainly on films. People talk about how much movies make, who is dating whom, and who is working on which project. 

Many successful people in Hollywood try to live elsewhere while working there. Still, it remains the main place for anyone important in show business.

**Photography**

Photography was created by artists in the 19th century as a way to capture their surroundings. They wanted a lasting record of what they saw. The new technology of light, lenses, and chemicals produced images that were more detailed and realistic than paintings, which took much longer to create. 

This upset many traditional artists. They believed photography could not be considered art because it relied too much on machines. However, photographers saw it as a new form of art and a way to express themselves. They used photography like other artists use brushes and pencils to show their view of the world.

**Book Illustration**

In the past, every children's book needed illustrations. This also applied to many novels for older readers, although fewer were published over time. Children's publishing was mostly low-budget, which led to many average-quality works, but the best artists always gave their best effort. 

The collection of black-and-white illustrations is a mix of valuable and less valuable works, making it a great place for research and discovery. Many of these treasures will be shown to the public again, either through new editions of classic books or exhibitions of original artwork. There are signs that interest in this period of illustration is growing, and soon, a publisher will likely create a series of classic children's book illustrations."
CPE_68,"**Blogging: Sharing with Caution**

Not long ago, a website warned about the dangers of public check-ins, which are online posts that tell people where you are. The message was clear: when you say, ""Hey, I'm here,"" you are also letting many people know your location, including those you might not want to meet. This shows that while sharing our lives online can be exciting, it can also have negative consequences.

The internet gives us many chances to share our experiences with a global audience, which can lead to fame or wealth. However, as we share personal stories and photos, we may find ourselves in a crowded and risky space. It can feel overwhelming, but there is hope. We can learn from those who explored the internet before us.

In the early days of the web, a group of pioneers, now known as bloggers, faced many challenges. They lost jobs, made and lost friends, and dealt with the temptations of fame long before social media existed. Their experiences can teach us valuable lessons.

In January 1994, Justin Hall, a 19-year-old student, started sharing his life online. At that time, the web was mostly used by graduate students and scientists. Hall saw a chance to share his personal story. He created a blog filled with his thoughts, photos, and art. By January 1996, he was posting daily, attracting many readers who were fascinated by his boldness. Hall was open about everything, and while some saw him as an exhibitionist, others appreciated the artistic side of his work.

However, one day, visitors to his blog found it replaced by a video called ""Dark Night."" Hall shared that he had fallen in love, but when he wrote about it, his partner told him to choose between the blog and the relationship. Hall chose to remove the blog, feeling that sharing so much made people distrust him. This situation highlights a key point: while sharing online can be enjoyable, it can also lead to disappointment if you expect it to bring you closer to others.

In 2002, Heather Armstrong, a young woman in Los Angeles, had a blog called Dooce. She sometimes wrote about her job at a software company. One day, a colleague shared her blog with the company's vice presidents, including some she had criticized, which led to her losing her job. This situation illustrates the ""online distribution effect,"" where people feel they can say things online that they would never say in person. However, our online lives are connected to our real lives, and ignoring this can lead to serious mistakes.

Armstrong's story had a positive ending. After taking a break from blogging, she got married and started a new blog focused on her family. Today, she is a successful ""mommy blogger,"" and her writing supports her family. She learned an important lesson: while the internet allows us to say anything, it doesn't mean we should."
CPE_23,"**Enough Sleep?**

Many people today feel tired all the time. In richer and busier countries, sleeplessness and anxiety have become common. Research in the USA shows that 40 million Americans suffer from chronic sleep problems. Some popular novels in Britain even have characters who cannot sleep or are set in sleep research labs. This shows a growing interest in sleep: its patterns, its importance, and the issues people face with it. A leading sleep researcher says, ""People need more sleep."" When people are busy, they often sleep less. They wake up early to avoid traffic.

Recently, a sleep researcher conducted an experiment. He let participants sleep for up to 14 hours a night for a month. After three weeks, they settled into an average of eight hours and fifteen minutes of sleep. This shows they needed more sleep than they were getting.

In Europe, a university sleep research lab in the English Midlands studies sleep in detail. They have looked at how tiredness affects sailors, how airport noise disturbs sleep, and the risks of driving when tired. They recruit participants through student newspapers. These subjects are picked up by taxi, paid £5 an hour, and asked to change their sleep patterns based on instructions. Dr. Louise Reyner reassures them, saying, ""Some people worry because we put electrodes on their heads, thinking we can see their dreams or thoughts."" However, the lab focuses more on physical effects.

In a dark room, there is a driving simulator with a large screen. Participants come in at 2 PM, which is when people usually feel sleepy, especially after a poor night’s sleep. They drive while answering questions. The road ahead seems endless, with bright sunlight and warm air. The young men insist they will not fall asleep. Dr. Reyner has a video of one participant trying hard to stay awake. At first, he sits up straight, but soon he starts to blink more often and his head begins to droop. Eventually, he falls asleep for a few seconds, causing the car to drift off the road. Dr. Reyner suggests that drinking two cups of coffee can help someone stay awake and drive safely for at least half an hour. She also recommends energy products like tablets and caffeinated gum, especially for shift workers.

But what do we really know about sleep? It is clear that humans, like other mammals, sleep in cycles. When we sleep, we go through four stages, from light sleep to deep sleep. Dreams usually happen during light sleep, and the brain temporarily paralyzes the body to prevent injuries. Beyond this, many ideas about sleep are still theories. Some believe sleep helps repair the body or restore muscles, but it might also happen during relaxed wakefulness.

Scientists agree that women tend to sleep about half an hour longer than men, and older people generally need less sleep, though the reasons are unclear. Some researchers even say, ""Sleep is a way to travel through time without getting hurt.""

Sleep patterns have changed over time. A history professor studied British sleep habits from 1500 to 1850 and found that people went to bed early, woke up after midnight for a while, and then went back to sleep. This time was used for thinking, remembering dreams, or even stealing. The poorest people benefited most from this quiet time, escaping their daily struggles. By the 17th century, with more artificial light, wealthy people began to adopt the sleep patterns we have today. The industrial revolution later forced most people to work longer hours in lit buildings.

However, in many non-western cultures, the old sleep patterns still exist. Some people go to bed for a few hours, wake up, and then sleep again. The idea of a full night’s sleep is not common. In certain tribal societies, noises from animals and the need to watch over fires make it hard to sleep continuously. It seems that people everywhere are in need of more sleep."
CPE_60,"We are talking about really expensive cowboy boots. I stood in my 800-dollar designer cowboy boots on the rocks in the Arizona desert. Money was not a problem. I wore a full cowboy outfit, and if you have the outfit, you might look like a cowboy. But I wasn’t one. I looked out at the Arizona mountains and realized I didn’t belong there. I had flown in from Denver early in the morning, thinking I might look like a cowboy coming from the sky. But that thought disappeared when I saw a real cowboy at the Phoenix airport. He was wearing a dirty shirt, needed a shave, and was picking up his bag when he noticed my new cowboy boots. He raised an eyebrow and left without saying anything.

I thought there should be a set of clothes that an ex-racing driver could wear without feeling out of place. I loved being a racing driver and driving fast cars. I was addicted to it, and it was all I knew. But I couldn’t do it anymore. I wondered what I should do now. A racing driver should have other options for when he stops racing. I thought I had some, but they didn’t work out.

One idea was to be a commentator at races, but there were many former drivers ahead of me for that job. Another idea was to sell classic cars, but that didn’t go well either. It was a bad year for selling old cars, so I decided to step back before I lost everything. Being an ""ex"" at anything is hard. Who wants to hear about how I almost became the World Champion? No one wants to hear a story that ends with ""almost."" Even if I had been the champion, people would only listen for a short time before getting bored. Last year’s champion is just that—last year.

I don’t want sympathy, and I don’t get any. I had a good career, made money, and saved enough. But I really miss the excitement of getting into a powerful racing car. I miss the thrill of going from zero to 150 miles per hour in just 4.9 seconds. I even miss the danger of racing. I miss the bright, interesting people and the reporters who cared about what I said. Being somewhat famous had its perks. Businessmen and politicians liked to say they knew me, and kids would sneak under fences to get my autograph.

Now that I don’t race anymore, I have a lot of free time. Just last week, my phone rang twice. I have time in the morning and afternoon, and tomorrow looks free too. I looked up at the clear blue sky. There were no buzzards flying above. Maybe Arizona doesn’t have buzzards. But I saw some little brown birds in a cactus nearby, and they seemed to be telling me to leave their nest alone. I never thought the desert had songbirds. I realized that a fake cowboy in fancy boots still has a lot to learn."
CPE_1,"**Vancouver**

In the last ten years, many people from around the world have moved to Vancouver, a city in western Canada. In the evenings, residents walk through the streets, and if you join them, you will likely hear many different languages. People come to Vancouver for its mild weather, beautiful location between the ocean and mountains, clean and safe environment, and good education and job opportunities. Although some locals complain about how quickly new buildings are being built, it is clear that the new residents and growing tourism have helped the city improve. Vancouver was once called 'Terminal City' because it was a gateway to other places. Although this name is not used as much now, Vancouver is still a major gateway.

**Putting Pen to Paper**

Journalists like me are often not good at writing letters. Some say this is because we don’t like to write for free, but I think it is more about how we try to make our writing very effective in our work. This focus on effect can make writing a letter feel less spontaneous. A true artist, who does not think too much about the effect of their words, does not have this problem. I believe that understanding the impact of words is a key sign of a real artist. For example, when Shakespeare wrote his famous lines, he probably did not think about how the choice of words made them powerful.

**Supermarket Opening**

In Britain, the opening of a new supermarket used to be a big event. You could expect a celebrity, like a soap star or a member of the royal family, to come and cut the ribbon. Now, new supermarkets seem to open every day, and celebrities are no longer needed. Why pay a famous person when anyone can open it for free? Last week, older people waiting for the new Superbuy store didn’t care who opened it, as long as they were at the front of the line. According to someone who knew an employee, the first five men to enter would get a bottle of aftershave, and the first five women would receive flowers. This news spread quickly among the crowd, making those at the front feel proud and leaving the latecomers feeling jealous."
CPE_53,"**Citizen Kane**

When the film *Citizen Kane* was released in 1941, it created a lot of excitement. However, it was not a big success at the box office. The film was delayed because the distributors were worried about what William Randolph Hearst, the person it was said to be about, might do to them. It was only later, when it was shown on television, that people started to appreciate it more. This film has inspired many people to become filmmakers, which is impressive since it was Orson Welles's first film. Welles believed that its success came from his lack of knowledge about the rules of filmmaking; he just went for it. He also had a great team, including cameraman Gregg Toland, screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, and special-effects expert Linwood Dunn. When Welles and Mankiewicz decided to create a story about a newspaper owner who was similar to Hearst but not exactly him, Welles realized he had found the perfect role for himself as both director and actor, and he took the opportunity with great enthusiasm.

**Dermot and Carmel**

That morning, Dermot thought Carmel was acting a bit strange. He had mentioned twice that he might be late and that he might stop at the golf club on his way home to talk to someone. Carmel had nodded but seemed distant, as if she didn’t really understand. Dermot asked her, “Will you be okay? What are you going to do today?” She smiled and replied, “It’s funny you ask. I was just thinking I have nothing planned, so I might walk downtown and look at the shops. I feel like it would be a bit sinful to waste the day like that.” Dermot smiled back and said, “You deserve to enjoy yourself. And if I’m late, I won’t need anything to eat, so don’t worry about it.” “That’s fine,” she said.

**Title Race**

Do you mind if I call myself a mobile lukewarm beverage resource facilitator? A recent study shows that job titles can cause jealousy and problems at work. A survey by a well-known recruitment company found that 90% of employers and 70% of employees believe that job titles create divisions among coworkers. Surprisingly, 70% of office workers said they would give up a pay raise for a more “motivational” or “professional” job title. If our desire for better titles is so strong that it overcomes our basic need for money, we are in trouble. In the early twenty-first century, no one wants to be called “subordinate.” The job titles being discussed focus on skills (like specialist or coordinator) but are really just fancy words."
CPE_55,"**The Vienna Assignment**

I was in Vienna to take photographs, which was usually why I traveled. Photography was not just my job; it was a big part of my life. I loved how light fell on different surfaces and how a single photo could capture a moment in time, a place, or a person. I always believed that I could take the perfect photo at any moment, as long as I had film in my camera. My motto was to finish one roll of film, load another, and keep looking for new shots. 

Once, I took a photo of a smoke plume from a burning oil well that became very popular, and many newspapers and magazines wanted to use it. It was a brief moment of fame, mostly due to luck. They say you create your own luck, both good and bad. After that, I decided to work as a freelance photographer, which I thought was a smart choice. However, life had other plans, and things didn’t go as well as I had hoped. The mid-nineties were not the successful years I expected after my photo was featured on the cover of Time magazine. That’s why I found myself in Vienna instead of a more exciting place. But I was still taking photos and getting paid for it, which I thought was good.

My assignment in Vienna came about by chance. I had taken photos for a book called *Four Cities in Four Seasons*, which included London, Paris, Rome, and Vienna. I had received a nice payment for capturing different seasons in London. I had my own style, showing the beauty of daffodils in Hyde Park and the busy streets of Piccadilly. I knew that some of my best work would be ignored because it was just a picture book, not something meant to challenge people’s views.

After I submitted my winter photos of London, I learned that the Austrian photographer, Rudi Schussner, had left his job in Vienna for reasons I didn’t need to know. Instead of hiring someone new, they offered me the job. The Austrian publishers liked my work, and I was available, while other photographers were not. I was happy to go because things were not good at home. A week in snowy Vienna sounded great to me.

They put me up at the Europa hotel in the old city. I had visited Vienna before with my wife, but it had been a busy and hot trip, and I hadn’t taken many photos. This time, being alone in the cold January weather, I felt it would be different. As soon as I arrived and saw the beautiful light over the snow-covered roofs, I knew I would enjoy my time there and take great pictures.

On my first day, I didn’t rush to take photos. I rode the trams around the Ringstrasse, getting on and off to experience the city’s atmosphere. The weather was cold and still, just like the grand buildings from the old empire. I hadn’t seen what Schussner had captured in the other seasons, and I didn’t want to. This was going to be my Vienna, and I wanted to discover it for myself.

A photograph captures a moment, but you have to wait for the right moment to come. So, I took my time to look around until I was ready. The next morning, I woke up early. The snow from the night before made Stephansplatz beautifully white and almost empty. I struggled to find a way to capture the cathedral in one shot. Its tall spire reached into the grey sky, while at ground level, it was huge and dominating the city. I realized I might have to take a partial shot instead. In that weather and at that time, it could still be magical.

Photography has always had a sense of magic. Even the early photographers felt this before they fully understood the science behind it. You can watch a blank piece of paper turn into a photograph in a dark room. Even when you know how it works, the mystery of it remains. Maybe that’s why what happened at Stephansplatz that morning didn’t surprise me in a strange way."
CPE_50,"**Kinetic Art Exhibition**

Exciting news: London's Hayward Gallery has changed from a serious place into one full of wonder. This change is not due to a big-budget show, but rather a unique exploration of a lesser-known part of the last 60 years. A new exhibition looks at the history of kinetic art, which is art that involves movement, throughout the twentieth century. It shows that creating art that moves or explores the idea of movement has been an important but often overlooked theme in the creative work of this century. 

Curator Guy Brett, who has studied this subject for many years, has put together a wonderful collection of paintings, drawings, documents, and films about kinetic art. The exhibition has very little text, allowing visitors to enjoy discovering and connecting ideas on their own.

**David Hockney**

David Hockney's art attracts many people who might not usually be interested in art. This could be because his work is figurative and easy to understand, or because it shows themes of leisure and escape from daily life. Some people might even be drawn to Hockney's charming personality and his clever comments that make him popular in the media. However, this raises the question: does this popularity mean his art lacks serious purpose? 

Some critics believe Hockney is an overrated artist. But others argue that his popularity today might be seen as a problem, rather than a lack of depth in his work. Hockney himself understands his limitations and believes it is not important to judge his work based on traditional ideas of greatness. He does not claim to be a great artist and knows that only future generations can truly judge his importance.

**Window-Shopping: An Art Exhibition**

In recent years, I have seen many contemporary art exhibitions, some brilliant and some not so good. What bothers me are shows that seem to push a specific idea or agenda, suggesting a common viewpoint among certain artists. Sometimes this works, and we notice new trends in seemingly unrelated works. More often, though, it feels forced or questionable. 

As a curator, I wanted to create a show that was the opposite of this. Together with seven artists, I took over an empty warehouse for an exhibition called ""Window-Shopping."" This show featured individual artworks that connected only by being labeled as art. For example, Sam Cole created knitted cats that playfully chased each other on a toy train track, while Matthew Crawley filmed himself opening a video camera and poking around until it broke. These pieces did not fit into a specific theme and would not usually be shown together, but I believe their differences added to each other’s impact. 

I did not make grand statements about contemporary art, but I think it is important to recognize that art is often a personal activity where artists set their own rules.

**Art History**

Many people who enjoy paintings hesitate to analyze them because they fear it will ruin their enjoyment. Some believe that art historians, who focus on theory rather than practice, overlook the joy of simply looking at art and the special act of creating it. This idea is similar to thinking that knowing how a dish is made takes away from its taste. 

Understanding the importance of enjoyment does not mean we cannot also learn about the art we appreciate. In fact, knowing more about what we are viewing can enhance our pleasure. Additionally, our enjoyment of art is not just about personal taste; it is influenced by the values of the society we live in. While it is important to value our instinctive responses to art, the belief that thinking about art takes away from enjoyment is an outdated idea that once viewed art as separate from thought."
CPE_25,"**Metals**  
In the Stone Age, people may have become interested in metals because they wanted to decorate themselves. While sitting by a river, one of our early ancestors might have found a shiny yellow stone and picked it up. This stone felt different from regular stones and was very attractive. This could be how gold first became important to early humans. Because gold is easy to shape, it quickly became a popular material. Copper might have also been discovered by chance. Once people realized how useful copper tools were, they actively searched for copper ores and ways to extract the metal. This led to the development of metalworking, which improved the lives of our ancestors.

**St Ives**  
We walked down a narrow, cobbled street towards the town, struggling with our heavy bags against a strong wind and trying to avoid the cold waves crashing over the walkway. The streets were empty, and all the windows in the seaside cottages were tightly shut against the storm. We had seen the weather get worse as we arrived in St Ives on a small train. With the dark clouds gathering, visiting Cornwall in the off-season without a car didn’t seem like a good idea anymore. I had convinced my friend to come with me by promising beautiful walks along the coast and cozy evenings by the fire.

**Computer Modelling**  
Studying the past is difficult because it is already gone. The people who lived in times of peace and those who faced challenges are no longer alive. The reasons why they settled in certain places or formed families and communities are lost to time. Archaeology gives us some clues, but we cannot test our ideas with experiments on past cultures. We cannot go back in time to see what happened. However, computer modelling allows us to recreate ancient landscapes and environments and fill them with virtual communities. These digital people can have some of the needs and abilities of real humans. We can set rules for them and create social groups. Then, we can change the weather or the population and observe how these virtual cultures respond."
CPE_34,"**Vervet Monkeys**  
Cheney and Seyfarth studied a group of vervet monkeys. One day, the dominant male noticed a strange male monkey nearby. The stranger wanted to join the group, which could lead to the dominant male losing his position. To keep the stranger away, the dominant male made an alarm call that vervet monkeys use to warn about leopards. This scared the stranger back into the trees. He repeated this trick every time the stranger approached. However, the dominant male made a mistake. After using the alarm call several times, he called out while walking across the open ground himself.  

**What Cats Catch**  
In a survey in the village of Felmersham, people recorded what their cats caught over a year. Seventy cats caught over 1,000 animals. A professor in America estimated that all cats in Britain might kill 100 million birds and small mammals each year. However, this number is misleading. Most cats live in towns and catch fewer animals than those in the survey. The important question is whether these numbers are sustainable. The answer seems to be yes. In winter, many people feed birds, and gardens provide places for birds to nest, keeping their population above natural levels. The survey showed that while cats are significant predators, they are not destroying Britain's bird population.  

**Buffalo's Day**  
Buffaloes are very important to the marshmen, and they are treated with care. Each morning, the buffaloes, who sleep near their owners, slowly leave their resting place to go to the reed beds. They often groan about their tiredness before finally moving into the water. Once in the water, they seem to forget their purpose and relax, making low sounds for a while. Their movements away from the house are slow and almost unnoticed, but eventually, they swim, appearing to struggle to keep their noses above the water. They spend the day among the reeds, grazing on green shoots at their eye level.  

**Picasso, Pablo**  
In 1940, while staying in the fishing port of Royan, Picasso painted several still lifes of fish. One painting shows a fishmonger’s table with a crab and some soles. The fish look alive despite their situation. The painting is complex, with overlapping shapes and soft colors that create a calm underwater feeling. However, there is tension in the painting, as the fish seem to be preparing for a fight with the crab. The sharp shapes and the chain around one fish add a sense of danger, giving the painting a deeper meaning."
CPE_12,"**Photography**

Over the last 150 years, photography has been used to capture many aspects of human life. This relatively short history has allowed photography to improve in showing both small details and large scenes. It has given us images from faraway places, different parts of the solar system, and the complex social issues of modern life. Photography has become one of the most important ways to express what it means to be human.

However, the idea of recording events visually goes back much further. The first known images were created around 35,000 years ago during the Upper Paleolithic period. We are not sure why early humans made cave paintings. They might have recorded hunting events, served as magic to help with hunting, had religious meanings, or simply made daily life more colorful. These early images are deeply connected to human culture.

Throughout history, people have questioned how accurate visual images are and what role they play in society. The saying ""seeing is believing"" has given special importance to visual images. When photography was invented in the mid-1800s, it seemed to promise a truthful record of reality. The camera was thought to work like the human eye, capturing images that closely resembled what we see. This chemical process allowed for the creation of images that felt natural.

At the same time, photography was seen as a sophisticated art form, something that artists had worked hard to achieve. Because photography seemed so realistic, many believed that everyone could easily understand photographs. For example, in 1933, photographer August Sander said that even the most isolated person could understand a photo of the sky, whether it showed the sun, moon, or stars.

However, as global communication grew in the late 20th century, we must consider how well photographs can cross cultural differences. Is photography as influenced by culture as language is? Has our familiarity with photographs made us overlook the complex ways they convey reality? Photography is often seen as strong evidence, making it easy to confuse our view of the world with its photographic representations. For instance, it is common for someone to show a photograph and say, ""This is my grandson.""

Since its invention in 1839, photography and how people view it have changed a lot. This change may be because photography has moved into what we might call ""mythic time."" Its original role as a record-keeper has evolved, and photographs, once closely connected to the photographer and the subject, have become historical documents. These images often tell us more about the people and society that created them than about the subjects themselves.

I want to show that the camera is not just a silent recorder of events. Photography does not only reflect culture; it can also inspire social and political change. For example, it is hard to imagine the cultural changes of the Italian Renaissance without recognizing how the development of perspective changed visual representation. Similarly, photography has played a significant role in shaping the media culture of today, while also revealing the harsh realities of the world."
CPE_26,"{'index': -9, 'text': 'None'}"
CPE_8,"I have never started a novel with so much doubt. I call it a novel only because I don’t know what else to call it. I don’t have a strong story to tell, and I don’t end with a death or a marriage. Instead, I leave my readers uncertain. This book is about my memories of a man I met only a few times, and I don’t know much about what happened to him in between our meetings. I could make up stories to fill in the gaps and make my writing more complete, but I don’t want to do that. I just want to share what I know.

To protect the privacy of people who are still alive, I have given the characters in this story names that I made up, and I have taken care to ensure that no one can recognize them. The man I am writing about is not famous, and he may never be. When his life ends, he might leave no more mark on the world than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the water's surface. If my book is read, it will be for its own interest. However, it is possible that the way he lives and the unique qualities of his character may influence others, and after he is gone, people may realize that he was a remarkable person. Then it will be clear who I am writing about, and those who want to know a bit about his early life may find something useful in my book.

I believe my book will be a helpful source of information for anyone writing about my friend. I do not claim that the conversations I recorded are exact. I never took notes, but I remember well what matters to me. Although I have put these conversations in my own words, I believe they accurately reflect what was said. I mentioned earlier that I have invented nothing, but I have taken the same liberty that historians do by putting words into the mouths of characters that I did not hear myself. I did this to make the scenes more lively and engaging, as they would not be as effective if I just told them plainly. I want my book to be enjoyable to read, and I think it is fair to do what I can to achieve that. A thoughtful reader will notice where I have used this technique and can choose to ignore it if they wish.

Another reason I feel nervous about this work is that the people I write about come from a different culture. It is hard to truly know people, and I believe we can only really know those from our own country. People are shaped by many things: the place they were born, the home they grew up in, the games they played, the food they ate, the schools they attended, the sports they liked, and the poets they read. All these experiences make them who they are, and you can only understand them if you have lived through similar experiences. Since you can only know people from a different country through observation, it is challenging to make them believable in a book. I have never tried to write about anyone but my own countrymen, and if I have done so in short stories, it is because those allow for a more general approach. You can give broad descriptions and let the reader fill in the details. In this book, I do not claim that my characters see themselves as they truly are; they are seen through my own perspective, just like my main character."
CPE_4,"**POETRY RECITALS**

At any time in history, the world of literature can seem confusing to those living in it. However, later generations can see clear patterns and important figures in literature. Right now, there is a complex mix of different styles of poetry, various groups of poets, and different ways of presenting, criticizing, and teaching poetry. There are also many opinions about what a poet's role in society should be.

In general, the current discussion in poetry is about the distrust between serious 'literary' poets, who write poems meant to be read on the page, and 'popular' poets, who prefer to perform their work in front of an audience. This division is not strict. Over the last twenty years, public poetry readings have become more common in many forms. Small literary groups in towns hold readings in community centers or members' homes. Schools and colleges invite poets to read and talk to students, and arts festivals often feature poetry readings by well-known poets.

These events have many effects, and it is unclear how they benefit poets. For 'pop' poets, who write their work to be performed live, public readings are beneficial. Their poems are usually simple and can be understood easily in one hearing. However, when these poems are read on the page, their weaknesses in thought and technique become more obvious.

On the other hand, poets who are dedicated to their craft and aim to create deep and meaningful work may not be appreciated by audiences who are hearing their poems for the first time. The risk is that these poets might choose to read only their simplest work to connect quickly with the audience, which may not represent their best writing.

Attending poetry readings cannot replace reading poetry from a book, but it can be enjoyable and helpful. Hearing good poets read their work, even if they are not great speakers, can show the audience how to understand the poems better. It is best if the audience has the text in front of them or knows the poems beforehand.

The main reason for popular poetry readings, which sometimes include music, is to help audiences enjoy poetry and see it as an art form for everyone, not just a select few."
CPE_30,"**Oral History**  
Historians are increasingly using oral evidence, but this approach has its challenges. It is unrealistic to think that a person's story is a perfect reflection of their past. In an interview, both the historian and the informant influence each other. The historian chooses who to interview and what topics to discuss. Even if the historian only listens, their presence can change how the informant remembers and talks about their experiences. The final account is shaped by the historian's social position and their understanding of the past, which may affect how the informant shares their memories. Additionally, the informant's memories are not always accurate. They can be influenced by other sources, like the media, or by feelings of nostalgia or resentment about their past. These emotions can make the testimony seem convincing, but they may not truly reflect the past.

**Animal Science**  
There are two main ways to study animal science: the physiological approach and the whole animal approach. Physiologists focus on how the body works, including how nerves, muscles, and senses work together to create complex behaviors. Those who study the whole animal look at the behavior of animals in their natural environments and the factors that influence that behavior. Within this approach, there are psychologists and ethologists. Psychologists often work in labs studying a few species, like rats and pigeons, while ethologists study animals in the wild and their natural behaviors. Although these two areas are different, they are starting to work together more. Physiologists often claim that their methods are more fundamental, but understanding behavior also requires studying it at a behavioral level. For example, explaining how a bird builds a nest by only looking at nerve cells would be like trying to read a book with a microscope.

**The Social Sciences**  
Students studying social sciences for the first time face a challenge: they must learn both the content of their new subject and the methods used to study it. This means they need to understand not only the knowledge found in textbooks but also how that knowledge is gathered and organized. These two aspects are closely connected. While we all have experiences in social life, social sciences go beyond common sense. Each discipline focuses on different parts of social life, uses specific methods, and has its own concepts. These basic ideas form the foundation of the subject and help social scientists understand society in a deeper way.

**Classical Architecture**  
In Ancient Greece and Rome, architecture was more than just building structures. According to the Roman architect Vitruvius, architecture involves order, arrangement, proportion, symmetry, propriety, and distribution. He also provided Greek terms for some of these ideas, which likely came from earlier Greek sources. While utility and function are not part of his main definition, Vitruvius does discuss how to design buildings for different purposes. Initially, the focus is on the artistic side of architecture. The history of classical architecture is complex, with a long period of simple construction before the sophisticated designs we see later. Even though classical temples may seem elaborate, they essentially started as simple, single-room huts."
CPE_7,"The two sisters kept Lily's driving a secret from Chen for a while. Lily would drive around the gardens and the railway, even going over a small bridge with all four wheels in the air, which was her only mistake. After that, they would pass by the gasworks, where there was a strong smell. Chen, however, found it funny that his wife was driving without him knowing. ""So you can really drive, Lily? Well done!"" he said. Mui thought it was strange that her brother-in-law was not upset. Instead, he was excited and made plans with Lily for a trip. They decided to go on a Monday at the start of next month, which was the quietest day for their business. They planned to leave early in the morning and return by noon to avoid losing customers. In the meantime, Lily would practice driving.

Mui, despite her worries, bought a road map and got a ten percent discount, which impressed Chen. However, Lily felt a bit insulted that Mui did not trust her navigation skills. Within an hour of leaving home, they were looking at the English Channel. Lily drove very well. Even Mui, who was in the back seat ready to give directions, had to admit this. On the road, Lily even passed a couple of slow cars with great skill, which made Chen applaud her. After passing the gasworks and the lagoon with its small boats, they drove smoothly along the empty promenade. Lily parked in a small street near the sea, where there were many empty parking spaces. She was unsure about the road signs and preferred to pay for parking rather than risk getting a ticket or having her car towed. 

Lily noticed her sister's worried face in the driving mirror and thought it was better not to add to her worries. She locked all the van doors carefully. ""Don't worry,"" Chen joked. ""No one will want that old car."" The sisters were annoyed. Lily told her husband he was ungrateful, and Mui scolded him for being too quick to judge. Surprised, Chen took their son Man Kee to look at the sea. He held Man Kee close and thought about how he wanted to raise him. Chen wanted his son to learn about numbers, which he struggled with, and to grow up to own many restaurants, learning everything about the business along the way. 

As Chen looked at the sea, he felt a mix of sadness and hope while planning for Man Kee's future. He saw smoke on the horizon and then a ship appearing in the sunlight on the water. Chen put a coin in a telescope and tried to find the ship. At first, he couldn’t see it, but then he finally spotted it. It was a small, old tramp steamer. Chen lifted Man Kee to the telescope and said softly, ""Do you see the ship, Son? It’s a special ship for people like us. It may look small and old, but we know it will take us back home when we are done here. It will take you to your homeland, which you have never seen."" Chen kissed Man Kee's head. 

Lily and Mui joined them, and Lily put her arm around Chen's shoulders. ""The little old ship,"" Chen said. ""Let your mother see, Son."" Man Kee didn’t want to let go of the telescope, and when he finally did, the view was just a blurry white light. By the time Chen found another coin, the ship had disappeared over the horizon, leaving Lily watching seagulls flying around."
CPE_43,"**THE WELL**

I once read that if you dig a deep enough hole, you can see the stars on a clear day. I convinced you to help me with my plan. You watched with wide eyes as I pulled up the well bucket, steadied it on the wall, and then climbed in. I asked you to lower me down. I didn’t think about how heavy the bucket was or that you might not be strong enough to hold it. You held the handle, trying to help as I pushed the bucket off the edge. As soon as it was free, I fell down. You screamed and tried to stop it, but then you let go. I fell into the well and hit my head. 

At first, I was confused and then scared. I saw strange lights, which reminded me of the stars I often saw in cartoons when a character got hurt. I felt dazed, then scared again, and finally angry at you for letting me fall. I was also worried about what my mother would say. You called down to check if I was okay. I opened my mouth to shout, but then I heard panic in your voice, and I couldn’t speak. I lay still, peeking at you through my eyelashes. You ran off to get help. 

After a moment, I climbed back up and pulled myself over the edge, landing on the courtyard stones. I heard worried voices coming from the castle. I quickly ran away to hide in the shadows by the moat bridge. You, my parents, and old Arthur came looking for me. My mother was screaming, and my father was shouting for Arthur to help. You looked pale and shocked. I felt a rush of excitement but then noticed the wet spots I had left on the ground from my clothes. I looked in horror at the dark water spots on the dry stones. 

My father was shining a flashlight into the well, looking for me. I couldn’t believe no one had seen the drops. My mother was now screaming loudly, a sound I had never heard before. It made me feel terrible. I had gotten back at you, but now things were more serious than I expected. What started as a fun prank had turned into something that could lead to serious trouble for me. I regretted not thinking this through. 

Suddenly, I had an idea. I gathered my courage and came out of hiding, pretending to be weak and confused. I cried out softly, then louder when no one heard me. I fell dramatically on the stones. When I sat up, I pretended to be comforted by my mother and said I had found a secret tunnel from the well to the moat. I claimed I crawled through it to escape. I thought I was almost getting away with it until my father squatted in front of me and asked me to repeat my story. I hesitated. 

His eyes narrowed, and I realized he didn’t believe me. I said the secret passage had collapsed after me and that the well was dangerous. I looked into my father’s eyes and felt like I was looking into a dark tunnel with no way out. He seemed to see me for who I really was, and my words got stuck in my throat. “Don’t be ridiculous, boy,” he said, sounding more disappointed than angry. He stood up and walked away. 

Arthur looked at me with a troubled expression, as if he understood my fear but also saw through my lie. He felt sorry for me, not because I had a scary adventure, but because he worried about what kind of person I was becoming. His pity hurt even more than my father’s disappointment. It made me realize that my actions had consequences, and I couldn’t ignore them."
CPE_51,"**REMOVAL DAY**

Now that her children are grown, Susan, who is a widow, has to leave her family home. The moving van had the words 'Removers of Distinction' on it, and indeed, everything that made the house special was being taken away. Fred, the removal man, was carefully wrapping fragile items in newspaper and packing them into boxes, while his helpers were not as gentle. Susan was leaving a beautiful four-story house that looked over a small harbor. The memories of her children growing up there felt present in the air, like dust.

When they first bought the house, her son Robert, who was five at the time, had asked, ""Mum, how do you get a house home?"" It was easy to miss the little boy he used to be, especially now that he was an adult helping with the move. He was making sure Susan didn’t mention the piano. Francesca, their daughter, was also helping, insisting that only she could take care of the family’s Steinway piano.

Fred noticed Susan was not crying and said, ""That's something."" Curious, Susan asked if people usually cry during moves. Fred replied, ""You'd be surprised. They seem happy while packing, but then they cry in an empty room. They feel better once they reach the new place; it’s just hard to see everything taken apart.""

Susan could understand that feeling. If she had been alone, she would have warned the movers about the piano before they started. But Robert insisted it was the movers' job to notice any issues. The piano was now the last item to be moved, sitting proudly in the best room of the house.

Sitting on the bottom stair, with all the chairs gone, Susan remembered the day they moved in. It felt like that day was playing in reverse. The piano had been the first thing brought in, but it got stuck on the stairs. The movers struggled for nearly two hours, and little Robert watched in amazement while Francesca cried, ""We can't live in a house without a piano!"" They had to find a way to get it inside, and her late husband, Peter, had solved the problem. They left the piano outside while they moved in the other furniture. The next day, a builder took out a window, and a crane was brought in to lift the piano through the opening. The children were overjoyed to see it.

However, the whole process had cost a lot, and it took months before they could afford to have the piano tuned. Peter had said, ""That's there forever."" But forever is a long time. The children were too busy to visit often, and Susan found it harder to move around the house.

Thinking about the stairs made her realize the banister rails were still not fixed properly. She should have warned the movers about the piano, but it was too late now. She felt panicked as she looked around. Fred noticed and asked, ""Are you all right? Just the piano left, and then we’ll be done."" 

Robert and Francesca appeared in the hallway to watch. Fred casually asked, ""No tears then?"" Susan was close to crying. It was strange how moving things made them feel so important. Items that seemed unimportant before now felt full of memories, and she almost cried.

Just then, the piano appeared at the top of the stairs, with Fred guiding it down. ""Easy does it!"" he called out as they carefully brought it down and placed it behind the van. Robert was the first to laugh, and soon they were all laughing together, relieved that it was over. As they walked down the path for the last time, the only tears Susan shed were tears of laughter."
CPE_11,"**Online Literary Criticism for Everyone: Is DIY Literary Criticism Just Fun?**

From the beginning, one of the main ideas of the Internet was that it should be open to everyone. In theory, anyone could publish their thoughts or share music online. However, in the early days, some technical skills were needed. Still, there was one area that became accessible to many people: literary criticism. 

By visiting Amazon.com, the first popular online bookstore, anyone could try writing book reviews. Amazon allowed anyone to share their opinions about books and give them a rating of up to five stars. This seemed like a great idea because it meant that readers could see what others thought about a book, not just the publisher's description or professional critics' opinions. Other online bookstores also offered similar features, but Amazon was the largest, with over 80% of the online market. This meant it had the most customers and the most reviews, but it also faced some problems.

Every day, thousands of reviews were submitted to Amazon, and it was impossible to check them all. A team of editors looked for reviews that followed the company's rules. For example, one-word reviews or personal attacks on authors were not allowed. Reviews that gave away the ending or included bad language were also removed. However, since reviewers could remain anonymous, it was easy for some people to misbehave. For instance, authors could write positive reviews for their own books. 

One author, Lev Grossman, was upset by the bad reviews of his first novel, so he wrote some positive reviews under a fake name to balance things out. His trick worked until he wrote an article about it, and then Amazon removed the fake reviews. Authors could also comment on their own books by clicking a link that said, ""I am the Author, and I wish to comment on my book."" Most authors used this to encourage readers to buy and enjoy their books. Some even shared their email addresses for direct communication. However, Amazon did not always check if these comments really came from the authors, except for well-known writers.

The real drama often came from readers, not authors. When James McElroy's book, *We've Got Spirit*, was published, it received good reviews from the press. However, many people mentioned in the book felt hurt and expressed their anger through negative reviews on Amazon. These reviews often disappeared after a few days. Despite this, Amazon saw the large number of reviews as a positive thing for business. 

Amazon wanted reviews to be a place for discussing books, not just chatting. They paid special attention to bestselling books to ensure that all reviews followed the rules. This meant that silly reviews were more likely to appear on pages for less popular books. For example, a classic children's book called *The Story about Ping* inspired some humorous reviews because ""ping"" is also a term used in computer networking. One long review compared the book's story to Internet architecture, saying it provided a good overview of networking concepts. 

However, most reviews on Amazon were serious. They gave a good idea of whether a book was worth buying. The writer George Orwell once said that reviewing too many books made it hard to have real feelings about them. This shows that making literary criticism available to everyone is a positive development."
CPE_14,"**Art in Modern Times**

In the last two hundred years, we often think that every artist must go against the art of their time. We admire art that is unique, revolutionary, or even shocking. We feel proud to appreciate artists whose work was not valued in the past. However, when it comes to contemporary art, we often hesitate and say that some artists have gone too far, and their work is no longer art. The media often expresses these feelings for us, and we tend to agree because we expect art to always be new and surprising. This expectation makes us overlook the old themes and methods that are still present in today’s art.

We want artists to be different from us, with special talents that break the rules. In the past, people commissioned artists for specific purposes, and art was part of everyday life. Today, we leave artists to work on their own and sometimes get frustrated if they try to connect with us.

**Picture This**

Let me describe a situation and ask an important question. An artist picks a text from an art book that talks about the variety of pictures. The text asks, ""What are they all about?"" and then says, ""There is no end to the different kinds of pictures."" This sounds simple, but it leads to a more complex situation. The artist then asks someone to prepare a canvas and take it to a sign painter. He instructs the sign painter to write the chosen text on the canvas in plain black letters without any decoration. The question is: is this finished piece a painting?

**Underground Encounters**

At the Mercury Gallery in London, there is an unspoken rule for painters: once you find a successful style, you should stick to it. Collectors expect artists to keep producing similar work, and if they try something new, it can upset the audience. Gallery owners prefer artists who are safe bets, and the art-buying public often feels more comfortable with familiar styles. However, some artists, like Picasso and Hockney, have successfully broken this rule. 

Eric Rimmington is another artist who is trying something different. He is moving away from the still lifes that made him famous and is now painting scenes from the London Underground. He has been inspired by his drawings of King's Cross Station in the 1980s and has created an exhibition called ""Underground Encounters,"" featuring 40 paintings and drawings that capture the unique charm of this hidden world.

**Extract from a Novel**

I have come to this island with a few books. I use the word ""escape"" because the villagers joke that only a sick person would choose such a remote place to live. I am here to heal myself. Besides an old woman who comes from the village to clean my house, I am alone. I feel neither happy nor sad; I am like a feather floating in memories. 

I mentioned the uselessness of art but did not speak about its comfort. The true value of art lies in its ability to help us reorder and understand reality. Our everyday actions often hide the deeper meaning of life. For artists, creating art allows us to deal with the pain and challenges of daily life, not to avoid them, but to fulfill our true potential through imagination. Otherwise, why should we hurt each other?"
CPE_63,"**Family Business**

""Look, this isn't good!"" said my Dad. We were in the car driving back to London. My father, with my brother Maurice beside him, had just picked me up from the fancy girls' school I attended. He had also just been to Parent's Day, where I received the Latin prize and the prize for the best end-of-school exams. He had a long talk with my headteacher, and now we were heading home for the holidays.

""What isn't?"" I asked, although I had a feeling I knew what he was thinking because he was unusually quiet. Normally, he talked a lot. ""You can't fool me. You'll do what you want now,"" he said. ""With all those certificates, I heard you will get a scholarship to Oxford."" 

""So?"" I replied, trying to act tough. ""Isn't that useful?"" 

""I also heard,"" he continued, and I knew a serious conversation was coming, ""that you want to be a barrister. A barrister!"" My father knew a lot about lawyers and the law. 

""I just said that,"" I replied. ""I couldn't think of anything else!"" 

""And apparently,"" he went on, ""you have the right personality. You can quickly understand a lot of information, you are good at speaking, and you enjoy performing."" 

""I don't know about that,"" I said. ""I only know what I see on TV."" 

""Regardless,"" he said, gathering himself, ""I feel like your heart won't be in the family business. You will go to Oxford University, and after that, I can't see you wanting to join us."" 

The problem was that, like many children in family businesses, I felt trapped by my father's expectations. I saw many career options for myself and wanted to explore them. At the same time, I didn't want to upset my father. I wasn't as scared of him as Maurice was—I was his favorite—but I still found him intimidating. 

""It's too soon to know,"" I said weakly. 

""I tell you, you won't want to join us,"" my father said, who often turned out to be right about these things. ""It's a shame because you have the talent—brains, courage, and vision."" 

""There's still Maurice,"" I said, feeling down. My father scoffed. We both knew Maurice didn't like the business. 

""Anyway,"" I continued, ""you could always use me as a consultant."" My mother had died when I was young, and my father raised me and Maurice. I was two years older than Maurice, and I had taken care of him since we were kids. It wasn't hard; I loved him. Because the business was successful, we lived comfortably—in a big house in London, attended nice schools, wore good clothes, and went to parties, theaters, and operas. My father knew many interesting people—politicians, actors, and businessmen—and our home was always lively.

""I have an idea,"" my father said. ""You can help us during the holidays until you leave Oxford, and then if you want to leave, you can. It will give you some pocket money and help me."" 

""Okay,"" I said, relieved to avoid making immediate choices and especially the sadness my father would feel if I disagreed with him. This was how he controlled us. 

So, it happened. In my last term at school and during university breaks, I helped out, but only a couple of times a year and always with easier tasks. I became one of the top students, had a small house, a nice white car, designer clothes, and a black dress from Paris that I planned to wear for my final exams. 

In my last term, my father came to visit me and took me to a village for a meal and a chat. There were only a few weeks left. My tutor said I would get a First Class degree in Law, and I knew that if I focused and organized my thoughts, he might be right. I felt ready and confident. But then my father told me that he needed me to do one last important task for the family business, the biggest one they had ever attempted, and he promised it would be worth my time. 

""But Dad,"" I protested, ""I have my final exams coming up, and I need to focus on that. It's really important for me to do well, and I don't want to think about anything else right now."" 

I could tell my father didn't understand the pressure I was under (or maybe he was jealous of my life away from him), and he would see my refusal as a betrayal. As he explained the task, I realized how determined he was—the clarity and energy he had for his work were impressive. In his own way, he was a genius, and I respected that. It made my own plans seem less important. 

""All right,"" I said. ""I'll do it."""
CPE_56,"Simon Costello realized that buying the house in Pembroke Square was a mistake within a year of moving in with Lois. He believed that owning something that requires strict budgeting is not worth it. At first, it seemed like a good idea. He had been successful at work, and cases were coming in regularly. Lois returned to her job at the advertising agency just two months after having twins and received a raise to thirty-five thousand. She strongly wanted to move, and Simon did not resist her arguments, which seemed convincing at the time: their flat was not suitable for a family, they needed more space, a garden, and a separate room for an au pair. They could have found these things in a less expensive area of London, but Lois wanted more than just space. She felt that living in Mornington Mansions was not good enough for a rising barrister and a successful businesswoman like herself. 

Lois decided that one of them should use public transport to save money, and it was clear that Simon would be the one to do so. His crowded tube rides became a time for him to feel resentful and unhappy. He often thought about his grandfather's house in Hampstead, where he had spent time as a boy, remembering the comforting smells of dinner and his grandmother's care for her husband after a long day at work. She had been a supportive lawyer's wife, always present at legal events and seemingly happy with her life. But that world was gone. Lois had made it clear before they married that her career was just as important as his. This was a modern marriage, and they both relied on their jobs for their lifestyle. 

Now, their hard work could be ruined by Venetia, who had come to their office in a bad mood. Something had upset her, and she confronted Simon with intense anger. He regretted not leaving his room earlier, thinking that if he had, the confrontation might not have happened. He remembered every word of her accusations. She claimed that a client, Brian Cartwright, said Simon had known about jury bribing four years ago and did nothing. Simon denied it, but his denial felt weak even to him. He felt guilty and ashamed, remembering the fear of punishment from his school days. When he looked into Venetia's eyes, he saw her disbelief. 

He wished he had said, ""Cartwright told me after the trial, but I didn't believe him."" Instead, he had told a more dangerous lie, and she knew it was a lie. He wondered why she was so angry and if she had the right to judge him. Was her own behavior always perfect? Did she have the right to ruin his career? He was unsure of what she could do, but he knew that if this rumor spread, it could destroy him."
CPE_36,"I chose this place to live because I thought I would be anonymous among people who didn’t care about the worn-out rented houses and messy gardens. However, I was wrong. People in the shops soon start to recognize you, even if you try to stay hidden. The beautiful roses from my neighbor’s garden remind me that gardens can be loved. Usually, I stay inside to forget about the summer outside, but tonight I am watching the swifts flying between the trees and roofs. I have trimmed some plants to make space for a chair, and my arms are stinging from scratches. 

It’s a small garden in London, where plants have to grow tall or spread out to survive. My upstairs neighbor, Jaz, leans out of her window and comments on my gardening. She is a writer with several unpublished works, and I sometimes help her with them as an English teacher. I have her latest manuscript with me. I ask her how her writing is going, and she complains about how people always ask her about her work. 

Jaz offers to bring me a drink, but I don’t want her in the garden because it looks messy. She knocks on my door and comes in, joking about my holiday. She sits in the chair while I put a cushion on what used to be a small lawn. She talks about how writers don’t have holidays like teachers do. I feel anxious about the empty days of summer ahead, thinking about lonely walks to the shops and sitting alone in the park.

I mention that I’m going to Stonebridge tomorrow and ask Jaz to feed my cats. She agrees, knowing she will be around. I tell her I’ll be staying with my oldest friend, Ruby, at a place called the Rising Sun, but that’s not true. I often deal with fiction in my life. Jaz then asks about her manuscript, ""The Cruelty of Red Vans,"" which I haven’t read much of. I tell her I like the title and explain how red vans can be cruel by bringing gifts to others but not to her.

I decide to give her some advice. I suggest she write about nice people for a change, instead of focusing on herself. Jaz reacts strongly, saying she keeps a journal where she writes something good about each day. My suggestion sounds old-fashioned, and she tells me to get a life. I do have a life; I work, go out sometimes, and read on the tube. 

When we finally go inside, my calm kitchen makes me feel better. Suddenly, I remember my old geography teacher, Miss Tarrantine, who used to wink at us and say, ""I've had my moments."" We all found it funny."
CPE_6,"**Heritage**

Heritage is important because it connects people and communities to their past. We often feel connected to our personal heritage, knowing about our grandparents and hearing stories about their lives. However, there is also a need to learn about our broader history to understand our future, both as individuals and as a nation. Heritage helps us feel a sense of continuity; knowing about the past can give us confidence about the future. Just like we inherit our genes, we also inherit a culture that has been passed down through generations. There may be parts of our national heritage that we do not like, but it is still a part of who we are, and it can be comforting to feel connected to something larger. Heritage teaches us a lot and is essential for our well-being, influencing everything from our customs to our material culture. 

In the past, we learned about our heritage through stories and legends from our ancestors. However, in modern society, many of these oral traditions have been lost due to the breakdown of communities and families. Now, we often rely on places and buildings to remind us of our past. It is very important to preserve these connections as a way to honor our ancestors' identities.

**The Fens**

Some time ago, I started writing a novel called *Waterland*, where the landscape of a region in England called the Fens became very important. People often ask me why I, as someone from London, chose to write about a place I have no personal connection to. The simple answer is that I found the Fens interesting because they seemed like a flat and empty space for my story. However, I learned that the Fens are not flat or empty at all. They are uniquely English but also strangely different. It is surprising that there is a place in the middle of England that many people find foreign, especially since many other unique areas of Britain have become part of the national culture. The Fens are both empty and full, cultivated and wild, seemingly simple yet deeply mysterious. 

While writing my novel, I did not explore the Fens extensively. I have never visited places like Wisbech or Prickwillow. As a fiction writer, I prefer to create imagined worlds rather than seek strict evidence. However, trying to imagine the Fens has its own logic, as they are not just a landscape but also a way of thinking.

**Museums**

Museums need to make their collections easy to access. In the past, this meant just putting items in display cases with long labels that were hard for most people to understand. Today, accessibility should mean more than that. Displays can be engaging and use creative techniques to attract visitors and evoke emotions. Museums should also reach out to the community. For example, some museums provide loan boxes of objects for teachers, and they have started offering similar materials for elderly people with memory loss. 

Museums focus on real objects, not replicas. They exist to provide a genuine experience with history. They show items that were used and had meaning at some point in time. This is their strength and what sets them apart from heritage centers, theme parks, books, and digital media. Museums that meet this challenge and create exciting displays and outreach programs will find that their competitors in ""virtual history"" can actually help them by increasing interest in real historical experiences.

**Architecture and Environment**

The desire to preserve things is not new, but changes in our towns happen quickly and on a large scale, affecting many people. This can make some people very focused on preservation and encourage others to think more about the nature of our towns today and their future. People who have lived through significant events, like world wars, may feel a stronger need to preserve things because stability becomes important to them. If there is a psychological need for preservation, planners should consider it. Change is not a problem if we learn how to manage it. Changes in our towns reflect social changes, such as population growth, welfare, and our needs."
CPE_33,"**Einstein**

If you stop someone on the street and ask them to name a scientist, they will likely say Albert Einstein. His image is often used to sell products that seem smart, like computers and encyclopedias. Most people know little about what Einstein actually did, except that he created some complex theories called 'relativity'. These theories are famous for being hard to understand and for making strange predictions that seem to go against everyday experiences.

Einstein was part of a major change in scientific thinking, which started the development of modern science in the twentieth century. Physicists and mathematicians were trying to find a new and clearer way to describe the universe by studying how matter and natural forces interact. Einstein made important contributions by rethinking the basic ideas of time, space, matter, and energy. Before him, scientists followed Isaac Newton's idea that stars and planets moved in a fixed space and time. Einstein changed this idea, saying that time and space are not fixed but relative.

**Young Readers**

When we were children, Lydia and I did not trust any book that won awards because we thought they would be boring. Our mother often criticized us for this attitude, but our father would give us small coins as rewards for reading certain books. He would also include some better books in our Christmas and birthday gifts, marked with a note saying, 'This Book is NOT Literature'. Although we often thought these were 'boys' books', he did introduce us to some shorter, good stories and even a famous collection of poems.

**Language**

Jacob Grimm wrote in 1851 that the origin of human language is a secret and amazing topic. This secret has led to many strange ideas. For example, Charles Caller suggested in 1928 that early humans made sounds like ""meuh"" when they felt danger. This sound is sad. Early humans, who lived in dangerous places with wild animals, made desperate sounds, and some of these sounds are still present in words today, like ""malaria,"" which means ""fever,"" or the Latin word ""mors,"" which means ""death.""

Many people avoided discussing the origin of language because they thought it was silly, but recently, studying how language began and evolved has become very important. Language likely started in East Africa about 100,000 years ago. At first, speech was mainly used for friendly communication and was important in struggles for power. Sharing information was probably not the main purpose of early language, which goes against the ideas of philosopher John Locke, who believed language was mainly for sharing knowledge."
CPE_20,"**Writing Reviews**

Frank Kermode looks at how to write reviews from the perspective of someone who does it. Most reviews are written quickly and do not last long. There are strict deadlines and limits on how long they can be. Once published, they are only relevant for a short time—usually a day, a week, or at most a month. Because of this, many people think that writing reviews is not very important. Often, both the public and the writers believe that people only write reviews for money or because they cannot spend all their time on a novel or serious book.

However, writing reviews is a skilled job that requires different abilities. Writing a short review of six or eight hundred words for a newspaper is different from writing a longer review of six or eight thousand words for an international journal. A review in a weekly magazine, which is about fifteen hundred words, has challenges from both short and long formats. 

Reviewers must also think about their audience. Some readers may only skim the review, while others are more interested and want to read a detailed article. Additionally, a reviewer needs to know a lot about various topics and write in a way that intelligent readers can understand and enjoy. This means that most reviewers also write other things besides reviews.

The American novelist John Updike, who does not think highly of criticism, still writes reviews between his novel-writing. He collects all his reviews, no matter how short, into books with modest titles. Some might think that less famous writers should accept that their reviews will not last long, but it is understandable if they want their work to be remembered, especially if they believe some of their best writing is in those reviews.

I feel this way about my own work. My main job has been in academia, and my serious books are academic in nature, which is what professors are expected to write. However, in the English-speaking world, there is no strict separation between reviewing and literary study, so it is common for the same people to do both. 

The time has passed when academics criticized professors for writing reviews, thinking it was a waste of time or not dignified. Complaints from non-professors about professors taking opportunities away from them are also less common now. This is partly because there are many more reviews being written today, allowing more people to participate, and partly because the rewards for writing reviews are often small.

I believe this situation is good for both readers and professors. Readers can trust that reviewers have some knowledge of the subject, and for professors, writing reviews helps them stay connected to the public. It also reminds them that they need to communicate clearly with non-professors. While they may use complex language when talking to each other, they should make sure to be understandable when addressing a wider audience.

In conclusion, despite its challenges, reviewing is often a secondary job. You can only do it well if you are also doing something else well."
CPE_40,"Ralph unlocked the door to his apartment and, as he stepped into the dark hallway, he felt a brief sense of ownership. Even after three years, this feeling sometimes surprised him when he returned home alone at the end of the day. When he first bought the flat, he would come back eagerly, wondering what had happened while he was away. The flat felt like a welcoming place, a space where he could be himself. He thought he should worry about things like break-ins or leaks, but his flat always seemed to be waiting for him, either looking tidy or a bit messy, depending on how he had left it.

Over time, Ralph began to see his flat as an extension of himself, a place where his thoughts and feelings spilled out. He grew frustrated with its inability to change. There were always a few letters piled up by the door and the answering machine blinking when he returned. He was thankful that nothing had been broken or stolen, but he often wondered what it would be like if something did happen.

From his small, dull office on the third floor, Ralph looked forward to his quiet evenings at home. After leaving the busy office, he felt a bit more like himself on the bus ride home. However, he often realized that he didn’t want to be alone, even though he thought he did. At his desk, he craved solitude and time to himself, but once he escaped, he felt empty. This loneliness made him think that his job, which he didn’t enjoy, was changing him and pulling him away from who he really was.

As the night went on, he would read or listen to music, but he started to question why he did these things. His thoughts became unclear, and he struggled to connect his feelings and ideas. He remembered a time when he felt more in control of his life. He had wanted to improve himself but found that he only wanted to get by. He applied for jobs that his friends talked about, following them as they moved forward, unable to see how he could find happiness in his work.

He went to one job interview, feeling grateful just to have a conversation with Neil, the boss. He didn’t think to consider if the job was right for him. Neil offered him the job immediately, saying he was the only graduate who had applied. Ralph took this as a compliment at the time, even if he didn’t fully understand what it meant for his future."
CPE_45,"**Goat Racing**

I was about to see goat racing on Easter Monday in Buccoo Village. I pushed my way through ice-cream vans, large crowds, food stalls, and loud music. Even though everyone was moving towards the racecourse, I tried to find a good spot to watch. An area was blocked off to create a course for the goats. It wasn’t as fancy as real racecourses, but it was similar because people stood on both sides of a stretch of ground where the goats would run. It was a challenge to keep a few selected goats in line, especially since goats are known for eating almost anything they find.

**Canoe Trip**

As the day ended, I started to worry about the night ahead. The canoe was too wet to sleep in, there were no places to stop, and we hadn’t seen any villages or huts since early morning. In the dim moonlight, we used our flashlight to see the cliffs, but the flashlight batteries were dying. We changed the batteries, but they didn’t work. We realized we wouldn’t find a place to camp. A few miles later, Lesley shouted that she saw a distant light, and we felt hopeful. But the light was just the moon shining on the waves. Soon, we heard the loud sound of rushing water, but we couldn’t see what was happening. We kept moving forward.

**How to Be Presentation Perfect**

I am not great at making presentations, but as the managing director, I often have to present to my colleagues and major shareholders. How can I get better at presenting and feel more confident? You are not alone. Giving a presentation requires different skills than running a company, but many senior executives need to be good at it. If you want to convince your audience, you must believe in what you are saying. Show your belief with passion and enthusiasm during your presentation. This means you need to prepare well. Test your ideas beforehand and ask colleagues to help you think of difficult questions your audience might ask. You should also create a positive atmosphere from the start. Begin with something everyone can relate to and gradually lead to the conclusion you want to reach."
CPE_64,"Some activities cannot be rushed; they take the time they need. For example, if you are late for a meeting, you can hurry. But if you are impatient with mayonnaise and add the oil too quickly, it will not turn out right. Similarly, if you pull on a tangled fishing line in frustration, the knot will only get tighter. The mind also works at different speeds. Some tasks are done very quickly, while others take longer—seconds, minutes, hours, days, or even years. We can speed up some processes, like solving crossword puzzles or doing math, but others cannot be rushed. If we try to hurry them, they may fail, just like the mayonnaise or the fishing line.

Sometimes, the idea of ""think fast; we need results"" is not helpful. We learn and think in different ways, and these ways work at different speeds. There are three main processing speeds of the mind. The first is faster than thought. In some situations, we need to react instantly without thinking. For example, when I lost control of my motorbike on a wet road, my body reacted quickly to keep me safe, and only later did I realize what happened. This quick reaction can be called our ""wits.""

The second speed is actual thinking, where we analyze problems, weigh options, and create arguments. For instance, a mechanic figuring out why a car won’t start or a student working on an assignment uses this type of intelligence, which we often call ""intellect."" People who are good at solving these problems are seen as ""bright"" or ""clever.""

The third speed is slower and less focused. It is more relaxed and can be playful or dreamy. In this state, we might think deeply or reflect on things. For example, sitting on a rock by the sea, listening to the waves, or drifting between sleep and wakefulness puts us in a different mental space than when we are planning a meal or writing a letter. This slower way of thinking is just as important as the faster ones. Taking time to think slowly is essential, especially when life gets busy. 

Some everyday problems are better solved with a slow mind. Complex situations often require a relaxed approach. Research shows that patient, less deliberate thinking is effective for understanding complicated issues. Deliberate thinking works well for clear problems, like deciding where to go on holiday. But when the situation is unclear or complicated, we need to use our slower thinking. 

For example, if we are trying to manage a difficult team at work or deciding whether to change careers, it might be better to take time to think rather than rush for answers. This slower type of intelligence is linked to creativity and wisdom. Poets and philosophers have long understood the limits of fast, deliberate thinking and have encouraged slower, deeper ways of knowing. Recently, scientists have begun to study these slower thinking processes. The field of cognitive science is showing that our unconscious mind can handle many complex tasks if given enough time. It can recognize patterns that our conscious mind might miss and solve complicated issues more effectively than quick thinking."
CPE_29,"**Surviving in a Foreign Land**

I have been welcomed warmly in a very isolated place. There are about forty people here, including scientists, students, and weather experts, all living together as a close community. My basic French is enough to communicate, but I struggle to have casual conversations. I miss the small details in conversations, and my phrasebook doesn’t help much during breakfast. This isn’t a big problem, but at first, I felt unsure of myself. I was nervous about mealtimes, unsure of which table to sit at, and worried about the silence when I spoke. I felt anxious, like I did in the early weeks of school. I still smile awkwardly or feel panicked when people talk to me. I think my occasional sadness comes from losing the confidence I usually have when I can talk easily.

**Elliot**

When I first met Elliot, I was just a young writer, and he didn’t pay much attention to me. He remembered faces, though, and when we met, he would shake my hand politely but didn’t seem interested in getting to know me better. If I saw him at the opera with someone important, he would often ignore me. However, when I became successful as a playwright, I noticed that Elliot started to treat me differently. One day, he invited me to lunch, and I thought he was testing me. After my success, I made many new friends and began to see him more often.

**Alfred Hitchcock**

The famous film director Alfred Hitchcock always said that he didn’t care much about the story or the acting in his films. Instead, he focused on the visuals and the sound. For Hitchcock, it was not the message or the acting that moved the audience; he believed that people react to the film itself, no matter their background. So, if a film is made well, people in Japan should react the same way as people in India. Hitchcock was very clear and logical about his work. He was a genius who loved to see audiences react strongly. He didn’t focus on complicated ideas or deep meanings, and he didn’t explore his characters in a complex way. He concentrated on the pure experience of film and how it can affect an audience."
CPE_57,"**Amateur Astronomy**

Astronomy has changed a lot in the last fifty years. Until about thirty years ago, there were not many charts and catalogues available. Telescopes were limited, and there were few books on practical astronomy. Today, you can find many types of telescopes and equipment that meet almost every need. Electronic calculators and computers have improved the production of almanacs and charts, making it easier to analyze observations and publish results. This could be seen as the best time for amateur astronomy. However, some things have also been lost. Now, you might have to travel 80 kilometers to find a dark sky, which was easier to find in cities fifty years ago. Daytime skies are often filled with trails from airplanes, which can last for hours and create clouds, making it hard to observe the sun and stars at night.

**Too Much Choice**

Today, people have too many choices. There are too many things to do and too many options available. In our modern economy, the desire for new products and services has become an addiction, and technology speeds up this change. New products come out quickly, and just as you get used to one, another one is already on the way. This can be overwhelming and tiring, leading to a feeling of disconnection from life. While choice is important in our economy, having too many choices can cause stress, take up time, and make life more complicated. Because of this, many people are looking for ""simplexity"" – the simple things that bring meaning to our complex lives. However, simplifying life is not easy in a world full of excess. There are more brands of detergent and breakfast cereals than we really need, and more software updates and plans than we can keep track of.

**McAndrews Hotel**

Every summer, my family spends two weeks at McAndrews Hotel in North Mayo, Ireland. This tradition started with my grandmother and has become very important to us. Nothing can interrupt this ritual. We are a special group of guests at McAndrews: old-fashioned and perhaps a bit snobbish. I dislike the rude behavior of shop assistants that some people see as equality today. I also do not like the overly friendly waiters who seem to struggle to keep from being too familiar. I know the names of many other guests, as they have been coming here since childhood like me. However, I appreciate that when I see them in the hotel, we only exchange polite greetings without any need for deeper conversation. This respect for personal space and dignity is hard to find in hotels these days."
CPE_9,"**Othello**  
A great production of Shakespeare's play *Othello* has moved from Stratford to London. I want to correct an unfair review I wrote when the show first opened last spring. At that time, I said that Ray Fearon was too young for the title role and I criticized his acting. I still believe that changing the age difference between Othello and Desdemona is a mistake, but I take back my negative comments about Mr. Fearon's amazing performance. The entire cast is excellent. Some unforgettable scenes include the one where Cassio's games with other young officers become dangerous, and the moment when Iago starts to lose control and struggles to regain it. I challenge anyone not to be moved to tears during the scene where Emilia helps Desdemona get ready for bed. The pace and tension throughout the play are fantastic. Don’t miss this production.

**Lake Vostok**  
In the middle of Antarctica, there is nothing alive. On the edges of the continent, you can find many penguins, seals, and birds. But in the deep interior, life does not exist—except for a large hidden body of freshwater called Lake Vostok, which is under nearly 4 kilometers of ice, right below the coldest place on Earth. This water has been cut off from air and sunlight for up to 25 million years. Biologists are eager to explore its mysterious depths and find out what strange organisms might be there. Geologists and glaciologists are also interested. For two years, researchers around the world have been planning ways to uncover the secrets of the lake, and if they succeed, we will see a lot of discoveries about Lake Vostok in the coming years.

**Scientists**  
Last week, I heard something interesting on the radio. A group of scientists is discussing what motivates them to be scientists. The phrase ""because it's there"" comes to mind. We all know that the search for knowledge is important, and we want to understand everything from atoms to black holes. But these scientists want to know why we have this desire for knowledge and why science cannot explain this desire. I think it is more important to focus on whether what scientists do is right, rather than getting stuck in debates about the purpose of science. The key issue is not why we pursue science, but to understand that science is a tool, and we should decide how, where, when, and why to use it."
CPE_42,"**Food**  
Our relationship with food is very important and satisfying. Many people who enjoy cooking buy cookbooks like this one. However, we often think that cooking is only worth it for special occasions or complicated dishes. This is not true. For example, if you chop some carrots, a leek, celery, and herbs and boil them in water, you can make a delicious soup. This is much more rewarding than buying a pre-made soup. Instead of buying a sweet chocolate mousse filled with preservatives, you can make a tasty dessert in just five minutes that both adults and children will enjoy. Cooking is also a way to show care and love by sharing your food with others. Sharing meals is important to our human needs, which is why we celebrate events like birthdays and anniversaries around the table. No one would choose to have takeout for a wedding or anniversary party, and few would want to discuss business over canned soup.

**In the Elevator**  
This morning, Alistair tried to clean up his office, but papers were still everywhere. Tax forms and other documents were piled in drawers and boxes, waiting for a day when he would feel like organizing them. He also had many books and journals that were close to new bookshelves. As the elevator took him to his floor, he knew Mallory would arrive on time for their meeting. She would knock on his office door exactly at the hour. She was very strict about time and cleanliness. He wondered how she would react to the mess. She might think someone had broken in. He could walk in after her and pretend to be shocked. Mrs. Wilson, his cleaning lady, had come while he was trying to clear some space on the floor. When he peeked out of his office as she was unlocking his apartment, he smiled at her, hoping she would help. But she looked at him with a hard expression and thought, ""No way am I going in there,"" before disappearing into her own space, which she was responsible for. He knew Mrs. Wilson saw him as someone from a different world, not from her familiar Brooklyn streets.

**KAREN**  
Karen had a simple wish: she did not want to be like her mother. This desire led her to create her own story, one of strength and difference. In her story, there were important moments, like when she was twelve years old and her brother accidentally hit her in the eye with a golf club. At first, she thought she would go blind, but the bone protected her, as the doctor later confirmed. The club had missed her eye, and she only needed a few stitches that healed over time. When she opened her eyes in the doctor's office and saw her mother talking about miracles and small blessings, she realized she was saved for a reason.

**Miss Fogerty**  
Miss Fogerty was both excited and sad as she walked back to her duties across the wet grass of the village green. It was thrilling to be the first to know something important in a small community, where her life was usually quiet. However, she felt deep sadness for Dr. Bailey's health. He had been her doctor for many years, and she appreciated his care during her yearly throat problems, which were her only health issues. Miss Fogerty valued his ability to make patients feel like there was always enough time to talk about their worries. This quality made him very loved in the village. He was always willing to share his time, knowledge, and humor, and in return, he received great loyalty and affection from the people."
CPE_59,"**Joanna's Lessons**

Joanna MacGregor is a busy concert pianist, but she has also started writing books for young children who want to learn the piano. Her performances are exciting and impressive, and even those who don’t know much about music can enjoy them. At a recent concert for kids, one boy asked her if she could play ""Match of the Day."" This surprised many concert pianists, but Joanna found it funny. She realized that, in the boy's eyes, she needed to play that song to be considered a real pianist.

Joanna is different from many famous pianists because she cares about how children learn music. She has just published a beginner piano book called ""Joanna MacGregor's Piano World,"" even though she has a very busy schedule. This summer, she is performing at many festivals and working with young composers and artists. She also runs her own recording label called Sound Circus. Joanna loves collaborating with other artists, but she believes that teaching young children is very important.

She thinks the first lessons in music are crucial. Many music teachers focus on talented children, but Joanna believes that most people enjoy music in a more everyday way. She remembers teaching beginners when she was younger and how many children came to her home to learn piano from her mother. She wants to make music accessible to everyone, not just those with exceptional talent. 

Joanna believes that just like everyone should learn to swim or speak a little French, everyone should try to learn the piano. Some children learn quickly, while others take their time and sometimes give up. This can happen at any stage. Some kids find the beginning too hard, while others feel pressured to perform like the talented children they see on TV. Joanna worries that some parents use music to push their children to achieve rather than letting them enjoy it. 

When asked if she thinks other piano teaching books are not good enough, Joanna is careful not to criticize them. She acknowledges that her books are colorful and fun, but they are not the only ones available. To make learning enjoyable, she includes stories in her books and CDs. She believes that learning should be fun and encourages children to improvise and explore the piano.

As children progress, they need to learn to read music instead of just playing by ear. Joanna understands this challenge because she relied on her ear when she was young. However, she believes that practice is the most important part of learning. She knows it can be hard to get children to practice, but she encourages them to set goals and enjoy the process. 

Joanna suggests that whether you practice for twenty minutes or five hours, it’s important to know what you want to achieve. She also recommends rewarding yourself by playing through a piece, even if you make mistakes, and mixing difficult pieces with easier ones."
CPE_54,"**Writing by Hand and on Screen**

Dr. Johnson believed that ""what is written without effort is usually read without pleasure."" This means that good writing takes hard work. When I look back at my handwritten school essays, I notice that they had very few mistakes. Today, I would rewrite them many times. I think this is because writing by hand was physically challenging. The slow pace of writing helped me think carefully. When using a computer, it is easy to make mistakes. Many writers find that the time they spend fixing mistakes on a computer is about the same as the time they would have spent writing by hand. 

Also, emails, unlike handwritten letters, can feel less personal. Many people now write love letters through email, which is a good thing. At least these emails are written in some form of English and grammar. However, words on a screen can feel dull. Writers often do not realize the power of writing and may exaggerate their messages. Words typed quickly can lack the care and personality of handwriting.

**The CD**

I put down my cup and looked at the CD. The case was not impressive, but the shiny disc inside looked interesting. ""Wonderful little things, aren't they?"" Mr. Warriston said as he entered the room. I agreed and carefully handed the disc to him. ""It's amazing how they can fit seventy minutes of music on these,"" he said, turning on the music player. Lights turned on, and he pressed a button to open a small drawer. He placed the disc inside and closed it again. ""Some people say they sound cold, but I think they..."" 

""Do you have to turn them over like records?"" I asked. 

""What? No,"" Mr. Warriston replied, surprised. ""You only play one side."" 

""Why?"" I asked. He looked confused and then thoughtful. ""You know, I have no idea. I don't see why both sides couldn't be played to double the capacity..."" He stared at the machine. ""You could use two lasers or just turn it over by hand... hmm."" He smiled at me. ""Yes, good point."" He nodded toward my wooden chair. ""Anyway, come on, let's get you sitting in the best spot for the stereo effect, okay?"" I smiled, happy to have asked a technical question that Mr. Warriston could not answer.

**Books vs. Electronic Text**

Malcolm Bradbury made a good point when he said that if matches had been invented after cigarette lighters, we would have been amazed by the improvement. Many people believe that electronic text is a change as important as the invention of printing, but they forget that real changes in how we think take a long time. 

For example, a book from 1979 predicted that by the 1980s, traditional books would slowly disappear. So far, this has not happened. Reading long texts on a screen is often frustrating, so many people avoid it. Computers encourage people to read only parts of texts. Some people claim that this leads to new ways of storytelling, but many books have always been read in a non-linear way. What is new is that computers do not encourage reading a text from start to finish.

**The Office**

Charles walked into the office and saw a perfectly organized space. The carpet was clear of papers, and the dark wooden desk looked just as it did when he bought it at an auction five weeks ago. Neat file holders were being put away, and twelve years of trade journals filled one wall. Kathleen struggled to close the filing cabinet and then turned to him. ""You have to use computers, Charles. This is too much work.""

""Hello, Kathleen. This is amazing,"" he said, admiring the room and its antique furniture. He was not thinking about computers or any machines in the office. ""Simply amazing,"" he said, avoiding the topic of computers. They had discussed this many times over the two years they had known each other. She could never understand why he resisted technology, even though he was skilled with computers and had published an important paper about them. She had inspired that paper. Through her keyboard skills, she could create new software that could do amazing things."
CPE_32,"""You don't take sugar, do you?"" shouted his secretary. She was not really asking; she was stating a fact because she had been making coffee for Lancelot for many months. She often forgot small details because he was not usually supposed to be there. However, he had started to come to work all the time, realizing that staying away only caused more problems. He thought about how he had gone from being a respected advisor, meeting authors and playwrights for lunch, to being overwhelmed with work and struggling to find parking in the mornings.

""This came,"" she yelled, waving a manila folder before placing it in front of him. ""From that guy in Los Angeles. You said you wanted to see it."" The label on the folder read: ""A World History of the Short, by Ian Cuthbert,"" and below it said ""An Expanded Synopsis."" Lancelot did not like the word ""synopsis."" He wanted to see a label that said ""A First Draft."" He had already seen a synopsis of this book and did not want to see another one, even if it was revised. Ian Cuthbert had received a large advance for this book when Lancelot had bought the company. Ian was one of Lancelot's old friends, and he was a clear example of how some authors become even more unpredictable when they are given money to write.

Lancelot skipped the introduction he had read many times and looked at the synopsis. He recognized almost every phrase. He closed the folder and pushed it aside. Clearly, Ian's manuscript would not be ready anytime soon. The synopsis lacked the brilliance that Ian was known for, and it felt like it was missing something important. Lancelot remembered a famous author whose last book was published after his death, but that author had been paid little by little for each chapter. In Ian's case, he had received a huge advance, which went against the usual rule that authors must deliver a manuscript before getting paid.

Lancelot, who had studied modern languages at Oxford, remembered when Ian Cuthbert was seen as a great talent in Cambridge. Ian's peers had aimed to take over British theatre, and they succeeded quickly. But Ian seemed less motivated than them. He wore his overcoat like a cape and talked about famous French writers as if he had been there. Yet, for some reason, Ian's creative talent remained hidden. While less talented people succeeded, Ian withdrew even more. At the height of his influence, he was very hard to work with. He was supposed to edit a magazine about the arts, but it never got published, wasting a lot of money. His contract with a fashion magazine also led to stories about how much he was paid, but he still produced very little.

At editorial meetings, Ian would criticize others' ideas sharply. Ten years later, he was so unreliable that Lancelot thought ""A World History of the Short"" had been a mistake from the beginning."
CPE_65,"**England's Breakfast Revolution**

Health experts agree that a good breakfast is very important. However, in history, breakfast is a relatively new idea in England. In medieval times, breakfast was rarely mentioned in literature. There are some mentions of travelers eating a meal at dawn before long journeys and sick people having breakfast for health reasons, but most people did not eat breakfast unless they were kings or nobles.

In the sixteenth century, breakfast started to become common for everyone, not just the rich. Some writers believe this change happened because food became more available. However, they may not have considered other important social changes. For example, new work patterns meant that more people had jobs with set hours, often starting very early in the morning. As a result, eating breakfast became necessary for many people and was no longer just for those with high social status."
CPE_61,"**Photography**  
When a photographer takes a picture, they choose what to show based on their skills, personal views, and experiences, as well as social and cultural influences. In this book, we will explore how these factors affect the style, content, and meaning of a photograph, and how viewers understand and react to these images. For instance, a casual reader of a newspaper usually understands the photographs printed in it. However, instead of just accepting the photograph as it is, we can ask if it truly shows what happened at that moment. Does it reflect the photographer's opinion? Is the exact moment captured important, or should we see the photograph as a symbol of a situation in the world?

**More than a Game**  
For me, sports are more than just a game. The most successful athletes have strong self-belief. To succeed in sports, you need to focus completely on your goal. There is only one way to be the best, and you must set aside everything else. Sports can be harsh, and no one will do the hard work for you. It’s a matter of survival. Sports have taught me discipline and determination, but they also show the importance of teamwork. My sport allows me to shine individually, but it is still a team effort, and I must balance both. This is similar to life – you can achieve personal success, but you should always remember the people around you. Sports have given me a lot, not just money. They have opened doors for me and shown me things in the world that many will never experience. However, you also have to sacrifice a lot to enjoy these benefits.

**Tuning In**  
Some experiences are so clear in our memory that they stand out. For me, one special moment happened many years ago in California when I lay awake listening to a mockingbird singing beautifully from a tree in my neighborhood. I don’t have trouble sleeping, but the bird's amazing song kept me awake. As I listened to its complex melodies, I felt like I was in a beautiful musical world. To understand the bird's patterns, I drew on my knowledge of jazz and Indian classical music. The bird made me feel like I was enjoying an incredible live performance. I reacted with joy and surprise as the bird created one surprising musical variation after another through my open window, until I finally fell asleep."
CPE_52,"Text: 

Human culture has always had strong feelings about birds. But what does this say about us? Paul Evans reports. 

In a greenhouse, a little brown bird called a wren is bumping against the glass. This bird is often seen as a sign of something important. Is it trying to send a message, or is it just trapped? Depending on how you look at it, both could be true. 

Wrens have been part of British culture for a long time. In medieval times, people believed that the direction in which wrens flew could predict their luck. Today, images of wrens can still be found in many British homes. Even if old beliefs about them have faded, people still care about wrens. A place without wrens feels empty. 

This connection to birds comes from a time when people relied more on nature for survival. They developed a way to understand the importance of other creatures. However, these beliefs can change over time. 

For example, the red kite bird was once admired in London for taking bread from children. It was seen as a valuable part of the city. But soon, people began to see it as a pest, and it almost disappeared from many areas. Over time, the red kite became a symbol of conservation in Britain, and efforts were made to protect and reintroduce it. 

Our relationship with birds goes back to the early days of humanity. The first birdwatchers paid close attention to birds because they could warn of danger or changes in the environment. Birds also connected people to their dreams. 

When we think about why birds matter to us, we are also thinking about our own identity. Birds represent flight, song, and freedom, which reflect our desires and feelings. Some people might think these feelings are outdated, but they are still part of who we are. Losing this connection would be difficult. 

Recently, birds have become important indicators of environmental health. In Britain, 30 bird species are now endangered, which is sad not only because we are losing these birds but also because we are losing part of our culture. Birds like the skylark, turtle dove, and lapwing symbolize love and magic in literature. Losing them is a loss we feel deeply. 

However, we often ignore the loss of other birds that are not part of stories or folklore. Folklore is important because it connects us to the past through stories and legends. These stories create a stronger bond with birds than scientific facts do. 

Whether we watch birds on TV or in our backyards, the joy we feel cannot be fully explained by science. Birds engage us in ways we find hard to understand. The wren in the greenhouse connects our present with a rich history, holding onto the past while moving into the future—a mystery that keeps us curious."
CPE_28,"**Maps**

The main purpose of a map is to show the relationships between different points and features on the Earth's surface. These relationships are based on distance and direction. In the past, people often measured distance in terms of time, like ""a few hours' walk"" or ""a day's journey by river."" This way of measuring was more about how easy it was to travel through the land than about the actual distance. 

Direction is also important, but for most travelers, the main questions were ""Where do I go from here?"" and ""How far away is it?"" Because of this, written directions were often just as important as maps. Even today, some maps, like those for train systems, do not always show true directions. In the past, important landmarks along a route were marked by signs, which could be realistic or simple symbols, and their size showed how important they were. 

Different maps used different conventions based on their purpose and location, so it is important to understand these conventions when studying early maps. The history of map-making, or cartography, is mainly about improving the accuracy of distance and direction and expanding the information included on maps. 

To improve mapping, cartographers have used knowledge from other sciences. For example, instead of finding direction by looking at shadows or stars, they began using the magnetic compass and developed tools to measure angles accurately. As explorers learned more about the world, they tried to create better maps. Astronomers also discovered that the Earth is not a perfect sphere, which led to more precise mapping techniques.

Over time, the needs of map users changed. Travelers and merchants were not the only ones using maps anymore. Soldiers, especially after the invention of artillery, needed accurate maps to understand the land for military purposes. This led to the creation of contour maps. Other professionals, like archaeologists and historians, also had specific needs for maps. 

Today, cartographers create maps for many different purposes, including geological and climate information, as well as land use. The growing recognition of the importance of maps in various sciences has led to a modern revival of cartography. 

However, it is important to note that the development of maps has not always been steady. There have been times of slow progress and times of rapid change, with old ideas sometimes coexisting with new ones. Cartographers have often had to wait for better tools before they could use their new ideas. Since it is easier to copy old maps, and because map publishers may resist change, we should not blindly trust maps as perfect representations of current knowledge and techniques. 

The many maps we have today are the result of significant human effort and thought. They provide a valuable record of human history, making the study of historical cartography both interesting and educational."
CPE_35,"**Simplified Text:**

I was taken into a young man's living room, which was a calm and cultured space compared to the messy rooms where his family members spent time. Moving from the kitchen to his room felt like going from economy to business class. This young man had the biggest collection of records I had ever seen, the first stereo record player I had encountered, and he even owned Georgian wine glasses, pictures, and furniture. His name was Andrew Lloyd Webber. He had received a scholarship to Magdalen College, Oxford, to study history, and he had nine months before starting school. During this time, he wanted to become a famous composer like Richard Rodgers.

I also had big dreams; I wanted to be a pop star for the usual reasons: women, money, and fame. However, my dreams were not as important to me as Andrew's were to him. When Andrew suggested that I try to become a famous lyricist like Oscar Hammerstein, I was open to the idea. This was partly because, within ten minutes of meeting him, he played me three of his own tunes, and I could tell he was very talented.

As he played more songs from the shows he had created at school, I remembered some of the best albums from my parents' collection. He needed a new lyricist, and I didn’t have much to offer except praise for his music and a single I had written with an unknown pop group that had not done well. We agreed to meet again and write something together. I was still more interested in pop music than in musical theatre, but I realized I had met someone with great talent and determination. I thought it would be a mistake to miss the chance to work with someone who was likely to succeed in musical theatre.

The next day, back at my office where I was training to be a lawyer, the excitement I felt about working with Andrew had faded a bit. I planned to keep looking for bands that needed a singer and to write more simple songs. However, it was likely that I would finish my exams and become a lawyer by the time I was twenty-five. My father believed I would lose interest in pop music by then, which worried me because I only had a few months left to enjoy it. Still, I thought it would be fun to see Andrew again, to go to a musical with him, and to write lyrics for musicals instead of pop songs. Andrew was an interesting person who talked about good food and Victorian architecture, and he supported the Leyton Orient football team.

I wasn’t sure about the musical idea he had been working on for a year, but I was open to it. The story was about Dr. Thomas Barnardo, a 19th-century philanthropist who started orphanages. While his story was important, it didn’t excite me much. The main character seemed too perfect, and the idea felt unoriginal, similar to Lionel Bart's famous show, Oliver. However, Andrew was very confident about his music, and his enthusiasm was contagious. I thought, what do I know about musicals? As my future agent David Land often said, if there is one hamburger restaurant on the street, there can be another one too. We could be the second restaurant.

I started working with great enthusiasm, especially on the funny songs. Andrew explained the plot, played me the music, and often gave me the titles, which were likely created by his friend from school. I even skipped a day at the law office, pretending to be sick, to write my first set of lyrics for the musical. I didn’t realize it at the time, but that day marked a change in my career."
CPE_5,"**Language**  
You and I are part of a species that has a special ability: we can influence each other's thoughts with great accuracy. Language is so important in human life that it is hard to imagine living without it. If you see two or more people together anywhere in the world, they will likely start talking to each other. When people are alone, they often talk to themselves, their pets, or even their plants. I like to think of language as an 'instinct.' This means that people know how to speak in a way similar to how spiders know how to spin webs. Web-spinning was not created by a genius spider, and it does not require special education or skills in building.

**Climate and Weather**  
Climate and weather, which are mainly influenced by the air around us, greatly affect the lives of animals and plants. Climate can shape the appearance of landscapes. For example, warm and wet conditions all year round allow tropical jungles to grow, which are full of different species. In contrast, cold and windy areas can only support a few types of living things. The daily weather patterns that create the climate are caused by large air masses rising and mixing, as the atmosphere is always moving. Some of this movement happens because the air rests on a spinning Earth. Since air is light, it does not move at the same speed as the Earth and tends to lag behind. However, the sun is a more important cause of air movement.

**Coffee**  
As a bar-person, my job included serving drinks, but I was also responsible for making coffee. In Lygon Street, Melbourne, a restaurant's success can depend on its coffee. I went through several days of intense training on how to make coffee, learning a lot about cleaning and maintaining the restaurant's shiny espresso machine. I also learned the key principles for making a perfect, rich cappuccino. By the end of the first week, I realized that making good coffee was not as easy as it seemed, and I thought I might have to go back to simpler tasks. Fortunately, my boss was patient. He told me, ""Making coffee is both an art and a science, and you need time to learn how to do it well."""
CPE_41,"**Art on TV**

Why does television often struggle with programs about visual arts? Painting and sculpture are great subjects for the camera because it can show the entire artwork and then zoom in on the details. However, there are very few TV series that successfully show the enjoyment and complexity of these arts. A good example of this problem is Robert Hughes's eight-part series on American art called *American Visions*. Hughes is a respected critic with a strong personality, and he has almost eight hours to introduce British viewers to a type of art that is often ignored in British galleries. I expected the series to focus on famous artworks, but instead, it looked at how American history and culture are shown in its art and architecture.

**Dealing in Metals**

For 20 years, I worked as an international metals dealer and became known as a speculator. The metals market is less regulated than other markets. With some luck, a willingness to take risks, and a good understanding of the market, it is possible to make a lot of money. Taking risks is a normal part of this industry, which fits well with a free-market global economy. However, free-trade economists who believed that the market would keep the prices of scarce metals high have found the opposite is true. More minerals are being extracted, and the prices of raw materials are going down. When considering inflation, the prices of most metals are about half of what they were 20 years ago. Recently, I was asked to investigate claims against a multinational company that benefits from these low raw material prices.

**Extract from a Holiday Brochure**

Abaco and its nearby cays are part of the 700 islands of the Bahamas, which stretch from Florida to Cuba. Each island has its own character and offers something unique. To explore the islands and cays of Abaco, you need a boat. If a boat is not included with your accommodation, don’t worry. There are many ferries and water taxis available. You can also rent boats if you prefer to explore on your own. Sailing is the most popular way to get around here. Abaco is known as 'The Sailing Capital of the World' for good reasons. The calm, protected waters are perfect for fishing, diving, snorkeling, and swimming. The cays and their beaches stretch for 200 miles, looking like a string of pearls. At night, the lights from the restaurants and cafes in Hope Town and Green Turtle Cay shine brightly, adding to the beauty of the area."
CPE_69,"**Build Your Own Bamboo Bike at the UK’s First Workshop**

You can join a course at the Bamboo Bike Club, run by engineers James Marr and Ian McMillan, where you can build your own bike. You will get a custom-designed frame and enjoy a fun weekend of bike-building. 

It’s Saturday morning in Hackney Wick, east London. The only sounds are from machines in the Bamboo Bike Club, the only place in Britain where you can learn to build bamboo bikes. I’m here to see what’s happening. There is a lot of energy and excitement in the air. 

Bamboo is becoming a popular material for bike construction. Companies like Calfee Design from California and Bamboo Bikes from Yorkshire have brought back this method, which has been around since 1894. However, many cyclists find bamboo bikes too expensive. A ready-made bamboo frame can cost around $2,995 or £1,868. This high price is what motivated James and Ian to spend years working in a shed in Brecon, Wales. They wanted to create a bamboo bike business that was affordable for regular cyclists. 

After a lot of research, they realized they didn’t just want to sell bike frames. They wanted to share the joy of making something unique and sustainable. This led to the Bamboo Bike Club, which is more about community than business. Both James and Ian have full-time jobs; James works on wind turbines, and Ian is a civil engineer. 

They offer monthly courses where you can build your own bike frame at a reasonable price. On the first day, they teach you how to choose strong bamboo and how to make strong joints. You start by gluing the bamboo tubes together to form the bike frame. They also use metal tubes for parts that need extra strength, like the handlebars and wheel forks. 

For someone like me, who is not very good at DIY, this can be challenging. James and Ian are always there to help, checking every cut and joint. They encourage everyone, saying it’s okay to make mistakes. If you mess up, just try again with a new piece of bamboo. 

On Sunday, you spend time building the lugs, which are the parts that connect the frame. You wrap the joints with hemp bindings and glue them to make them strong. After adding a waterproof coating, your bike is ready for wheels, brakes, gears, and any personal touches. 

James and Ian say their bamboo bikes are just as strong as metal ones. Ian has been riding his bike for over a year, and James has tested his bike off-road for three months without breaking it. They use thicker tubes and bindings to make the bikes even stronger. 

While bamboo bikes may not look as polished as professional ones, they are unique. I think these bikes are great for relaxed rides rather than racing. I choose a 'Classic English' frame for a comfortable ride. 

I take James’s bike for a test ride, and it feels light and smooth, thanks to bamboo’s ability to absorb bumps. James says the real joy comes when you ride the bike. They are very light and fun to ride. 

And the best part? The price is less than £500."
CPE_38,"**Self-Help Books**

Diane Reverend was an editor at Random House in New York when she first saw a manuscript by an unknown psychologist, Dr. John Gray. She immediately thought it would be a bestseller, and she was right. Dr. Gray became very successful, and Diane started her own company. Dr. Gray's book, which helps people communicate better between genders, is a key part of a growing self-help industry. This industry tries to meet many of Americans' desires for improvement, but it also creates new desires and supports the publishing world in New York. 

In Britain, people are discovering that this genre can produce many books that are not very good, but there are even worse ones. For every self-help book published, many others are rejected because they are too similar or too specific. This is a good thing. As new editors search for the next big hit, the quality of writing is often not a priority. What matters most is how marketable the book is. Diane Reverend lists important questions like: ""How promotable is the author? What's the 'hook'? Is it universal enough?"" She admits that a catchy title can make a big difference in attracting readers.

**Autobiographies**

When someone writes an autobiography, there is an unspoken agreement between the writer and the reader that the truth will be told. However, this agreement is often not fully kept. Writers may leave out things they feel are too shameful or not important enough. Sometimes, they might invent stories that express their truth better than sticking strictly to the facts. They may even label their work as an autobiography just to make readers believe it is true, even if it is mostly fiction. This can happen without any intention to deceive.

**Dashiell Hammett's Detective Stories**

Scholars have studied detective stories and believe they reflect the social conflicts of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. These stories often symbolize deeper human desires like lust or greed, and their resolutions show how society can return to order. In Hammett's stories, society is shown to be corrupt, and the characters often represent different sides of the same personality. The private detective and the criminal understand each other and share a strange connection. The detective is seen as too honest by criminals and too shady by the law. His mission is complicated by his feelings of guilt and his desire for justice.

**Science Writing**

Stephen Jay Gould is considered one of the best science writers today. I met him at the Grand Hotel while he was promoting his new book. Neither of us felt comfortable in such a fancy place. Gould believes that to write well about science, you need to understand the scientific community. If you don’t know its rules, you will struggle. One of his key beliefs is to never talk down to the reader. He advises, ""You can simplify the language but must never change the main idea. If readers feel you are treating them like children, they will lose interest."""
CPE_17,"**Air-conditioning**

At Cannons Gym, a popular place for City of London workers during lunch, the air is very cold. To handle this summer's high temperatures, the gym has used a lot of air-conditioning. Sometimes, it feels like being in the Arctic. This shows how people often misuse air-conditioning today. It has become a common part of our lives, showing how we can control the climate. However, many buildings with air-conditioning could use other ways to stay cool. They could use natural light and fresh air, and have thicker walls that keep heat out during the day and release it at night. These ideas may seem simple, but they can make a big difference and reduce the need for air-conditioning.

**Sundials**

It is interesting that as we start a new millennium, people are becoming more interested in sundials, which are tools that measure time based on the sun's position. A hundred years ago, sundials were important for keeping time accurately. But as clocks and watches improved, sundials became just decorative items in gardens. Now, they are being taken seriously again. David Harber, a maker of sundials, believes their charm comes from their connection to the planets. He says there is a special moment when a sundial starts to work after he delivers it. Sundials are calm and beautiful objects that remind us of our place in the universe.

**Paint Your Own China**

My idea of china-painting came from a visit to an arts and crafts show long ago, where serious-looking older women showed how to paint delicate flowers on teacups. It was fascinating to watch them, as each brushstroke created a perfect petal or leaf. Their hands were steady, and the paint never smudged. I thought these women must have practiced for years or had a special talent. Because of this, I wondered what kind of people would join a china-painting class. Would beginners have any natural talent? However, the atmosphere in the class was friendly and relaxed. Everyone was there to enjoy themselves, and even the teacher did not want to paint as quickly and perfectly as I had remembered."
CPE_47,"**The Wrong Country**

Uncle chose a package holiday for Keith and Dawne at a good price: a flight from Gatwick Airport, twelve nights in Venice, the beautiful city, at the Pensione Concordia. When they went to the travel agency to book, the clerk told them that the other travelers were a school group from the south coast, all learning Italian. But something went wrong. Either at the travel agency, the check-in desk, or in a computer, a mistake happened. Keith and Dawne ended up in a hotel called the Edelweiss, in Room 212, somewhere in Switzerland.

At Gatwick, they gave their tickets to a girl in a yellow-and-red uniform. She checked their tickets and said everything was fine. An hour later, they were surprised to hear older people on the plane speaking with accents from the North of England. Keith thought there might have been a cancellation or that the Italian class was on another plane. They ordered drinks, and then more drinks. 

When they landed, a heavy woman with glasses told them, ""The coach will take us on. Stay together now."" The brochure didn’t mention an overnight stop, but when the coach arrived at its destination, Keith realized that was what was happening. It was close to midnight, and tired from traveling, they didn’t question the beds they were offered. But the next morning, when they found out they were supposed to stay there for their holiday, they became worried.

""The lake and the water birds are here,"" the receptionist said with a smile. ""You can take a boat to Interlaken."" 

Keith calmly told the man, ""There has been a mistake. We were supposed to be in Venice, at the Pensione Concordia."" 

""I don’t know that name, sir. This is Switzerland,"" the receptionist replied. 

""A coach is supposed to take us on. An official said so on the plane,"" Keith insisted. 

""Your group is booked for twelve nights in the Edelweiss Hotel. If you want to change now—"" 

""We haven’t changed our minds. There’s been a mistake,"" Keith said firmly. The receptionist shook his head, saying he didn’t know about any mistake. 

Dawne added, ""The man who made the booking was bald, with glasses and a moustache."" She mentioned the travel agency in London. 

""Is there a problem?"" a woman said cheerfully. She was the same heavy woman Keith had seen at Gatwick. 

""My name is Franks,"" she said. ""I’m married to the man with the bad leg."" 

""Are you in charge, Mrs. Franks?"" Dawne asked. ""We’re in the wrong hotel."" 

Again, Dawne described the travel agency and the bald clerk. Keith interrupted, ""It seems we got into the wrong group. We reported to the Your-Kind-of-Holiday girl and left everything to her."" 

""We should have known when they weren’t from Dover,"" Dawne added, mentioning they heard them talking about Darlington. Keith wished she would let him speak. 

""We noticed you at Gatwick,"" Keith said. ""We knew you were in charge."" 

""I counted you, but you probably didn’t see me,"" Mrs. Franks replied. ""Let me explain. Your-Kind-of-Holiday sends clients to many places, with different holidays at different prices. There are villa holidays for young people, treks to Turkey, and treks for singles to the Himalayas."" 

""What I’m trying to say is that all tickets and labels look similar, yellow with two red bands,"" Mrs. Franks laughed. ""If you just followed others with the yellow-and-red label, you might think you could end up anywhere!"" 

""But we’re not supposed to be in Switzerland,"" Keith insisted. 

""Let’s see,"" Mrs. Franks said suddenly and walked away, leaving them standing there. The receptionist was gone, and they could hear typing. 

""She seems nice,"" Dawne whispered. Keith wasn’t listening. He was trying to remember everything that had happened: giving the tickets, waiting, and then the girl leading them to the plane. 

""Nice to have some young people here,"" an old man said. He and his wife looked like they were in their eighties. They had slept well, thanks to the fresh air by the lake. 

""That’s nice,"" Dawne replied. Keith walked out of the reception area, and Dawne followed him. Outside the hotel, they didn’t say anything about the irony of their situation. On their first holiday since their honeymoon, they had ended up on a package tour with elderly people when they wanted to escape from the needs of older people. Uncle had said so himself when they tried to convince him to join them."
CPE_48,"**HE WAS A PEOPLE PERSON**

American business leaders are looking to the polar explorer Ernest Shackleton as a model for good management. Eluned Price reports.

Most people in Britain know who Sir Ernest Shackleton was and what he did. However, America has only recently discovered him. The Wall Street Journal described Shackleton as ""an Antarctic explorer whose achievements went mostly unnoticed for most of the 20th century,"" which is an exaggeration. Now, Americans are showing great interest in him. Many biographies and stories about his famous voyage on the Endurance are being published, and the American Museum of Natural History is planning a big exhibition. Columbia Tristar is also making a film about Shackleton's life.

Some American managers see Shackleton as a role model. They admire his leadership and communication skills and often refer to each other as ""speaking Shackleton."" Shackleton, known for his determination and resourcefulness, has become an example for modern management consultants. Jim MacGregor, a managing partner at Abernathy MacGregor Frank in New York, has looked up to Shackleton for years. His firm focuses on communication during mergers, acquisitions, and corporate crises.

MacGregor explains that even if a company handles a crisis well, poor communication can still cause problems. He believes Shackleton is a great management model because he had strong values and was at his best when he and his team had a lot to lose, including their lives. One of Shackleton's most interesting decisions was to turn back when he was only 97 miles from the South Pole. This choice showed his commitment to the safety of his men.

In a crisis, people want to know who is in charge. While many managers today avoid responsibility, Shackleton was willing to take charge. His 1914 expedition became legendary when his ship, the Endurance, was trapped in ice for nine months and eventually sank. When the ship went down, Shackleton told his men, ""We should all eventually reach safety if you do your best and trust me."" Throughout the ordeal, it was clear that Shackleton was always in control.

MacGregor notes that Shackleton planned for every situation, kept his men informed, and valued their opinions. He was flexible and willing to change plans if something was not working. Shackleton believed that an explorer needs optimism, endurance, and patience. MacGregor points out that in difficult times, especially in America, people often want quick solutions. However, sometimes it is better to wait and see how things develop.

Shackleton led by example. On the way back from the Endurance, he noticed the expedition photographer, Hurley, without gloves. Shackleton insisted that Hurley wear his gloves, saying he would throw them overboard if he didn’t. He also once offered a biscuit to a starving crew member, saying it was too valuable to leave behind.

As Caroline Alexander, author of ""Endurance,"" says, ""The public's interest in heroic efforts is growing. Shackleton represents the ideals we long for today."""
CAE_15,"**Tapping into a Food Supply**

In the forests of Madagascar, there is a unique primate called the aye-aye. Its way of finding food is similar to that of a woodpecker. Both the aye-aye and the woodpecker search for insect larvae by digging into wood. The woodpecker uses its beak to make holes and its long tongue to get the insects. In contrast, the aye-aye uses its sharp front teeth to chew into the wood and its long third finger to reach inside and scoop out the insects.

Although scientists first described the aye-aye's unusual feeding method over a hundred years ago, they have only recently learned how it finds the insects hidden in the wood. Dr. Carl Erickson from Duke University studied the hunting skills of two male aye-ayes named Nosferatu and Poe, a female named Samantha, and her baby, Annabelle.

Dr. Erickson wanted to see if the aye-ayes could find insects by looking for signs, like holes in the wood where insects might have entered to lay eggs. He gave them logs with narrow holes, some leading to food and others that were empty. The aye-ayes quickly went for the logs with food, showing they did not need to rely on visual signs. They might have been using their sense of smell or hearing, but further tests showed they did not need these senses either. They could find food even when the smell was blocked and when the insects were dead and silent.

So, how did the aye-ayes find the insects? Dr. Erickson found that they could sense the cavities in the wood. When looking for food, an aye-aye taps the wood with its long finger and listens carefully. Dr. Erickson believes the aye-aye uses a method called echo-location, where it listens for sounds that tell it there is a hollow space below. It can also hear insects moving when they are disturbed by the tapping.

The idea that the aye-aye fills the role of woodpeckers in Madagascar is interesting. However, there are also birds like the Sickle-billed and Nuthatch Vangas that look for insects in wood, so the woodpecker role may not be empty. The aye-aye is not only similar to a woodpecker and an echo-locating bat, but it also acts like a squirrel. Its front teeth grow continuously, just like a squirrel's, and it has been seen in the wild chewing through nut shells and using its long finger to get the nut meat inside."
CAE_19,"**Ordinary People, Ordinary Lives**

Many of us have photos of our grandparents, but how many of us really know what their lives were like when they were young? The few diaries we find often do not tell the whole story, and family stories are often only partly remembered. What will our grandchildren know about us? We often plan to write down our stories but never do. We might leave videos instead of photos, but these are still just images. 

Hannah Renier has found a solution: she writes autobiographies for other people. She creates a hardback book of at least 20,000 words, with illustrations if needed. Her focus is on ordinary people, not famous ones. The idea came to her when she spoke with her family and realized how much of the past was being forgotten. 

""When I started, I didn’t take it as seriously as I do now,"" she says. ""I met people who really wanted to share their interesting lives. They often say they are doing it for their children or for future generations, but they enjoy the process too."" 

The promise of confidentiality helps her subjects feel comfortable sharing their stories. One 62-year-old man, who has experienced both success and failure in his life, said, ""I was surprised at what came out. There were painful memories, like my divorce."" He wrote his story for his family but hasn’t let his adult children read it yet because he feels they might be hurt by some details. He thinks it might be better for them to read it after he is gone. 

Hannah has noticed that many people are influenced by their childhood experiences. ""It’s amazing how much people are shaped by their parents,"" she says. ""The things they learned as children can affect them for the rest of their lives. They often repeat the same patterns in their relationships."" 

Many people still feel regret or resentment about unresolved issues with their parents, even many years later. They may try to impress a parent who never seemed impressed, or they might rebel against their parents’ expectations. 

Hannah acts as a recorder rather than a questioner. ""I’m not there to pry into their lives,"" she explains. People sometimes share things and then worry if they should be included in the book. She tells them they can remove anything when they see the draft, but most people want to be honest about their lives. 

This is not about vanity; it’s not just people wanting to show off their interesting lives. In our fast-paced world, we often forget our past. Hannah’s work helps people connect with their roots and gives them a sense of immortality. 

Each book involves up to 30 hours of recorded interviews, which Hannah uses to write the life story, organizing the events and interpreting them. Modern technology helps her create everything except the binding, which has gold lettering. Clients can choose the color and title of their book. 

The final product is well-organized and written, reflecting the life of the person it is about. Each book costs nearly £3,000, with extra copies available for £25 each. Hannah receives about 10 inquiries a week, but the high cost stops many people from going ahead. ""I thought it would be a more affordable product,"" she says. ""But the people I’ve worked with are often from wealthy backgrounds, the kind of people who would have had their portraits painted in the past."""

The Museum of Classical Archaeology has one of the few collections of casts of Greek and Roman sculptures in the world, with over six hundred pieces. It is important to note that none of the sculptures are original; they are all replicas made from the originals, mostly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Museum is located in a specially designed gallery with great natural light. There are many benefits to having plaster casts: sculptures that were originally displayed together but are now in different museums across Europe can be seen together again. You can view almost all the famous works of Greek and Roman sculpture in just one afternoon.

There is a small display in the entrance hall, and the knowledgeable library staff can help with any questions. The photographs cannot be borrowed, but copies can usually be purchased, which take about a month to prepare.

**E. Cambridge Medieval Brass Rubbing Centre**  
The Cambridge Brass Rubbing Centre is the second oldest and longest-running center of its kind in the world, making it a unique tourist attraction. Visitors can enjoy creating wall hangings by rubbing over one of more than a hundred different brass plates from the tombs of medieval knights and ladies. The center has made resin copies, called facsimiles, to preserve the originals while allowing everyone to enjoy brass rubbing. These brass plates were used as memorials and spread from Germany across medieval Europe and Scandinavia. Many beautiful brasses were destroyed during various revolutions, but most of the remaining ones are in Britain, with the widest range available at the Cambridge Centre."
CAE_13,"**From Here to Fatherhood**

**A. The Theatre Director**  
I have had a strange personal life, but I feel lucky to have spent 35 years with small children, and I have loved every moment. This morning, I enjoyed feeding my baby, which is what being a father means to me. I am very fortunate with my children; we all share a love for opera, theatre, books, and music. This has created a strong bond, especially now that they are mostly grown up and I feel more like a friend than a father. I do not believe in physical punishment. I have slapped my children in anger before, but I do not support it. I may not have been the most attentive father, but I have always tried to be there for them. I am available if they need me, but I believe they should reach out to me first. I do not want to make them feel guilty for not contacting me, as my parents did to me.

**B. The Advertising Executive**  
I was quite young, around 25, when my children were born, and I found the responsibilities difficult at times. It made me feel older quickly, but it also kept me young, which I appreciate. As they became teenagers, they introduced me to music, youth culture, and fashion, which helped me stay connected to the world. I missed some important moments, like their first concerts and sports days, and I feel sad about that. However, now I can take them on holidays to places like the south of France, and they enjoy spending time with my friends and attending parties and award ceremonies without feeling out of place. I think my job is seen as exciting, which has helped our relationship.

**C. The Politician**  
My first child was born just as I was starting my political career. My wife and I promised to make time for our children, but as my political work increased, finding time became difficult. I only accept weekend meetings and public events if my children can come with me. This way, they can see what I do when I am not with them, and they do not feel like I am disappearing from their lives. I have noticed that more politicians are bringing their children to work, which shows that we are becoming more aware of the importance of including our kids in our lives.

**D. The Writer**  
My first marriage ended when my daughters, Kate and Bonnie, were young, which made me think more about fatherhood. I worked hard to stay connected with them. My ex-wife and I even tried living next to each other for a while, so they could visit easily, but I think it confused them. Kate has said in interviews that I was always there for her, but I wonder if I was a good father. I was around a lot, but I treated my children like adults too soon. Kate recently said that I was too lenient. I wish I had set more rules and structure. I still worry about my older daughters just as much as I do about my youngest. In that way, being a parent never really ends.

**E. The TV Presenter**  
I was ready for children when I turned 30. I had met my wife, and we had a nice home, so we thought, ""Why not have a child instead of just buying new furniture?"" Having my daughter, Betty, has helped me understand who I am. Creating a child feels very special, but it also makes you just one of many parents. Sometimes I feel frustrated, but a single smile from her can make all my irritation disappear. A baby's smile is incredibly powerful and can soften anyone's heart."

CAE_46,"**Science Defying Gravity**

Journalist Tom Mumford joins students who are using weightlessness to test their ideas. The aircraft looked normal from the outside. The pilot told the 13 students from Europe and America that it was a Boeing KC-135 refueling tanker, built in 1964 and based on the Boeing 707 passenger plane. However, inside, it was very different. The interior was a long white tunnel with few windows and bright lights along the padded walls. Most of the seats were removed, leaving just a few at the back where the nervous students sat.

For a year, these students had competed to take part in this flight, which was organized by the European Space Agency. They had to come up with creative experiments to do in weightless conditions. Those with the best ideas won a spot on this unique flight, which was like an extraordinary roller-coaster ride. 

For the next two hours, the Boeing would fly in a way that felt like a giant bird soaring up and then diving down. The pilot would cut the engines at 3,000 meters, allowing the plane to rise higher for a moment before gravity pulled it back down. During the few seconds between rising and falling, everything inside the aircraft became weightless, and the students would feel as if they were closer to the moon than to Earth.

The flight took off smoothly, but any thoughts of a regular passenger flight disappeared when the pilot put the plane into a steep climb for about 20 seconds. The engines roared, and we felt the blood rush from our heads as we were pushed against the cabin floor. Then, the engines stopped, and we quickly experienced weightlessness. For 20 seconds, we floated in silence, as if the floor had turned into a trampoline. One small step sent us flying towards the ceiling. We floated around, confused about where to go, as up and down lost their meaning.

After ten seconds of freefall, the pilot pulled the plane out of its dive. The return of gravity was sudden, and some students landed hard. After the first curve, some students felt sick at the thought of the 29 more to come. Thirty curves gave us ten minutes of ""space time"" for experiments. The Dutch students studied their robotic cat, Leonardo, to find out how cats always land on their feet. They released a device they built to investigate this, and one student managed to turn it over using a remote control. 

Another student almost landed on it during a rough return to gravity. Meanwhile, a German team from the University of Aachen studied how metal joints are affected by the lack of gravity, which could help in building future space stations. A team from Utah State University worked on creating solar sails from thin liquid films hardened by ultraviolet sunlight. They believe that once perfected, these sails could help satellites use the sun's energy like a yacht uses wind.

After two hours of flying between heaven and Earth, breakfast felt unstable, but the main feeling was excitement, not sickness. This experience would stay with us for a long time. One student said, ""It was unforgettable. I wanted to be an astronaut before, but now I want it even more."""
CAE_3,"**With the Trees, I Planted My Stake in New Zealand**

**JONATHON PORRITT TALKS TO DANNY DANZIGER**

Jonathon Porritt is the author of *Seeing Green - The Politics of Ecology*. 

I had a strange time in my life when I didn’t experience any summers. I went to New Zealand every summer, which was actually winter there. So, I had nine winters in a row, which I enjoyed because I like winter. My parents had the idea to buy a small piece of land for my brother, sister, and me to take care of. My mother said, “If you can take the time to plant trees, then you can have it.” The idea was that we would always have a connection to New Zealand, which is special because my father grew up there. They found a piece of land about 20 miles north of Auckland in a place called Rangitoupuni. The land is not very good, but it is suitable for planting trees. I have always been interested in land. I spent a year in Australia working on sheep farms and doing different farming jobs, so the idea of planting trees excited me, and I was eager to start. My family became enthusiastic as we went along. 

I started planting in 1968, and by the end of 1972, the three of us had planted the entire 70 acres. In New Zealand in 1968, it was a very rainy winter. It’s funny to think of that time as happy because it rained almost every day we were planting. I don’t think I have ever been wetter or colder for such a long time. Every morning was a challenge: getting ready for the next planting session. I would come out of the Land Rover, still warm and dry, but then the rain would start, and my jacket was still damp from the day before. My boots were soaked, and my hands struggled with slippery laces. 

During that first year, I had a helper who was an experienced tree-planter, which was very useful since I had never planted trees seriously before. You wear a planting bag around your neck, filling it with as many trees as you can. When the bag is full, it’s heavy and difficult to carry, but it gets easier as it gets lighter. The hardest part of the job was getting the lines straight. You decide how far apart to plant the trees, then you set up three poles in a straight line. These poles help you keep your planting straight. Once you are in line, you plant all the way down, turn around, and come back. 

I enjoy hard physical work, and it helped me get fit. After a while, you can plant trees almost automatically. You get into a rhythm and use the fewest movements needed to dig a hole. This rhythm is important in many farming jobs. You train your body to do the same movements, making it much easier. You develop a regular process: taking the tree out of the bag, digging a hole, putting it in the ground, stamping it down, and moving on. 

Mentally, it was interesting. My mind started to wander, and I had many thoughts about life and nature. A lot of my ideas about the natural world began during those days. I have returned to New Zealand four times since then and watched the trees grow, which has been very satisfying. I feel a connection to what happens to them. I always worry when I read news about strong winds or droughts in New Zealand. Such news makes me anxious. However, everything turned out well, and those trees are now 20 years old and healthy. 

I should add that I took a break from teaching and went back in 1984 for three months by myself. I wrote my first book, *Seeing Green*, there. There is a simple cabin on the tree farm with just a bed, a table, and a chair. In the mornings, I would write; in the afternoons, I would prune the trees, and in the evenings, I would do research. My connection to that area is still very strong. It is the place I feel most connected to in terms of the bond between people and the earth. It is a powerful connection."
CAE_10,"**Bringing Up Badgers**

""What now?"" was my first thought when one of my helpers brought me a cardboard box. My husband Derek and I have run an open dairy farm in Somerset for six years, and we are known for caring for orphaned animals. But the strange noise from the box—a mix of a cackle and a bark—caught my attention. I looked inside and saw three small grey badger cubs, each about eight inches long. Their soft coats were covered in fleas, and their milky eyes looked up at me from their tiny black-and-white striped heads. I had never seen badger cubs before. Most badgers are born between mid-January and mid-March and live underground. If they are orphaned, they usually die from hunger and are never found. 

These three cubs were brought to me by builders who accidentally disturbed their home while laying drain pipes. Their mother was found dead, with her babies still trying to suckle. I could see the cubs were healthy but cold and whimpering. After removing the fleas, I took them into the farmhouse kitchen and placed them beside the stove for warmth. There were two females, named Primrose and Bluebell, and a male named Willow. At first, I fed them with a syringe, but I had to wipe them with a warm cloth first to mimic their mother’s licking. This helped them go to the bathroom. For the first few days, I fed them every four hours. Within a week, they learned to drink from a bottle and started moving around, although a bit unsteadily. They were happy together, with a heated pad to keep them warm.

However, three weeks later, I noticed that Willow seemed tired, even though he was still eating normally. This was a warning sign. I should have acted quickly, but I didn’t realize how serious it was. The next morning, I found him dead. The vet said he died from a lung infection. When bottle-feeding animals, it’s important not to let them drink too quickly, as liquid can go into their lungs. In Willow’s case, this caused an infection that was hard to treat, especially for such a small cub. Feeling sad about my loss, I continued to care for the other two.

Then, six days later, a local farmer came to see me. He had found another male cub, abandoned by its mother. He knew she wouldn’t return because the area was too disturbed, and the cub was cold and hungry. I named him Willow II. At six weeks old, he was about two weeks younger than the females. I soon discovered that he was very difficult to feed. I had to keep moving the bottle around and squeezing it to get him to drink. After ten minutes, he would finally latch on as if he hadn’t eaten all day. By the end of April, the females were eating creamed rice and anything else I offered. Willow II was happy to stop using the bottle but struggled to eat without making a mess. Eventually, I gave him a sausage, which he slowly learned to chew and eat. After a week of sausages, he was ready for more variety.

At nearly five months old, all the cubs were eating cereals for breakfast, a meat and vegetable meal for lunch, and fruit, nuts, cheese, hard-boiled eggs, and sunflower seeds in the evening. Normally, badgers eat 60% earthworms, along with beetles, baby rabbits, mice, and even plant roots. My badgers were better off than others that year because the summer was very hot, making it hard to find earthworms. By August, the cubs started to become nocturnal, going for walks at dusk or late at night. We often walked through the cider orchard, where they would get excited and chase each other’s tails. I learned to avoid their playful nips, but Derek, who joined us less often, sometimes got caught and ended up with bruises.

During these late-night walks, I noticed other badgers in our field. They were likely looking for food because their own territories were not providing enough. Badgers are very territorial and can be aggressive towards others. We were warned that they might enter our badger pen and harm the cubs, so we covered the gate with sheet metal to keep it secure. The local press took pictures of me walking the badgers, and many people wanted to help build a home for them on our farm. With advice from others, we designed a new sett for the badgers. Our son Daniel drew the plans, and we built a sett with tunnels, an enclosure, and a badger gate that faced their usual walking path. It had three chambers, one larger than the others, with a glass side so people could see inside.

As the sett was built, the badgers explored it before their walks. Eventually, they became more interested in the tunnels and their bedding than in walking. The cost of building was higher than we expected, but a local bus company called Badgerline helped fund part of it, and local businesses donated materials. Everyone wanted to see the badgers have a proper home. One evening, they finally moved in. After watching them for a while, we left them to settle down. Half an hour later, I returned to find three badgers curled up in their chambers, sound asleep.

Now, my walks with them are less frequent, especially since they don’t wake up until midnight. We see Primrose only occasionally because she has joined a nearby sett, but Bluebell and Willow II still come to greet me before running off into the night. This is their territory now, a place they know well and a home they have happily accepted."
CAE_67,"**In Search of True North - The Man Behind Halley's Comet**

Dr. Toby Clark, a researcher at the British Geological Survey, wants to follow in the footsteps of Sir Edmund Halley, who studied compass variations. Anjana Ahuja reports.

Sir Edmund Halley (1656-1742) is famous for the comet named after him. However, during his time, one of his most important achievements was mapping the ""variations of the compass."" These variations, now called ""declination,"" refer to the angle between magnetic north and true geographical north. Understanding this was crucial for sailors to correct their compasses and navigate the oceans accurately.

Halley was one of only two people in England paid to do scientific research at that time. He set out for the Cape Verde Islands to study declination in the North and South Atlantic, but his first trip was cut short due to problems with the crew. He later made a second voyage that took him to Rio de Janeiro, South Georgia, Newfoundland, and back to England. From this journey, he published a chart in 1701 showing compass variations in the Western and Southern Oceans. This chart helped sailors for over a century until changes in the Earth's magnetic field made it less accurate.

Dr. Clark wants to celebrate the 300th anniversary of Halley's journey by retracing the route of Halley's ship, the Paramore. He needs to raise £70,000 to start this project, and Sir Vivian Fuchs, who led the first expedition across Antarctica, is supporting him.

Dr. Clark became interested in Halley while working at Halley Station in Antarctica, where he read about Halley's life. ""Halley led a remarkable life,"" Dr. Clark says. ""He was a respected scientist and led expeditions. He was not just an astronomer; he also studied geophysics. While he was Astronomer Royal, he mapped the stars and worked on other projects.""

During his career, Halley invented a diving bell and advised Sir Isaac Newton while he wrote *Principia Mathematica*, a key work in physics. Dr. Clark believes that retracing Halley's voyage will give him the recognition he deserves. His expedition, called ""In the Wake of the Paramore,"" will also have scientific value. It will involve taking measurements similar to Halley's but with more advanced tools. These measurements are important because the Earth's magnetic field is always changing.

Dr. Clark explains, ""We usually measure the strength of the magnetic field, but not its direction. To measure direction, we need to know true north."" On this expedition, they will use global positioning satellites to find true north. The British Geological Survey and the United States Navy will provide instruments for the project. A Danish satellite will also be taking similar measurements, and Dr. Clark hopes his data will fill in any gaps in the satellite's coverage of the Atlantic Ocean.

Halley's journey was significant because it was the first scientific expedition at sea, and he was the first civilian appointed as a naval captain for this purpose. 

Does Dr. Clark have what it takes to succeed in this journey? He has spent two years in Antarctica and worked in the geomagnetic group at the British Geological Survey. He has also sailed the 13,000 kilometers from Rio de Janeiro to England. He plans to complete the expedition in four stages with different crews.

Does he share Halley's passion? ""I am ready to dedicate eight months to this, so some might say I'm obsessed. But I wouldn't want to sail across the Atlantic again without a good reason. Halley and his fascinating life have given me a real sense of purpose."""
CAE_27,"**Power Dressing**

Every summer, the peacocks at Whipsnade Wild Animal Park in Bedfordshire show off their beautiful tail feathers to the hens. This behavior puzzles scientists, including Charles Darwin, who wondered how such a showy feature could have evolved in a world where survival is tough. Darwin believed that animals evolve through natural selection, meaning that the strongest and best-adapted individuals survive and reproduce. However, he thought that peacocks' tails were a burden rather than an advantage, so he introduced the idea of ""sexual selection,"" suggesting that females are attracted to beauty.

Darwin's friend, Alfred Russel Wallace, disagreed with him. He believed that if peahens prefer males with the most impressive tails, there must be a reason beyond just beauty. Wallace thought that the tail might signal some hidden quality that helps the males survive.

Now, over a century later, researchers like Marion Petrie are studying peafowl at Whipsnade to answer two main questions: Do peahens really choose the males with the most impressive tails? And do these males have any real advantages, or is it just for show?

The researchers have observed that the hens do seem to prefer the males with the most eye spots on their tails, which are related to the tail's length. However, it is still unclear if these attractive males are better in other ways. William Hamilton from Oxford University suggested that showy male birds might be healthier and free from parasites, and their bright feathers could indicate this. However, Petrie and her team have not yet been able to test this idea with the peacocks at Whipsnade.

This year, Petrie is comparing the offspring of attractive males with those of less attractive ones to see if the children of the attractive males grow faster and are healthier. If they are, it would support Wallace's idea that the females' choice is practical.

There is also an interesting theory from the mathematician R.A. Fisher, known as ""Fisher's Runaway."" He suggested that if a female chooses a male with a slightly better tail, her sons will inherit that tail, and her daughters will inherit her preference for long tails. Over generations, this could lead to even longer tails, as males with the longest tails attract more mates. This process could explain how such extravagant tails evolved, and it would also support Darwin's idea that females might eventually choose beauty for its own sake."
CAE_66,"**THE BOAT OF MY DREAMS**

Tom Cunliffe believes that the best boat design should mix old and new ideas. He has done this with his own boat, 'The Westerman'. This week, the Summer Boat Show in London is filled with beautiful yachts that have the latest technology. Most of these boats come from a big change in boat design that happened 25 years ago. In contrast, my boat is quietly resting in a tidal creek on the south coast. Although she was designed last year, she looks like she is 100 years old, which might make people think her owner is a romantic. Maybe I am, but I’m not sure.

My boat uses the best parts of traditional boat design, but modern technology has made it easier to build. However, it is important to note that advanced technology can sometimes keep sailors away from the real challenges of life at sea. These challenges are often what they wanted to experience by going sailing in the first place. I am not saying that sailors should go back to suffering through every difficulty. I believe it is important for my boats to have a coal stove for warmth and comfortable places to sleep. But why go sailing if every sail does the work by itself? Dealing with a sail that flaps in the wind is part of being a sailor.

Also, why should we change the steering position from a safe place at the back of the boat to a less safe spot in the middle? This change often makes the cabin feel like a big ship, with a bed larger than what we have at home. For me, a boat should be a boat, not a house on the water. When I bought my earlier boat, Hirta, to sail around Britain for a TV race, the previous owner said she had all the comforts but no luxuries. Over time, I learned how true this was. Hirta had heavy sails, no running water, little electricity, no fridge, no central heating, no winches, and no electronics for navigation, yet she was the easiest boat I ever sailed.

However, classic boats like Hirta need a lot of care. When I hurt my back, I realized I could no longer keep her. I looked for a younger boat but found nothing suitable, so I decided to build a new one from scratch. The Westerman has never let me down. Although the designer, Nigel Irens, and his assistant, Ed Burnett, use computer design programs, Irens first sketched the boat on a paper napkin and then moved to the computer. After creating a model, just like boat builders did in the past, we worked together to improve the design. The final version was perfect.

The completed boat has crossed the North Atlantic and won four out of her first six races. She looks timeless, moves beautifully in the water, and has a peaceful atmosphere inside, much of which is made from reclaimed pitch pine. This calmness may be because she was designed purely as a sailing boat, without thinking about any furniture. This traditional method works well. The Westerman shows that you don’t need to follow trends to be happy, and sometimes it is wise to learn from history. Built with special treated wood, she is completely waterproof. So, she has all the advantages of a fiberglass boat but still looks, feels, and sails like a real boat."

Health farms and country house hotels with spa facilities are becoming very popular. We asked five journalists to visit some of these places.

**A. HENLOW GRANGE**  
I was happy to spend six days at Henlow Grange because I was tired and needed to relax. My room in the large 18th-century house was very comfortable, and I felt calm right away. On the first day, I did nothing and slept a lot. From the second day, I started attending body conditioning classes, yoga, and other activities. The instructors were very skilled, and I felt more flexible as the week went on. They offer many treatments, including aromatherapy, seaweed baths, manicures, and pedicures. The facial treatment, which lasts an hour, made me feel like a new person. The staff in the treatment rooms were friendly and professional. The atmosphere was lively and positive. Henlow plans to renovate this year, adding a half-size Olympic swimming pool and a Light Diet Room. You can also ride bicycles around the grounds or enjoy a quiet walk in the garden. During my stay, I felt happier and had a better appetite. I left feeling wonderful and full of energy. I will definitely return. This is a perfect getaway for stressed working women. Save Room 5 for me!

**B. SHRUBLAND HALL**  
The peaceful atmosphere of this stately home was clear as soon as I entered. The Hall has a beautifully decorated library, a lovely conservatory, and plenty of space, so you can avoid talking to others if you want. When you arrive, everyone gets a medical check-up, including weight and blood pressure. They called us patients, which felt strange since I am healthy. However, I was impressed that they quickly addressed a shoulder problem I had during the examination. Each patient follows a specific diet. I lost weight without starving, but I felt very hungry and got a headache on the second day. My daily menu included grapefruit and honey for breakfast, salads for lunch, and a mix of fruit, yogurt, and hot broth for dinner. If you are not on a light diet, you can eat in the main dining hall, where the food is tasty. You get a massage or water therapy every other day, and extra treatments are reasonably priced.

**C. CAREYS MANOR**  
Careys is not a health farm, but a charming old manor with cozy log fires and a spacious lounge. If you are counting calories, you might want to skip the gourmet food, which is rich and delicious. Luckily, the hotel has a gym and a soft-water pool to help you burn off some calories. There is also a spa bath, steam room, sauna, and treatment rooms. A big draw is the sports injury clinic, where I got advice for an old shoulder injury. The physiotherapist suggested good posture, exercises, and massage. Careys is comfortable and luxurious, and if you want to explore, there is beautiful countryside nearby.

**D. CLIVEDEN**  
Cliveden is a grand country home and a five-star hotel that treats guests like royalty. It offers health and beauty treatments, a gym, saunas, a swimming pool, tennis, horse riding, and more. There are beautiful walks and gardens around the 376-acre estate. The restaurant, Waldo's, serves amazing food. It took me a long time to read the dinner menu because there were so many choices. The meal was fantastic, especially the sticky-toffee pudding with banana ice cream. I went to bed very happy! The next morning, I spent some time in the gym to burn off a few calories before my next meal. I enjoyed a facial and an aromatherapy massage. Cliveden has many fitness and beauty treatments if you want them, before enjoying a meal at Waldo's.

**E. SPRINGS HYDRO**  
The best and worst thing about Springs Hydro is the carrot cake. It is the best because it is the most delicious I have ever had, but it is also the worst because it has 360 calories, which can be a problem if you want to lose weight. You have been warned! The second best thing is the wonderful aromatherapy massage. I chose a relaxing oil blend and fell asleep twice during the treatment. The facilities are modern and well-organized, with luxurious bedrooms. There are many therapists and beauty rooms, so it is easy to book appointments. They offer a variety of treatments, from manicures to deep-cleansing facials. The guests are a mix of people, including football teams, mothers and daughters, friends, and singles. I would love to take a break here every month.

CAE_22,"**NATURAL TALENTS**

In the seven million years since humans separated from chimpanzees, we have not developed many differences. Genetically, we are still over 98% similar to chimps. This means that the things that make us different from animals are very recent changes. Our biological history suggests that our ability to create art and other unique human traits come from just a small part of our genes. This is a big responsibility for a few genes.

Recent studies of animal behavior show that many traits once thought to be unique to humans are now seen as differences in degree. For example, both humans and wild chimpanzees use tools. Chimpanzees use sticks to eat and as weapons, while sea otters use rocks to open clams. Monkeys also have a simple form of language, using different sounds to warn about predators like leopards, eagles, and snakes. This means that besides art, there are not many clear differences between humans and animals.

If human art comes from a special genetic ability, it is strange that our ancestors did not create art for almost 6.9 million years after separating from chimps. The earliest forms of art might have been wood carvings or body painting, but these materials do not last over time. We only have clear evidence of human art from around 35,000 years ago, with famous cave paintings, statues, necklaces, and musical instruments.

If we believe that our recent burst of creativity makes us different, we need to consider how our art is different from animal art. Three main differences are often mentioned: human art is not useful, it is made for enjoyment, and it is learned rather than instinctive.

First, as Oscar Wilde said, ""All art is quite useless."" This means that human art does not help us survive or pass on our genes, unlike many animal behaviors. While some human art communicates ideas to others, this is not the same as passing on genes. In contrast, birdsong serves clear purposes, like defending territory or attracting a mate, which helps them pass on their genes. By this measure, human art does seem different.

The second claim is that human art is motivated by aesthetic pleasure. We cannot ask birds if they enjoy their songs, but they mainly sing during the breeding season, suggesting they do not sing just for enjoyment. Again, this makes human art seem unique.

The third difference is that human art is learned, not instinctive. Each human group has its own art styles that are learned. For example, songs in Tokyo are different from those in Paris, and people can learn each other's songs. In contrast, some birds are born knowing how to sing their species' songs, even if they have never heard them before.

Human art styles change quickly. For example, Roman authors wrote about geese honking 2,000 years ago, and they still do today. However, human art evolves so fast that even casual museum visitors can tell a twentieth-century painting from older works like the Mona Lisa. Art experts can often identify when and who painted a work, but they might confuse two mid-twentieth-century artists named Congo and Betsy. In reality, these artists were chimpanzees. Congo created up to 33 paintings in one day and was upset when his pencil was taken away. Congo and Betsy had a show of their paintings in 1957 in London, and many of their works sold, which is something many human artists cannot claim.

These chimpanzee paintings blur the lines between human art and animal behavior. Like human art, the ape paintings were not created for practical purposes; they were made for the satisfaction of the painter. Some might argue that human art is different because it is often meant to communicate with others, while the apes did not care about sharing their art. However, this argument is not very strong, as some famous human art was also created for personal satisfaction."

Susan Harr decides to unplug her gadgets and enjoy manual work again. Many people love technology because it provides us with amazing devices that make life easier and give us more free time. However, this belief has made us think that technology is the best way to live. Using our hands for tasks does not harm the environment, unlike some gadgets.

Recently, Susan had a bad experience with her broken word processor, which cost her a lot of money to fix. This made her question whether we really need all these gadgets. She started to let go of some household technology as it broke down. This made her wonder what ""free time"" really means. Does it just mean we have more time to buy and use more gadgets? She feels that marketing tricks us into thinking we need them.

When her word processor started making strange noises, she decided to leave it outside, where it now sits quietly. She enjoys working with her hands instead of being tied to noisy machines. She can take her sewing projects anywhere, which she loves. 

There are some gadgets she appreciates, like her washing machine, which she found very useful after a year without one. However, she discovered joy in giving up others. For example, they returned their rented color TV and went back to a small black-and-white one. This change helped them spend more time walking their dog, reading, talking, and enjoying hobbies. 

Susan has taken up sewing by hand since her old sewing machine is now just a table for plants. She realized that people often think they cannot live without technology, but she finds pleasure in doing things manually. Computers do many tasks for us, but she enjoys the calmness of sewing and the satisfaction of creating something with her hands. 

Now, she can listen to the radio or talk with family while sewing. If the task is simple, she can even watch her favorite TV shows without feeling guilty because she is also being productive. She enjoys the cozy feeling of sewing by the fire with a cup of tea.

At first, she thought sewing by hand was tedious and tiring, but she now finds it relaxing and rewarding. She feels that things get done quickly, and life slows down to a more enjoyable pace. She also appreciates washing dishes by hand, which allows her to daydream.

This reflection has made her reconsider what appliances she really needs in her home. She wonders if they truly need a freezer, microwave, or electric lawnmower. In fact, she thinks they could save a lot of money by living without electric lights!"

Charles Hurst is a skilled cabinet-maker who creates beautifully crafted furniture. Joanna Watt meets him in his workshop located under a railway arch in East London. When she arrives, he greets her quickly and seems to be in a hurry. It’s not clear if he is always this way or if he is just shy. The workshop is busy, filled with unfinished furniture and wooden planks in many natural colors.

Hurst has been a cabinet-maker for ten years and has a great reputation. His schedule is always full for months ahead, even though he does not advertise himself. People know that if they want a good cupboard, table, bookcase, or kitchen units, Hurst is the right choice. While it is easy to find furniture-makers, it is harder to find one who focuses on making high-quality furniture with simple designs. Hurst notes that there are not many true cabinet-makers left, as many people call themselves furniture-makers instead.

Hurst is often disappointed by the quality of modern furniture. He criticizes mass-produced items and craftsmen who make poor-quality pieces. His desire for perfection is a big part of his success, along with his talent. He is confident in his skills, saying, ""I have a huge natural ability. I have always been good at making things."" Although he shows some modesty at the end of the interview, he clearly believes in his abilities.

Hurst learned his craft on his own by asking questions and observing. Most of his work comes from private clients, and some return to him for more projects. He enjoys working on entire houses for clients. However, he admits that not all client relationships are easy. He finds it frustrating when clients are unsure of what they want, but he appreciates those who have clear ideas.

Despite his confidence, Hurst respects other craftsmen and acknowledges that some are better than him. He mentions that he was not trained at Parnham, a top furniture design school. He is critical of craftsmen who take too long to make one piece and of students who focus on making fashion statements instead of practical furniture. Hurst believes that furniture should be useful, not just a statement.

In the end, Hurst shows a humble attitude about his work. He reminds us that, ""After all, I am only making furniture,"" as he bids farewell."
CAE_49,"**Three Theories About Sleep**

People spend about one-third of their lives sleeping. This shows that sleep is very important. However, scientists do not fully agree on why we need to sleep. There are three main theories.

The first and most popular theory says that sleep is mainly for our physical health. It suggests that while we sleep, our bodies work to repair any damage from the day and help us feel better.

The second theory focuses on learning. It claims that sleep helps us process the information we learn during the day. According to this theory, without sleep, we would not be able to learn effectively.

The third theory is about energy. It suggests that we need to sleep to recharge our energy, so we are ready for the next day."
CAE_31,"**ECCENTRICS**

An eccentric is someone whose behavior is unusual and does not follow the accepted rules of society. This raises the question, ""What is normal?"" Most people have their own quirks and strange habits. For example, someone might love entering newspaper competitions, collect beer mats, or write angry letters to the press about various topics. Eccentricity shows our individuality.

Inside us, there is often a struggle between two forces: individualism and conformity. Individualism is the desire to be unique, while conformity is the desire to fit in with others. For many people, the need to be accepted and liked by others is stronger than the desire to stand out and be different.

People with unusual hobbies or strong opinions often come together. They form clubs, hold meetings, and organize events to share their interests, which others might see as strange. Being part of a group can be comforting. Most of us feel a tension between wanting to fit in and wanting to be ourselves. Even when we follow the crowd, we may feel the need to show our individuality. For example, someone might say, ""I say what I think,"" or ""You must take me as I am.""

At any time, we can choose to express our individuality. Many successful people have done this. Bob Dylan, the American singer, once said that when you truly believe in what you are doing and pursue it with determination, you may confuse others. However, this strong expression of individuality is not the same as eccentricity at first. If a pop singer wears strange clothes just to get attention, or a socialite makes shocking comments to be noticed, that is not eccentricity. But if they continue these behaviors until they become a part of who they are, then they can be considered eccentric.

The key to eccentricity is that it is natural. Eccentrics do not try to be strange; they simply are. A true eccentric does not care much about what others think. They act according to their true selves, which makes them different from enthusiasts, pranksters, clever criminals, show-offs, and recluses. These people are aware of society and often act in response to it. Some want to impress others, while others want to escape from society. In contrast, eccentrics live their lives freely, without concern for how others see them."
CAE_58,"**Natural Books**

We asked four well-known naturalists to share the wildlife book that has influenced them the most.

**A. Geoffrey Lean**  
Choosing the author was easy for me. As an environmental journalist, I have had the chance to meet many important figures in this field. One of the most significant is Barbara Ward, a small but strong woman who has greatly influenced environmental issues in Europe after the war. She combined her experiences from different environmental movements into a powerful philosophy. When I was a young journalist, her ideas helped me understand these complex topics. Choosing her book was harder. I considered ""Only One Earth"" and ""Progress for a Small Planet,"" but I believe ""The Home of Man"" is her most important work. It discusses the rapid growth of cities and addresses major themes she cared about. It is a passionate call for what we now call ""sustainable human development."" I have read many books since, but none compare to it.

**B. Linda Bennett**  
When I read ""Signals for Survival"" by Niko Tinbergen, I can hear the calls of herring gulls and remember the smell of their droppings in the sun. This book beautifully explains the interesting world of animal communication through words and pictures. After reading it, if you watch a gull colony, you will see how their chaotic activity is actually a well-organized social structure. You can identify which birds are partners and recognize families later in the season. Niko Tinbergen was a respected behaviorist who wanted to share his findings with everyone. His collaboration with talented wildlife artist Eric Ennion made this book special and enjoyable for anyone who loves nature. Ennion's paintings, created from years of observing birds, show how one gull can be aggressive while another is calm. This is the work of a true naturalist.

**C. Lee Durrell**  
The book that has influenced me the most is ""My Family and Other Animals"" by Gerald Durrell. This book not only led me to a wonderful husband but also to a fulfilling career in conservation. It defined my love for the natural world. I was doing research on animal sounds in Madagascar when I first read it. After two years of challenges, this book made my world brighter. It beautifully connects animals, people, joy, and beauty, showing a world worth saving. Many people believe humans are the worst because of the harm we have caused to other species. However, I remember Gerald as a boy in the book, viewing all living beings as a family, connected and inseparable. This is an important idea for everyone to understand.

**D. Bruce Pearson**  
I found ""The Shell Bird Book"" by James Fisher in my school library shortly after it was published in 1966. I was immediately attracted to it, especially the 48 colorful bird illustrations by Eric Ennion. These images caught my attention. I already had other bird books and had spent holidays learning to identify birds. They inspired me to start sketching what I saw. But ""The Shell Bird Book"" offered much more. Along with the beautiful illustrations, it included chapters on bird migration, the history of birds in Britain, and even a chapter on birds in music, literature, and art. This wide range of information and exciting images encouraged me to appreciate birds and nature more broadly. The book showed me that my emotional and creative connection to nature is just as important as a scientific one. Since art was my stronger subject, I began to see new opportunities for myself."
CAE_37,"**DO REVIEWS SELL BOOKS?**

We asked five important British publishers about how book reviews affect sales. Here is what they said.

**Publisher A**  
Reviews are very important for publishers. They are the first thing we look at in newspapers. A study by the Book Marketing Council showed that many people buy a book because of reviews, more than any other reason like ads or recommendations from friends. Authors feel differently about reviews. Both authors and publishers are upset when there are no reviews, but publishers often feel okay about bad reviews. They believe that any mention of a book can help sales, as readers want to form their own opinions. Publishers enjoy reviews that match their own feelings about a book since they are often the first to read it.

**Publisher B**  
Publishers and newspapers both care about book reviews, but they have different needs. Newspapers want to entertain their readers, while publishers want their books to be reviewed positively. Book reviews today are better and more varied than they were 40 years ago. However, there is still a problem with the lack of attention given to paperbacks. Weekly reviews often do not cover enough books, and original paperbacks rarely get serious reviews. Still, publishers need reviews because they are a cost-effective way to promote a book and an author. A good review from a trusted source can really boost sales, especially if there are several positive reviews.

**Publisher C**  
Reviews are essential for literary publishing. Without them, we would struggle to promote our books, especially since we often do not publish well-known authors and do not spend much on advertising. Positive reviews are much more valuable than ads because readers trust them. Publishers often say they care more about the size of the review than its content. The impact of reviews on sales is complex. Good reviews can help launch a book and a writer's career, but they need support from other factors like recommendations from readers and effective marketing.

**Publisher D**  
I wish I understood the relationship between publishing and reviewing in Britain! In the U.S., a single review in the New York Times can make or break a book. Here, bookshops often ignore reviews. Sometimes, it takes many years of great reviews for people to notice a good writer. Interestingly, some poorly reviewed books become bestsellers. The situation is unpredictable, but non-fiction reviews often focus more on the reviewer’s knowledge than on the book itself.

**Publisher E**  
All publishers and writers hope for great reviews. But do they really help sell books? I once published a biography that received excellent reviews, but it did not sell well because people felt they could just read the reviews instead of buying the book. Does the name of the reviewer matter? Thirty years ago, if certain reviewers liked a book, people paid attention. Today, it can also be the unexpected reviewer or the creativity of the review that encourages people to buy the book."
CAE_2,"**WEATHERVANE MAKER**

Making weathervanes is an old skill that dates back to ancient Egypt. Today, this craft is still alive in the workshop of Graham Smith. He is one of the few people in the country who makes hand-cut weathervanes. Graham creates unique designs based on what his customers want. He says, ""This way, I can make a special item just for them."" Many of his customers are women looking for gifts for their husbands. They want something unique that reflects the man's job or hobbies.

Graham's work is very different from the traditional cockerel design, which is the most common type of weathervane. The first weathervane he made was not a cockerel, but a witch on a broomstick. His friends liked it and asked him to make weathervanes for them. He realized that there were endless possibilities for designs. So, he decided to focus on making weathervanes.

Before starting this business, Graham trained as a precision engineer and worked in that field for 15 years. Five years ago, he and his wife, Liz, switched roles: she went to work as an architectural assistant, and he stayed home to take care of their children and grow his business. He has no regrets about this change. He says, ""My previous job was not creative, but this work is exciting and artistic. I really enjoy designing.""

Graham has created over 100 original designs. He pays close attention to detail and always gets the customer's approval on the design before he starts cutting it by hand. He also keeps many traditional designs available because they are still popular. Graham believes that people like handmade items because they want something different.

He does not plan to expand his business because he wants to keep it as a rural craft. He feels he has found his place in the market. People appreciate the uniqueness of his work, and he enjoys seeing a simple shape turn into something almost lifelike. 

For centuries, weathervanes have helped communities understand the weather by showing changes in wind direction. Nowadays, more people are moving to the countryside and want to add a special touch to their homes. This trend has helped crafts like Graham's. He is now busier than ever, sending flat-packed weathervanes to customers around the world, especially in America and Denmark. He explains that the price depends on how detailed the design is. His latest request was for a curly-coated dog. No matter the occasion, Graham can create a unique gift."
CAE_68,"**Beginner Takes All**

Before it was even published, *The Horse Whisperer* was already the most talked-about book of the year. This first novel by British screenwriter Nicholas Evans made him a lot of money. Here, he shares his inspiration and success.

At the start of the year, Nicholas Evans was having a tough time. A film project he had been working on, called *Life and Limb*, suddenly fell apart. He felt disappointed and worried because it had been two years since he earned any money, and he was struggling to pay his bills.

A sensible person in Evans' situation would have found a job. He could have returned to his previous work in television or started a new project. Instead, he made a surprising choice. He bought a ticket to America and spent three months researching for his first novel. Although it was a risky decision, he had been thinking about the story for a while. He was inspired by a farrier he met while visiting a friend in Dartmoor. The farrier told him about a gentle horse that suddenly became aggressive. The owners were desperate until they heard about a gypsy who could calm the horse just by talking to it. These special people were called ""horse whisperers."" 

Evans became very interested in this idea. He initially wanted to write a screenplay since he was a filmmaker. However, after losing the film project, he decided to write the story as a book. During the spring, he traveled across the US, visiting ranches and learning about horses and the people who work with them. He later reflected, ""It was a strange time. I was observing people, but I felt alone and worried about my life falling apart. I had tried for ten years to succeed as a filmmaker, and now I was in debt and unsure how to support my family.""

By the end of August, after returning home, he had written the first half of the book. He was still under pressure from the bank and needed to know if he should continue. He bravely showed his work to a friend who was a literary agent. The agent read it and said it was ""fine."" When asked for more feedback, he suggested that Evans might receive $30,000 as an advance for the book. Evans thought about how much he needed to pay off some of his debts, and $30,000 was not enough. He had spent seven months on *The Horse Whisperer* and still had at least two months of work left. 

In October, he sent the first two hundred pages of the novel, along with a 12-page summary of the rest of the book, to seven UK publishers just before they went to the Frankfurt Book Fair. Within days, his agent called to say he had turned down the first offer of $75,000. Evans was shocked and asked, ""What?"" The agent replied, ""It's okay, I feel something big is happening.""

What happened next became a famous story in publishing. Within a week of competitive bidding, the novel was sold to Transworld Publications in the UK for £550,000 and to Delacorte in the US for $3.15 million, both record amounts for a first novel. Evans and his team were amazed. They had not even sent the manuscript to New York, and they still do not know how it got there. They also did not send it to Hollywood, but soon major film studios were interested in it. 

Evans' UK agent worked with an American agent, who called to say, ""I think we can get $3 million for the film rights."" They all laughed in disbelief. They decided that each studio should present their ideas to Evans. One night in October, he sat in his study while four famous filmmakers called him one after the other, asking to pay $3 million for an unfinished novel.

Evans shared this story while we enjoyed coffee on his porch overlooking his garden. He mentioned that he had turned down an offer to write the screenplay for *The Horse Whisperer*. ""It has all felt like a fairy tale so far. I don’t want to ruin it. Writing at that level is very challenging, and I don’t want to become just an employee of the people who have paid me so much. I would hate to write a draft and then have them say, 'Thanks, Nick, but we’ll bring in someone else now.'""

He wants to stay involved but from a distance. The success of his novel led to new support for *Life and Limb*, but he was unsure if he wanted to make that film anymore. ""I think it would be foolish not to write another novel,"" he said."
CAE_23,"**Young Masters**

Bobby Fischer is facing challenges as he tries to return to the world of chess. Chess has become more of a young man's game. After being away for 20 years, Fischer is back and playing against his old rival, Boris Spassky. He won the first game, which was impressive, but he is not the same player he was in 1972. Now, at 49 years old, he is out of practice and not in great shape. Spassky is even older.

Chess has changed a lot in the last 20 years. Fischer helped make chess popular, leading to a new era of professionalism. Now, winning is the main goal for modern players. In international chess, a player’s nerves and stamina are just as important as their intelligence. The pressure in chess has always been high. Players use a chess clock to make sure they finish their moves in time, or they lose the game. Nowadays, games can last longer, and many are played without breaks. This increased pressure favors younger players. In the last 30 years, each new world champion has been younger than the last. Currently, eight of the ten highest-ranked players are under 30.

The way chess is played has also changed. Much of it now happens off the board. Players must prepare seriously before matches, especially because computers have changed the game. A small computer can store one million chess games and provide quick access to many games of an opponent. In recent matches, players have used large teams to find weaknesses in each other's strategies. The opening moves of a game are analyzed in great detail, and being well-prepared can be the key to winning.

Today, there are more top players than ever before, with many grandmasters competing for modest prizes around the world. Success in chess requires both physical and mental effort. A single game can last up to eight hours, and players must stay focused. A moment of distraction can lead to losing the game. The chess clock adds to the stress, especially during the final moments when players have only seconds to make their moves. In these intense situations, players must act quickly and efficiently, similar to athletes.

At the highest level of chess, losing is very painful. Winning brings great satisfaction and a chance to recover from the stress. However, one win is not enough to win a tournament. Chess masters must be ready for the next challenge every day. Most tournaments last 9 to 11 days, with games played daily, and there are competitions all year round. World championship matches can be even more demanding. For example, a match between Anatoli Karpov and Gary Kasparov in 1984 had to be stopped after several months because both players were exhausted.

Can Bobby Fischer overcome these challenges? He once said, ""All I want to do is play chess."" This makes his long absence from the game seem strange. However, it also adds to his legacy. If he has returned for the money, he will do well, as both he and Spassky will earn millions from their match. But if Fischer believes he can prove he is still the best player, the outcome could be very disappointing for him."
CAE_60,"**Fame and Fortune**

Imogen Edwards-Jones interviews some new British talents, from poets to pop stars, who are on their way to success.

**A**  
Nick Grosso, in his early 30s, has written three well-received plays. He is now turning his first play, *Peaches*, into a movie script. ""It's low budget, but we don't know how low,"" he says. ""It won't be over £30 million, but it could be as low as £30."" The most surprising thing about Nick is that before writing *Peaches*, he had never been to a play or read one. ""When I wrote the play, I never thought it would be performed,"" he explains. ""It's set in a car. I probably wouldn't do that now because I know the challenges."" He left school at 16 but returned a year later. After finishing his A-levels, he joined the Young People's Theatre. ""I realized I wanted to write for actors. I wanted my writing to be heard, not just read, because of its rhythm and rhyme,"" he says. ""Suddenly, I was with people who thought like me. It was the first time I enjoyed being in an educational setting. It was very inspiring.""

**B**  
Simon Pegg, 28, has made great progress in his career since studying drama at Bristol University. He is currently writing a TV comedy series and has just finished a tough tour with comedian Steve Coogan. He has always worked hard, even performing in comedy clubs while at university. ""It was very theoretical at university,"" Simon remembers. ""It made me realize I didn't want to be a serious actor; I was always more interested in comedy. People think comedy is the hardest job, but it really isn't. If you have courage and good material, it's wonderful to make people laugh."" He has worked with the comedy group Funny Business, but his partnership with Steve Coogan has been the most successful. ""He saw my show, and since I was a big fan of his, he probably noticed I was imitating him,"" Simon admits.

**C**  
Ciaran McMenamin, 24, became well-known when he starred in the series *The Young Person's Guide To Becoming A Rock Star*. The response was very positive, and his career has taken off quickly. ""It's been a great opportunity for me,"" he says with a smile. ""Now I can choose what I want to do, which is what I've always wanted."" This is a comfortable position for someone who has just graduated. Ciaran's early career shows that he was always meant to succeed. Encouraged by his mother, he went from leading roles in school plays to the Ulster Youth Theatre, where he spent four years. ""I was using acting as an excuse not to do homework,"" Ciaran laughs. ""But then I decided I wanted to take it seriously because I had a talent and passion for it."" Now, he is waiting for the praise to come in, but when asked about fame, he becomes thoughtful. ""When you're 18, you think you'll love the photos and interviews, but you soon realize that's not why you act. It's about earning respect for doing good work.""

**D**  
Neil Taylor, 25, is the lead singer of the pop band Matrix, which has just signed a three-album deal with Domino Records. Neil and his bandmate, Rick Brown, are expected to be very successful when their single, *Chimera*, is released soon. ""The record company's idea of good sales is very different from mine,"" he says. ""They want a big hit, but for me, if two people buy it, I'll be happy."" Unlike many new pop stars, Neil has worked hard for his success. He left school at 16 and has been trying to enter the music industry ever since. ""It's funny how things happen,"" he says. ""I had been performing at student gigs for eight years and was starting to feel tired. I was about to give up when I met Rick Brown, who had connections at Domino, and we formed Matrix. It couldn't have happened at a better time. There were moments when I felt really down, and I was in some terrible bands, but hopefully, it will all be worth it.""

**E**  
Stephen Richards, 27, is a poet and author who has won many awards and honors, more than most people twice his age. He is well-known in the poetry world, where he has been touring and giving readings several times a week for the past six years. His first novel, *Hidden*, will be published in March. ""It's a story about obsessive love. It was a strong idea that I couldn't express as a poem."" Stephen loved creative writing in school but lost interest in education later. ""I decided not to go to university, but I became bored stuffing envelopes at a theater and realized I should go."" After university, he published his first work, a children's book, in 1992. ""I don't think my parents expected me to be a writer; they thought I would just be a reader because that's all I did as a child."" With his poetry getting great reviews, moving into novels is a brave step. ""My poetry has a structure, so there's less chance of making a big mistake,"" he explains. ""A novel can be any length, which means there are more chances for bad writing. My main goal is to avoid just producing work without caring about its quality."""
CAE_1,"A. Isabel, the main character in this quirky novel, thinks she looks good in jeans but rarely wears them because she doesn't want to attract the wrong people. She is a 31-year-old art student who loves historical romance novels and is looking for Mr. Right. She worries that her knobbly knees might ruin her chances. However, she remains hopeful, which helps her and others in the story. The author writes with a lively style, using chapter titles like ""Our Hero Feels Inspired,"" creating a fast-paced, dramatic feel similar to early silent films.

B. This story celebrates the rise and near-fall of a local radio station in America. It is told from the perspective of a clever but shy child named Francis With. Francis works for WLT (With Lettuce and Tomato) Radio, a station started by Roy and Ray Soderbjerg to promote their sandwich shop. The station quickly features a mix of singers, preachers, and announcers. The small-town setting allows the author to use dry humor and simple writing, taking readers back to the more relaxed days of the 1940s and 1950s, filled with old stores, classic cars, and radio shows.

C. In the author's world, it is normal for a second husband to talk with his wife's first husband. When Richard Vaisey, a successful professor, falls for a beautiful Russian poet, he shares his feelings with his wife's ex-husband. The poet writes bad poetry, which bothers Richard, and she is also trying to get his help for her wrongly imprisoned brother. However, the way the author unravels these issues is even more interesting. He moves the story forward with a sense of humor and carefully examines relationships, making it an enjoyable and clever read.

D. In 1960s London, two sets of best friends—two women and two men—become connected for 25 years through life and death. At the beginning of this long novel, James Hudson, a mysterious American businessman, is starting a newspaper, which his friend Richard Blake is editing. The newspaper launch is important, but so is the fact that they both loved a woman who was killed years ago. The story includes themes of murder, ambition, love, and jealousy, all written well. This book allows readers to deeply connect with the characters.

E. This touching and funny story, written by a top American author, follows Ian Bedloe, who feels guilty about a past mistake. To make up for it, he becomes a father figure to his brother's three orphaned children. At 40, he is slowly becoming an eccentric bachelor. The story explores many emotions and highlights the special bond Ian forms with the youngest child, Daphne. It is a warm book that balances sadness and humor perfectly."
CAE_53,"**Volunteer Tourism**

Four academic writers discuss international voluntary work. 

A. It is difficult to say that volunteer tourists make a big difference in development. While they can help build homes or schools, they usually pay a lot of money to participate in this work. If that money were given directly to a local community, it could pay for more labor than one volunteer could provide. This is especially true for gap year volunteers, who often do not have the necessary skills or experience. Many studies question whether these volunteers are truly motivated by a desire to help others or if they are more interested in improving their own careers. However, these projects can help develop people who may act ethically in their future careers.

B. Volunteering can lead to better international understanding, improved conflict resolution skills, and more participation in global issues through civic organizations. It can also help create international social networks among ordinary people. In this way, the benefits can be shared between volunteers and host communities, contributing to the greater good. However, if volunteering is mostly done by wealthy individuals, it may only help them gain a global perspective and career advantages, while doing little for the communities that need help.

C. At its worst, international volunteering can be seen as a form of imperialism or self-serving charity from wealthy Westerners. At its best, it can provide benefits to both volunteers and the organizations they work with, allowing for the exchange of skills and cultural experiences in developing communities. Most importantly, volunteering can raise awareness and commitment to fighting against poverty, injustice, and unsustainable development.

D. Volunteer tourism fits well with the growing trend of helping others. These small efforts to ""make a difference"" can seem positive, especially in a time when people are skeptical of big governments and businesses. However, this approach can ignore the need for democratic government and reduce development to individual acts of charity, which may not truly change the situations of poor communities. While volunteering can be a simple and commendable act, when it is promoted as sustainable development, it can weaken the true understanding of development issues. The politics of volunteer tourism can distract from the real problems of global inequality and poverty faced by many in developing countries."
CAE_55,"**Sound the Alarm**

Stuart Harris reports that many of us listen to the radio in the morning and need something to help us get out of bed. This is why we have clock radios. But how do you choose a good one? A group, including myself, inventor Tom Granger, and broadcaster Paul Bridges, tested five different models.

One model has a 'dual alarm function' that lets you set two different wake-up times, one for weekdays and one for weekends. However, it does not let you snooze and then wake up later, as I first thought. Since this model costs about the same as another we tested, having a cassette player is a good deal. You can listen to your favorite tapes to fall asleep and wake up to a quiet morning. We all agreed that the radio quality was excellent, but the size was a problem; it was as big as a rugby ball. Paul Bridges mentioned that he needs space on his bedside table for his keys, wallet, glasses, and phone. He also said he always books a wake-up call just in case the alarm fails.

This model was voted the best-looking and overall winner. Paul Bridges said he was ""in love with it,"" even though the clock he tested sometimes got stuck at 16:00. I liked the digital display with its nice grey numbers on a soft green background. The snooze button is wide, so you can easily tap it while still half-asleep. However, the buttons felt nice to touch, which made me play with them too much, and I ended up needing to read the instruction booklet.

The clock has a backup power feature, so you don’t have to reset it if the power goes out. Everyone liked this feature. However, we found it difficult to set up, but once we figured it out, we felt pretty cool. Tom Granger thought the model with a built-in lamp was poorly made. He had to read the instructions twice to get it to work because the clock kept changing times. The lamp was hard to adjust and was not bright enough to read by.

Paul Bridges found the lamp idea funny but agreed that tuning the radio was difficult. The buzzer sounded like an alarm on a submarine, which made me want to throw it across the room. Interestingly, this model is the third most popular on the market. It is aimed at young people with its bright colors, which appealed to both Tom Granger and me. Tom said he would choose this one because it stands out more than the others. It was also the only model we could set up without reading the instructions.

Unfortunately, the alarm has a funny 20-minute error margin, meaning it might go off 10 minutes earlier or later than set. Paul Bridges laughed at this idea and said the model was ""terribly fiddly"" and ""completely useless."" The simplest and cheapest model we tested was liked by Tom Granger because it was small and had old-fashioned dial tuning. He said it was easier to set up than modern push-button tuning, which can be confusing. We all agreed that the radio quality was good, and the buzzer worked well; it got me out of bed in just two beeps!"
CAE_50,"**Hedgehogs**

A hedgehog is a small mammal known for its sharp spines that cover its body. Hedgehogs live in many parts of the world, but they are not found in America or Australia. All types of hedgehogs can roll into a tight ball when they feel threatened, which makes their spines stick out for protection. How well this works depends on how many spines the hedgehog has. Some hedgehogs that live in deserts have fewer spines because they have adapted to their environment. These hedgehogs are more likely to run away from danger instead of rolling up, using their ability to roll as a last option.

Hedgehogs are mostly active at night and sleep during the day, often hiding under bushes or in holes in the ground. Although all hedgehogs can hibernate, not all of them do. In good conditions, some hedgehogs may stay awake all year."
CAE_25,"**Great Sportswomen on a Winning Streak**

Excelling in any sport is challenging, even for men, but women often face even more difficulties. Training and competing take up a lot of time, leaving little room for a normal life, which means they have to make sacrifices. Despite these challenges, many women are overcoming prejudice and setting new records. Here, we talk to some amazing British sportswomen who are reaching their goals.

**A. Jill, 27, Skier**  
""It's an incredible feeling to fly through the air and land safely, but it can also be scary. Sometimes I don’t feel well, or the weather is bad, but I just keep going. Having a career outside of skiing is tough because we train for ten months each year. I have to give up a lot of my social life and time with friends, but it was my choice. There are six men and three women on the British team, and we all compete on the same courses and get treated equally—it's a young sport.""

**B. Caroline, 22, Cyclist**  
""Two years ago, I borrowed a bike to join a charity race and surprisingly won because I cycled faster than everyone else, even though I had never cycled before! I earn a good salary as a professional cyclist, and there are many opportunities for sponsorship. However, I worry that people might think I succeeded because of my looks, not my skills. So, I focus on cycling instead of making money. I train for at least four hours every day, plus I do stretching, swimming, and running. My boyfriend is also a cyclist, so he understands how much time it takes.""

**C. Annabel, 26, Rower**  
""Rowing is hard for girls to start because very few schools offer it. Most girls don’t begin until they are 19 or 20, which makes it harder to compete internationally. Also, coaches often change every year, so there is no stability, and the women's team struggles. But I enjoy it and love being fit, plus there is a good social life.""

**D. Ffyona, 24, Long-Distance Walker**  
""When I was 13, I dreamed of walking around the world without knowing how big it was! I felt trapped in Britain and wanted freedom. Each walk has been different. The hardest was crossing Australia, where I walked 50 miles a day with very little sleep and many blisters. But I set a record! I had to because my sponsorship money would run out after 95 days. Some men think women are more likely to fail, so they see sponsoring us as a risk.""

**E. Lisa, 26, Saloon Car Racer**  
""Some men have big egos when driving. When I do well, they often ignore me. Being a woman in racing has its challenges. When I approach a corner, men think they must beat me, so I’ve had many tough moments! You need to be competitive and aggressive. It’s hard to earn money, and what I do make goes back into racing. Women have been racing since the 1920s and have often been seen as unusual. It’s great that more women are joining racing every year. I love striving for perfection in every lap.""

**F. Alison, 28, Triathlete**  
""I wake up at 5:30 three mornings a week to swim. I need Tuesday and Thursday mornings to catch up on sleep. In the evenings, I either cycle or run. Sometimes I even fall asleep at my desk! There is a lot of pressure before a race, and I really push myself during competitions. I often wonder why I do this, and I realize it’s because I feel happier when I stay fit, I would be lazy without this routine, and racing is very social. Men and women usually compete together, but when events are covered in the media, 90% of the focus is on the men's events, and only 10% mentions the women's results. The prize money is also not as good. However, we have created an International Triathlon Women's Commission to improve this."""
CAE_34,"**The Day I Met Picasso**

Richard Cork remembers the day he met Picasso when he was 78 years old. Even from a distance, he could recognize Picasso, who was having lunch at an outdoor restaurant in Cannes. At that time, I was an 18-year-old student traveling around Europe and Morocco in an old van. I had run out of money and found a job painting boats by the waterfront. However, I spent a lot of time drawing and had my sketchbook with me when I saw Picasso.

Picasso was known to be a private person who usually stayed away from others to work. So, I was surprised to see him sitting at a table with his wife, Jacqueline, and some friends. I would not have approached him if my friend hadn’t encouraged me. Nervously, I introduced myself and asked for his signature, and to my surprise, he agreed. He wrote his name at the top of my page and then added a lively drawing below it. His art often reflected real things, so the lines he drew might have represented a cloud, the sea, or the shape of Cannes harbor.

I thanked him and started a conversation, but since Picasso's English was not very good and my French was limited, an American woman at the table helped translate. She kept calling him ""the Maestro,"" which made it hard for me to speak freely. Still, I told Picasso how much I loved art and admired his work. After a while, I went back to my boat and showed my friend what I had. He noticed that Picasso was still having lunch and asked, ""Is that all?"" He encouraged me to go back and talk to Picasso again, suggesting I could draw his portrait.

With my sketchbook in hand, I returned to Picasso's table. I decided not to ask if I could draw him, as I thought he might say no. Instead, I stood by the table, set up my pad, and began to draw. When Picasso saw me, he smiled and made it hard for me to concentrate. He acted out funny faces and gestures, making me laugh. Even though it was challenging, I felt like he was testing my determination to draw him.

Eventually, Picasso relaxed and let me study him closely. He looked strong and alert, wearing a blue-and-white striped shirt. He seemed much younger than his age, with bright, dark eyes that were very expressive. Even though he was surrounded by friends, he seemed to be in his own world, quietly focused on his thoughts.

When the American woman told me that Picasso wanted to see my drawing, I felt shy and said it wasn’t good enough. But he insisted, and when I showed him my sketch, he nodded approvingly. Then, to my surprise, he said it was his turn to draw. I quickly gave him my crayon, and he made a few quick strokes on the paper. In seconds, he drew a face that looked very different from my careful drawing. He had moved one of my eyes and captured my smile with just one lively line.

I thanked Picasso and asked if he could sign my drawing. The American woman explained that he said I already had his signature. So, he was not going to give me another one! Looking back, I feel very lucky to have met Picasso and to have received his attention. It meant a lot to me."
CAE_12,"**Talking Shop**

Have you ever gone into a store and ended up buying more than you planned? This article explains the tricks that shops use to encourage you to spend more money.

**A. The Image of Freshness**  
Supermarkets know that customers really want fresh food. To create this feeling, they often place fruits and vegetables at the entrance of the store. They might also have a bakery that fills the air with the smell of fresh bread. The colors in the store, like green, are chosen to make people think of fresh produce. However, most of what supermarkets sell, like frozen foods and cleaning products, is not fresh.

**B. Displaying to Advantage**  
The way products are placed in the store is very important for sales. Supermarkets use computers to find out which areas of the store customers visit the most. They put high-profit items in these areas. Products at eye level are especially popular with manufacturers. Special bins with discounts attract bargain hunters. Another strategy is to place related items together, like desserts near ice cream.

**C. Spreading Staples Around the Store**  
Supermarkets often place low-cost items like bread and sugar far from the entrance. This way, shoppers have to walk past more expensive items to get to them. Stores also place popular products away from the entrance, hoping that loyal customers will search for them and see other tempting items along the way.

**D. Less Sells More**  
Chain stores have changed how they display their products. For example, the Next chain has moved away from the idea of selling many items cheaply. Instead, they create a boutique feel by showing fewer items, making them seem more exclusive. Their success comes from good store design as well as stylish clothing.

**E. Tempting Totals**  
Food shoppers often pay more attention to the total cost of their shopping than to the price of individual items. Supermarkets mix low-cost staples with higher-priced items to attract customers. They sometimes sell certain staples at a loss to bring people in, a strategy known as ""loss leaders."" They also get lower prices by buying in large amounts or by promoting products prominently.

**F. The All-Important Price Tag**  
Customers in chain stores tend to buy fewer items and notice prices more. For example, pricing a blouse at £14.99 instead of £15 can make a difference. This pricing strategy also helps reduce theft, as employees must ring up sales to give change.

**G. Lighting to Effect**  
Both supermarkets and chain stores pay attention to lighting. Chain stores try to use lighting that looks like natural light so customers can see the true colors of clothes. Supermarkets use special lighting to make fresh fruits and vegetables look more appealing.

**H. Walk This Way**  
Many chain stores use different types of carpet to guide customers through the store. One pattern shows the main paths, while another marks sales areas. This strategy, called the ""Yellow Brick Road,"" encourages shoppers to explore, although some may hesitate to leave the main paths. For example, Marks and Spencer uses wood or marble for the main paths to lead customers to the more inviting carpet in sales areas.

**I. In-Store Promotion**  
As you enter a supermarket, you might see large, colorful pictures of delicious food, which can make you hungry if you haven't eaten before shopping. In the U.S., some supermarkets are testing ""video trolleys"" that show ads for products while you shop. These trolleys aim to attract impulse buyers and can increase sales by about 30%."
CAE_26,"**Sea, Ice & Rock**

Chris Bonnington, 58, is famous for climbing Mount Everest in 1985. He has also created new climbing routes in Britain and the Alps and has written many books, such as *Quest for Adventure* and *Everest the Hard Way*. Robin Knox-Johnston, 53, started his career at sea in the Merchant Navy. In 1968-69, he became the first person to sail around the world alone in his yacht, Sunhaili. He also set a record for crossing the Atlantic Ocean, taking just 10 days to sail from New York to the Lizard in England.

Chris and Robin worked together to sail and climb in Greenland, and they wrote about their journey in their new book, *Sea, Ice and Rock*. In 1979, while Chris was working on *Quest for Adventure*, he called Robin for an interview. Robin invited Chris to join him for a sail. Chris could teach Robin some climbing techniques, and Robin could teach Chris the basics of sailing. It was Chris's first time on a yacht. They sailed for a while and then anchored. Robin's wife and daughter stayed on the boat while Chris and Robin paddled to shore to practice climbing.

The climbing route was challenging, but Chris was impressed by how steady Robin was in difficult conditions. When they reached a steep drop, Chris asked Robin if he had ever climbed before. Robin had not, so Chris showed him how to do it. Robin politely asked if he could climb down using the ropes from his boat, as he was used to using his arms. Chris preferred that he use his legs, but Robin managed to lower himself safely.

During their trip to Skye, Chris and Robin formed a strong friendship. Robin suggested they combine their skills for a trip to Greenland, which was a big step from their Skye adventure. Chris admired Robin as a leader. Normally, the captain makes all the decisions, but Robin asked for everyone's input first. Although most crew members were hesitant to give advice, it felt good to be part of the decision-making.

Chris found sailing challenging and sometimes boring. He preferred the excitement of crisis moments, but he struggled with spending many days at sea. He is more comfortable on land and not very handy. In contrast, Robin enjoyed sailing and fixing things on the boat. Chris sometimes felt useless, especially since there were six people on a 32-foot yacht meant for four. On a mountain expedition, there is more space to be alone.

When they reached Greenland and it was Chris's turn to lead the expedition, he felt nervous about being responsible for Robin's safety. There were times when if Robin fell, he could pull Chris down with him. Chris underestimated how hard it would be to climb the Cathedral, Greenland's highest mountain. Robin is not a natural climber, which made his efforts even more impressive. The first time they tried to reach the top, they climbed for 24 hours. On the way down, they were so tired that they almost fell asleep on steep slopes, 1,500 feet above the ground. Robin trusted Chris completely and followed him. When it became too difficult, Chris decided they had to turn back, and Robin accepted this. 

Chris knew Robin was worried about their boat and whether it would be safe in the ice, but Robin still wanted to try climbing the mountain again. The only time they had a serious disagreement was on the yacht on the way home. They were taking turns keeping watch. Chris was supposed to wake up at 4 am for his shift, but Robin chose not to wake him, thinking he could handle it alone. Chris had almost fallen asleep the night before and felt that Robin did not trust him. He expressed his feelings, and Robin quickly reassured him that he had misunderstood the situation.

While they enjoyed their trip to Skye, they truly got to know each other during the Greenland expedition. Chris discovered that beneath Robin's tough exterior, he was a kind and sensitive person."

CAE_30,"Richard Nerurkar, a long-distance runner from Britain, visits a training camp in Kenya. This camp is located ten miles south of the equator, on a mountain path that leads to Mount Kenya, the highest peak in the country. For the past three years, Nerurkar has trained in Kenya's Central Highlands during the winter, but he had never trained with Kenyan runners before. On his latest trip, he decided to change that. He participated in his first race in Kenya and stayed at the national team training camp, where the best Kenyan runners prepare for the World Cross-Country Team Championships. He was invited by the national team coach after finishing fifth in the World Championship 10,000 meters race.

Training at high altitude helps runners produce more red blood cells, which improves their ability to carry oxygen. This has contributed to the success of many Kenyan runners. Nerurkar's first race in Africa was also significant because it was the first international cross-country race held on the continent. He finished behind 41 runners, most of whom were Kenyan, but he felt he had performed well.

Nerurkar believes that Kenyan success is not only due to the altitude. Kenyan runners have a simple and relaxed approach to running, and they genuinely enjoy competing. He wanted to learn more about their training methods, so he stayed at the national team camp at St Mark's College, located 6,200 feet up Mount Kenya. The camp is basic, with athletes living in shared dormitories with college students.

The daily routine at the camp includes three workouts: a morning run, interval training in the mid-morning, and a steady run in the late afternoon. Each day, they run about 40 kilometers, except on Sundays when they run 20 kilometers. Life at the camp is simple, with minimal preparation for meals. Breakfast includes tea, bread, and boiled eggs, while lunch and dinner consist of ugali (a maize dish), stew, cabbage or spinach, and tea. After running, they often go to bathe in streams from Mount Kenya's glaciers.

By the end of his stay, Nerurkar gained a deeper appreciation for Kenyan runners. Their success cannot be explained by genetics, upbringing, or altitude alone. He believes that the simplicity of their mountain lifestyle, their hard training, and their passion for running are key reasons for Kenya's dominance in long-distance running."
CAE_7,"**The Challenges of Mass Marketing**

Almost everyone knows that advertising is struggling. This problem is not just because of the recession; advertising started to decline in early 1989, before the recession really affected the economy. The truth is that advertising has not kept up with changes in the economy. Advertisers often think about large audiences and mass media, but as more brands and media options have appeared, audiences have become smaller and more specific. Even campaigns for well-known brands should focus on smaller groups, but they usually do not. This is a major reason why advertising is not working well.

Think about your own shopping habits. When you go to a supermarket, you might buy 30, 40, or even 50 items. Most of these items are not from advertised brands, and you may buy several of the same brand. In total, you probably only buy a few advertised brands from the thousands available in the store. Over a year, you might buy only a few hundred different brands. For big items like cars, you might only buy one every three years, and many people get their cars from their jobs. You also do not buy many clothes, and most of them are not from advertised brands. In total, you likely do not buy more than 400 different brands in a year, even when you include all types of products and services.

Now, compare that to the 32,500 brands and services that are advertised. If we ignore the 23,000 brands that spend very little on advertising, we focus on about 9,500 brands that are analyzed. The average person buys only 400 of these brands, which is about 4 percent. This means that a large part of advertising is not effective. When you watch TV, count how many ads are for brands you buy or might buy. Most people find that only about 6 percent of the ads are relevant to them, meaning that 94 percent of the ads are likely wasted.

You might think you are different and that you are not influenced by advertising, but most people feel the same way. The reality is that most people do not buy the brands they see advertised. There is always some waste in advertising because not everyone who sees an ad will buy the product. However, advertising can still be effective. Many ads have shown that they work. Advertisers need to reach a large number of people to find the few who will respond, as they cannot know in advance who will be interested.

Even with careful targeting, advertisers cannot know exactly who will respond to their ads. For example, a direct mail campaign will never get a 100 percent response rate. This is different from face-to-face selling, where a salesperson might succeed with every potential customer they talk to. If advertisers knew exactly who would respond, they would not need to use mass media at all; they could contact those people directly.

Any advertiser who can attract one million new customers, which is about 2 percent of the adult population, is doing well. For popular products like soap powder, the top brands would be very happy with a million extra customers. Therefore, any advertising campaign that can reach more than 2 percent of the population is considered very successful, even though that is still a small part of the total population. To improve advertising effectiveness, the messages need to be more focused on specific audiences than ever before."
CAE_43,"**Simplified Text:**

Solar Survivor Charles Clover visits one of the most environmentally-friendly homes in Britain. This house is located in Southwell, Nottinghamshire, which has some interesting features. The first is Southwell Minster, a little-known ancient cathedral famous for its carvings of 'green' men made by medieval craftsmen. The second surprise is the 'autonomous house,' built by Robert and Brenda Vale. 

The Vales have created a home that uses rainwater for washing and drinking, recycles sewage into compost for the garden, and heats the house using waste heat from their electrical appliances and their own body heat, along with that of their three teenage children and two cats, Edison and Faraday. The house looks traditional, with a clay tile roof, and is located 300 yards from the Minster. It was designed to match the orange brick of the town's older buildings and was approved by planners even though it is in a conservation area.

When you ring the solar-powered doorbell, you will notice it is very quiet inside. The house is well-insulated, with special windows that keep out noise. Once inside, you must take off your shoes, as Robert insists on this. The house feels peaceful, especially on a sunny summer day when the windows are closed and the conservatory warms the air before it circulates through the house. Robert opens clever ventilation shafts and windows to create airflow because the house is designed to be airtight. Even the cats have their own small air-locked door.

The Vales, who teach architecture at Nottingham University, have cared about the environment for many years. They wrote a book on green architecture in the 1970s called The Autonomous House. They aimed to create a building that produced no carbon dioxide and eventually decided to also avoid using mains water. They designed special toilets that compost waste, installed rainwater tanks in the cellar, and used copper gutters to keep drinking water clean, filtering it before use. Water from washing goes into the garden, and they do not use a dishwasher because they believe it is wrong to use strong detergents.

Robert explains, ""We wanted to show that it is possible to design a house that is much better for the environment without living in darkness."" The only medieval feature of the house is its design, with a hall that goes up to the top of the building. The Vales do not pay for water, and last winter, their house used only nine units of electricity a day, costing about 70p. This is much less than what other four-bedroom houses use for heating.

Soon, they will install solar panels in the garden, which will help the house generate more electricity. The house will still use mains electricity for cooking and appliances but will produce extra electricity, enough to charge an electric car in the future. The only heating source is a small wood-burning stove in the hall, which they rarely use except during very cold weather. 

When Charles visited in February, Robert said it was too warm to light the fire. The temperature on the first floor was 18°C, which is lower than usual for living areas, but Robert felt comfortable because there were no drafts and everything felt the same temperature. He compares this to how people in the early 1900s felt comfortable at 12.5°C because of their warm clothing. 

The secret to the house's comfort is that it uses simple technology, making it easy to maintain. Most materials were bought from local suppliers and installed by local workers, which kept the building costs low, similar to affordable rental housing. This idea is not popular with commercial building companies, who are resistant to change."
CAE_51,"**The Camera Never Lies**

Arthur Conan Doyle, the writer of the Sherlock Holmes stories, thought of himself as a rational and scientific person. However, in 1920, he saw photographs of fairies taken in a garden and believed they were real proof of these tiny creatures. He published these photos with an article where he accepted fairies as magical beings. 

It was not until 1939 that the two women who took the photos confessed they were fake. They had simply cut out pictures of fairies from a book and placed them among flowers. The photos looked beautiful, but the simple trick showed that a basic idea about photography is wrong: that the camera cannot lie. In fact, it can, and it always has been able to. 

Today, we often use computer software to change our digital images, and it is a myth that photography ever had a time when it was completely honest. From the very beginning, when cameras started capturing images, those images were being changed."
CAE_11,"**Blacksmiths**

Throughout history, iron has captured human imagination, and blacksmiths, who work with it, have often been seen as more than just skilled workers. Before the Industrial Revolution, blacksmiths were respected like doctors and astrologers because they made weapons, armor, and farming tools. They were also celebrated as artists. In the 18th century, blacksmiths created beautiful ironwork for St Paul's Cathedral, and the elegant metal designs in French and Belgian Art Nouveau buildings were made by talented blacksmiths.

However, by the late 1960s, the number of blacksmiths in Britain had greatly decreased because heavy industry no longer needed their skills, and modern architects rarely used beautiful wrought-iron features. In the last 10 years, there has been a revival of interest in decorative architecture and more creative interior design. Still, much of the new work looks similar to past styles, with manufacturers promoting their products as ""classical"" or ""Victorian-style."" You can find trendy design stores filled with rusty candlesticks and similar items.

Fortunately, there are new opportunities for blacksmiths, and several events are planned to promote their craft. The first event is an exhibition of forged ironwork by members of the British Artist Blacksmiths Association (BABA), which opened last week at the Fire & Iron gallery in Leatherhead, Surrey. Alan Dawson, the secretary of BABA, believes we might be starting a new Iron Age, as both the public and blacksmiths are becoming more aware of the craft. 

Power tools have made it easier for blacksmiths to work with metal, allowing them to bend, twist, and weld it more easily. Dawson explains that these artists now have the tools to express their creativity. About 250 pieces are displayed in the exhibition, including bookends and a spiral staircase, with prices starting at £90 and going up to much higher amounts. Most of the money will go to the individual makers, but a portion will be kept by the Association to promote good ironwork.

Dawson has created an eight-foot gate and a lamp with a glass shade. He describes his style as letting steel bend and take shape when it’s hot, comparing it to drawing with metal in space. Many artists are fascinated by iron. Unlike other metals that are soft when cold, iron and steel are tougher and more challenging to work with. Susan May, a trained jeweler, finds it magical because it is soft when hot but becomes hard and unmovable when it cools down.

Ann Catrin Evans creates door knockers and handles from mild steel, inspired by the dark castles often seen in horror films. One of her designs looks like a ball and chain, and another resembles a Celtic cross. She loves the cold, hard feel of steel and how it seems to last forever. No other metal has given people as much visual pleasure or a sense of security. It is likely that iron will continue to be used for decorative purposes for many years to come, as long as we can avoid more rusty candlesticks!"
CAE_14,"**The Day I Gave Up Smoking**

I thought everyone would be happy when I stopped smoking, but one of my colleagues was very angry. She shouted, ""What do you mean? If it was that easy, why didn't you stop years ago?"" I found it hard to explain how I went from being a heavy smoker to not smoking at all in just a few hours. It was a bit annoying for me too. 

The stop-smoking session I attended was a mix of group therapy and hypnotherapy, and it happened two months and three weeks ago. I didn’t plan to stop smoking, and I didn’t really want to. I felt pressured by anti-smoking groups, and I still do. I also had low blood pressure and a healthy family. I didn’t cough or feel sick, and I seemed to recover from colds faster than my friends who lived healthier lives.

On that ordinary Thursday afternoon, I went to the Birmingham session of ""The Easy Way to Stop Smoking"" to write an article about others trying to quit. I said, ""I won’t be trying to stop myself; I’m just here to write."" I thought this was a reasonable approach because I enjoyed smoking and found pleasure in it. The counsellor seemed to understand me.

During the session, we were encouraged to smoke as much as we wanted, and the room was so full of smoke that we had to open the windows. I noticed that when I was told to smoke, I didn’t want to, and neither did the others. I think the messages about stopping smoking started to make sense to me. Just as smoking had become a challenge against opposition, the idea of quitting began to feel appealing. The thought of not being a smoker made me feel strong. It was a personal feeling that was just for me. 

In many ways, quitting was easy. The physical cravings for nicotine, which felt like hunger, went away after a minute or two and lasted only four or five days. I thought my work would be the hardest part without cigarettes, but it turned out to be fine. I had worried that I wouldn’t be able to meet deadlines without nicotine and that I would fail to write a story. Surprisingly, the hardest part was doing simple things at home on weekend mornings. 

I’ve come to realize that smoking helped me deal with boredom; having a cigarette was an activity in itself. Yes, I do miss smoking, but not too much. Every new experience as a non-smoker is something I have to get used to—like eating out, waiting for a plane, checking into a hotel, or during a theatre break. These are all moments when I would have smoked before."
CAE_63,"**Dorothy Who?**

Dorothy Hodgkin is the only British woman scientist to win a Nobel Prize, yet many people in Britain do not know her name. For the past four years, I have been asking friends if they know about her. If they respond with surprise and say something like, ""Isn't there already a biography?"" they pass my test. 

Why should people in Britain know about Dorothy Hodgkin? She is important because she is the only British woman scientist to win a Nobel Prize. If someone in literature had this achievement, they would be very famous. Hodgkin, who passed away in 1994, was an extraordinary person, much like the crystals she studied. Her life shows significant changes in the 20th century, including the progress of women's education and the global nature of science.

When I started my research, I wanted to read scientific biographies. A friend of Hodgkin suggested I look for a biography of Linus Pauling, who was a close friend of hers and also a Nobel Prize winner. However, when I went to the bookstore, I found that there were no biographies of Pauling available. I was surprised that he was not considered interesting enough for British readers, even though he was a very important chemist.

Even scientists sometimes think that biographies about scientists are not interesting. Peter Medawar, another Nobel Prize winner, once said that the lives of scientists are often dull. If scientists believe this, it is not surprising that publishers and bookstores feel the same way. This idea that scientists are different from artists and writers is a common belief, and it means that only a few famous scientists get biographies.

It is not true that scientists have less interesting lives than artists, writers, or politicians. Some scientists are very careful about their public image. For example, a well-known geneticist said he would only talk about his work if he was not quoted or photographed, as he did not want to seem like he was promoting himself. This attitude can make science seem less appealing to young people and can create distrust among the public.

Fortunately, things are changing. Nowadays, scientists often appear in the media in ways that are not just about their research. For example, Professor Richard Dawkins gives out awards on a TV quiz show, and geneticist Steve Jones appears in car commercials. These activities help people see scientists as real individuals, not just researchers.

The world of publishing is also changing. Scientific biographies used to be very serious and often ignored the personal lives of scientists. However, this has changed with books like Richard Feynman's ""Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman?"", which is both funny and touching. Recently, even famous scientists like Isaac Newton, Charles Darwin, Albert Einstein, and Marie Curie have been shown with their flaws, making them more relatable.

Dorothy Hodgkin was dedicated to her scientific work. She made significant discoveries, including the structures of penicillin and vitamin B12, which earned her the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1964, and insulin, which her team solved in 1969. She was also a devoted mother of three and had a husband who was often away due to his job as a historian. While her personal life may not seem directly related to her work, it shows how she balanced different parts of her life.

There is much to learn from her life, but her scientific achievements are also important. Hodgkin's passion for science was central to her success, and explaining this passion is a challenge for biographers. Many readers may not have enough scientific knowledge to understand complex ideas without detailed explanations. However, understanding science is not harder than reading Shakespeare or learning a new language; it just requires effort.

It is unfortunate that educated people who would feel embarrassed not to know a famous writer or artist often do not recognize the contributions of scientists like Dorothy Hodgkin."
CAE_56,"**Margaret and Her Water-Finding Skills**

Margaret Wilkins is known for having a special ability, often called a ""sixth sense."" She can use a forked hazel stick to find water underground. Farmers whose wells have dried up are increasingly asking for her help. Along with her husband, Margaret runs a well-drilling business that uses modern tools like drilling rigs and air-compressed hammers. However, to find water, she relies only on her hazel stick. The couple has a success rate of over 90%.

This ability to find water, minerals, and lost objects underground is known as dowsing. There are many theories about how it works, from scientific ideas like magnetism to spiritual beliefs. One of the most believable theories suggests that everything on Earth vibrates, and water vibrates more than other materials. Some dowsers believe they can sense these vibrations, while others say they can smell water, as smell is a very strong sense.

Recently, during dry years, Margaret has been very busy, with a waiting list of almost six weeks. Most of her customers are farmers with dry wells. She explains, ""We usually see customers only once because wells last a long time."" Other customers include people with remote cottages or barns that have become holiday homes, where it is too expensive to run water pipes over long distances. There are also golf-course developers who need water for their clubhouses.

Margaret looks for water between 50 and 70 meters deep. She explains, ""You can't drill a well if there is a risk of waste getting into the water supply. The water we find is in cracks of solid rock, and if we bring it up correctly, it should be clean. However, in Cornwall, there are many minerals, so we have to be careful about iron.""

Another important factor is electricity to run the pump, which can be costly if the well is far from power sources. After considering these factors, Margaret begins her search for water. For large areas like golf courses, she starts with a map and a pendulum. She holds the pendulum still and moves it over the map. It will swing when she is above an area with water.

Once she has identified possible locations on the map, Margaret walks over the fields with her hazel stick, which is forked and equal in size on both sides. ""When I am above water, I feel a strange sensation; I sway a little. When that feeling goes away, I use the stick to find the exact spot to drill."" She holds the two forks of the stick with both hands and pulls them slightly apart to create tension. ""When water is directly below, the straight part of the stick rises. It is crucial to drill exactly where the stick indicates. If we drill even a little off, we might miss the water completely.""

Margaret's husband also checks the same area. Usually, but not always, they agree on the exact drilling spot. If they disagree, they will not drill and will keep searching until they find a common agreement.

Margaret Wilkins is not alone in her unique skill; many anthropologists and writers have been intrigued by this mysterious ability. She describes it as an ""intuitive perception of the environment,"" which is the best way to explain how she finds water so accurately. If she did not have this ""sixth sense,"" it would be hard to understand how her family could continue to succeed in their well-drilling business year after year."
CAE_36,"**We Changed Lives for a Day!**

Have you ever thought about living someone else's life for a day? It could be fun to try something completely different! We arranged this for four people. Here’s what happened.

**Amanda's Story**

Amanda is 23 and a mother of two daughters. She swapped lives with her friend Cindy, who is 30 and works as a waitress in a busy restaurant in London. 

Amanda had never been in a place like that before. It was dark, loud, and full of people. It was very different from her quiet hometown, and she felt nervous. Being a mother is busy, but waitressing was a whole new challenge! She had only fifteen minutes to learn how to carry a tray of drinks. The other waitresses made it look easy, but when Amanda tried, the drinks slipped off the tray and spilled everywhere. She felt embarrassed, but the other waitresses laughed and told her it happens to everyone.

By 11:30 am, there was a long line of customers waiting to get in, and Amanda felt even more nervous. Luckily, the orders were taken automatically, so she didn’t have to remember them all. After a few hours, her feet hurt, and she struggled to hear customers over the loud music. She often had to ask them to repeat themselves, which was embarrassing. By the end of her shift at 5 pm, she was exhausted and just wanted to soak her feet in hot water. One waitress told her it had been a ""quiet"" day, and Amanda realized how tiring waitressing could be. She thought it was an easy job, but it actually requires a lot of energy and a friendly attitude. Amanda felt relieved to return to her children, as being a mother seemed much easier after her day as a waitress!

**Cindy's Story**

Cindy is 30 and was nervous about being a mother for a day, but she was also excited. She knew Amanda's daughters could be cheeky, but she thought she could handle it. 

After Amanda left for the restaurant, Cindy had to get the two girls dressed and fed. After dropping Sophie at school and Katie at nursery, she thought she would have some quiet time. But she was wrong! Amanda reminded her that she still had to clean the house and do laundry. 

At 1 pm, Cindy picked up Katie, went shopping, and then took her home for lunch. When she brought Sophie home from school, things got chaotic. The girls turned the couch into a trampoline and screamed loudly while playing. Cindy thought they would tire out, but they had more energy than she expected! After a lot of effort, she finally got them to bed by 8 pm, but then the fun continued. The girls kept asking for water, just to come downstairs and watch TV. Cindy realized how tiring it is to take care of two small children. She had no time for herself, and the responsibility felt overwhelming. Still, she enjoyed the day.

**Rosemary's Story**

Rosemary is 42 and runs a dairy farm. She swapped lives with Hilary, who is 30 and a primary school teacher. 

On the farm, Rosemary usually wakes up at 5:30 am, but on this day, she got to sleep in until 7 am. She was nervous about how to dress for school, so she tried to blend in. At assembly, she hoped no one would notice her. 

In class, the children worked in small groups, which was different from Rosemary's school days. She helped with a nature project about snails. By lunchtime, she was tired and looked forward to a break, but teachers only have about five minutes to eat. After lunch, she attended a staff meeting and helped with athletics trials. The hardest part was speaking in front of the class, even for just two minutes. Although teachers have more holidays, Rosemary decided she prefers farming.

**Hilary's Story**

Hilary arrived at Rosemary's farm at 8:30 am, only to find that Rosemary had been working for three hours already! Rosemary's farm is large, with many cows and sheep. 

Hilary spent the morning in the ice-cream shop, filling milk containers and making ice cream. She had to resist eating the treats! At lunchtime, she checked on the sheep and helped a ewe that had fallen over. If sheep are not checked daily, they can die. After feeding the calves, Hilary started milking, which took two and a half hours. Rosemary does this twice a day, every day of the year!

Hilary found the day lonely and missed being around children, as animals don’t talk back. She realized that farming is not as easy as it seems. The work is constant, and it’s hard to take time off. Rosemary only gets about three days of vacation each year. Farming may look romantic, but the reality is very different, with an unpredictable income and dependence on the weather."
CAE_6,"A trumpet isn't just for Christmas... It is interesting how many musicians, even famous ones, come from families without music. Hakan Hardenberger, the only son of parents who did not play music in a small town in southern Sweden, has become a unique trumpet player at the age of 30. His recordings are introducing new music, including concertos by forgotten composers from the baroque and classical periods, as well as new pieces. When you meet him, he looks younger than his age, with a bright and friendly personality, just like the sound of the trumpet.

Recently, he performed the Hummel Trumpet Concerto in one of London’s top concert halls. He also had a feature on television about his work and growth, filmed in both London and Sweden. Born near Malmo, his music career began with a Christmas gift when he was eight years old. His father, who did not play music but liked Louis Armstrong, decided to give his son a real trumpet instead of a toy. The gift was a success, and the boy played constantly. His mother found the second trumpet player in the Malmo Symphony Orchestra and convinced him to give her son lessons. Bo Nilsson, the teacher, quickly recognized Hakan's natural talent. Hardenberger is grateful to have had such a passionate teacher from the beginning, someone who loved the trumpet and sought out players from around the world.

Hardenberger explains that the trumpet is a simple instrument, and it is impossible to make a perfect one. There will always be some imperfections, and no two mouthpieces are exactly alike. He believes it is important to understand these imperfections and learn to work with them. From the start, he had a special ability to find the right balance and connect with the instrument. He notes that even as a child, his unique sound was already noticeable, which was the first thing he developed.

Unlike John Wallace, another famous trumpet player who started in brass bands and orchestras, Hardenberger has always seen himself as a solo artist. He admired the French trumpeter Maurice Andre and bought all his records. His parents supported his dream of becoming a trumpet player and allowed him to practice as much as he wanted. At 15, it was time to decide where he would study. Although Bo Nilsson wanted him to go to America, it was considered too far and dangerous, so at 16, he went to Paris to study with Pierre Thibaud. Thibaud also believed that playing in an orchestra was not as fulfilling as being a soloist.

Hardenberger knew he played better than many of his peers, but it was only after entering a competition at 17 that he realized he had a special talent for connecting with the audience. Thibaud suggested he enter the competition for experience. Hardenberger prepared only for the first round but made it to the second. Fortunately, he already knew most of the pieces for that round too. When he reached the final, he faced a concerto that had intimidated him before. He did not win first prize, but he enjoyed the performance and realized that even if he felt he played poorly, people were still listening.

Hardenberger's honest view of his work might seem arrogant, but that is not the case. He thoughtfully avoids trying to explain what makes his communication with the audience special, saying that doing so might ruin it. He believes the power of music lies in its ability to move people."
CAE_33,"**New In Paperback**

Rebecca Cripps meets five women who talk about their different jobs, including the good and bad parts and what a typical day looks like for them.

**A. THE BRAIN SURGEON**  
**Name:** Anne  
**Age:** 34  

**ANNE'S DAY**  
""I wake up at 6:30 am, go to the gym at 7 am, and arrive at work by 8 am. I start surgeries at 8:30 am. I perform surgeries all day on Mondays and Wednesdays, and sometimes on Friday afternoons. Most brain surgeries take about three hours, but some can last all day. There are times when I work for ten hours without eating or taking a break. Deciding when to operate can be stressful. I don’t feel stressed during surgery, but I sometimes worry about the next day. Brain surgery is often a last option for patients, but when it is successful, it feels amazing, even if it doesn’t always work. From 10 am to 1 pm, I see outpatients and explain the surgeries to them. I enjoy this and find it easy to talk to patients. If they get upset, I try to comfort them, but time pressure can make this hard. I usually leave work between 6 pm and 8 pm. Some nights and weekends, I am on call, and I always carry my pager. When I’m on holiday, I worry about my patients for the first few days, and I often dream about operating. I find it hard to relax.""

**B. THE SENIOR DESIGNER**  
**Name:** Marita  
**Age:** 31  

**MARITA'S DAY**  
""I wake up at 7:45 am, leave home by 8:20 am, and take the train to work, arriving at 9:15 am. On Mondays at 10:30 am, we have a meeting to discuss our work and any problems. I work in a team with three senior designers, a partner, and a junior designer. My job is mostly about production, with only 10 to 15 percent being actual design work. I receive a brief from the client, and if they have clear ideas, I spend three to four weeks designing and developing the project. After that, I present my ideas to the client. Once they approve, we create budgets and I start hiring photographers and illustrators. I also work with printers to ensure everything is done on time. Managing people is a big part of my job, and I need to communicate well with everyone. When their work comes in, I put everything together and send it to the printers. Juggling several projects can be very stressful, and deadlines are always tight. I usually have lunch at 1 pm for an hour, and we often go to a pub. If the client likes my designs, it feels great, but it’s disappointing when a project gets rejected. I usually get home by 7:30 pm, but sometimes it’s much later. I find it hard to relax after a busy day.""

**C. THE CHAUFFEUR**  
**Name:** Linda  
**Age:** 42  

**LINDA'S DAY**  
""I usually wake up around 7 am, but on some days, I have to get up between 4:30 am and 5 am to meet long-haul flights. At 10:30 or 11 am, I might go for a bike ride or swim. Since chauffeuring is a sitting job, I need to watch my diet and exercise. I usually have a big breakfast and snack during the day. People often ask for my recommendations for restaurants or shops, so I need to know the area well. Many jobs are pre-booked, which helps me plan my routes. Not all passengers are polite; some can be rude, but most are nice, and I have good relationships with my regular clients. Sometimes I hear private conversations in the car, but I focus on driving. I work seven days a week, up to fifteen hours a day, so I have to be careful not to get too tired. I try to go to bed by 11 pm.""

**D. THE LANDSCAPE GARDENER**  
**Name:** Tracy  
**Age:** 27  

**TRACY'S DAY**  
""I wake up around 7 am, leave home at 7:30 am, and go to my first job. My assistant and I mainly maintain gardens we designed. We do some commercial work, but most is in private gardens, spending about an hour and a half at each place. Around 11 am, we take a break and go to a local café for breakfast. In summer, I might work until 10 pm, and in winter until 4:30 pm. I have a home office, so when I return, I check messages and calls. If someone wants a new garden, I usually set up a meeting in the evening. We focus on using old materials to make gardens look historic. Sometimes clients have strange ideas, but it’s very satisfying to see a garden we created bloom. I find it hard to relax in the evenings because I can hear the business phone ringing. I sleep well because my job is physically demanding, and I’m always tired at the end of the day.""

**E. THE CIVIL ENGINEER**  
**Name:** Zena  
**Age:** 27  

**ZENA'S DAY**  
""I arrive at the construction site by 8:30 am. I am the assistant resident engineer, overseeing the building of bridges and a retaining wall. I check that the contractors are following the schedule and safety rules while minimizing environmental impact. I help coordinate the site workers and solve any problems. The contractors start at 6 am, so my first task is to find out what happened since I left the night before. The rest of my day depends on what I learn from the clerk of works. I usually have paperwork to review or design questions to answer. I take a half-hour lunch break between 2 pm and 2:30 pm, but I often eat on the go. Since we check the contractors' work, it can create tension, so we need to maintain a good relationship. I see the resident engineer once a day, but if something urgent comes up, I act immediately. I usually leave the site around 6 pm and am on call all the time."""

**A. Credit Card Executive**  
I wake up at 6 am and get to the office by 7:30 am. I manage programs for our credit card users, including the Membership Rewards scheme in Europe. My job involves keeping in touch with current card users, finding new ones, and building relationships with partner companies. I spend the first 45 minutes organizing my day and then respond to emails. I work with marketing staff and advertising agencies to plan our advertising strategy. I have many meetings throughout the day, but I keep my door open for anyone who has questions. I travel to different European markets once or twice a week to discuss any issues. When I’m in London, I usually leave work between 6:30 pm and 7:00 pm.

**B. Record Company Executive**  
I start work at 10:00 am and check the mail, which includes about ten to twenty demo tapes, letters from producers, concert information, and invoices. The phone starts ringing around 10:30 am with calls from producers and publishers. I have meetings throughout the day to discuss projects for artists, which may involve the press and marketing teams. When I listen to demo tapes, I know that these are important to the artists, so I try to give helpful feedback. Once I sign a band, we begin working on their first album, choosing songs and a producer. I also manage budgets and spending. I usually leave work by 7:00 pm and often go to concerts, sometimes seeing up to five new bands in one night. I often don’t get home until 1:00 am, when I listen to music to relax.

**C. Sales Director**  
I wake up at 8:00 am and drive to work, arriving by 9:30 am. I check the mail and my schedule to see if we have any clients visiting. I enjoy showing customers around the showroom and selling furniture. We sell antiques that cost between £1,000 and £6,000, and we buy from various sources. Many items need restoration, so I work with restorers and other specialists. I read the Antiques Trade Gazette while drinking coffee to stay updated on the business. I handle accounts once a month and do tax returns every three months. I usually go home at 5:30 pm, and it takes me about an hour to relax after work.

**D. Air Traffic Controller**  
I work on a set shift schedule. On early shifts, I leave home at 6:00 am and start work at 7:00 am, taking over from the night shift. I control aircraft movements with a team, working at different stations for about an hour and a half at a time. In winter, we manage around 1,000 movements a day, and even more in summer. Night shifts are quieter, and I often read about new air traffic rules during those hours. This job can be stressful, and I take sick days if I feel unwell. I hope to become a watch manager and eventually the general manager of the airport.

**E. Shop Manager**  
If I have an early shift, I leave home by 8:00 am. I start by setting up the electronic point-of-sale system and making sure someone is at the till. I spend the morning helping customers find and order books. I enjoy serving customers, but it can be challenging when they expect me to gather many books quickly. From 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm, publishers’ representatives visit, and I discuss new titles with them. I need to decide how many copies of each title we should order. I finish my early shift at 5:45 pm. On two days a week, I work late, closing the computer system and locking up before going home.

**F. Financial Analyst**  
I listen to the news at 7:00 am, then get up and take a taxi to work, arriving by 8:45 am. I contact freelance reporters to find out what is happening in my area. I assess financial risks for companies operating abroad, warning clients about potential problems. I provide three services: an online newsflash, a security forecast, and a travel information security guide. From 9:15 am to 9:30 am, I meet with editors to discuss the stories I will cover. I have tight deadlines, with my first report due by 10:00 am and the second by 11:00 am. I travel to Africa about three times a year to report on events. I usually leave work around 6:00 pm, but it can be hard to relax, and I often stay awake until 1:00 am."
CAE_45,"**Career Power: Take Control at Work**

**A. What Makes a Good Leader?**  
A good leader inspires others and helps create change. Leadership is not about being tall or having a high IQ. According to Pat Dixon, author of *Making the Difference: Women and Men in the Workplace*, leadership is about getting things done with the help of enthusiastic people. A good leader should communicate clearly and confidently. Dixon says it’s important to say ""I believe"" instead of ""I think.""

**B. Discovering Your Leadership Potential**  
John van Maurik, who runs a Leadership in Management course, believes that most people have more leadership potential than they realize. Becoming a leader means recognizing and developing your hidden talents. In a way, we are all born leaders; we just need the right environment to grow. While it’s easy to see leadership in famous figures like Emmeline Pankhurst or Mahatma Gandhi, it can be harder to see it in our own workplaces. However, leadership is now seen as essential for good management.

**C. Comparing Bosses**  
Think about the best and worst boss you’ve had. They might have been equally good at setting goals and meeting deadlines. But how did they achieve these goals? The best leader motivated you and provided support. The worst leader made you feel unimportant and blamed you when things went wrong. The first was a great leader; the second was a poor manager.

**D. Leaders vs. Managers**  
Leaders and managers are different. Managers like to work within set rules, while leaders create new opportunities. Micheal Shea, author of *Leadership Rules*, says a good manager can keep a company running smoothly, but a good leader can change a struggling organization for the better.

**E. Improving Your Leadership Skills**  
Whether you are a boss or a middle manager, you can improve your leadership skills. Here are some tips:  
- Leadership works best when you choose to lead. Find what you are passionate about and act on it when you feel inspired.  
- Start seeing yourself as a leader. Your ability to lead is an important part of who you are.  
- Collaboration is good, but sometimes strong leadership is needed. Try different leadership styles. If you usually ask for others' opinions, try taking charge instead. Notice how this changes the results.  
- Set goals and strive to achieve them. Identify areas in your job where being a leader can improve your effectiveness and career.

**F. Developing Leadership Skills**  
- Leadership doesn’t just happen; it develops through taking charge, taking risks, and learning from mistakes. Learn to delegate, motivate, organize, and give feedback.  
- Don’t assume everyone will accept your leadership style right away. Work on your communication skills. You don’t need to be liked, but your ideas should be respected.  
- Be visible and approachable to important people.  
- Remember, you don’t have to lead all the time. Know when your leadership is needed and how you can help others become leaders too."
CAE_64,"**Films on Video: Reviews by Film Critic Nick James**

**A. Abyss**  
Before ""Titanic,"" director James Cameron created a tense Cold War thriller called ""Abyss."" It tells the story of oil workers and navy experts trying to save a nuclear submarine deep underwater. The characters, especially foreman Bud and his team, remind us of tough heroes from older films by Howard Hawks. The film has great production design and special effects, but the dialogue and character development are weak. Despite the skilled filmmaking, the story feels like a typical B-movie.

**B. The Thin Red Line**  
This video release of ""The Thin Red Line,"" based on James Jones's novel about the battle for Guadalcanal, offers a different take compared to Terrence Malick's recent film. While Malick's version is poetic and mystical, Andrew Marton's film is more traditional but often stays true to the book. It focuses on one soldier and his difficult relationship with his tough sergeant. Malick's film is richer and more complex, but Marton's version has its strong moments, especially a flashback where the soldier dreams of his wife.

**C. On Guard**  
""On Guard"" is a fun swashbuckler inspired by Paul Feval's 1875 novel. It stands out from other musketeer films with a great villain played by Fabrice Luchini, who is a sneaky politician causing chaos. Vincent Perez plays a lively hero, and although Daniel Auteuil might be too serious for this type of film, he also has his good moments as a swordsman. The filmmakers use familiar costume-drama elements with so much charm that it doesn't feel boring.

**D. Character**  
""Character"" is a serious story set in early 1900s Rotterdam. The detailed production and costumes make it look like a museum piece. Jan Decleir plays the harsh bailiff Dreverhaven, who is cruel to his tenants. The main conflict is between him and his son, but the filmmakers focus too much on the historical details and not enough on the dark story.

**E. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly**  
This newly re-mastered version of ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" highlights director Leone's skills. The sound editing is excellent, making every sound clear. The story is harsh, and whenever it slows down, Morricone's powerful music brings excitement back. Morally, there isn't much difference between the good (Clint Eastwood), the bad (Lee van Cleef), and the ugly (Ell Wallach), as they all act ruthlessly in the post-Civil War West.

**F. The Longest Day**  
The promotion for ""The Longest Day"" boasts about its ""forty-eight international stars."" With four directors and 23,000 extras, it feels overdone. The early scenes, where experienced soldiers wait for news about the invasion, are slow and drag on for both the audience and the characters. While it is impressive in terms of logistics, it really needs to be seen on a big screen. Watching it on video makes the experience less enjoyable."
CAE_29,"**BOOK A** Steve Martin's *Compelling Evidence* is indeed very interesting. The story follows a lawyer who is trying to start a new practice after leaving a powerful law firm. He ends up defending his boss's wife, who is on trial for her husband's murder. The trial scenes are exciting, and the outcome is uncertain until the very end, with a surprising twist in the last pages. This is a great first book in a popular genre.

**BOOK B** *Curtains for the Cardinal* starts with a strong beginning and follows the charming Sigismondo, a problem-solver for the rich during the Italian Renaissance. He gets caught up in a mix of politics, church secrets, and serious crimes, but we always believe he will find out who is guilty. The plot is complicated, and the book is a bit too long, but it is still very enjoyable.

**BOOK C** *File Under: Deceased* introduces a new detective from first-time author Sarah Lacey. Leah Hunter is a tax inspector who finds herself in a detective role when a strange man collapses at her feet. Despite facing challenges and the disapproval of a handsome local detective, Leah is brave and skilled, making her a great character.

**BOOK D** *Double Deuce* by Robert B. Parker features Spenser, a smart private investigator, who helps his friend Hawk remove drug dealers from a poor neighborhood in Boston. The dialogue is quick and clever, and while there are not many deaths, there is more thoughtful discussion than usual. Parker always provides high-quality entertainment.

**BOOK E** *False Prophet* by Faye Kellermann includes her regular detectives, Pete Decker and Marge Dunn, who investigate a robbery and attack at the home of a famous film star's daughter. The author's easy writing style and attention to unusual human behavior make this an enjoyable mystery.

**BOOK F** *Blood Red, Snow White* is written by husband and wife team Diane Henry and Nicholas Horrock. It features another lawyer and a female client, but the action takes place outside the courtroom, and the lawyer becomes a victim as the story unfolds. The book combines romance, money, and violence to create a gripping suspense novel.

**BOOK G** *Dead for a Ducat* by Simon Shaw features actor Philip Fletcher as a character who is supposed to be the victim. A funny group of characters comes together to film a story about Robin Hood, but Philip feels that this is not the right direction for his career. Simon Shaw usually entertains well, but this time the shift from dark comedy to farce is not as strong as his usual work.

**BOOK H** *Fall Down Easy* is Lawrence Gough's best book in a while. It follows Canadian police as they search for a clever bank robber who targets female bank tellers. The story builds tension slowly and portrays the intelligent but troubled robber, making it stand out from typical detective novels."
CAE_57,"I might be too old for this adventure, but here I go! At 34, Tim Pozzi has left a good job to go backpacking. He thinks about why he and others his age are making this choice. This summer, I quit my job and decided to rent out my flat to travel in South East Asia for a year. You might think I'm lucky, but I'm also nervous. I have traveled before; after university, I spent two years backpacking in North and South America. When I returned, I promised myself I would do it again someday. But then life happened: I fell in love, started a career, bought a flat, and got used to earning a salary. Over time, I realized I was sacrificing my happiness for my job. When I handed in my resignation, it felt like I was taking control of my life again. 

I have no ties now. Many of my friends are married with children, and while they wouldn’t trade places with me, they envy my freedom. I’m not in a relationship and I don’t have strong career goals. I feel I should make the most of this freedom, at least for my friends’ sake! But why am I so nervous? First, I need to make all the arrangements. How can I let someone else live in my home? How do I organize the rental? And I still need to decide where to go. I tend to procrastinate and I’m already behind schedule. I thought, “I might as well enjoy the summer in England,” and then, “Why not wait for the football season to start?”

Letting go of emotional ties makes it harder. I’m delaying because I wonder if I can still handle backpacking. Will I be able to adjust to a simpler way of life? Will I feel out of place among younger backpackers? Maybe not. I’ve noticed that more Britons in their late twenties and thirties want to break free from their lives and travel abroad. Jennifer Cox from Lonely Planet says that more people are realizing that adventure is possible: “People who always say ‘I wish I had that opportunity’ are now understanding they can have it anytime. They just need to be brave, organized, and confident.”

For Danny, a 30-year-old accountant, and his girlfriend Tammy, a 28-year-old teacher, this trip is a chance to enjoy life before settling down. They bought a round-the-world ticket for a year. Danny says, “I’m willing to give up job security for this trip. There’s always a worry that I won’t move up in my career when I return, but I think it’s a risk worth taking. When I left the office, I threw my calculator into the river as a sign of defiance!”

For Matt, who just left the Army, traveling for a year was a time of change. “In the military, there’s a strict way of doing things. I needed to change that to live well as a civilian.” There are many reasons for people my age to travel, but some common factors exist. Angela Baron from the Institute of Personnel Development says, “Today’s workforce is more flexible. Many people work on short-term contracts, so if your contract ends, you have nothing to lose.” Some large companies even have policies for career breaks. “If you’ve invested time and money in training someone, it’s good to know they’ll return instead of going to a competitor.”

Dan Hiscocks, managing director of Travellerseye, says more thirty-somethings are reassessing their lives. “If you’re not happy with your job—and many people aren’t—it’s no longer just about sticking it out. People know there are opportunities, and jobs aren’t permanent anymore. Travel allows you to step back and think about your life.”

Is wanting to travel just a sign that my generation struggles with adulthood? Jennifer Cox doesn’t think so. “It shows a better-educated, more stable society. We care less about just paying bills and more about living a balanced life. We’re taking the time to ask, ‘Is this what I want?’” Ben, a 32-year-old picture researcher going to Central America for a year, believes he’s not running away. “I’m running towards something. I want to grab opportunities for myself.” But he also feels nervous about leaving his comfortable routine of going to the office and chatting with colleagues.

I share Ben’s concerns about leaving a stable life with few challenges. I’m not sure I would be going on this journey if I hadn’t found my boss so difficult. Jennifer Cox points out that this is common. “There’s often a trigger, like a breakup or losing a job, that pushes people to travel.” It took a little push for me to get moving, but I’m now looking forward to the next 12 months with excitement. No matter what happens, I’ll be proud to have taken this step. I believe many of us older backpackers feel the same way."
CAE_42,"**Plugging in the Home**

Georgina McGuiness took a long break from journalism and felt out of touch with new technology. In this article, she shares how she turned her home into an efficient workplace.

The Christmas before last, I turned 37 and realized I needed to revive my journalism career, which I thought was lost due to technology. Looking at my resume, I saw that I was stuck in the 1980s, when typewriters were the latest technology. I felt that no one would trust me to use a computer in a newsroom. Many job ads asked for experience in desktop publishing, which I didn’t have. I thought I would have a better chance of hosting a seminar on nuclear physics than learning to design a page on a computer. I was the family technophobe; even using a calculator was confusing for me, and I still didn’t know how to use the timer on the video.

I knew I had to act quickly to fill the gap in my career. I thought leaving home before my children would be difficult, but then I entered a competition in a local newspaper. To my surprise, my family and I won a computer package. We received a laptop for my husband and a personal computer for the family. We jumped into this new world, and terms like cyberspace, Internet, and surfing became part of our everyday language. We started chatting online with strangers from around the world. The children stopped watching TV, and I set up a small office in the kitchen with a phone, a fax machine, a CD-ROM, and a modem to connect to the Internet. I had everything I needed to work from home while still taking the kids to school.

My children were already comfortable with computers from school, but I was nervous, thinking I would lose my work if I pressed the wrong button. I was wrong. Although I wasn’t very skilled, I learned the basics. It turned out to be logical and easy. With practice, I improved a little every day. I recently started freelancing for a magazine, writing about two articles a month, and I feel proud to have the best of both worlds.

How has the computer helped me? Since school, my desk has always been a mess, and I often lost important papers. The computer has made me more organized, especially with office tasks. I can use spreadsheets to track income and expenses, and ready-made invoices and letterheads save me a lot of time. As a journalist, being online allows me to research stories, ask for information in forums, and discuss the pros and cons of working from home with people worldwide.

However, there are downsides to working from home. You can feel isolated without face-to-face contact. There are also distractions, like household chores, and when the kids are home, we sometimes argue over who gets to use the computer. Still, more people are buying multimedia PCs, not just for education and entertainment, but also for the convenience of avoiding the daily commute to the city.

As we move into the next century, a report called ""PC Usage in UK Homes"" describes the typical computer user: they are 38 years old and well-educated; 93% own a personal computer, 32% have a CD-ROM, 38% have a laser printer, and 50% have a modem. Considering this, I feel I am ahead of the game. Who knows, one day I might be emailing a column to a newspaper in Melbourne or even publishing my own magazine from home. It seems that the possibilities are endless in this digital age."
CAE_59,"**The Tartan Museum**

The Tartan Museum is located in Edinburgh, Scotland, and its modern design stands out against the historic city. Sally Varlow visited the museum just before it opened to see what it had to offer.

You can't miss the new Museum of Scotland. It has a large yellow sandstone tower and unique buildings that look like cheese wedges. Last winter, people had mixed feelings about the building. Some called it a ""masterpiece"" or ""stunning,"" while others were more cautious or even negative. Now, as the museum prepares to open, the exhibitions are also expected to receive mixed reactions.

The museum tells the story of Scotland through many interesting displays. It features important historical objects, like jewels belonging to Mary Queen of Scots and silver from Holyrood chapel. The museum is designed to be enjoyable for everyone, not just experts. Dr. David Clarke, who leads the exhibitions, believes that visitors should have a pleasant visual experience.

Dr. Clarke prefers to show real objects rather than imaginary scenes from the past. He believes that the public deserves to know the truth about history. This means that what you see in the museum is based on what experts have discovered.

However, there is a question about whether the stories of these objects can be told effectively using just explanation panels, captions, and multimedia displays. The museum has around 30 computers to help with this, but it is still uncertain how engaging the experience will be.

Inside the museum, visitors will notice a variety of gallery spaces with pale walls that look like stone. Natural light comes in through special windows and roof lights, creating a pleasant atmosphere to enjoy the displays.

The museum also has a Discovery Centre, thanks to a group of children aged 9 to 12 from all over Scotland. They wanted to create a fun way to explore the exhibits. Although they didn't get to ride through the displays, they did create a hands-on area for children.

The Twentieth Century gallery on the top floor is the only temporary exhibition. It features items chosen by Scottish people that have had a significant impact on life in Scotland during the twentieth century. Suggestions included an electric guitar, televisions, and favorite toys. While this idea is entertaining, it may not address more serious topics.

Dr. Clarke believes that objects can tell stories about the past better than anything else. As for the museum's modern architecture, it looks great from the inside and the top, but whether it fits well in its historic location is still up for debate."
CAE_54,"**The Future of Print Newspapers**

The idea of ""transition"" is often seen as a positive change. It means moving from the present to the future in a smooth way. However, the transition of newspapers to the online world is not so easy. Many people believe that this change will happen eventually because print newspaper sales are falling while visits to their websites are increasing. For example, newspapers like The Daily Telegraph and The Guardian have seen their print sales drop by 8% to 10% each year, while their online traffic continues to grow.

But not everything is clear. A recent survey by the World Association of Newspapers showed that global newspaper circulation actually increased by 1.1% last year, reaching 512 million copies a day. While sales in Western countries have decreased, Asia has seen a rise in sales. News magazines, which many think would struggle in the digital age, reported a 5.4% increase in sales.

The same trend is seen in books. E-readers like Kindle are becoming very popular, with sales rising significantly. However, when bookstores looked at the sales of physical books over the last six months, they found only a small decrease of 0.4%. This suggests that people are buying both digital and physical books.

The idea that young people are completely giving up reading newspapers is not entirely true. Recent data shows that nearly 5 million people aged 15 to 35 still read major national newspapers. Different countries also have different trends. In Britain, print sales have dropped by 10.8%, but in Germany, the decline is only 7%, and in France, it is just 3.1%.

Media experts in the US once believed that online advertising would support the shift to digital newspapers. However, digital ad revenues are now falling, and many major US newspapers have started charging for online access. The best way to attract paying readers seems to be offering both print and digital subscriptions together. This means that print newspapers are still important for selling online subscriptions, as they generate much more advertising revenue than online ads.

Maintaining both a print edition and a website is challenging and costly for newspaper companies. However, print newspapers still have a strong presence, and being noticed online is much harder."
CAE_32,"**Photographing People**

People are the most interesting subjects to photograph. A picture with a person is usually more engaging than one without. However, photographing people can be challenging. Besides technical skills, photographers must pay attention to actions, gestures, and expressions. The camera can sometimes make people act differently.

**A. Grouping People**  
When taking group photos, avoid straight lines. Ask people to stand at different angles and distances. If possible, have some people sit or kneel in front so all faces are visible, or raise your viewpoint.

**B. Posing for Pictures**  
People often feel stiff in front of the camera. Help them relax by suggesting comfortable positions, like folding their hands or putting them in their pockets.

**C. The Right Approach**  
Don’t pretend you are not taking a picture when it’s obvious. This can create tension. Most people will agree to have their picture taken, but they may feel self-conscious. You might need to guide them to look at the camera instead of off to the side.

**D. Eye Contact**  
A picture is more powerful if the subject looks at the viewer. Ask them to look into the lens, and remind them just before you take the shot. You can also say something funny to get a natural reaction.

**E. Candid Concentration**  
Instead of direct eye contact, have the subject focus on something in the picture. This can make them feel more comfortable, and it gives the viewer a sense of observing the subject naturally.

**F. Expressions and Gestures**  
Expressions and gestures reveal a lot about a person. A laughing child can make viewers smile, while a sad face can evoke sympathy. Look for common expressions like shrugs, winks, or smiles; they communicate feelings instantly.

**G. Situation Interest**  
While close-up shots of faces are impactful, the background can add more context. When including a background, avoid distracting details. Use a wide-angle lens to make the subject stand out against the background.

**H. Interaction**  
Capturing moments where people interact, like talking or laughing, can lead to great photos. Look for connections, such as eye contact or physical touch, to show relationships between people.

**I. People and Places**  
Many photos of people are taken during trips. To show both the person and the place, use a wide-angle lens and step back to include the background. Position the subjects close to the camera to create a balanced picture.

**J. To Pose or Not to Pose?**  
Decide why you want to take the picture. If it’s to remember someone, a posed photo might be best. However, family pictures can become boring if they are all formal poses. Candid shots of events are often more lively and memorable. A spontaneous picture can capture real moments better than a posed one."
CAE_65,"**Under Sarah's Spell**

Sarah Janson is a trompe-l'oeil artist, which means she creates paintings that trick the eye into seeing something that looks real. In this interview with Joanna Watt, we learn more about her.

Not many artists choose not to sign their work, but Sarah Janson is one of them. She believes that the artwork is more important than the artist. She says, ""It's not the artist who is important, but the work."" Sarah is very humble and almost makes it seem like her paintings create themselves. This attitude makes it a bit challenging to interview her. She admits, ""I just don't like to shout about myself,"" and she even gets nervous when asked to be photographed.

After some time, Sarah becomes more comfortable, and the interview turns into a fun and interesting conversation. She has been a trompe-l'oeil artist for sixteen years. Before that, she spent two years drawing at art school, earned a degree in graphic illustration, and worked at a publishing house. However, she was not satisfied with illustration and decided to work with a specialist decorator named Jim Smart. He asked her to create one trompe-l'oeil painting, and that sparked her interest. She left to start her own career, unsure of where it would lead but feeling it was the right choice.

Sarah's skills in observation and attention to detail, developed through her illustration work, are very important for her trompe-l'oeil art. She often gets asked where people can learn this technique, but she believes it cannot be taught. ""Trompe-l'oeil is the school of life. It's all about observation,"" she explains. She feels she is still learning and says, ""The moment you think you've mastered a field, you might as well give up.""

Sarah is honest about her weaknesses, like her struggle to paint bread, which she says always looks like grey concrete. She also admits to having trouble with math, especially when she had to measure for a large project at Lulworth Castle. She often questions herself, saying things like, ""You're not Michelangelo. Who do you think you are?"" This self-doubt makes her view her talent from a distance. Sometimes she talks about herself in the third person, saying, ""When I finished that ceiling, I thought, 'Well, I didn't do it, she did.'""

Her trompe-l'oeil work is exceptional and stands out from others in the field. She has completed many important projects for both businesses and private clients. Much of her art is inspired by architecture. For example, she created a trompe-l'oeil dining room based on a Venetian palace and a painting that makes it look like you can enter two more rooms at the end of a hallway.

However, there is a risk with trompe-l'oeil art: once people understand the trick, they may lose interest. Sarah knows this and says, ""Trompe-l'oeil has to do two things. First, it must draw you in; it's got to trick you. Secondly, it has to hold you and engage your imagination. That is the most important part.""

Sarah believes that trompe-l'oeil art should also be personal to the client. She enjoys working with clients because that is where the best ideas come from. ""Without the rapport, the job of creating a trompe-l'oeil scheme becomes rather difficult,"" she says. Some clients have clear ideas, while others do not, so she must listen carefully to understand their vision. Many of her clients become friends because she spends a lot of time with them while working on their projects.

Sarah appreciates her clients, saying, ""I am very grateful for the mad ones who have let me loose on their walls."" They seem happy with her work, which is why she is always busy, even though she tends to downplay her talent. ""I really don't like to shout about myself,"" she repeats. ""Like my work, I am very restrained. I don't want it to shout. You become bored with things that shout."" 

While she may not want to draw attention to herself, her work is certainly impressive and deserves to be recognized more widely."

CAE_52,"Text: 'Should the media make money from content they do not own? Digital cameras and camera phones have made it easier to capture important news events, but social media has changed how we see citizen photography. News often breaks on social networks, and some journalists now use these platforms to find images of fast-moving events. However, some reporters have shared user-generated content (UGC) without asking for permission. Although there are guidelines that say images on social media can be used without permission in special cases or when there is strong public interest, there is still debate about whether this is right. Research shows that about one in ten people would film or take pictures of a news event, which means UGC is important for the future of the media. To keep a good relationship with the public, the media must ensure that people are fairly rewarded for their work and that permission is always requested.'"
CAE_28,"**Ancient Chinese Medicine in the West**

Acupuncture is a practice that is over two thousand years old. It comes from traditional Chinese medicine, which also includes herbal medicine, massage, diet, and exercise. Acupuncture is used to treat many health issues, but it is especially known for helping with pain. Some general practitioners (GPs), midwives, and physiotherapists use it regularly for pain relief.

**What is Traditional Chinese Medicine?**

Traditional Chinese medicine believes that health is when the energy of the mind, body, and spirit are balanced. This energy, called Qi (pronounced ""chee""), flows through the body along pathways known as meridians. There are twelve main meridians, each connected to an internal organ, and many smaller meridians that carry Qi to every cell. If the flow of Qi is blocked or weak, it can lead to weakness or illness. During a visit to an acupuncturist, they will check for imbalances in your Qi by feeling your pulse, looking at your tongue, and assessing your overall health. They will also ask about your medical history, current health, mental state, and your eating and sleeping habits. Acupuncturists use very thin needles that are inserted into the skin. They may also use heat from burning herbs or apply pressure to certain points to help the flow of Qi.

**Acupuncture Points**

The points used in acupuncture are connected to the meridians and may not be near the area that hurts. Many people report feeling a mild ache or tingling when the needle is gently moved. This can be done by hand or with a machine that provides electrical stimulation. Acupuncturists believe this sensation means the needle has reached the Qi in a meridian. There are over three hundred acupuncture points on the main meridians, with many more that are used less frequently.

**Scientific Understanding**

Even though not all doctors accept the ideas of traditional Chinese medicine, many agree that acupuncture can help relieve pain. Scientists have suggested that acupuncture might work by blocking pain signals from reaching the brain or by releasing natural pain-relieving chemicals in the body called endorphins.

**Types of Pain Treated**

Many people with long-term pain try acupuncture when other treatments have not worked. Commonly treated pains include back pain, sports injuries, arthritis, headaches, and pain after surgery. Acupuncturists also claim to help with menstrual pain, facial nerve pain, and pain in terminally ill patients.

**Modern Use of Acupuncture**

Although acupuncture has been practiced in China for over 2,000 years, its use as an alternative to anesthesia during surgery began in the 1950s. This helped some doctors outside China to see that acupuncture has real benefits. In China today, acupuncture is used in many types of surgeries, from tonsil removals to heart surgery. Needles can be used alone, with electrical stimulation, or with medication. While some people report that pain is greatly reduced, results can vary from person to person. Many might find the idea of being awake during surgery unappealing, but acupuncturists say that acupuncture has fewer side effects than traditional anesthesia and allows for quicker recovery.

**Effectiveness of Acupuncture**

Like many alternative therapies, it can be hard to conduct clinical trials on acupuncture. However, studies show that 50 to 80 percent of people find it effective for chronic pain. Acupuncturists generally agree with this success rate. They understand that it may not work for everyone and that people respond differently. Traditional acupuncturists suggest that for long-term pain, it usually takes six to seven visits to feel significant relief, but some improvement can be felt after just two or three sessions.

**A Different View on Pain**

Western and Chinese medicine have different views on pain. Acupuncturists look at their patients as a whole, not just focusing on specific symptoms. They spend time diagnosing the problem and looking for underlying issues with the Qi. They also consider external factors that might affect the pain, such as weather conditions or the type of pain (sharp, dull, throbbing, etc.). These factors are important in deciding how to use acupuncture for treatment, which is not something most medical doctors would typically consider.

**Choosing an Acupuncturist**

Some medical professionals have training in traditional acupuncture, while others, including many GPs, prefer scientific explanations. Traditional acupuncturists believe that using traditional methods can lead to deeper healing, which is hard to measure in studies. It is important to choose a qualified acupuncturist, who should refer you to a medical doctor if further investigation is needed."
CAE_35,"P.D. James is a well-known crime writer whose gentle appearance hides a clever and imaginative mind. Her full name is Phyllis Dorothy James, and she has a strong presence that makes you think she could have been a headmistress at a girls' school if she hadn’t become a writer. However, she is actually quite shy. She admits that her main character, Adam Dalgliesh, the detective in her books, is based on herself, or how she might have been if she were a man. Dalgliesh likes to solve crimes alone, just like P.D. James prefers to write in private. 

Although she is considered one of Britain’s best crime writers, she is modest about her success. Her 12 detective novels are popular worldwide, and she enjoys reading the works of her friend Ruth Rendell, especially those written under the name Barbara Vine. She also likes books by female authors like Iris Murdoch and Anita Brookner, but she appreciates male writers like Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh as well.

P.D. James found success later in life. She was 42 when her first novel, Cover Her Face, was published. She was born in Oxford and grew up in Cambridge. She met her husband there, who was a university student. She chose Cambridge as the setting for one of her books, An Unsuitable Job For A Woman. 

Her life has not always been easy. After her husband, Connor Bantry White, returned from World War II very ill, she had to work long hours to support him and their two daughters, Clare and Jane. Although she had many ideas for stories, she struggled to find time to write. Thankfully, her husband’s parents helped take care of the children during those tough years.

While working full-time in the National Health Service, she used her strong organizational skills. She managed several psychiatric clinics and later worked for 11 years at the Home Office, first in the Police Department and then in juvenile crime. During her time in forensic science, she became used to seeing dead bodies, but she was not interested in death itself. Instead, she loved the challenge of writing a crime novel. 

P.D. James did not want to write about her own life experiences. She saw writing detective stories as a good way to learn how to be a serious novelist while keeping her personal life separate. She realized that it was possible to follow the traditional structure of a detective story and still create a meaningful novel about people. For her, writing detective stories is a way to bring order to chaos, and solving a crime shows the value of life, even if that life is difficult. She believes that nobody truly enjoys violence."
CAE_5,"**The Pen is Mightier than the Psychoanalyst**

The study of handwriting to understand a person's character is becoming more popular. In some countries, if you apply for a job, you will likely be asked to provide a sample of your handwriting. This handwriting sample can play a big role in deciding if you are suitable for the job. Handwriting analysis, also known as graphology, is considered a real science in many places. Researchers believe it can help identify certain health issues, like heart disease and cancer, and can show psychological states and emotional problems. 

More companies are using handwriting analysis for job guidance and during interviews. Many large companies now hire graphologists to examine the handwriting of job candidates. However, many doctors and psychiatrists are skeptical about the usefulness of graphology. Patricia Marne, a professional graphologist with over 20 years of experience, argues that it should be taken more seriously. She believes handwriting can reveal psychological traits and some medical conditions. 

Marne states, ""Handwriting is a strong indicator of social class and intelligence. It can also help determine if someone should focus on arts or sciences and whether they have a deceitful or honest character."" She claims that graphology can be especially helpful in identifying possible criminal behavior. According to her, criminals often have disturbed handwriting, which can be poorly shaped and childish. Many criminals come from difficult backgrounds and show emotional issues, which can be seen in their handwriting.

Marne explains that handwriting can indicate if someone is honest, manipulative, or reliable. For example, young male offenders often have tall letters, suggesting they live in a fantasy world. Graphologists can also predict if someone is under extreme stress or has violent tendencies. Handwriting can even help identify potential suicides. 

She notes that heart and lung problems can sometimes be seen in handwriting. ""You can't make a diagnosis from just one sample unless the writing is clearly shaky or disturbed. But if handwriting changes over time or if a signature breaks from its usual style, it could mean something serious is happening,"" she says. A major emotional upset can also change a person's signature temporarily.

Marne explains that handwriting can show other psychological traits. For instance, people whose letters connect in a thread-like way may be clever but deceitful. Those who write mostly in capital letters might be hiding their true selves. Light pressure in writing can indicate sensitivity and low energy. The more original the handwriting is, the more it shows confidence and creativity. Disconnected writing often suggests a person is a loner. Very small signatures can indicate feelings of inferiority, while circles over the letter ""i"" may show a desire for attention. Heavy crossing of the letter ""t"" can suggest intolerance and a condescending attitude.

Marne believes it takes six years of study and experience to analyze handwriting accurately, along with empathy and intuition. She thinks more research is needed to establish graphology as a scientific field, and she believes this will happen soon. ""It's actually more accurate than psychoanalysis because it can reveal a person's entire history, including emotional crises, without asking them questions that they might answer incorrectly.""

Despite these interesting claims, there is little solid evidence to support them. Some psychiatrists criticize graphology, arguing that handwriting is influenced by education, artistic skills, and the type of writing taught, and that it has no deeper meaning."
CAE_41,"**Is Your Office Working Well?**

Fresh air and good chairs are important for a happy and healthy workplace, according to a new survey. We visited four different offices to see how healthy and happy they are. Our expert panel included a building health consultant, an ergonomist (who studies working conditions), and an occupational psychologist. Here are their opinions.

**Office A: Advertising Agency**

- **Building Health Consultant:** This office is very simple; it has no central heating or mechanical ventilation, and the windows open directly to the street. It’s surprising that this space works, but the small team of seven people seems happy. They adapt to the weather by opening doors or using electric heaters, similar to how they would at home. This may be the reason for their happiness; they have created a comfortable working environment without too many rules.

- **Ergonomist:** The furniture is mismatched and creates bad sitting positions. Many chairs are old and not adjustable. However, the staff has a varied work schedule, which helps reduce tiredness and boredom.

- **Occupational Psychologist:** The team enjoys the variety of work and the office size. It’s small enough to know what everyone is doing but big enough to focus on personal tasks. The office feels attractive and fun, showing both efficiency and creativity.

**Office B: News Service**

- **Building Health Consultant:** This office may not be very exciting, but it is comfortable and the staff does not dislike it. The air quality is good, partly because of a No Smoking policy.

- **Ergonomist:** The company has hired an ergonomist, so the chairs and lighting are good. The layout could be better, but the environment feels impersonal with plain grey walls.

- **Occupational Psychologist:** The walls are mostly bare, except for some planners and a poster about maternity rights. Most staff have been there for over five years, and relationships are good. The office could improve by arranging desks to make sharing information easier.

**Office C: Bank**

- **Building Health Consultant:** This office gets mixed reactions. It feels like being in a glass box, with many people around. The air quality is surprisingly good, even with smokers nearby.

- **Ergonomist:** The office is standard and uninspiring. The desks are just okay, and not all chairs are suitable for computer work. The setup for computer screens is outdated.

- **Occupational Psychologist:** Staff support each other well and have good technology. There are many awards on display, but the wood paneling and brown carpet make it feel a bit dull. The office is busy with activity.

**Office D: Newspaper**

- **Building Health Consultant:** This office has many problems. The air conditioning is not good, leading to uncomfortable temperature changes. The space is cluttered, and there is not enough desk space. It is also very dusty.

- **Ergonomist:** The furniture looks more like it belongs in a workshop than an office. Many chairs are old and not suitable for people who work at computers.

- **Occupational Psychologist:** The office has old chairs and dirty carpets. It needs a good cleaning, and individual achievements should be recognized more. The air conditioning needs to be fixed, especially since there are many smokers. When we visited, there were few conversations, and everyone seemed stressed and focused on deadlines. The company should encourage teamwork."
CAE_38,"**Chewing Gum Culture**

Chewing gum is popular, does not belong to any social class, and Americans chew about 12 million sticks every day. This ancient habit has turned into a big business. Each stick of chewing gum has fewer than ten calories, but it is considered food and must meet the standards of the American Food and Drug Administration.

Today, most gum is made from synthetic materials, with added pine resins and softeners to keep the flavor and improve the texture. However, this was not always the case. The ancient Greeks chewed a resin from the mastic tree, which grows mainly in Greece and Turkey. Greek women especially liked mastic gum to clean their teeth and freshen their breath. American colonists learned from the Native Americans in New England and chewed resin from spruce trees. In the early 1800s, lumps of spruce for chewing were sold in the eastern United States, making it the first commercial chewing gum in the country.

Modern chewing gum began in the late 1860s with the discovery of chicle, a milky substance from the sapodilla tree found in Central America. Gum made from chicle was smoother, more enjoyable, and more elastic to chew, leading to the growth of a whole industry. However, attempts to grow sapodilla trees commercially have not been successful. As the chewing gum market expanded, synthetic alternatives were created.

Today, the few remaining chicle gatherers, known as chicleros, live a difficult and dangerous life. They travel long distances to collect sapodilla in very humid conditions. The environment is dangerous, with poisonous snakes and many insects. One of the most concerning pests is the chicle fly, which lays its eggs in the ears and nose of the gatherers. Despite these dangers, experienced chicleros can climb trees quickly to collect the sap, which they carry back to a camp where it is boiled and made into bricks.

Life at the camp is also hard, with a boring diet mainly of maize and local alcohol made from sugar cane. Even though this work is tough, chicleros worry about their jobs. Not long ago, the United States imported 7,000 tonnes of chicle each year from Central America, but last year only 200 tonnes were collected in Mexico's Yucatan peninsula.

As chewing gum sales have increased, manufacturers have turned to synthetic materials to lower costs and meet demand. At the same time, gum producers are finding creative ways to market their products. They claim that chewing gum helps you relax, boosts your energy, and reduces stress. During both world wars, soldiers were often given gum. One of the main benefits of gum is that it can help reduce tooth decay. When we eat, plaque acid forms, but our saliva helps neutralize this acid and provides important minerals. Gum manufacturers say that chewing for 20 minutes can increase saliva flow.

Research is ongoing to create new textures and flavors. Glycerine and other vegetable oils are now used to make the gum base. Most new flavors are artificial, but some still require natural ingredients. Additionally, 137 square kilometers of land in America is dedicated to growing mint for the two most popular chewing gums in the world."

**A. INDIA - GHANERAO HOTEL, RAJASTHAN**  
Ghanerao Hotel is located at the edge of the Aravalli Hills in a small village known for its craftsmen. It combines the calmness of an English country house with Indian culture. The Ghanerao family has lived here for 400 years, and now Sajjan Singh and his wife welcome guests into their home. The hotel has basic facilities, with hot water provided in buckets, but this simplicity adds to its charm.

**B. NEW ZEALAND - HERMITAGE HOTEL, MOUNT COOK**  
One of my favorite hotels is the Hermitage Hotel on New Zealand's South Island. I found it by chance while climbing. After a long climb, I was surprised to find this hotel in a stunningly beautiful and remote area. After a tiring day, it was amazing to relax in luxury, listening to a man playing Cole Porter on the piano.

**C. MAURITIUS - PARADIS HOTEL**  
On the south-west of Mauritius, the Paradis Hotel is located on a quiet peninsula. The road to the hotel goes along the coast, passing empty beaches where only fishermen are present. The hotel is large and offers many free water sports, but you can easily find peace on its nine kilometers of private beach. If you swim a little way out into the Indian Ocean, you can hardly see the hotel among the palm trees. In the evening, when everyone has left, you can enjoy the quiet and beautiful sunset.

**D. ST LUCIA - LADERA HOTEL**  
The Ladera Hotel in St Lucia has a stunning view of the Caribbean Sea. It is quiet and located at 1,000 feet above sea level, with open rooms that look out between the twin peaks of the Pitons. The hotel has a colonial style, with mahogany furniture and four-poster beds covered with muslin.

**E. TURKEY - THE SPLENDID HOTEL, ISTANBUL**  
The Splendid Hotel is on Buyukada in the Princes Islands, a perfect escape from the noise of Istanbul. The islands are just an hour away by boat and are very peaceful. There are no cars, only horse-drawn carriages, and beautiful wooden buildings. The Splendid Hotel is a charming old wooden building with white paint and red domes. Although it is a bit worn down, it still has a lot of character.

**F. FRANCE - CHATEAU D'ETOGES, EPERNAY**

CAE_47,"**Simplified Text:**

Sue Brown is a hotel inspector. Christopher Middleton watched her during an inspection at the Globe Hotel. Just one minute into the inspection, things start to go wrong. The receptionist is busy talking on the phone and does not notice Sue and Christopher. ""She hasn't even acknowledged us,"" Sue whispers. ""Very poor."" This is a common mistake that Sue has seen many times in her 11 years as an inspector. She expects better from a hotel with three red stars, which means it is one of the top 130 hotels out of 4,000 in the guide she works for.

Before they even enter, Sue feels uneasy. The entrance from the car park is through a door with a buzzer, leading to a long, empty corridor. ""This is not what I expected,"" she says. Things get worse when the receptionist says, ""We have no record of your booking."" The hotel has 15 rooms, but only three are occupied that night. The room they are shown is not good: it feels stuffy, and there is a big hole in the wall behind the wardrobe.

When Sue started her career, people called her ""The Woman in Black,"" even though she never wore black and didn't think she was very tough. The next morning, after paying her bill, she reveals her identity to the hotel’s manager, Robin Greaves. He looks scared when he sees her. He quickly apologizes for a bad smell in the lounge, saying there might be a blocked drain.

Sue suggests that he should not let guests into the lounge with the smell and should guide them to another area instead. Greaves listens and takes notes. He has only been at the Globe for five months and seems unsure about Sue's advice, but she assures him it will help the hotel in the long run.

Not everything is negative. Sue praises Emma, the assistant manager, and Trudy, the young waitress, for their good service and knowledge about the hotel’s 400-year history. The dinner also meets the standards to keep the hotel’s two-rosette food rating. Greaves asks, ""What do we need to do to get three rosettes?"" Sue replies, ""Don’t serve a pudding that collapses."" Greaves looks disappointed.

Sue's job is to say what many customers are too afraid to say. She remembers a time when a woman complained that Sue got her son fired because he served her apple pie with his fingers. Some letters she receives include false claims about her attitude or demands for bribes. ""You get used to it, but it still hurts,"" she says.

Sue must tell the hotel owner her findings verbally and also send a written report. The hotels pay for her advice. Being recognized with red stars makes it worth it. Greaves is relieved to hear that Sue will not recommend taking away the Globe's red stars. However, the bad news is that another inspector will return in two months to check if the problems have been fixed. ""Good,"" Greaves says with a forced smile. ""We’ll look forward to that."""
CAE_48,"**Seven Summits: A Mountaineer's Journey**

Doug Scott, a mountaineer, shares his experiences of climbing the highest peaks on each continent, known as the Seven Summits. He began this journey later in life and will describe each mountain in the order he climbed them.

**A. Mt. Everest, Asia (8,848m)**  
While resting in a snow cave 91 meters below the summit, Doug and his climbing partner, Dougal Haston, talked about sleeping bags, which seemed odd since they were alone. Doug felt the cold in his feet and remembered climbers who lost fingers and toes to frostbite. They were not just worried about surviving but about how well they could survive. Over the next two days, Doug thought about their time on the summit ridge and felt confident climbing with Dougal. He focused on finding a better rhythm to reach the summit.

**B. Mt. McKinley, North America (6,194m)**  
This mountain is known to be very dangerous. In April 1976, Doug and Dougal arrived at the Kahiltna Glacier and spent four days carrying equipment and food to the base. After the first day, they realized how difficult their climb would be. They followed a route from 1967 but decided to take a new path to the summit. They climbed with all their gear on their backs, which was a new approach for this mountain. After a tough climb, they finally reached the summit and felt victorious.

**C. Kilimanjaro, Africa (5,895m)**  
In September 1976, Doug and his friend Paul Braithwaite flew to Nairobi to climb Mt. Kenya but ended up climbing Kilimanjaro instead. They got lost in the jungles at the base, which was serious because water was hard to find. On the second day, they found a rock pool and felt relieved. They tried to climb a steep wall but decided to take a safer route to the summit.

**D. Aconcagua, South America (6,960m)**  
In January 1992, Doug and his wife, Sharu, arrived at Punta del Inca and met a guide named Phil Erscheler. Phil suggested they join his group to climb Aconcagua via the Polish Glacier, which was less crowded. After waiting for bad weather to pass, they started their climb. The glacier was icy and challenging, so they chose to take the standard route instead. They reached the summit just before dark and met other climbers who encouraged Doug to aim for the Seven Summits.

**E. Vinson Massif, Antarctica (4,897m)**  
Doug learned that climbing Vinson Massif could be funded by guiding others. In November 1992, his team traveled to the South Pole. During this time, the sun never sets, and the atmosphere is very peaceful. On December 7, they set out for the summit. Despite strong winds and freezing temperatures, they all reached the top within eight hours, although visibility was poor due to a storm.

**F. Elbrus, Europe (5,633m)**  
In the summer of 1994, Doug's team gathered in St. Petersburg and traveled to Elbrus. After a few days of getting used to the altitude, they took a cable car to 3,900m and then walked to a refuge at 4,200m. Two days later, they faced strong winds while climbing. They thought they reached the summit but found there was still more to climb. They returned to the refuge and descended the volcano the next day.

**G. Carstensz Pyramid, Australasia (4,883m)**  
On their expedition to Carstensz, Doug and his team wanted to create a new climbing route and spend time with the local Dani people. They were warned about possible dangers but decided to continue. On May 12, they climbed, and the weather improved. Doug reached the summit by 11 am and received a warm welcome from his team. He had successfully completed his goal of climbing all Seven Summits!"
FCE_15,"**Style Merchants**

Style affects many parts of our lives today, including clothing, home decoration, and accessories. Jo Foley shares some of the fashion trends for this year.

**Ned Ingham: Dress Designer**  
Ned Ingham creates beautiful and romantic wedding dresses. He advises people to avoid traditional, stiff dresses and the overly frilly style, suggesting simpler designs instead. Ingham has been designing wedding dresses since he was a child. At 16, he went to fashion school to learn how to cut and make clothes. You don’t have to be a bride to wear an Ingham dress; he also designs elegant evening dresses in modern colors and fabrics. For those who prefer classic styles, he offers a timeless navy-blue summer suit, which has been a staple in women's wardrobes for many years, but he gives it a fresh look.

**Sally Quail: Jeweller**  
Sally Quail used to work for an art dealer but has no formal training in jewellery design. She started designing her own engagement ring when she couldn’t find one she liked. This led her to become a designer in 1990, and now many celebrities wear her jewellery. Her unique style features large semi-precious stones set in gold, creating stunning necklaces, bracelets, and rings inspired by 18th-century designs. Recently, she has started using diamonds, saying, ""I reached that moment in every woman's life when she wants a diamond.""

**Lily Grimson: Handbag Designer**  
Lily Grimson has quickly made a name for herself in the competitive fashion industry. After just four years and a basic art and design course, two of her handbag designs were chosen for a major exhibition. Her bags are handmade in the UK and are known for their glamour, whether made from fine calfskin or heavy silk. A Grimson bag is not just a bag; it combines style and quality, making it special.

**Peter Little: Hairdresser**  
For over 20 years, Peter Little has styled the hair of many famous people. He believes most women want hair that looks natural and is easy to manage at home. His unique approach ensures that clients don’t look like they just left a salon. However, his services are expensive, costing £250 for the first appointment, and there is a three-month waiting list. Peter has also created his own line of hairdryers and styling tools, allowing people to achieve his styles at home.

**Penny Pratt: Florist**  
Penny Pratt runs a small flower shop and works as a flower consultant for a large supermarket chain and top restaurants. She has no formal training in floristry and left her teaching job ten years ago to pursue a new path. Her modern floral designs have won many awards, helping her establish her own London Flower School. She has also given successful lectures in Japan and the USA. Penny believes that flower arrangements today should be simple but strong, with fewer leaves. For wedding bouquets, she advises that all flowers should be of the same type."
FCE_19,"**Five-Star Luxury with Modern Technology**

The new five-star Merrion Hotel in Dublin has been created after a lot of research into what customers want and nearly two years of work to convert four large 18th-century houses. This approach has allowed the hotel to use the latest technology for the benefit of both staff and guests.

General Manager Peter MacCann expects his staff to know guests by name. However, he uses the hotel’s computer system to keep track of guests' preferences. This system helps the hotel provide special services for returning guests, which is important for a five-star hotel. Although the system cost £250,000 to install, MacCann believes it will save money in the long run. He appreciates its efficiency and the services it offers. For example, if a guest requests certain music CDs during their first stay, those same CDs will be ready for them on their next visit, thanks to the guest-history feature.

Many hotel guests often complain about room temperature. The Merrion Hotel has a high-tech system that allows guests to adjust the temperature in their rooms. They can change it by three degrees around the normal 18°C, and the front desk can adjust it anywhere between 14°C and 25°C.

Business travelers will find the technology in their rooms especially useful. MacCann estimates that about 65% of the hotel’s business will come from this group. To meet their needs, the hotel has brought traditional business services into the guest rooms. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that also works as a photocopier and printer, and video-conferencing facilities.

Technology changes quickly, so the hotel has prepared for future improvements by laying extra cables. They rent televisions instead of buying them, so they can easily replace them with newer models. DVD recorders can also be upgraded when needed. Despite all this modern equipment, MacCann wants to ensure that guests do not feel overwhelmed by technology. The 145 bedrooms are spacious, well-furnished, comfortable, and welcoming.

The hotel also features a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a beautiful garden. As with all luxury hotels, the food must be excellent. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, who already had two Michelin stars for his Dublin restaurant, has moved his restaurant to the Merrion. This move has allowed him to design a new kitchen and improve the facilities. The hotel benefits from having a popular restaurant without financial risks.

With the help of technology and a skilled staff, the Merrion Hotel is likely to be very successful."
FCE_24,"**An Eye for Detail**

Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. The large garden around her house provides many of her subjects. It is filled with her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wildly and spread all over the garden. The two long flower borders along the paved path that goes from east to west are full of color, shape, and structure. This beauty is partly thanks to the previous owners, who loved gardening and left plants that Susan liked. She also kept the gardener, Danny. ""In fact, it was really his garden,"" she says. ""We got along very well. At first, he would say, 'Oh, it's not worth it' for some of the things I wanted to add, but when I told him I wanted to paint them, he understood my vision.""

Susan prefers to paint detailed studies of individual plants instead of the whole garden. Sometimes, she paints a group of plants, but usually, she picks one flower and takes it to her studio. ""I don't set everything up at once,"" she explains. ""I take one flower out and paint it, which can take a few days. Then I bring in another one and build the painting that way. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.""

Her busiest time is spring and early summer when the tulips bloom, followed by the poppies. ""They all come out together, and you're so busy,"" she says. But she also finds beauty in the way flowers change as they decay. For example, with tulips, ""you bring them in and put them in water, then leave them for a day, and they change shape. They open up and look amazing. At first, you think they are boring, but they keep changing.""

Susan has always loved plants. ""I studied botany in school and used to collect wildflowers from the countryside,"" she says. ""I wasn't really interested in gardening then; I didn't like garden flowers because they looked fake, like silk or plastic. I was fascinated by how wildflowers could grow in difficult places, like cracks in rocks or on cliffs.""

Today, her garden has many plants from faraway places, but they seem just as comfortable in her garden as they do in their native lands like China or the Himalayas. She has a relaxed attitude towards her garden, like a caring aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don't cause serious trouble. 

With two upcoming exhibitions to prepare for and plenty of subjects right outside her door, Susan has found it hard to spend time in the garden lately. She now hires an extra gardener, but she knows that to stay connected to her work, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""
FCE_13,"**Title: Changes in Brackham**

Many trees in the Brackham area were destroyed during the strong storms in March. The town lost two large lime trees from the old market square. This change upset many residents who liked the town's traditional look. One of these residents was Chief Inspector Douglas Pelham, the head of the local police. However, during the storm, Pelham was not in a good condition to notice the changes because he was seriously ill with bronchitis for the first time in his life.

When he first felt pain in his head and tightness in his chest, his wife, Molly, urged him to see a doctor. But Pelham, thinking the police needed him, ignored her advice and tried to keep working. This made him forget things and made him more irritable. Eventually, his colleague, Sergeant Lloyd, took him to the doctor, and Pelham was too weak to argue. Soon after, he got his antibiotics and went home, where Molly sent him straight to bed.

On Thursday morning, when Molly told him that the walnut tree in their garden had fallen during the night, Pelham was too sick to understand. Later, he asked if their house was damaged and felt relieved to hear it was not. He then covered himself with the sheets. It was not until Saturday, when the medicine started to work and he felt better, that he noticed the walnut tree was gone. This change made a big difference in their living room.

The Pelhams lived in a large house with a big garden, which they had bought without regrets. The garden had given them privacy. Before the storm, the view from their living room included the beautiful walnut tree, which created nice patterns of light and shadow. This helped hide the old furniture they had brought from their previous home. Now, without the tree, the room felt too bright, showing the worn-out furniture clearly. The view from the window was not pleasant either. The tall house next door, which was hidden by the tree, now stood out with its unattractive purple bricks and pipes. It had many upstairs windows that seemed to watch the Pelhams.

“Doesn’t it look terrible?” Pelham said weakly to his wife. But Molly, standing in the doorway, sounded more happy than upset. “I’ve been telling you this since we moved here. We need to buy a new sofa, no matter the cost.”"
FCE_16,"**Living in the Valley**

We had been living in our valley for sixteen months when we first noticed the dangers in the surrounding hills that could threaten our survival. It was a year when storms came early, even before November ended. Until then, we felt safe in our valley, protected by the hills around us. Soon, snow began to fall, and within a day, it was about 15 centimeters deep. This snow almost completely blocked our lane and made the path by the stream slippery and dangerous. 

In the hills nearby, the snow was much deeper and lasted longer. The wind blew strongly up there, but in our valley, we only felt sudden gusts of wind. The trees swayed, but their branches stayed strong. Still, we knew we had reasons to worry. The snow and wind were annoying, but they did not really trouble us much. The biggest threat was the river, the Ryburn, which usually flowed gently. It reminded us of what could happen if the water from the hills was not controlled by the dams built many years ago.

Soon, the snow started to melt. Day after day, we watched dark clouds gather over the hills to the west. These grey clouds spread over the valleys, warning us of what was coming. We had seen enough of the sky; now we focused on the river, which was getting fuller and wilder each day. The melting snow was washed away as more rain fell from the clouds, but the reservoir in the hills was filling up and getting close to overflowing.

Then it happened – for the first time in years, the reservoir overflowed. It was like a mini Niagara Falls as the water rushed over the dam and into the stream below. The river became wild as the water poured down towards us. Just a few meters from our cottage, the stream looked furious beneath the bridge. It was deeper than we had ever seen it, crashing against its banks. For three days, we hoped it would stay below the dam. Luckily, our hopes were answered as the dam held strong and the water began to go down.

In the past, before the dam was built, the river had flooded nearby villages many times. Now, the dam controls the river's flow, and usually, everything is fine. The large amount of water from the hills, caused by snow and heavy rain, stays behind the dam, with only occasional overflow. Because of this protection, we can enjoy the big clouds over the valley and appreciate the river's power without fear. Thanks to the dam, we feel that our home in the valley is safe and secure."
FCE_21,"Film critic Mark Adams reflects on his ten years of work for a newspaper called The Front Page. Writing film articles for this newspaper was his first real job. Before that, he had done some reviews of novels for other newspapers, films for a magazine, and radio work. This is how he met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, who also worked in radio and television. Tom hired Mark, but he was not mainly a journalist, which meant he was not very careful in choosing his team. 

Tom's idea was to have a group of critics cover different art forms that did not need special knowledge, like books, TV, theatre, film, and radio. They would have a weekly lunch to discuss which topics to cover, and there would be guests to make it more enjoyable. At that time, it felt like a dream for Mark to be part of a new newspaper in a busy market. He even thought it was unlikely that a millionaire would want to help him personally. When he first saw someone reading the newspaper on the London Underground with one of his reviews, he felt very shy.

However, Tom's plan for a team of critics did not work out as expected. They did not meet as planned, and most communication happened by phone. It turned out that the public preferred to have a reviewer focus on one subject area, so Mark chose to write about films. Without Tom's initial support, they would not have developed the current system where Mark writes a detailed weekly article about one film. This way of working suits him well because he is not interested in the usual role of a film critic, which requires watching every new film. He believes that doing that would make him bored quickly.

Mark enjoys having the space to develop his arguments in his reviews, even if some weeks are not very interesting. He wonders about his role in helping the public choose films. He thinks people usually decide what to watch based on stars, advertising, or the director. People often stick to their favorite types of films, so a review may not change their minds. 

Mark does not feel he has to be ""right"" about a movie, nor does he believe there should be a set number of ""great"" or ""bad"" films each year. His job is to present an argument, and he does not want to be a judge of films."
FCE_46,"**Why would a schoolgirl want to swim 1500m, cycle 40km, and then run 10km? Because ""it's fun.""**

**Teenager with a passion for endurance sports**  
**WANTED:** A sports-loving training partner for a triathlete, preferably female. This is a chance to work with a potential Olympic champion. You should really enjoy distance running (regular 15km sessions), distance swimming (training in cold rivers is a plus), and distance cycling (a love for 100km rides is helpful). You must be able to do all three activities without taking a break.

The triathlon is becoming one of the most popular Olympic sports. It has attracted large crowds who are both fascinated and shocked by athletes who swim 1500m, cycle 40km, and then run 10km without stopping. This may be exciting for the audience, but what drives the triathletes to push their bodies so hard? Why would a talented 17-year-old, who does well in school, give up so much for this challenging sport?

Melanie Sears, a young triathlete, has not yet learned the usual phrases about personal satisfaction and mental challenges that many athletes use when asked similar questions. She explains, ""You swim for 1500m, then you run out of the water and jump on your bike, still wet. Of course, then you get cold. After the 40km bike ride, you have to run 10km, which feels long when you’re tired. But it’s really fun, and it’s all worth it in the end.""

Melanie entered her first triathlon at 14. ""I won the junior section, but I was the only junior there. It felt so easy that I waved at my teammates as I went around."" Feeling confident, she entered the National Championships. Although she had the second fastest swim and the fastest run, she did not place well. ""I was following a man, and suddenly we found ourselves at the sea. We realized we had gone the wrong way. I ended up cycling 20 kilometers too far. I cried all the way through the run."" But she did not give up and is determined to keep going. ""Sometimes I wish I could stop because then the pain would end, but I’m afraid that if I stop just once, I would want to stop again.""

Her determination impresses Steve Trew, the sport's coaching director. ""I tested her fitness,"" he says, ""and she worked so hard on the running machine that it finally threw her off into a wall. She gave it her all, while most people stop when they realize they can’t go any further. She just kept going.""

Melanie was the top junior in this year's European Triathlon Championships, finishing 13th. ""I was almost as good as the top three in swimming and running, but much slower in cycling. That’s why I’m working hard on it."" She is trying to convince her parents, who will pay the £1,300 cost of her trip to New Zealand for this year's World Championships, to buy a £2,000 bike (it’s a special deal with £1,000 off) so she can compete in national 25 km and 100 km races later this year.

However, there is a cost to her dedication. Her intense training has made her a bit of a loner. ""I don’t have a social life,"" she says. ""I’m not really into parties. After two hours of hard swimming on Friday nights, I just want to sleep. But I do call and write to the other girls on the team."" What do they talk about? Boys? Clothes? ""No, we talk about our times and achievements.""

Where will all this focus lead? Melanie has tried other events, like the triathlon ""sprint,"" where you only swim 750m, cycle 20km, and run 5km. She wants to enter even tougher events than the triathlon. ""The big problem is, I have no one my age to train with,"" she says. Funny, isn’t it?"
FCE_70,"**The Collectors**

Amanda Roy talks about her love for collecting and why many people enjoy this hobby. Collecting is a passion that one in three adults share. It is a world filled with excitement and joy. However, if you decide to collect something, remember: only collect items you truly love.

People have always had the desire to collect. In ancient times, early humans collected pebbles and wore them as necklaces. They were attracted to the shapes and colors of these stones, which were their first attempts to gather objects for personal reasons. Over the years, not much has changed. Children still collect stones and seashells just because they are beautiful.

I have been collecting for my entire life, from flowers like tulips to pottery and paintings. My first collection was stones I found in my parents' garden. When I was six, I went to a school in a remote, cold place in England. When my parents visited, they took me to a local museum filled with interesting objects collected by people long ago. I was fascinated by these items. 

Surprisingly, I am not alone in my interest in collecting. Many adults share this passion. People collect for different reasons, and some feel it is the only part of their lives where they have full control. For me, it is simply something I enjoy.

One famous collector was the Duc de Berry in France, who had a ""room of wonders"" filled with unique items like coconut cups and carved ivory beads. Another collector, Catherine the Great of Russia, owned over 4,000 paintings. However, you don’t need to be rich to start a collection. I have collected many different things, like tulip bulbs and china cups, always searching for special examples.

I remember convincing another tulip collector to sell me a rare bulb. I planted it and took care of it, but one year it disappeared—stolen by another collector. I also collected 350 American rag dolls, searching for different designs across the USA. Sadly, this collection was lost when my house caught fire. The next morning, I stood in my home and saw the remains of my furniture and my collection. I was heartbroken.

I find it interesting how collections change hands. A silver spoon that belonged to a king or a poet adds value to items traded in markets. As certain small objects become popular among collectors, their prices go up. For example, toys from the 1950s are now valuable, especially if you kept the original boxes. Unfortunately, I threw away both the boxes and the toys!"
FCE_3,"**My Line of Work**

Four people talk about their jobs.

**Lisa - Exhibition Programmes Organiser, Science Museum**  
I organize temporary exhibitions. This means I plan and design the exhibition and promote it. I need to learn about the exhibition topic and talk to important people to understand the main themes and goals. I decide what objects and pictures to display. I also create interactive displays, workshops, and theatre to help the public understand the exhibition. I work with engineers and electricians to ensure the display is safe for visitors. Before the exhibition opens, I help design and write brochures and leaflets to inform people about it.

**Janet - Teacher of London Taxi Drivers**  
When I arrive at 7:30 a.m., I first check the accounts. Then, I see what new maps and documents we need to help students learn the routes for the London taxi-driver test. By midday, about 50 students are in class, figuring out the best routes. I help when there are disagreements, like whether a right turn is allowed at a certain junction. As they prepare for the test, I give them a simple route but tell them they must take a different one because the road is closed. This forces them to think of alternative routes.

**Sarah - Marine Conservationist**  
I live by the coast and usually work from home. My job involves answering phone calls, creating educational materials, and setting up training courses. Sometimes, I go to our main office, but I mostly work along the coast. I collaborate with schools and study centers, running courses for coastal managers and decision-makers about the ocean. I take them out to sea to help them understand marine life better, which often changes their perspectives. I feel lucky because conservation is my passion, but the downside is that I work for a charity, so I always need to find more funding and cannot achieve everything I want.

**Chris - Map and Atlas Publisher**  
My job is quite varied. I ensure our publishing program meets market needs and keep around 300 books in stock. We have high standards for information and content. We receive many letters from readers about issues like international boundaries, which need careful responses. I discuss future projects and current sales with co-publishers. I work with a motivated team, which makes the job enjoyable. However, like many jobs, there is too much administration, which takes time away from more interesting tasks like product development and design."
FCE_10,"**No Title**

Every June, we went to Ireland. Since the four of us started going on holidays together, we spent the first two weeks of the month at Glencorn Lodge in County Antrim. It is a big house by the sea, not far from the village of Ardbeag. The English couple who own the house, the Malseeds, have made some additions to it, but they did it very carefully. Strafe found Glencorn for us. He saw an advertisement when the Malseeds were still advertising. ""How about this?"" he said one evening and read the details. The summer before, we had gone to a hotel recommended by friends, but it was not good because the food was terrible. 

The four of us have been playing cards together for a long time: Dekko, Strafe, Cynthia, and me. They call me Milly, but my real name is Dorothy Milson. Dekko got his nickname at school; Dekko Deacon sounds nice, I guess. He and Strafe went to school together, which is why we call Strafe by his last name, like the teachers did. We are all about the same age and live close to the town where the Malseeds lived before moving from England to Ireland. We always think it is a funny coincidence.

""How very nice,"" Mrs. Malseed said, smiling to welcome us again this year. She seems to know when guests are arriving because she is usually waiting in the large hall that always smells of flowers. ""Arthur, take the luggage up,"" she told the old porter. ""Rose, Tulip, Lily, and Geranium,"" she said, naming the rooms we would stay in. Mrs. Malseed painted flowers on the doors instead of using numbers. In winter, when not many people come to Glencorn Lodge, she takes care of little details like that; her husband handles repairs and decoration.

""Well, well, well,"" Mr. Malseed said as he entered the hall from the kitchen. ""A hundred thousand welcomes,"" he greeted us in the Irish way. He was smiling, and his dark brown eyes sparkled, making us feel like we were more than just another group of hotel guests. Everyone smiled, and I could tell the others felt that our holiday had truly started. Nothing had changed at Glencorn; everything was good.

Kitty from the dining room came out to greet us. ""You look younger every year, all four of you,"" she said, making everyone in the hall laugh again. Arthur led the way to our rooms, carrying as much luggage as he could and returning for the rest. After dinner, we played cards for a while, but we didn’t play for too long because we were still tired from the journey. 

In the lounge, there was a man alone and a French couple. There were other people at dinner too because Glencorn Lodge is always full in June. From where we sat by the window, we could see some guests walking on the lawns and others taking the path down to the beach. In the morning, we would do the same: walk along the beach to Ardbeag and have coffee at the hotel there, returning in time for lunch. In the afternoon, we would drive somewhere. I knew this would happen because over the years, we had developed this routine. Since we first came here, we had all fallen in love with the beautiful landscape in every way."
FCE_67,"**Keeping Holiday-Makers Happy**

Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex, is in her second year as a chalet girl in Val d'Isere, France. She cooks and cleans for visitors who come to ski and stay in wooden houses called chalets. Sarah studied French and History of Art at Oxford Brookes University and sees her job as a fun way to spend a year or two before starting a more permanent career. She enjoys meeting successful people through her work.

Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to work. She has her own breakfast before preparing breakfast for the guests, which includes porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants. After breakfast, she cleans up and either makes afternoon tea for the guests or cleans the rooms, which she finds the least enjoyable part of her job. By 11 a.m., she is ready to ski and enjoys being on the slopes until about 4:30 p.m.

After skiing, Sarah returns to the chalet to prepare dinner. She takes a shower first but avoids sleeping because it makes her feel worse. Dinner is a three-course meal served at 8 p.m., and coffee is usually ready by 10 p.m. After dinner, she cleans the kitchen because she dislikes coming back to a messy space the next morning. Sometimes she chats with the guests, but other times they prefer to be alone. She finds that good guests can make her week enjoyable, while some weeks are not as good.

Sarah lives in a chalet with friends, and they often go out around 11 p.m. They usually start at a place called Bananas, then go to G Jay's, and sometimes end the night at Dick's T-Bar. However, she does not stay out too late on Saturdays because Sundays are her busiest days. She calls Sundays a ""frightful day"" because she has to prepare breakfast for guests leaving early at 7 a.m.

Once the guests leave, Sarah cleans quickly, clearing breakfast, stripping beds, and getting everything ready for the new guests. If she hasn’t done the shopping on Saturday, she does it on Sunday. By around 3 p.m., after cleaning, she prepares tea for the new guests who arrive around 4:30 p.m. Sometimes the new guests are confused and have many questions, which Sarah finds amusing.

Between tea and dinner, she helps guests who need ski boots or equipment and then gets a ride back to the chalet. Soon, it is time for dinner again, and sometimes she enjoys a drink afterward, but if she is too tired, she goes to bed early."
FCE_27,"Miss Rita Cohen was a small girl with pale skin who looked much younger than Seymour's daughter, Marie, but she said she was six years older. One day, she visited his factory. She wore overalls and big shoes, and her curly hair framed her pretty face. Seymour found it hard to believe that she was studying at the University of Pennsylvania and doing research on the leather industry in New Jersey for her Master's degree. 

Several times a year, someone would contact Seymour to ask if they could visit his factory. Sometimes, he would help students by answering their questions over the phone or giving them a short tour if they seemed serious. Rita was almost as small as the children from Marie's third-grade class, who had visited the factory years ago to see how gloves were made. Seymour remembered how Marie loved to watch the workers shape and press each glove using hot brass hands that looked like they had been flattened. She called them ""pancake hands.""

Rita asked, ""How many pieces come in a shipment?"" Seymour replied, ""Between twenty and twenty-five thousand."" She took notes and asked, ""Do they come directly to your shipping department?"" He explained, ""They go to the tannery first. We buy the material, and they prepare it for us. My grandfather, father, and I all worked in the tannery here in town. Have you ever been inside a tannery?"" 

Rita said, ""Not yet."" Seymour encouraged her, ""You should visit a tannery if you want to write about leather. I can help you arrange that. It's a tough job, and while technology has improved things, it still looks similar to how it was hundreds of years ago. Tanning is one of the oldest industries; they found 6,000-year-old tools in Turkey. The first clothing was made from animal skins that were tanned by smoking them. It’s a fascinating subject. My father is an expert on leather; you should talk to him. He can talk for two days about gloves. Glovemakers really love their work.""

Seymour then asked, ""Have you ever seen anything being made, Miss Cohen?"" She replied, ""Not really. I saw my mother bake a cake when I was a child."" He laughed at her answer. She was innocent and eager to learn, reminding him of Marie, who was much taller than Rita but shared her spirit and intelligence. 

Seymour said, ""Let’s do something fun. We will take you through the whole glove-making process. Come on! What size do you wear?"""

**A. Raquel Graham**  
Raquel Graham calls from a taxi on her way to the airport. She cannot meet tomorrow because her boss needs her in Los Angeles. As a personal assistant to a pop star, she often travels around the world at a moment's notice. Raquel loves her job and has a good relationship with her boss. However, she has one small problem: she hates flying. ""On a nine-hour flight to California, I usually take sleeping pills to help me relax,"" she says. Her worst experience was flying on Concorde, which felt very cramped with its small windows. When she is not traveling, she works in offices in Manchester and London, doing regular tasks like organizing schedules, attending meetings with lawyers and accountants, and planning travel. Raquel did not apply for this job; she met the manager of a pop group by chance and took a secretarial course in the evenings. Five years later, she was in the right place when her boss needed a personal assistant.

**B. David Brown**  
David Brown has worked as an accountant and a golf caddy, which is someone who carries a golfer's bags. He prefers being a caddy because golf is his passion. However, there are some downsides. He earns a small flat fee plus a percentage of the winnings, which usually totals between £25,000 and £35,000, but much of that goes to travel and hotels. He started caddying for golfer Greg Norman when he was 31. ""You're not just carrying bags; you're giving advice and trying to understand the course,"" he explains. Recently, his accounting skills were recognized, and he became a statistical data administrator for European Tour Productions. He collects and analyzes statistics from each day's play, which are important for TV commentators, golf magazines, and the players.

**C. Martin Fern**  
Martin Fern is the editor of the 'Food and Drink' section of a daily newspaper. One of his easier tasks is to taste food at the best restaurants. What does he think about expensive restaurants? ""For those who can afford it, it's their choice,"" he says. ""I would rather spend £120 on a meal I will remember than buy a microwave."" His cooking talent led to a food column offer from a friend who was an editor. At that time, Martin was the creative director of an advertising agency, and it provided him with extra income. When he was 42, another newspaper offered him a full-time job. ""It meant a 50% cut in my guaranteed income,"" he says, ""but it was a chance to turn my passion into a career."" He still cooks at home and tries to stay fit by cycling a couple of miles to the nearest subway station.

**D. Dick Prince**  
""I started writing children's stories about 20 years ago,"" says Dick Prince, one of Britain's most popular children's authors. ""Before that, I loved words and mostly wrote poetry. Then I had an idea for a story. I had been a farmer and knew about chickens being killed by a fox, so I wrote a story called The Fox Busters, which became my first published children's book."" Where do his ideas come from? ""It's not easy; I have to work hard on them,"" he says. ""I usually write in the mornings, but I don't wake up at dawn. After lunch, I spend a couple of hours typing what I wrote in the morning, using an old typewriter instead of a laptop. I receive between 50 and 100 letters a week, and that is the part of being a writer I enjoy the most. I try to answer them all, but now I have some help with that."""
FCE_66,"In the lumberyard by the lake, there was an old two-story brick building. Outside, there were large piles of soft sawdust. That afternoon, feeling bored, a group of boys followed Michael up the ladder to the roof of the building. They sat with their legs hanging over the edge, looking at the lake. Suddenly, Michael said, ""I dare you to jump down."" Without thinking, he jumped off the roof and landed in the sawdust, rolling around and laughing. ""I dare you all!"" he shouted, calling them cowards to encourage them to jump too.

The other boys looked nervous but eventually jumped one by one, smiling with relief when they landed. They all lay on the sawdust, telling jokes until one of them suggested going back up to the roof to jump again. Although they were not very excited, they climbed back up and started jumping off again. Soon, only Michael was left on the roof while the others called up to him, ""Come on, Mike. What's wrong?""

Michael wanted to join them but hesitated at the edge of the roof, feeling nervous. He tried to count to ten and take a deep breath, but he couldn't jump. The other boys began to laugh at him, growing tired of waiting. ""Come on, you're a coward! Do you think we're going to sit here all night?"" they shouted. When he still didn't move, they started to walk away, still teasing him.

Michael felt confused and unhappy as he stared at the ground. He stayed on the roof for almost an hour while the sun set over the lake. His clothes were wet from sweating. Finally, he closed his eyes, jumped off the roof, and landed heavily in the sawdust. He lay there for a long time in silence, as the workmen had gone home. He wondered why he had been too scared to jump earlier. Eventually, he got up and walked home, feeling ashamed and wanting to avoid everyone.

When he got home late for dinner, his stepmother said coldly, ""You should be able to get home on time by now. If you won't come home, maybe you should stay out tonight."" She was a strong woman with soft skin and a little grey in her hair, always patient. But Michael, feeling gloomy and miserable, hardly listened to her. He was still thinking about the boys laughing at him on the sawdust pile."
FCE_44,"**Careers Advice**

Are you unhappy in your job and unsure how to change it? Kitty Doherty offers some helpful advice. Many people looking to change their job turn to a careers adviser. First, you will write a short history of yourself and then take some tests called 'psychometrics'. After the tests, you will receive a summary of the results and suggestions for different careers, along with any retraining you might need.

I decided to try Career Analysts, one of the biggest organizations that provide career advice. Taking the careers test felt like being back in school during science exams. I was in a group of about ten people, answering questions under time pressure. I had to remind myself that it wasn’t about passing or failing. It was hard to see how the psychometric tests could show an accurate picture of me. The tests included finding mistakes in lists of names and numbers and matching similar shapes.

After the tests, I had a long conversation with an adviser. Based on our discussion and the test results, he created a report with his observations and recommendations. I agreed with most of his conclusions, but I was a bit disappointed to learn that I did poorly in the scientific, technical, and practical tests. I’m sure many sick people are glad I never became a nurse! However, it was comforting to hear that I had made the right choices regarding journalism.

Changing your career doesn’t always mean making a big change. Last March, after working as a marketing manager at a large insurance company for five years, 25-year-old Donna Laney lost her job. Her friends suggested she visit Career Analysts for help. Donna said, ""Losing my job was a great chance for me to step back and look at my career. I wanted to rethink my skills and interests."" Some of the results surprised her. ""I didn’t realize I had a talent for design. But in the end, I had to think about the cost of retraining in design compared to my financial situation,"" she explained. Other suggestions included taking a year off to work in the Far East. ""I decided to use my existing skills and move into something that suited me better than insurance. I am now a Public Relations officer. I believe I would have reached this point without Career Analysts, but they helped me understand what I really wanted to do. I have sent several friends there, and they are all happy with the service.""

Some people feel they would not have made important decisions without help. For example, 26-year-old Juliet Greene visited Career Counselling Services and made life-changing choices. ""After working at a major bank for six years, I found my job boring and wanted a new challenge. I had no idea what I wanted to do, so I went to Career Counselling Services with an open mind. I took the tests, which showed I was interested in sciences,"" she said. ""I had four sessions with an adviser. The third session was recorded, which was helpful because you forget many things you say. After the fourth meeting, I carefully listened to the test results and decided I wanted to study geology. I plan to start a degree course later this year. I think the advice from Career Counselling Services was worth the fee. I feel much happier and more positive now.""

However, career advice does not work for everyone. Amanda Margetts, a 24-year-old sales representative, said, ""I reached a point in my career where I didn’t know what to do next. I thought a careers adviser might suggest something new. Although I received many ideas, I rejected them because they either required a big pay cut or a lot of retraining. I didn’t learn anything new about myself. You have to share a lot of personal information with the adviser, and I felt that if I had told a friend the same things, they would have given me similar advice."""
FCE_22,"**Fun at the Dentist's?**

If you visit W. Lloyd Jerome's dental office in the center of Glasgow, you will notice bright, modern paintings on the walls and a stylish blue couch where patients sit while he checks their teeth. Jerome says, ""Fifty percent of people only go to the dentist when they are in pain instead of for regular check-ups. This is often because they are scared."" To help with this fear, he has created a friendly environment. For example, he decided not to wear a white coat, which many people connect with pain. He believes that dental treatment should happen in a relaxing, interesting, and enjoyable atmosphere.

This idea is surprising for many people who usually think of dental visits as painful or very formal. Jerome explains, ""If people feel relaxed, entertained, and well-treated, they will forget their past bad experiences."" One of his new relaxation methods is using virtual-reality headsets. ""We were the first dental practice in Britain to use them, and they are very popular. During the first check-up, the patient sits comfortably on the blue couch and watches a film about underwater wildlife while I check their teeth. Then, the headset shows a special camera that gives the patient a view of their mouth.""

Most patients seem to enjoy this part of their visit. Another important detail is that the office smells more like a perfume shop than a dentist's office. Today, it smells like orange. Jerome wants people to notice that it is not like a typical dentist visit. He says, ""Smell is very important. The usual dental smell can make people feel anxious if they are afraid of dentists."" I also found the pleasant smell in the office very nice.

Although Jerome is known as Glasgow's most stylish dentist, he takes his work very seriously. While relaxation techniques are important, the quality of treatment is the most crucial part. For example, he uses a special tool that sprays warm water on the teeth to clean them instead of scraping, which can feel strange at first but is not painful if people are relaxed.

Five years ago, Jerome went to the United States to learn about new dental techniques. He explains, ""I found that making things easier for the patient also makes it easier for me."" He believes that his patient-focused approach is helping to change the formal nature of British dentistry. 

At that moment, a patient arrives. Jerome quickly goes to greet him, offers a cup of tea (herbal or regular), asks what video he would like to watch, and gently leads him to the chair. The patient seems to enjoy this special treatment, and it is easy to see why. The office feels more like a beautiful salon than a typical dental practice."
FCE_39,"**Bitter Water Hits the Big Time**

Chocolate, which comes from South America, is now a huge global business worth millions. In the UK, people spend over £230 million on chocolate during Easter, which is about eight percent of all chocolate sales for the year. Only at Christmas do people buy more chocolate. 

Although chocolate production on a large scale started in the last century, the cacao plant was first grown by the Aztec, Toltec, and Mayan civilizations in Central America over three thousand years ago. The cacao tree is a tropical plant found in Africa, South and Central America, the West Indies, and Southeast Asia. Its fruit is the size of a melon and contains 20 to 40 seeds. When dried, these seeds become cacao beans, which are used to make chocolate. In English-speaking countries, they are often called cocoa beans, a name that comes from a spelling mistake in the 17th century.

The Aztecs used cocoa beans as money and made a drink called xocoatl, which means ""bitter water"" in their language, Nahuatl. This drink was flavored with spices and used in ceremonies and to welcome guests. The Spanish found it tasted better with cinnamon and sugar, but this recipe did not reach Europe for another hundred years. 

In the late 17th century, chocolate houses opened in major European cities where people could drink chocolate. Until the last century, the drink was made by melting solid chocolate blocks in hot water. In 1826, CJ van Houten from the Netherlands invented chocolate powder by removing most of the cocoa butter from the beans. The chocolate bar we know today started in 1847 when a company in Bristol, Fry and Sons, mixed cocoa butter with chocolate liquor and sugar to create a solid bar. A Swiss company later added milk solids, leading to the creation of milk chocolate.

At the beginning of the 20th century, French companies dominated the British chocolate market. In 1879, the English company Cadbury named their factory Bournville, hoping to attract some French charm. Then, in 1905, Cadbury introduced the Dairy Milk bar, originally called Dairymaid. Smart advertising linked it to the healthy image of milk from the English countryside, making it a strong competitor to rich French brands.

Currently, British chocolate consumption is stable at about four bars per week. This has pushed manufacturers to find new ways to attract customers. One new idea is the ""extended line,"" where chocolate bars are turned into ice cream, soft drinks, or desserts to appeal to chocolate lovers who want something different.

However, cacao farmers are still struggling due to a drop in cocoa bean prices in the late 1980s. Many small-scale farmers went out of business. So, the next time you enjoy a chocolate bar, remember the challenges faced by those who grow cacao."
FCE_18,"**THE SHELL ARTIST**

At 83 years old, Peter Cooke has become a master in his craft. He still has many things he wants to try, like making paper and working with feathers, but for now, he focuses on creating beautiful objects from shells. As he shows me his work in his apartment, he asks, ""Am I boring you?"" There is a fine line between being boring and being passionate, but Cooke is definitely passionate, thanks to his charm and the beauty of his creations.

He points to some shell-covered decorations above his fireplace. ""I won’t mind if people don’t buy them because I love them so much. I never planned to sell my work. About five years ago, some friends suggested I have an exhibition so more people could see my art. They even talked to a gallery owner."" This led to an exhibition in London, where 70% of his pieces were sold. His second exhibition just opened at the gallery.

The prices for his work are quite high, around £2,000 for some ornaments. Cooke has 86 pieces in this exhibition, with prices starting at £225 for a shell flower in a crystal vase. He says he has nothing to do with the pricing and is open about it. He believes no one else makes art like his, and the gallery owner told him that one day, when he stops creating, everyone will want his pieces.

Cooke wishes he had started this work earlier in life because he believes he could have made even more amazing things. Although he still has many ideas, he feels limited physically compared to when he began. However, his work is very different from the typical shell items found in seaside shops. He describes himself as having a ""miniature mind,"" which has led him to create boxes covered in thousands of tiny shells, pictures made from shells, and baskets of incredibly realistic flowers.

He has developed his own methods and uses materials he finds. For example, he uses cardboard from laundered shirts for flower bases, a special glue from a sail-maker, and washing-up liquid to clean the shells. He says, ""I have an idea of what I want to do, and it just happens,"" but the detail and color in his work show that it is not random.

Cooke searches for beautiful, tiny shells not just on the beaches of Norfolk but also in places like France, Thailand, Mexico, South Africa, and the Philippines. He insists that he only collects dead shells and responds to people who accuse him of damaging beaches. He explains, ""When I collect shells, I hear people stepping on them much faster than I can collect them. The sea breaks up the ones that are left. I would never take shells with living creatures in them, but once they are empty, why shouldn’t I collect them?"" His argument is strong, especially considering the beauty he creates from the shells he finds."
FCE_62,"**The Schoolgirl Model**

Kira Langer is a 15-year-old girl who is both a model and a student. When she is not traveling to exciting places or appearing on magazine covers, she is studying for her school exams. Jane Laidlaw shares more about her.

I was waiting for Kira at the agency when the receptionist told me she would be late. I thought about all the negative things I had read about models, like being difficult or vain. I worried that Kira might not show up at all or that she would be in a bad mood if she rushed in. However, when Kira arrived, she was smiling and relaxed, and she brought her mother with her. 

Kira was not wearing fancy clothes; she had on a simple black dress and trainers. She seemed friendly and down-to-earth. Since Kira is under 16, she must have an adult with her when she works, and her mother looked proud of her daughter’s success. Kira seemed a bit surprised by her fame, which was unexpected. It was actually her older sister who encouraged her to enter a modeling competition. Kira initially said no, but her sister sent in some photos anyway.

When Kira found out she was a finalist, she was at school. This news gave her the confidence to continue, and she performed very well. She won the competition, and the Select model agency in London offered her work right away. 

Now, Kira has to balance her life as a model and a student. Her friends and teachers are proud of her, but some people at school make rude comments about her success, saying she thinks too highly of herself. Kira finds this hard to handle because she is not arrogant; she just feels more confident and can stand up for herself better.

Being a busy model affects her social life. The agency can call her at any time for a job the next day, so she cannot always make plans with her friends. However, her friends understand and do not complain about her modeling career.

Kira has the looks, talent, and support to have a great future ahead of her, even before finishing her school exams. As I was ending the interview, I asked her what she would like to do if she didn’t have her beauty. She thought for a moment and said, “I’d like to do what you’re doing.”"
FCE_49,"**Father and Son Start Gold Rush**

Terence and Chris Madden have traveled from the cold north of Canada to the hot lands of Africa in search of valuable metals. This father and son team—one an explorer and the other a mineral expert—believe their mine on a Welsh mountain could hold up to 10,000 ounces of gold. After ten years of digging in the Welsh hills, they think they are very close to finding a gold vein worth five million dollars. Terence, 68, from Liverpool, said, ""As we dig, we are finding high levels of gold; now we just need to dig a bit more to reach where it is concentrated.""

The Maddens have dedicated their lives to finding gold. Their search began when Terence read about gold worth millions buried in the ""Dolgellau gold belt,"" an area near the town of Dolgellau in Wales. While reading old mining journals and newspapers at the Welsh National Library in Aberystwyth, they chose the best area of land to explore. After clearing away plants and finding pieces of gold in the rocks, they spent ten years getting permission from landowners, taking soil samples, and removing old cars and trash. They dug out 150 tonnes of greenstone rock to create a tunnel and a 10-meter shaft.

Now, they are running out of money. They have spent their savings on this dream and need to convince someone to invest £50,000 to dig a few more meters to reach the gold. Chris Madden says, ""Right now, it seems unlikely, but we have several people we can contact.""

As news of their dig spread through the valleys, the idea of gold began to attract the attention of local people as well as other gold diggers. Dolgellau depends on tourism, and residents are cautiously optimistic. Peter Woolven, manager of the Royal Ship Hotel, said, ""If they are right, it would bring more visitors here, but I hope millions of people don’t come and damage the hillside if they find gold.""

The Welsh gold industry has greatly declined since its peak in the late 1880s when thousands worked in many mines across the countryside. One of the last remaining mines, Clogau-St David's, which made wedding rings for the Queen and the Princess of Wales, closed a month ago. However, individual gold diggers are returning. George Hall, another prospector, plans to dig a tunnel deep into the hill on the other side of the ridge from the Maddens. Hall, 70, said, ""Searching for gold is very emotional. It’s adventurous and exciting, the thrill of finding hidden treasure. Maybe I’ll be lucky this time."""
FCE_31,"**IN HOT WATER**

Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends a lot of time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She teaches and researches marine geochemistry, which means she studies the chemical processes in the sea. Rachel is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she is not teaching, she gets into a small steel vehicle used for underwater exploration and dives three kilometers down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes. 

Inside the vehicle, space is very limited. Rachel says, ""I can reach out and touch the two pilots."" They cannot stand up or move around, and they must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last for 16 hours: three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours to collect rock and water samples, and three hours to return to the surface. If there is an emergency and they need to get to the top quickly, they can press a panic button. This releases a small escape vessel that rises quickly to the surface, but Rachel thinks it would not be a pleasant journey.

Rachel remembers her first time in the vehicle. She got in with an instructor who explained the emergency procedures, including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack. They wanted to see how she would react in such a small space. Now, Rachel has made six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian crew to a site five days west of the Canary Islands. There, they found a large area of underwater volcanoes that release black smoke. The Russian team was dropping off scientific equipment to study a project that would create a hole 150 meters through a volcano.

When Rachel is not at sea, she works in her office at the Oceanography Centre in Southampton. She says, ""Two-thirds of my salary comes from teaching, which I love, but I do it so I can continue my research on the 'black smokers.'"" This is another name for underwater volcanoes, where water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke. This water flows out at a rate of one meter per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees.

Rachel recalls a frightening moment when she first dived with an American team. They were towing equipment when suddenly there was an explosion. She heard a huge bang as shock waves hit their vehicle, and she thought, ""I'm going to die."" They waited in silence, and when nothing happened, they felt incredible relief—they were still alive!

Diving to the deepest part of the ocean is an adventure for Rachel. Every time she looks out of the porthole and sees the chimneys, she feels a sense of wonder. She thinks, ""Here I am at the bottom of the sea, and no one else on this planet has ever seen them."" After studying the black smokers for three years for her PhD, seeing them in person was an amazing experience."

""Never again,"" I said as I returned home. I repeated this every year after. All I needed to do was buy one train ticket, and because I was under twenty-five, I could travel anywhere in Europe for a whole month.

Once you learn to sleep in a train corridor, regular beds feel different. Carrying all your things in a backpack makes you travel simply and can lead to wasteful habits, like burning socks that smell bad or throwing away finished books. However, this carefree way of traveling is part of the Inter-Rail spirit, where common sense can be forgotten along with your paperback book and socks. All you need is one of those tickets in your hand.

Any system that lets young people travel through several countries in one day is special. On my first trip, my friends and I didn’t realize how much we could do with this train ticket. We thought it was just a cheap way to get to our campsite in southern France. But the idea of traveling non-stop was too exciting. There was always one more country to visit, and it didn’t cost us anything extra.

We were not completely uninterested in culture, but this was our first holiday without parents, like many other Inter-Rail travelers. We focused on the most accessible sights and enjoyed the freedom of not being on a guided tour. I was proud that sometimes all I wanted to see was the view from the train station. We were just trying to get by and have fun, like most other Inter-Railers who shared train corridors, food, money, and music with us.

The excitement of travel comes from arriving in a place that was just a name before. It feels like the city didn’t exist until the train arrives, and you see it with your own tired eyes for the first time. Only by seeing Europe, watching the changing landscapes, and noticing different lifestyles can you truly understand the continent. Everyone knows what is there, but it means nothing until you experience it yourself. This is why other people's holiday photos can be boring. While the train trip may not let you discover new things in the world, it is a valuable personal experience. Europe is vast, and Inter-Rail offers the best chance to appreciate this, even if it didn’t happen for us right away."
FCE_37,"There is nothing more disappointing than arriving at an airport in another country and finding out that your luggage has been left behind. At best, you will have to wear the same clothes for hours or even days until the airline returns your bags. At worst, you might be in a different climate, far from home, and stuck in clothes that are not suitable for the weather. 

Airlines do not often share how many bags they lose, but it is common for travelers to be separated from their luggage at some point. Even the best airlines can make mistakes, and it is impossible for any airline to guarantee that your checked luggage will travel on the same flight as you, especially if your journey includes one or more flight changes.

The system works like this: Airlines require passengers to check in early, which is meant to give enough time for bags to go through the airport and be loaded onto the plane. Minimum connecting times (MCTs) are the shortest time needed to transfer between two flights, and these times are also extended to help with baggage transfers. Usually, this system works well. However, extra security checks and air traffic issues can cause flight delays, which can lead to problems with luggage.

Human error can also happen, such as when a destination label gets torn off. These issues can be worse at large airports, known as 'hubs', because they handle many bags. For example, last year, London’s Heathrow airport served over 41 million passengers, with nine million changing planes. British Airways alone had two million transfer passengers at Heathrow, most of whom had to transfer between Terminal 1 (for domestic and European flights) and Terminal 4 (for long-distance flights).

Even efficient airports like Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Singapore, and Zurich can have bad days. The risk of losing luggage when changing planes is higher at certain airports. In the United States, Miami airport is known for losing luggage when transatlantic passengers make quick connections to Latin America.

To avoid losing your luggage, choose direct flights whenever you can and check in early. If you must change planes, try to fly with the same airline for all your flights. Allow extra time for connections by taking an earlier flight to the transfer airport, and make sure to label your luggage inside and out with your home and holiday addresses, including your flight numbers.

If your luggage still goes missing, contact the airline staff in the baggage area and fill out a property irregularity report (PIR) before leaving the airport."
FCE_2,"**The Kingfisher**

Wildlife photographer Charlie James is an expert on the kingfisher, a beautiful blue-green bird that lives near streams and rivers and feeds on fish. Old trees hang over the stream, providing some shade to the shallow water. The main colors in this scene are soft greens, browns, and various shades of yellow from the sunlight, creating a calm atmosphere, just like the gentle sounds of water in the breeze. The kingfisher moves quickly and gracefully, like a flash of light, making a strong impression even though it is small. It disappears in an instant, but its image stays in your mind.

Charlie James fell in love with kingfishers when he was young. He feels a deep connection to this little bird, but he cannot explain exactly why. The kingfisher is part of many legends. In Greek mythology, it is a bird that was once a moon goddess. Another story says that the kingfisher flew so high that its upper body became the blue of the sky, while its lower body was burned by the sun. There is some truth to this story. Even though kingfishers have many shades of blue, they do not have blue pigment in their feathers. Instead, the structure of their feathers scatters light, making them appear blue. This is why a kingfisher can look bright blue or rich emerald green depending on the angle of the light.

It is no surprise that many wildlife photographers love kingfishers. Their beautiful colors and the fact that they can be watched from a distance make them fascinating. Charlie James's first hideout was an old blanket he put over his head while waiting near a kingfisher's favorite spot. The bird returned within minutes and sat just one meter away. However, it took him four more years to take his first good picture. During this time, the European kingfisher became a big part of his life. He spent as much time as possible by a stream where kingfishers lived. Unfortunately, school took away some of his time with the birds, and he missed classes, calling himself an ""academic failure."" But his passion for this widespread kingfisher, which is the only one of its family that breeds in Europe, was noticed. At 16, he was hired as an advisor for a nature magazine, then worked as an assistant to the editor, and eventually became a freelance wildlife film cameraman.

Now, he dreams of making the perfect kingfisher film. ""No speech, just beautiful images that say it all,"" he says. ""I like to photograph parts of kingfisher wings..."" His voice trails off as he thinks about the colors of the bird he has spent more than half his life observing, which still fascinates him. His photographs express some of his feelings, but Charlie knows that there is much more to his connection with the kingfisher than what his work can show."
FCE_68,"**Conducting an Orchestra: Insights from New Conductors**

Giving directions to an orchestra is not easy. Anne Inglis talks to five new conductors about their experiences.

**A. Anne Manson**  
Anne Manson, 30, asked conductor Claudio Abbado if she could watch his practice sessions in Vienna. Instead, she ended up filling in for an absent assistant. Later, she was invited to help with another opera. ""I had to lead the first rehearsal for Abbado. I wasn't nervous. I have always felt good about standing in front of an orchestra,"" she says. Manson, who is from America, works with a well-known opera company in London that focuses on modern music. She is also gaining recognition in other European countries, thanks to support from the British Arts Council. Since her first experience, she has assisted Abbado on several projects.

**B. Andrew Constantine**  
Andrew Constantine, 31, believes the hardest part of being a conductor is finding the right opportunities. He won a major competition in 1991 after trying twice before. Looking back, he feels lucky about the timing: ""If it had happened earlier, I would have been forgotten,"" he explains. The competition gave him many chances to perform and a role as an assistant to a famous conductor. However, he struggles with being known only for the competition. ""If in three years my name is still linked to the competition, I will be worried,"" he says. Fortunately, orchestras like the English Chamber Orchestra, which hired him after the competition, are inviting him back. If this doesn't happen, his career could suffer.

**C. Wasfi Kani**  
Wasfi Kani, who founded Pimlico Opera, enjoys the long practice periods that come with opera productions. ""The music deserves four weeks of attention,"" she says. Kani began conducting seriously in her late twenties. After university, she worked in London until Pimlico Opera became fully professional two years ago. Taking lessons with Sian Edwards was a turning point for her. ""I saw her conduct and realized she was my size. I had always learned from much larger conductors, which makes a big difference."" She appreciates the complexity of opera: ""There are many arguments, and you have to consider the personalities of the singers.""

**D. Roger Vignoles**  
Roger Vignoles, 48, says conducting surprised him but he finds it fascinating. He started as a musician in an opera house and worked with great conductors. Last year, he was asked to direct Handel's *Agrippina* from the piano at a festival, which he had never done before. ""It was easier than I expected. I knew the music well and what I wanted it to sound like. I did my best to achieve that. People respect my skills as a musician. I learn from every experience I've had, both in musical style and performance. Now, I am open to any opportunity to discover what I enjoy.""

**E. Wayne Marshall**  
In 1986, conductor Simon Rattle noticed Wayne Marshall, a young assistant conductor, and told his agent about him. Now 32, Marshall quickly found himself conducting a musical in London on short notice, which was a tough start. He even had to manage some relaxed musicians reading newspapers during the show. ""I was firm with them. I always kept a clear beat and aimed for the best result. Many musicians don’t seem to need guidance from a conductor, but I am not afraid to express what I want. If people see you are worried, it gets worse. I have never formally studied conducting, and no book teaches you how to do it, but people have been supportive. I am determined and know what I like."""
FCE_23,"**Variations on a Theme**

If you are thinking about taking children to a theme park, there are many options in Britain. We asked five families to try out some of the best parks.

**Fun Island - The Burns Family**  
Last year, we visited a big theme park in the US and thought Fun Island would be boring in comparison. However, we were pleasantly surprised. The park is great for younger children, so our three-year-old felt included. The kids loved the Crocodile Ride and the Giant Wheel. There is also a special dodgems ride for very young kids, which was a big hit. For older children, there are scarier rides like Splash Out, where you jump into a pool! After five hours, my husband Steve and I were ready to leave, but the kids wanted to stay because they were having so much fun. Our only complaint is that the park could use more atmosphere and better scenery. However, the staff were very helpful, and we found the park to be clean, well-organized, and safe.

**Wonderland - The McMillan Family**  
None of us had been to a theme park before, so we didn’t know what to expect. We thought our son Oscar might be too young, but he loved it. He enjoyed the Mountain Train and especially liked Little Land, which has small models of famous buildings. The older kids liked the ferris wheel and driving toy cars on a real road. We spent six hours there and appreciated the places to relax. The landscaping was beautiful, and the staff were friendly and helpful. There was something for everyone, including adults.

**Adventure World - The Jeffree Family**  
After seven hours, we still felt there was more to see. The kids loved the Big Top Circus, which had an amazing trapeze act. We tried the Terror Line, and although the girls were scared and kept their eyes shut, they said they enjoyed it. Their favorite ride was Running River, which looked like it would get you wet, but it didn’t. For younger children, Toy Land was a lot of fun. The kids wanted to try the new ride, Fear Factor, but we were relieved they were too small for it! The park is so well designed that even waiting in line for rides isn’t boring. It was very clean, and the staff were great. When I couldn’t sit with both girls on one ride, a staff member kindly went with one of them.

**The Great Park - The Langridge Family**  
We arrived at one o'clock and were disappointed that the park closed at 5 p.m. This park is excellent for younger children because the rides are not too scary. I’m not very brave, but I still had fun. We all loved Exotic Travels, a boat ride that starts slowly and then becomes very exciting. We waited for half an hour for Lightning River, and it was over too quickly! I wouldn’t go on the Big Leap, but it looked fun if you are brave. If the children were a bit older, they might have found it a little boring, but they were the right age and loved it.

**Fantasy World - The Break-all Family**  
According to the park’s advertising, there is ""No Limit to the Fun,"" and we definitely felt that way. Europe’s tallest roller-coaster, the Rocket, is the main attraction, and Ben thought it was the scariest ride. Jennie thought the Hanger, where you hang upside-down 30 meters above the ground, was even worse! There are about a dozen main rides, which the older kids went on several times. Sarah was too small for some rides but enjoyed the Long Slide. We found the staff’s attitudes varied. Some were great with younger children, but the welcome was not always friendly. You need a full day to enjoy Fantasy World, and we wouldn’t have dared tell the kids we were going home early."
FCE_60,"**Running a Business in the Countryside**

Five women share their experiences of starting a business in the countryside.

A. **Christine Hogan** runs a computer-aided design business that makes over £200,000 a year and has four full-time employees. She says, ""My customers are friends."" Christine moved from London to the countryside when her children were young. She wanted a job she could do from home. With her background in computers, her husband suggested she start a design business. Although it was hard at first and required a lot of money, she managed carefully and communicated with her bank manager about spending. Working from home saves money, and she can work in the evenings if needed. Her business is small, and most customers pick up their work directly.

B. **Maggy Sasanow** is a greetings card designer who works from home. She studied art at university and initially wanted to work in a museum. However, after moving to the countryside, she decided to start her own business. She creates 50 different greetings cards that she sells to museums. Maggy works in a large room upstairs but finds it hard to focus because there are always chores to do, like mowing the lawn. She does not advertise; her business grows through word of mouth. Although she misses sharing ideas with others, she believes the benefits of working alone outweigh the downsides.

C. **Delia Turner** runs a curtain-making business that has faced ups and downs. She started her business eight years ago when it was growing quickly, and her income increased from £24,000 to £80,000 in two years. At one point, she had six full-time employees, but she had to let them go due to economic decline, which was difficult because jobs are hard to find in her area. Now, she makes curtains at home with her husband’s help and works with women who also work from home. Delia knows she must sometimes lower her prices and look for new opportunities.

D. **Tessa Strickland** manages her children's book publishing business from her farmhouse. She moved to the countryside three years ago for financial reasons and because she loves the area. Tessa enjoys the flexibility of working when she wants, but 80% of her income comes from international deals, so she often takes calls at unusual hours. She publishes children's books from different cultures and collaborates with authors and artists. Although she felt lonely at first, she has adjusted to her new life.

E. **Meg Rivers** runs a cakes-by-post business and a shop that earns £250,000 a year and employs six people, some part-time. She started her business ten years ago at home, focusing on health by making fruit cakes with high-quality ingredients. After friends and family requested her cakes, she began sending them across the country. Seven years ago, she rented a small building where everything is made, and now she manages the business side instead of baking. Her biggest challenge has been handling the finances, as she did not have a lot of money to start with."
FCE_1,"**Meet the Amazing Watkins Family**

The Watkins family is special because they are all involved in music. The sons are composers and award-winning musicians, while their dad makes musical instruments. 

John and Hetty Watkins, who are schoolteachers in South Wales, wanted to buy a cello for their ten-year-old son, Paul, but found it too expensive. John thought about making one himself. He discovered a local school for instrument making and took evening classes for about three years. After trying to make violins and violas, he successfully made his first cello. Paul, now 28, remembers that the cello turned out great, and he used it until recently.

John has now retired from teaching and works full-time as a craftsman, making about twelve violins each year. One of his violins was even sold to a famous American musician, Jaime Laredo, which he considers a great achievement.

Paul and his younger brother, Huw, started playing music when they were young. Paul began with the piano and later switched to the cello. Although their dad wanted Paul to play the violin, Paul was inspired by a cellist in his dad's music group. Huw, now 22, is also making a name for himself as a pianist and composer. He appreciated the support from his parents and felt motivated by Paul’s success rather than pressured.

Paul has achieved a lot with the cello his dad made. He won the string final of the BBC Young Musician of the Year competition and became the principal cellist of the BBC Symphony Orchestra at just 20 years old. Recently, he started using a different cello, a Francesco Rugeri, which is over 300 years old, but he still values the one his dad made.

Paul will soon perform on television with the Rugeri cello in Elgar's Cello Concerto. However, he won’t be able to watch it because he will be playing at the Cheltenham Festival that same night. Huw will also be busy, as his String Quartet will have its London premiere at the Wigmore Hall. John and Hetty will have to be very organized to keep up with all their sons' musical events in the coming weeks."
FCE_53,"**Looking After the Countryside: The National Trust**

The National Trust is an organization that aims to protect the British countryside. Gill Page visits the Lleyn Peninsula in North Wales and speaks with Gareth Roberts, a warden who works for the Trust to care for its beautiful areas.

According to Gareth, a National Trust Warden needs common sense and good people skills. This is important because he often interacts with farmers, visitors, conservationists, and construction companies. Gareth grew up on the Lleyn Peninsula and worked on his parents' farm until he got married. About 80 people applied for the warden position, but Gareth's local knowledge and farming experience helped him get the job, even though he did not have formal training.

Gareth finds it helpful to still farm with his parents, as it allows him to understand farmers' problems better. He also has the physical strength needed for the job, which includes tasks like building fences, planting trees, and constructing walls. Since joining the Trust, Gareth has learned more about nature conservation. He remembers collecting flowers, butterfly larvae, and birds' nests when he was younger. He now realizes that farming has changed the countryside, but he believes it is not the farmers' fault; they were just following government advice.

When Gareth started his job, farmers and conservationists often disagreed. However, they are now communicating and understanding each other better. Gareth believes they are close to finding a way to work together. His work includes conservation, allowing public access to Trust land, planting trees, and meeting with tenant farmers. He aims to complete tasks efficiently and enjoys seeing projects finished, even though he spends a lot of time on reports and paperwork.

Gareth is passionate about his job and enjoys talking to the public, although he finds some people's attitudes frustrating. He dislikes when visitors come in, make demands, and leave without appreciation. However, he believes that common sense is key to handling these situations.

If you have common sense and enjoy outdoor work, you might consider applying to be a warden like Gareth. Just keep in mind that there may not be a job available on the Lleyn Peninsula for a long time!"
FCE_55,"**The Netball Captain**

In our series about women in sports, Suzie Ellis met England's netball captain, Kendra Slowinski. Kendra is the captain of the England netball team. When I met her, she had a busy day, which included teaching at a local school and then training in a supermarket car park. I asked her if people looked at her strangely while she trained. She replied, ""I focus so much on my movements and my feet that I don’t notice anything else. I might see cars slowing down out of the corner of my eye, but that’s it.""

Kendra said, ""My whole life is about being my best for the Championships."" She follows a strict schedule to be as fit as possible. This will be her fourth World Championships, and it will be the biggest one yet, with 27 countries participating. ""We will have home support, which is very special,"" she said. ""It’s important to improve the reputation of netball in this country. Playing at home means there will be more pressure on us. The crowd will have expectations and will support us more. People want us to start the tournament with a good game.""

Their first match is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. Kendra mentioned, ""We have always beaten them, but they will be exciting to play against because they are very skilled."" The England team is currently ranked fourth in the world, but Kendra knows the Championships will be challenging. ""You have to push yourself to play every day. There is no rest between games like in a series. In a series, you can still win if you lose the first game. But in the Championships, you only have one chance, so you must be ready.""

In the fifteen years she has played at a high level, the sport has become harder and faster. Players are more aggressive on the court. Kendra said, ""You don’t train hard just to lose. But once the game is over, we become friends again."" 

Netball is also using more scientific methods for fitness testing. Kendra explained, ""It’s important for us to think and train like world-class players. As captain, I need to have a strong mindset and lead by example. I see my role as supporting and encouraging my teammates.""

Kendra added, ""From the start of my netball career, I have planned everything carefully. I decided a while ago that this competition would be my last as a player."" She will likely coach young players in the future, but for now, she is focused on her final big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she might have tears in her eyes."
FCE_50,"**SPECIALIST MUSIC SCHOOLS**

How can parents help a child with exceptional musical talent? It can be difficult to know the best way to support their gift. Some parents might not realize their child's needs until they show frustration through difficult behavior. While most schools can help children who excel in academic subjects, musically talented children often need special attention that regular schools may not provide, especially if music is not a priority there. 

Children who are musically gifted, or those whose talents are encouraged by their parents or teachers, may benefit from attending a specialist music school. In Britain, there are five such schools, which have been established recently. These schools create a supportive environment for gifted children aged seven to eighteen, allowing them to develop their musical skills with the help of professional musicians.

At specialist music schools, students spend about one third to one half of their day on music activities. This includes individual lessons (up to three hours a week for their main instruments), playing in orchestras and chamber groups, voice training, conducting, and music theory. They also practice in well-equipped private rooms, sometimes with a teacher. The rest of their time is spent on a limited academic program that focuses on essential subjects like English, math, basic sciences, and languages. However, students can study more subjects if they wish.

All five British specialist music schools are independent, with smaller class sizes and a high teacher-to-student ratio. Most students live at the school, which means they spend their formative years with peers who share similar goals and interests.

What are the downsides? One major issue is the cost; fees can be high (between £12,000 and £17,000 a year for boarders). However, schools often provide scholarships and financial help for parents of exceptionally talented children. Additionally, not all parents want to send their children to boarding school, especially at a young age. Many directors of these schools have concerns about admitting children as young as seven into such a strict environment. They emphasize that their goal is to help students become well-rounded individuals.

It is important to note that separating musically gifted children from their peers at an early age can create stress. Some children may lose their musical talent during their teenage years, and the pressure to succeed can lead to feelings of failure. However, specialist schools closely monitor each student's progress and offer support when needed.

While many former students feel they gained a lot from the high-quality music education, some worry about the limited academic program, which often takes a back seat to music. Many musically talented young people are also very intelligent and can handle academic challenges, so they may feel frustrated if their academic needs are not met.

For these reasons, it might be better to wait until a child is older and can make their own choices before considering a specialist music education. Children who are also academically gifted may thrive in a regular school with a strong music program or by combining a normal school schedule with music training at junior departments of music colleges. These colleges offer Saturday morning lessons with excellent teachers, as well as opportunities to play in orchestras and chamber music groups. However, this option may not be available for families living far from London or other major cities."
FCE_25,"**An Eye for Detail**

Artist Susan Shepherd is famous for her flower paintings. The large garden around her house provides many of her subjects. It is filled with her favorite flowers, especially tulips and poppies. Some plants grow wildly and spread all over the garden. The two long flower borders along the paved path that goes from east to west are full of colors, shapes, and structures. This beauty is partly due to the previous owners, who loved gardening and left plants that Susan liked. She also kept the gardener, Danny. ""In fact, it was really his garden,"" she says. ""We got along very well. At first, he would say, 'Oh, it's not worth it' for some of the things I wanted to add, but when I told him I wanted to paint them, he understood my vision.""

Susan prefers to paint detailed studies of individual plants instead of the whole garden. Sometimes, she paints a group of plants, but usually, she picks one flower and takes it to her studio. ""I don't set everything up at once,"" she explains. ""I take one flower out and paint it, which might take a few days. Then I bring in another one and build the painting that way. Sometimes it takes a couple of years to finish.""

Her busiest time is spring and early summer when the tulips bloom, followed by the poppies. ""They all come out together, and you're so busy,"" she says. But she also finds beauty in the way flowers change as they decay. For example, with tulips, ""you bring them in and put them in water, then leave them for a day, and they change shape. They open up and look amazing. At first, you think they are boring, but they keep changing.""

Susan has always loved plants. ""I studied botany in school and used to collect wildflowers from the countryside,"" she says. ""I wasn't really interested in gardening then; I didn't like garden flowers because they looked fake, like silk or plastic. I was fascinated by how wildflowers could grow in difficult places, like cracks in rocks or on cliffs.""

Today, her garden has many plants from faraway places, but they seem just as comfortable in her garden as they do in their native lands like China or the Himalayas. She has a relaxed attitude towards her garden, like a caring aunt who lets children play freely as long as they don't cause serious trouble. 

With two upcoming exhibitions to prepare for and plenty of subjects right outside her door, Susan has found it hard to spend time in the garden lately. She now hires an extra gardener, but she knows that to stay connected to her work, ""you have to get your hands dirty."""
FCE_34,"**Keeping Holiday-Makers Happy**

Sarah Sutherland-Pilch, a 24-year-old from West Sussex, shares her experiences as a chalet girl in Val d'Isère, France. This is her second year in this job, where she cooks and cleans for visitors who come to ski and stay in wooden houses called chalets. Sarah studied French and History of Art at Oxford Brookes University and graduated last summer. She sees being a chalet girl as a fun way to spend a year or two before starting a more permanent career. ""It's a good way to meet successful people,"" she says.

Sarah does not live in the chalet. She wakes up at 7 a.m. and walks about a mile to work. She has her own breakfast before preparing breakfast for the guests, which includes porridge, eggs, cereals, fruit, and croissants. After breakfast, around 9:30 a.m., she cleans up and either makes afternoon tea for the guests or cleans the rooms, which she finds the least enjoyable part of her job. By 11 a.m., she is ready to ski herself and enjoys being on the slopes until about 4:30 p.m.

After skiing, Sarah returns to the chalet to prepare dinner. She takes a shower first but avoids sleeping because it makes her feel tired. Dinner is a three-course meal served at 8 p.m., and coffee is usually ready by 10 p.m. After dinner, she cleans the kitchen because she dislikes coming back to a messy space the next morning. Sometimes she chats with the guests, but other times they prefer to be alone. ""Good guests can make a week great,"" she says, but some weeks are not as enjoyable.

Sarah lives in the chalet with her friends, and they often go out around 11 p.m. They usually start at a place called Bananas, then go to G Jay's, and maybe end the night at Dick's T-Bar. However, she does not stay out too late on Saturday nights because Sundays are her busiest days. ""It's a tough day,"" she explains, ""when you don’t want to cook breakfast feeling tired.""

On Sundays, Sarah starts work earlier, with breakfast for guests served by 7 a.m. After the guests leave, she quickly cleans the chalet, clearing breakfast and changing the beds. If she hasn’t done the shopping on Saturday, she does it now. By around 3 p.m., after finishing the cleaning, she prepares tea for the new guests who arrive around 4:30 p.m. Sometimes they seem confused and have many questions, which Sarah finds amusing.

Between tea and dinner, she helps guests who need ski equipment by taking them to the ski shop and getting a ride back to the chalet. Soon, it’s time for dinner again, and she might chat with friends, but sometimes she is too tired and goes to bed early."
FCE_12,"**Changing Lives with a Stranger**

Mandie Currie is a zoo-keeper who spent a day at the magazine Marie Claire. She found it hard to choose what to wear because she usually wears a uniform at the zoo. Her day started in a photo studio and then she went to press previews before lunch. The zoo is a calm place, but at the magazine, she felt rushed. Some people on the fashion team seemed stressed, but her job at the zoo is not very stressful. During a fashion shoot in the afternoon, she laughed at the thought that she would normally be cleaning cages or handling rats. She is interested in how magazines work, but she loves her job at the zoo and wants to stay there.

Alice Cutler, a fashion assistant at Marie Claire, spent a day at London Zoo. She arrived wearing leather boots and dark blue trousers, but the zoo gave her a green polo shirt to wear, which was good because she got very dirty. While petting an elephant, she thought about Mandie probably packing clothes at the magazine. By five o'clock, she was dirty but had a wonderful day. She could see herself working with elephants in Africa after she retires from fashion.

Karen Hodson, a nurse at Hammersmith Hospital, worked with the team from the gardening show Ground Force. She was very excited to meet the team, especially Alan Titchmarsh, the presenter. She enjoyed being outside because her hospital shifts sometimes keep her indoors. Although the work was hard, she had a lot of fun. She thought she was strong, but she felt weak compared to the gardening team. She realized that gardening requires a lot of physical work and planning, so she does not plan to leave her nursing job.

Charlie Dimmock, a landscape gardener from Ground Force, spent a day working at Hammersmith Hospital. He made beds and handed out medicine. He thought he might feel faint doing some tasks, but he was surprised that it didn’t bother him. He enjoyed the friendship among the nurses and felt it was very different from his usual male work environment. Although his day at the hospital was not easy, it gave him a great sense of satisfaction.

Lucy Harvey, a personal trainer, spent a day with Ryanair as cabin crew. When she put on the uniform, she felt different and noticed that people looked up to her. Before the flight, her supervisor talked about safety, which she already knew from her fitness training. When passengers boarded the flight to Paris, she handed out magazines and felt self-conscious as everyone stared at her. On the way back, there were 80 schoolchildren on board who wouldn’t sit still, and she wished she was back in the gym with one sensible adult.

Sonia McDermott, an air hostess with Ryanair, spent a day as a personal trainer in a gym. She was nervous about this swap because she doesn’t exercise. She was surprised by how much attention trainers give to one person, while in her job, she meets 130 passengers four times a day. At lunch, she noticed that some trainers didn’t eat very healthily, but they all drank a lot of water. She wouldn’t change her job for this experience, but it inspired her to join a gym and try to be healthier."

**Andrea Thompson - Newsreader**  
I fell in love with the south of France a long time ago and try to visit as often as I can. There is a local train from Cannes that goes along the coast and crosses into Italy. It takes you past beautiful sea views. No matter the weather or the time of year, the journey is always magical. Out of the other window, you can see some of the best gardens and homes in France. It feels like you are looking into the lives of the rich and famous. The passengers are always lively, with a mix of tourists and locals, all enjoying the stunning views.

**Raj Patel - Explorer**  
I have had many great train journeys, but my favorite is the Nile Valley Express, which travels through the northern Sudan desert. When I was young in South Africa, I missed a family train trip from Cape Town to Kruger National Park because I was considered too young and troublesome. When I moved to England as a teenager, I still hadn’t traveled by train. London Waterloo was the first real train station I saw, and its large glass dome amazed me.

**Betty Cooper - Novelist**  
I am very grateful to one train in particular: the Blue Train, which took my husband and me on our honeymoon across France to catch a boat to Egypt. On the train, my husband gave me a pink dress, which I loved. Someone said that pink is good for the brain, and I have worn it ever since. The journey was wonderful, traveling through France and then by boat up the Nile. It was the perfect way to relax after all the wedding planning.

**Martin Brown - Journalist**  
We were working on articles about a round-the-world trip and needed to cross a desert in Africa. There were no roads, so we took the Desert Express. The schedule was not reliable; we were just told to be ready on a certain day. The driver often waited for days if he knew people were still coming. When the train arrived, many people rushed to get on, even climbing onto the roof for free. At night, the train passed through some of the most beautiful landscapes I have ever seen. It felt like a dream, like traveling across the moon.

**Arisu Mezuki - Actress**  
Most people have childhood memories of trains, but I do not. I grew up in Singapore and Cyprus, where I saw very few trains. It wasn’t until I was a teenager that trains became important in my life. I made a film that featured a railway in Yorkshire. Most of the filming was on an old, unused part of the line that volunteers had taken care of. That’s where my love for steam trains started. When we weren’t filming, we took every chance to ride the train, and when I returned last year, everything was just as I remembered, even the gas lights on the station platform!"

If you want to publish your story, expert Margaret Stubbs has some helpful advice. Many readers of this magazine ask, ""I have written a story or book. Who should I send it to?"" The first thing you need to do is research the market and learn about publishers while also improving your writing skills. Turning your writing into something that can be sold requires a good understanding of the publishing world.

No matter what type of writing you do, you should know the markets you want to reach. One of the best ways to learn about these markets is to read as much as you can. Visit your local library, bookstores, and newsagents. Reading widely will help you understand what kinds of writing publishers are currently accepting. 

As time goes on, you need to keep updating your knowledge because new publications are always coming out. Editors change jobs, and magazines can change their focus. Publishers are always looking for new writers, so you need to give them what they want.

At first, you might not be sure what you want to write. For example, if you think you want to write short love stories, the first step is to find out which magazines publish love stories. This market is quite limited these days, so get recent copies of those magazines. Learn about the types of stories they buy and who their readers are. These readers have specific expectations, and the editor wants to meet those needs.

Writers often ask me, ""This story has been rejected three times. Am I wasting my time? Do I have a chance?"" As a former teacher, I never want to discourage anyone. However, it is likely that the work is not ready for publication. Many new writers are too eager to send out their work before they are prepared. If you have only written one story or article, it is very unlikely to be published. This rarely happens. When you hear about someone’s success, they usually have been in publishing or journalism for years before achieving it.

When you finally send out your work for the first time, keep writing while you wait for a response. Write ten more stories, or even twenty. Each one will be better than the last, and you will start to see yourself as a writer. This will help you gain confidence and improve your skills. Instead of giving up on your stories, work on improving them. 

I also recommend not sharing your work with others in the early stages. Remember, every successful writer has faced many rejections before finding success. Do everything you can to advance your writing career. Look for a creative writing course nearby, or join a local writers' group to gain ideas and confidence from other aspiring writers. Think of yourself as a writer and practice writing every day if you can."
FCE_4,"**No Title**

On the last day of a difficult year, I was waiting at the Baltimore railway station for the 10:10 train to Philadelphia. There were more people there than I expected. The station, usually bright and clean, felt crowded. Older couples with matching luggage filled the benches, and many college students had left their bags on the floor. 

A grey-haired man was walking around, talking to different people. He looked well-off with his tanned skin, nice sweater, and soft beige coat. He approached a woman sitting alone and asked her if she was going to Philadelphia. She replied that she was going north, but to New York. He thanked her and moved on. 

Next, he asked an old lady if she was going to Philadelphia, but she said she was going to Wilmington. He continued down the row to a couple with matching luggage. I moved closer, pretending to look at the platform, even though I was going to Philadelphia too. I understood why he didn’t ask me; he probably thought I looked unreliable. 

He seemed stressed as he approached a woman reading a book. “Please! Tell me you’re going to Philadelphia!” She looked up and said she was. He then asked her for a favor. I stood a few feet away, pretending to check my wrist, even though I didn’t have a watch. I could tell the woman was becoming cautious. 

The man explained, “My daughter is flying out this afternoon for a study year abroad from Philadelphia. I put her on a train this morning, but when I got home, my wife was upset. My daughter forgot her passport and called from the station in Philadelphia, not knowing what to do.” The woman listened sympathetically, but I thought it was better to stay quiet and see where this was going. 

He continued, “I told her to stay at the station, and I would send someone with her passport.” I thought it was strange he didn’t go himself if it was so urgent. The woman asked, “Why don’t you go yourself?” He replied, “I can’t leave my wife alone for that long. She’s in a wheelchair.” I thought this was a weak excuse. 

I noticed the man was holding a padded envelope, not a regular one, which seemed odd. It looked stapled shut too. I thought to myself, “Be careful, lady.”"
FCE_30,"**Gary and Me**

John Moore, the owner of a restaurant, talks about his relationship with his son Gary, who is a famous TV chef. John believes that everyone gets a chance in life. His chance was to run a restaurant, and Gary's chance was to cook.

When John found out about the restaurant opportunity, he quickly went to see it. The place was in bad condition, but it was just what he needed. Starting this business reminded him of his childhood. He remembers feeling sad when his mother went to work in a factory and left him alone. Because of this, he wanted to make time for family. His wife took care of the children and managed the accounts while John ran the restaurant. They lived above the restaurant and always made sure to have meals together. This helped their children, Gary and Joe, become very confident. From a young age, they would talk to the regular customers, which gave them a good start in life.

Gary was a lively child. When he was about seven, he jumped into a corner bath like it was a swimming pool and knocked himself out. As he grew older, he had to earn pocket money. He started with small jobs and by the age of ten, he was working in the kitchen every weekend, which meant he had a lot of money at school. He was very disciplined and would wake up even before John. In a family business, everyone helps out, and John was happy to see Gary working.

Although Gary was not very good at school, he excelled in the kitchen. By the age of 15, he was as skilled as the adult chefs and sometimes even managed the kitchen. He could prepare over a hundred meals, and John knew Gary would pursue a career in catering. When Gary needed work experience for school, John sent him to a friend’s restaurant.

Recently, Gary started playing the drums and formed his own band. John wonders what will happen to Gary's cooking if his music career takes off. He advised Gary to focus on one thing at a time, saying, ""If you chase two hares, you catch neither."" John also told Gary that he needed to achieve his goals by the age of 30, or it might be too late.

At 17, Gary went to catering college. On his first day, while other students were just starting, Gary quickly chopped all his vegetables and sliced the meats. He even helped his classmates. Everyone is amazed at how successful Gary's TV cooking show has become, and John is very proud of him. He always tells Gary that if you want something, you have to work hard for it because nothing is given for free. Gary has recognized the opportunities he has and has taken full advantage of them.

As parents, we talk to our children as they grow up, and even if they only remember a little of what we say, we should be happy. John sees that Gary listens and learns from him, which makes him proud."
FCE_7,"**Finding a Flat in Dublin**

Finding a good flat in Dublin that you can afford is very difficult. The best way to find one is through personal connections. If you know someone who knows someone else who is moving out, that can help. But if, like Jo, you just arrived in Dublin, you don’t have those connections. So, Jo had to stay in a hostel and look for a flat. For her, Dublin felt very unfamiliar. She felt nervous when she took the train to start her new job there. She didn’t question why she was going; everyone at school expected her to leave her small town. They all wanted to escape and experience life in a bigger city. Some of her classmates had already moved to nearby towns like Ennis or Limerick, where family members helped them settle in. But Jo was going to Dublin alone.

Jo’s mother thought it would be good for her to stay in the hostel permanently. It was run by nuns, so her mother believed she would be safe. Her father hoped the hostel would be warm because they are often cold. Jo’s sisters, who worked as waitresses, thought she was crazy for staying in a hostel for a whole week. But Jo didn’t know they were still talking about her while she answered an ad for a flat in Ringsend. The ad said, ""Own room, own television, share kitchen and bathroom."" It was very close to her job at the post office and seemed too good to be true. Jo hoped it would be nice, that the people would like her, and that it wouldn’t be too expensive.

There wasn’t a long line for this flat because it was more about finding a ""Third Girl Wanted"" than just a flat to rent. The mention of ""own television"" made Jo wonder if it was too fancy for her, but the house looked normal. It was a simple red-brick house with a basement, but the flat was upstairs. As Jo climbed the stairs, a cheerful girl with a college scarf came down. ""Desperate place,"" she said to Jo. ""They’re both awful. Common as dirt.""

Jo asked, ""What do you mean?"" The girl replied, ""She didn’t have to do anything. She just looked around and acted like it was terrible in a posh accent. We wouldn’t want her here, would we, Pauline?"" Pauline, who had colorful punk clothes and hair, was also there. Jo was surprised to meet a punk in person since she had only seen them on the street.

""I'm Jo, I work at the post office and I called about the flat,"" she said. Nessa, the girl with the college scarf, said they were about to have tea. She brought out three mugs: one with ""Nessa,"" one with ""Pauline,"" and one labeled ""Other."" ""We’ll put your name on a mug if you come to stay,"" she said kindly."
FCE_43,"**Behind the Dolphin's Smile**

People love dolphins. We enjoy watching them in seaside areas, movies, and TV shows. However, according to the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society, dolphins are in serious trouble. Mark Simmonds reports on the decline of dolphin populations.

Dolphins are special to us. They are very intelligent, sensitive to human feelings, and they inspire us with thoughts of freedom in the ocean. Our affection for dolphins has been supported by TV shows. For example, there was ""Flipper,"" and now we have Darwin from ""Seaquest."" But these happy images hide the harsh reality of dolphins living in polluted and overfished oceans today.

The population of North Sea harbour porpoises, a type of dolphin, has decreased by up to 89,000. You might think that such beloved animals would be protected by laws and cared for in special marine reserves, but this is not true. The lack of plans to protect them could lead to one of the biggest wildlife disasters of our time.

There are forty different types of dolphins around the world. In northern Europe, the most common are the striped dolphin, the common dolphin, the bottlenose dolphin, and the smaller harbour porpoise. The striped and common dolphins usually live far out in the open sea and are seen only in small groups. We know very little about them. Bottlenose dolphins and harbour porpoises used to be common near European coasts. Bottlenose dolphins are very social and were often seen along the Channel coast and in rivers like the Thames. Now, they can only be found in a few places, like the Moray Firth in Scotland and Cardigan Bay in Wales. The few that remain show signs of stress, such as skin injuries.

The reasons for the decline in dolphin numbers are complicated. Overfishing is reducing fish populations and threatening local fishing industries, which also puts dolphins and porpoises at risk. Porpoises need to find food quickly, and if fish are removed from one area, they may not survive long enough to find food elsewhere. They can also get caught in fishermen's nets, which they cannot see. Many modern fishing methods use large nets that are either left floating or pulled quickly through the water. In recent years, many dead dolphins have washed up on the beaches of France and Cornwall. Marks and cuts on their bodies show that they died after being caught in these nets.

Dolphins can also store harmful substances in their bodies. For example, pesticides can build up in their fat. When female dolphins produce milk, it can be rich in these poisons, which can harm their young. There has been at least one case of a young dolphin dying from its mother’s poisoned milk.

Another serious threat to dolphins comes from human activities. Dolphins live in groups and rely on sound to understand their environment. Noise pollution from ships and oil drilling travels much better in water than in air, which may disturb dolphins in ways we do not fully understand."
FCE_51,"**GETTING FIT**

Exercise is very important for your mind, body, and spirit. It helps you stay balanced, especially when life feels chaotic and fast-paced. You might be tired of reading about fitness, but there are many good reasons to exercise, and very few reasons not to.

Exercise helps improve your muscle tone and can quickly change your body shape. It makes your muscles stronger and helps you maintain good posture, which is how you hold your body when sitting or standing. It also prevents muscle imbalances that can lead to injuries. You can see quick improvements in areas like your thighs, stomach, and upper arms. Additionally, exercise is good for your heart, lungs, and blood circulation.

You may have heard these benefits many times, but here’s something new: exercise can help reduce feelings of depression and tiredness, and it can help you sleep better. It also helps manage stress and can relieve some medical conditions. 

If you still need convincing, just remember that exercise is good for you. There are many types of exercise you can try, such as aerobics, jogging, or using weights. However, be careful not to train too hard or lift too much weight, as this can cause injuries. If you’re unsure about what exercises are right for you, it’s a good idea to talk to your doctor.

Good posture is essential for improving your body shape. If you have poor posture, it can make you look and feel less energetic and can lead to health problems. To improve your posture, imagine that a helium balloon is pulling the top of your head up towards the sky. This can help you lift your chest and breathe better, while also making your body look slimmer.

Stretching is also important. It improves your flexibility and helps you move easily. Stretching can prevent injuries and muscle tears. If you stretch four or five times a week, you will become more flexible and fit. 

A good exercise routine should include a warm-up, stretching, an energetic workout, and a cool-down period."
FCE_11,"**IN THEIR NATURAL HABITAT**

What makes film-makers Amanda Barrett and Owen Newman leave their comfortable homes for months? They are looking for the perfect shot. In the jungles and plains of East Africa, it can be very hard to find them. Right now, they are in the Ngorongoro Crater, which has had six months of almost constant rain, causing many unexpected problems. Newman explained that they had to buy an expensive piece of equipment so that if one of their vehicles gets stuck in the mud, Amanda can pull him back to safety. Their teamwork has produced some of the best wildlife films on TV, including a popular film about leopards. While this film was being shown, they were already back in the field, this time following the shy jackal.

Traveling film-makers have been exploring the world to film exotic wildlife since television began. I spoke to Newman during one of his rare meetings with other people at a safari lodge. He said, ""We do have occasional arguments, but we usually get over them quickly."" Neither of them sees themselves as the leader, and they get along well because they both view the animals in a similar way. 

When they are on the move, they set up their tents each night. But now, they are working from a more fixed camp. They wake up at 5 a.m. and often make tea the night before to keep it warm. Their daily meals consist of pre-packed food that they heat and serve as needed. ""It's not unusual for us to be out for up to eight weeks, so cooking can sometimes be stressful,"" says Newman. 

Their life can be tough, but being in remote areas allows them to get close to the animals. Newman remembers filming a family of lions, where one lioness would often go off alone. When she returned, she would greet all the other lions, and eventually, she also greeted their car as part of her routine.

Newman first worked with Barrett in 1988 on a film called ""The Great Rift."" Two years later, they began working together to film Arctic foxes. Since then, they have learned to spend four months in the field to gather enough material for each half-hour film. Before they can start filming, they must submit a script for approval. 

Newman says, ""Amanda and I built a good working relationship from the start because we shared the same ideas and vision. We aim to create a film that captures the true spirit of the place and the animals, and that touches people's hearts. I believe that if you can make people feel something, it is much better than just appealing to their minds."""
FCE_14,"**The Netball Captain**

In our series about women in sports, Suzie Ellis met Kendra Slawinski, the captain of England's netball team. When I met her, she had a busy day, teaching at a local school and then training in a supermarket car park. I was surprised by her training location. I asked her, ""Don't you get strange looks?"" She replied, ""I focus so much on my movements and my feet that I don’t notice anything else. I might see cars slow down a little, but that’s it.""

Kendra said, ""My whole life is about being my best for the Championships."" She follows a strict schedule to be as fit as possible. This is her fourth World Championships, and it will be the biggest one yet, with 27 countries participating. ""We will have home support, which is very special,"" she said. ""It’s important to improve the reputation of netball in this country. Playing at home means there will be more pressure than usual. The crowd will have expectations and will support us more. People want us to start the tournament with a good game.""

Their first match is against Barbados, right after the opening ceremony. Kendra believes they have always won against them, but she knows they will be a tough team to play. The England team is currently ranked fourth in the world, but Kendra warns that the World Championships will be challenging. ""You have to push yourself every day. There is no break between games like in a series. In the Championships, you only have one chance, so you must be ready to take it.""

In the fifteen years she has played at a high level, the sport has become harder and faster. Players are more aggressive now. Kendra said, ""You don’t train hard to lose."" But once the game is over, everyone is friendly. 

Netball is also using more scientific methods for fitness testing. Kendra believes it is important for everyone to think and train like top players. As captain, she wants to have a strong mindset and lead by example. ""I see my role as supporting and encouraging the team,"" she said.

Kendra has planned her netball career carefully. She decided that this competition would be her last as a player. She will likely coach young players in the future, but right now, she is focused on her final big event. As she leads her team in the opening ceremony, she might have tears in her eyes, knowing her loyal supporters are with her every step of the way."
FCE_63,"**In Hot Water**

Rachel Mills is a scientist who spends a lot of time at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. She teaches and researches marine geochemistry, which means she studies the chemical processes in the sea. Rachel is a lecturer at the Oceanography Centre at Southampton University. When she is not teaching, she gets into a small steel vehicle used for underwater exploration and dives three kilometers down into the Atlantic Ocean to study underwater volcanoes.

Inside the vehicle, Rachel says, ""The space is so small that I can touch the two pilots. We cannot stand up or move, and we must stay inside until someone opens the door from the outside. A dive can last for 16 hours: three hours to reach the ocean floor, ten hours to collect rock and water samples, and three hours to return to the surface.""

""If there is a problem and we need to get to the top quickly, we can hit a panic button. This releases a small escape vessel that rises quickly to the surface. No one has tested it yet, but I don’t think it would be a pleasant journey.""

Rachel remembers her first time in the vehicle. It was on a ship, and she got in with an instructor who explained the emergency procedures, including what to do if the pilot had a heart attack. They wanted to see how she would react in such a small space.

Now, Rachel has made six dives. Last year, she dived with a Russian crew. ""We went to a site five days west of the Canary Islands in the Atlantic. There is a large area of underwater volcanoes that release black smoke. This is where the Atlantic Ocean is very active. The Russian team was dropping off scientific equipment to study a project that would create a hole 150 meters through a volcano.""

When Rachel is not at sea, she works in her office at the Oceanography Centre in Southampton. ""Two-thirds of my salary comes from teaching, which I love, but I do it so I can continue my research on the 'black smokers.' This is another name for underwater volcanoes, where water comes out of the rock and looks like black smoke. It flows out at a rate of one meter per second and at a temperature of 350 degrees.""

Rachel recalls a frightening moment when she first dived with an American team. They were towing equipment when suddenly there was an explosion. ""There was a huge bang, and I thought, 'I'm going to die.' We looked at each other in silence, waiting. When nothing happened, we were incredibly relieved to be alive!""

""Diving to the deepest part of the ocean is such an adventure. Every time I look out of the porthole and see those chimneys, I feel amazed. I am at the bottom of the sea, and no one else on this planet has ever seen them before. I studied the black smokers for three years for my Ph.D., and seeing them for real was an incredible feeling."""
FCE_56,"**Interview Tips**

First impressions are very important. Studies show that people form opinions about us within the first few minutes of meeting. They notice how we dress, our eye contact, our body language, and how we speak, including our speed, volume, and tone of voice, as well as the words we use.

Mary Pearce studied to be a teacher. She worked hard to earn her degree and felt confident when she graduated. She applied for a job at a nearby primary school and got an interview with the Head Teacher. On the day of the interview, she noticed a small hole in her jacket. She thought about changing but decided it would make her late, and she believed being on time was very important. Unfortunately, Mary did not get the job. A friend who worked at the school told her that the Head Teacher said, ""If someone doesn't take the time to present her best image at an interview, what kind of teacher will she be?""

Simon Grant, a hotel manager, says that candidates who care about their appearance are more likely to care about their jobs. People often say that what matters is inside, but during an interview, it is important to present yourself well.

Many people overlook the importance of a professional image. For example, Janet Goodwood worked for ten years as an administrative assistant in a large accounting firm. When the office manager retired, she applied for the position but did not get an interview. She thought it was a mistake and asked the Director of Personnel what happened. He told her that she did not fit the image of an office manager and suggested she improve her wardrobe before applying again. Janet was shocked because she believed her work performance should matter more than her appearance.

Body language and gestures also affect an interviewer's first impression. Psychologist Albert Mehrabian found that only 7% of our message about feelings comes from the words we use, 38% from our voice, and 55% from our facial expressions. If our facial expressions and words send different messages, the listener will pay more attention to the non-verbal message. Therefore, it is important that your words match your body language. Mixed messages can confuse the interviewer.

It is also important not to seem too desperate for the job or overly eager to please. Sheila Rice, a marketing specialist, applied for a promotion and had a great interview. She was offered the job immediately. However, she reacted with too much excitement. Once her boss saw how happy she was, he offered her a lower salary than she expected. She believes she could have negotiated a better salary if she had controlled her excitement.

Finally, what you say and how you say it can affect your interview success. David Artesio, a manager at an employment agency, suggests learning about the company before the interview. For example, reading the annual report can help you understand the company better. Mentioning an area that interests you during the interview can show your interest in the company.

Business consultant Marian Woodall advises having a few questions ready and avoiding long, confusing sentences. She says, ""Poor communicators talk in paragraphs. Successful communicators talk in short sentences and highlight key points."""

**The Farmer**  
Matt Froggatt used to work as an insurance agent in London, but now he runs a sheep farm. He says, ""After 14 years in the business, I found that working in the City was no longer exciting. It became very tiring, and no one was enjoying their work. I didn’t plan to leave for another five or ten years, but then I lost my job unexpectedly. I didn’t get a great pay-off, but it was enough to start my farm. My big break came when I met the head chef of a well-known hotel restaurant. By supplying them with meat, my reputation grew, and now I also sell meat online. I’m happy to be out of the office, but surprisingly, my work hours are still long, about 80 to 90 hours a week, and I’m still selling a product.""

**The Painter**  
Ron Able was a manager in advertising, but now he makes a living as an artist. He explains, ""I started painting as a hobby, but I found it much more exciting than my job. It made sense to take redundancy and become an artist. A career counselor helped me a lot. I think I was the first person to tell him, 'I don’t want to go back to my old job.' He was surprised because most people in their mid-forties need to find work quickly for money. My wife and I married young, and our children are now independent, so we took a risk and moved to northern England, where we didn’t know anyone. We left our friends behind, but we’ve been lucky; many of them still visit us.""

**The Hat Maker**  
Katherine Goodison worked as a lawyer for five years before starting her own hat-making business in her London flat. She says, ""Being a lawyer was fun and paid well, but the hours were terrible. I didn’t want to become a senior partner and work even longer hours, so I decided to leave. Many people thought I would get bored, but that hasn’t happened. The key is to set deadlines. In the fashion business, there are always collections and new designs to work on, so I have to keep a strict schedule. I feel happier now and less stressed. However, I miss the social interaction with colleagues. What I love about this job is that I am fully responsible for my work. If I do a bad job, I am the one to blame. When you work for a company, you care, but when your name is on the product, you care even more.""

**The Masseur**  
Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16 years before becoming a masseur at the Life Centre in London. He shares, ""I was in financial markets from the age of 22, making deals. I enjoyed the excitement, but I never found the work fulfilling. I almost lost my job in 1989, but I decided to resign and travel for a year. During that time, I thought about what I wanted to do. I was interested in health, so I visited some of the best gyms and talked to their owners about how they started. I knew I needed qualifications to change careers, so I took various massage courses. Then, I got a part-time job at the Life Centre. I have no regrets. I used to feel out of control, but now I have peace of mind and control over my life, which is the best part."""
FCE_6,"**Dedicated to Their Sports**

Four young athletes share their experiences.

**A. Darius (Runner)**  
I have always loved sports. I tried many, but I was best at football and athletics. When I was 14, I tried out for a professional football team, but I chose to focus on athletics instead. My biggest achievement was competing for my country in the youth team and winning a medal. Unfortunately, it didn’t get much media attention, which was disappointing. I hoped to get some sponsorship because training can be expensive. I train at home all winter and then go to Florida for three weeks before the season starts. It’s fun there with great facilities and nightlife, but I have to be disciplined. If friends invite me out the night before training, I have to say no. I wish I could go, but dedication is important in this sport. My main goal is to compete in the next Olympics – that would be amazing.

**B. Gabriel (Surfer)**  
The surfing community is small, so I often see the same people at competitions. Professional surfers take it seriously, and the best waves are usually at dawn, so I have to skip late-night parties. I don’t mind too much, but I do enjoy sleeping in, which I often have to give up. However, it’s worth it because my dedication helped me win the National Championships last year. After a win, I always celebrate with a big night out, and if I win money, I treat myself to a nice trip. Winning the championship also led to me being chosen to present a surfing series on TV, so I guess I’m a bit of a celebrity now.

**C. Dieter (Yacht Racer)**  
When I’m on a boat with my teammates, we have a lot of fun. We are traditional and celebrate our wins in style. Some people say we act a bit childish, but we don’t seek media attention. Sometimes, reporters seem more interested in our celebrations than our race results. I spend eight months a year away, so it’s nice to come back and hang out with friends from different backgrounds. You can’t focus on the sport all the time; it’s not healthy. I’m known in sailing, but I rarely get recognized in public, which I prefer. I receive nice letters from fans asking for signed pictures, and I reply to each one, even if it takes time.

**D. Tomas (Tennis Player)**  
It feels great to walk onto the court and feel the crowd’s support. At my last tournament, things got a bit wild with fans crowding around. I enjoy being recognized by fans when I’m out shopping, but it has its downsides. My last girlfriend didn’t like it when I got too much attention from female fans. Tennis players travel a lot, and that’s part of why we broke up. It was tough, but sacrifices are necessary in sports; you have to be serious and professional. I’m focused on my game now and will catch up on other things in life after I retire, which happens early in this sport."
FCE_33,"**Young Shoppers**

Shopping in supermarkets with children can be very difficult for parents. One mother explains, ""They want everything they see. If it’s not the latest sugary cereal, it’s a Disney video or a comic. Usually, they want all three. I can’t afford all this, and if I give in to their requests, I feel guilty about buying unhealthy food. But I also feel bad for saying no all the time, and I get stressed before we even leave the house. I try to avoid taking them shopping, but then I worry that they are missing out on learning how to make their own choices. I just can’t win.""

Research shows that children ask for something to buy every two minutes when they go shopping. Over £150 million is spent each year on advertising aimed directly at children, mostly on television. This amount is likely to grow, and supermarkets are a key place where this advertising works well. Children often do not understand why their parents say they cannot buy certain things, and arguments about how bad sugar is for their teeth are not convincing when compared to the attractive ads they see.

Susan Dibb from the National Food Alliance says, ""Most parents care about what their children eat and have ideas about healthy food, but these ideas are not always correct. It is important for parents and children to talk about food. If children only hear about products from TV ads, they get a very one-sided view. Parents feel frustrated because they are competing with the advertising industry and often have to disappoint their children.""

The Independent Television Commission, which controls TV advertising, does not allow advertisers to tell children to ask their parents to buy products. However, Dibb points out, ""The main goal of advertising is to persuade people to buy something. So even if they can’t say, 'Tell your mom to buy this,' that is still the effect.""

Shopping with children can be stressful for parents because they have to decide which requests to agree to and which to refuse. One mother says she tries to be patient when discussing food with her children, but she still feels unhappy about how she handles their requests. ""My son pays attention to ads but is critical of them. We talk a lot about different products and look at labels together. I’ve talked about it so much that he thinks all ads are bad. Now, we have very little conflict in the supermarket because the children don’t ask for things I don’t want to buy.""

Parents also admit they are sometimes inconsistent in how they respond to their children’s requests. Mike, a father of a seven-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter, says, ""We refuse to buy sweets for him because they are bad for him, but we are loading our trolley with cream and chocolate for ourselves. It’s nice to buy good things, and it’s normal for children to want to share that. But I still get annoyed by their requests. It also depends on how I feel. If I’m in a good mood, I’m more likely to say yes. It’s hard to be consistent.""

Supermarkets could help reduce the conflict between parents and children by removing sweets from checkout areas or providing supervised play areas. Even if parents spend less when their children are not with them, the idea of shopping without their children’s demands might attract enough extra customers to make up for it."
FCE_20,"**Five-Star Luxury with Modern Technology**

The new five-star Merrion Hotel in Dublin has been created after a lot of research into what customers want and nearly two years of work to convert four large 18th-century houses. This approach has allowed the hotel to use the latest technology for the benefit of both staff and guests.

General Manager Peter MacCann expects his staff to know guests by name. However, he uses the hotel’s computer system to keep track of guests' preferences. This system helps the hotel provide special service to returning clients, which is important for a five-star hotel. Although the system cost £250,000 to install, MacCann believes it will save money in the long run. He appreciates its efficiency and the services it offers. For example, if a guest requests certain music CDs during their first stay, those same CDs will be ready for them on their next visit, thanks to the guest-history feature.

Many hotel guests often complain about room temperature. The Merrion Hotel has a high-tech system that allows guests to adjust the temperature themselves within three degrees of the normal 18°C. Additionally, the front desk can change the temperature in each room between 14°C and 25°C.

Business travelers will find the technology in their rooms especially useful. MacCann estimates that about 65% of the hotel’s business will come from this group. To meet their needs, the hotel has brought traditional business center services into the rooms. Each room has three phones, two phone lines, a fax machine that also works as a photocopier and printer, and video-conferencing facilities.

Technology changes quickly, so the hotel has prepared for future improvements by laying extra cables. They rent televisions instead of buying them, allowing for easy upgrades to newer models. DVD recorders can also be updated when needed. Despite all this modern equipment, MacCann emphasizes that they want guests to feel comfortable, not overwhelmed by technology. The 145 bedrooms are spacious, well-furnished, and welcoming.

The hotel also features a swimming pool, gym, six conference rooms, two bars, two restaurants, and a beautiful garden. As with all luxury hotels, the food must be excellent. Chef Patrick Guilbaud, who already had two Michelin stars for his Dublin restaurant, has moved his restaurant to the Merrion. This move has allowed him to design a new kitchen and improve the dining experience. The hotel benefits from having a popular restaurant without financial risks.

With the help of technology and a skilled staff, the Merrion Hotel is likely to be very successful."
FCE_40,"**Where I Get My Energy**

Emma Marsden asked six women who live life fully how they find their energy.

A. **Jeanette Kupfermann, Journalist and Author:** ""I get my energy from excitement and challenges. Learning something new gives me a lot of energy. I also feel energized by rhythm; right now, I'm learning flamenco dancing. Dance is expressive and uplifting. If I'm bored, I feel drained. Being effective, even in small ways, gives me energy.""

B. **Linda Kelsey, Magazine Editor:** ""I have a lot of work, but I enjoy it all. Work is not a burden for me. When you enjoy what you do, it doesn't make you feel low, even if you're tired. I need enough sleep to feel good. When I only get six hours, I feel a bit off. Exercise helps me feel energized, but I sometimes struggle to find the energy to do it. I attend a yoga class once a week and try to work out at home. After exercising, I feel much better. I often feel low in the afternoon, so I think it's good to have a snack then.""

C. **Annie Nightingale, Disc Jockey:** ""I don't eat healthily for energy; I think my natural enthusiasm and positivity help. I dislike negative people. I believe we should enjoy life and set goals. I love my job, and the last two years have been exciting. I work with many lively young people, which energizes me. I enjoy taking photos, even if I'm not great at it, and I like writing lyrics for fun. It helps me relax while traveling.""

D. **Floella Benjamin, Author and Children's TV Presenter:** ""My energy comes from doing things I enjoy. I believe in my work and being positive about life. I love working with kids because they are full of energy and resilience. Energy is like a natural chemical that comes from connecting with others. Just smile at someone and see how good it feels when they smile back. I try to eat healthily and don’t smoke or drink, but I don’t have a strict exercise plan. I get my energy from playing with kids.""

E. **Deborah Moggach, Author and Playwright:** ""What I love most is creating a garden from a wasteland. I once turned a concrete area into a beautiful garden. It was more energizing than any workout. Knowing that someone wants to read my writing also gives me energy. I enjoy sneaking into nature, and if I get caught, I play innocent. I like it because it feels playful.""

F. **Katherine Monblot, Therapist:** ""I believe you should have an interest in what you do. I like taking risks and get bored easily, which keeps me motivated. Doing things you don’t want to do can drain your energy. I used to be part of many committees, but I didn’t like the demands on my time. You have limited energy, so focus it on what matters most to you."""
FCE_45,"**ICE SKATING**

Ice skating has been around for thousands of years. Archaeologists have found skates made from animal bones, which were used until iron skates appeared in Scandinavia around 200 AD. For the wealthy people in Scandinavia, skating was an important skill. In the early 1900s, skating was seen as elegant, but everything changed at the 1924 Winter Olympics when 11-year-old Sonja Henie brought a more athletic style, making skating very popular.

Today, ice skating combines art and athleticism, making it both beautiful and physically challenging. For beginners, balance and control are very important, and you can only go faster as you get better. Your body position is key to maintaining balance. Keep your legs slightly bent and your knees relaxed, leaning a bit forward. Relaxation is crucial in skating, more than in many other sports.

To start skating, your heels should almost touch, and your feet should point outwards. Push forward with your back foot while making a small movement with the other foot. It sounds easy, right? If you practice this for a while, you can gradually make bigger movements as you gain experience.

Learning how to fall is one of the first skills a skater should master. Even professional skaters fall sometimes. To fall safely, try to stay relaxed, which helps reduce the impact when you hit the ice. To get up, use your hands to kneel first, then stand up.

Once you feel confident on the ice, you can try different styles like figure skating, freestyle, distance skating, speed skating, and pair skating. The best way to start is by learning figure skating and then basic freestyle. Most ice rinks offer guidance, so you can quickly learn the basic moves, and soon you will be able to do turns, jumps, and spins in freestyle.

If you watch skilled skaters, you will notice how relaxed and smooth their movements are. To achieve this, it’s important to follow a regular exercise program. Skating with a stiff body can be dangerous, so warm-up exercises should focus on your legs, back, shoulders, and especially your ankles and knees. After skating, do the same exercises to prevent stiffness.

Skating helps improve balance, coordination, relaxation, and movement. It also boosts heart and lung health and strengthens your body. When combined with swimming or jogging, it creates a great fitness program for overall health."

Seeing a talented child win a medal can bring tears of joy. Julia Gregson spoke to three young stars and their mothers about the joys and challenges in their lives.

A. **Annika Reeder**, 15, won a gold medal in gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games. She wants to be a physiotherapist and compete in the next Olympics. ""Right now, the training is very hard. I don’t have time to watch TV, go out with friends, or do much besides gymnastics and school. I take it one day at a time. When I feel really tired, my coach sometimes gives me a day off, but usually, I keep going. You can’t take too many days off because it makes your body stiff.""

B. **Annika's mother** says, ""From a young age, Annika showed great talent. I’ve seen some parents push their kids, but that doesn’t work. To perform at Annika’s level takes a lot of time and energy, so you have to want it yourself. People often say we, as parents, have sacrificed a lot, but they don’t see what the sport has given us. We love it and what it has done for Annika. Before gymnastics, she was a shy girl who hid behind me, but now she has met people from all over the world and gained confidence.""

C. **Sarah Stokes** started show-jumping at age 10 and has won the British National Championship. ""It’s great that my parents love show-jumping because they train me and take me everywhere in the horse box. The shows can last from one to five days. I never get tired of it; I love the excitement and fun. Even if my parents weren’t involved, I would still do it because I am determined. I’m happy when they are proud of my wins, but I do it for myself. This year, I want to qualify for the British young riders (under-18) team, and my big dream is to win a gold medal at the Olympics.""

D. **Sarah's mother** says, ""From the moment Sarah sat on a horse at age 1, we knew she had a passion. When she was 5, she would wake up early to exercise her pony. To qualify for big shows, we travel all over England. To save money, we sleep in the living area of our horse box. Sarah is very organized and feels completely happy on a horse. Watching your child succeed at something they love is an amazing feeling.""

E. **Jane McShane**, 10, is the Under-14 Chess Champion in Britain. ""Tournaments are really friendly. I know everyone, and it’s fun. When I play, I don’t focus as much as I should; I just look around and don’t think too much. I’m not worried about becoming arrogant, and I don’t talk about my success at school because I don’t like to feel embarrassed.""

F. **Jane's mother** shares, ""Jane played her first game at age 5. My father suggested we see if she liked it. He had tried to teach me when I was young, but I found it boring. Jane loved it from the start. By the end of that day, she had memorized all the moves, and by age 6, she was beating adults. I’m proud when she wins, but if she wanted to stop playing tomorrow, I wouldn’t stop her. I also don’t want to hold her back because she is so talented. If she has this gift, I want her to reach her full potential."""
FCE_29,"Text: 

It's true - we are all getting taller. Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy. The teacher jokingly asked, ""What do you want to be? The flagpole on a ship?"" This was funny because Chris was already almost two meters tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is the tallest man in Britain. 

Every decade, the average height of people in Europe increases by about one centimeter. More tall people are being born, but this does not mean we are becoming a super race. Instead, we are returning to how our ancestors looked. According to Professor Chris Stringer, a palaeontologist, we are becoming like Cro-Magnons, the people who lived 40,000 years ago.

For most of human history, our ancestors had a varied diet. Women gathered fruits and herbs, while men hunted animals. One study showed they ate from 85 different wild plants. However, about 9,000 years ago, agriculture started, which changed everything. Farmers took over many natural areas, and now just three plants - wheat, rice, and maize - provide more than half of the calories we eat today. This limited diet has harmed our health. 

In a study in Ohio, scientists found that when healthy hunter-gatherers started farming corn, they became sick and underweight. Tooth decay and diseases increased. Although corn was thought to be a good food, it actually caused health problems. Farming spread because one piece of land could feed many more people than hunting could. 

Today, many people who rely on farming are still poorly nourished. Only in Europe, the US, and Japan are diets starting to reflect the variety of our ancestors' diets again. As a result, the average height of men is now 179 cm in the US, 180 cm in Holland, and 177 cm in Japan. This is a positive change, but it also brings challenges. 

Even though people are getting taller, the standard bed length has stayed at 190 cm since 1860. Legroom in planes and trains seems to be getting smaller, and clothing companies have to change their sizes often. The question is: how tall can we get? 

Some scientists believe we might reach a height of 193 cm this century. However, there is a twist. While individuals may be growing taller due to better nutrition, as a species, we are actually getting smaller. During the last ice age, 10,000 years ago, humans were rounder and taller to keep warm. Now that the climate is warmer, we seem to be getting thinner and shorter, even with good food. As the planet continues to warm, we might shrink even more. So, the growth of humans could be affected by global warming."
FCE_57,"**Studio Audiences**

What is it like to be in the audience when a television show is being made? Cosmo Landesman explored this topic. Studio audiences are a common part of television, but many people find them mysterious. When we watch game shows, we often wonder who these audience members are.

Some people think that studio audiences are not very important. I have heard that even those who work in television look down on them, comparing them to cattle. I used to think that studio audiences were made up of silly people wanting a moment of fame. However, there is no typical studio audience. They come from different backgrounds, jobs, and income levels. Television shows try to attract various types of people for different programs.

Many of us who watch television at home wonder why anyone would want to be in a studio audience. Why would someone apply for tickets, travel far, and sit through hours of waiting just to see a show live? One reason is that people hope to be seen on television. I didn’t believe this until I spoke to Angela, who said she came for a chance to appear on TV. Another reason is curiosity about what happens behind the scenes. But the most common reason I heard was, ""A friend gave me a ticket.""

Most of us have never been in a studio audience, but we think we know what it is like. You sit close to strangers while someone holds up signs that say APPLAUD or LAUGH, and you respond accordingly. This might be true for some shows, but not all. As one studio manager said, ""We believe a good show doesn’t need these signs.""

Is there a real difference between being in a studio and watching at home? For Claire, being in a studio is ""more exciting,"" while Charlotte enjoyed feeling part of the live show. She said, ""Last year I saw my favorite comedian. When you watch him at home, you miss a lot."" I found that I missed seeing the live actors because I could only see the back of someone’s head. The opening scenes were filmed far from my seat, so I ended up watching the show on a monitor.

Going to a studio might not be the best way to watch television, but that’s not what matters. For most audience members, it was simply fun and a free night of entertainment."

**Bruce**  
I don’t like wild landscapes that are untouched by people. I find the human element important. When I travel, I prefer charming villages with old temples rather than empty deserts. When I was eight, I went to school in England, and on Saturdays, I would ride my bike to the village of Lastingham in its beautiful valley. Cycling was a way to escape from school. I enjoyed exploring the bare hilltops, sheltered valleys, and old villages. Coming from Scotland, I found the landscape both familiar and different, and I still visit there today. I used to write about my adventures in my private diary, which was my first attempt at travel writing, a field in which I later became well-known.

**Sophia**  
There is a small railway that runs from Hythe to Dungeness, operated by volunteers. I always choose first class because it doesn’t cost much more than the regular ticket. The scenery isn’t amazing. The train travels across Romney Marsh with its sheep and next to a canal. However, there is one part of the journey I always look forward to - when the train goes through back gardens. For a few moments, we passengers get a glimpse into people’s lives as they make tea, wash dishes, or set up deck chairs. I see myself in their eyes, a woman in a tiny train carriage looking into other homes. I like the ordinary landscape of fields, sheep, and a distant grey sea. It makes me look more closely and search for something that opens my eyes.

**Matthew**  
The Hartland Peninsula is a beautiful and remote coast. The beaches are hard to reach and filled with rocks, so there are not many people here. A few brave surfers come, but most visitors prefer to enjoy the beauty of the sea. This coast, facing the Atlantic, is known for shipwrecks. There are walking paths along the coast that you can combine with trips into lovely damp valleys filled with oak trees, ferns, and wildflowers. We stay in simple self-catering accommodation with a family who owns property in the village of Southole.

**Annette**  
My favorite place in England is the Trough of Bowland, a wide-open moorland that is perfect for hiking. There are not many people living there, and not many visitors either. It’s a quiet and remote area, and I love the feeling of space. I found this place by chance when I was a student, and since then, I visit every year, either alone, with my boyfriend, or now with my son. It has changed very little since my first visit. Having a child makes these visits even more special. It makes me sad that he is growing up in a city.

**James**  
I bought Glenthorne, my favorite house in Britain. It was about finding peace and reconnecting with my English roots. I grew up in what is now Sri Lanka, but when I was twelve, I went to school in Devon, in the west of England. I used to ride my bike around the moors and village streets. There was a story about a place we would never cycle past: if you went down the driveway, you would never return. That place was Glenthorne. It is my dream place, a magical, secluded, and romantic house. You can only hear the sea, wind, and birds."
FCE_42,"**HAPPY HUNTING GROUND**

We are a family that loves animals. One afternoon, my daughter called me at work to tell me she had found a beautiful pine snake. She asked, ""Can we keep him?"" I replied, ""Yes, but only for one night."" We had a special tank ready for animals like this, so we could admire it and look it up in our natural history book.

I got home late and quickly started boiling some water when I heard my sons screaming, ""Oh, Mother! Help! Do something!"" I rushed to their bedroom. The problem was with Domino, our cat, and Bianca, the white mouse I had received as a Mother's Day gift. Domino was running around with the mouse in his mouth, trying to escape while avoiding the kids who were waving their arms.

In the chaos, I tripped and fell. As I thought about how to stop Domino, I noticed the snake. It had escaped and was slithering off the table and onto the floor. I crouched down as the snake moved closer, while the kids and the cat were jumping around in a loud, chaotic scene. The dog was barking, and the pot in the kitchen boiled over. I quickly turned off the gas and returned to the chaos with renewed energy. 

I managed to grab Domino by the tail and pulled the small, wet mouse from his mouth. Surprisingly, the mouse survived this encounter, even though Domino caught it three more times in its life before it eventually died of old age.

Feeling encouraged, I looked at the snake to find a way to catch it, but it seemed impossible. I sat on the floor, trying to calm the snake down. Slowly, it relaxed and rested its head on its body, but it still looked suspicious. I carefully placed my hands under the snake and stood up, then walked to the end of the garden. I wanted to give the snake a chance to live freely, so I pointed it towards a nearby tree.

When I finally let go of the snake's head, I expected it to attack me, but instead, it slid over my shoulders like a colorful shawl, making itself comfortable. We stood there in the fading light, with my four children, me, and the snake. My oldest son, DJ, broke the silence and said, ""You know what, Mum? You're nice and warm, and the shed isn't.""

I asked the kids to help encourage the snake to move on. Slowly, it did, climbing up the wall and disappearing over the roof. As the last bit of its tail vanished, my three-year-old son Clay sighed and said what we were all thinking: ""Boy, that was one big snake!"""
FCE_59,"**Drop Me a Line!**

In our fast world of phones, fax machines, and computers, the old art of letter writing is at risk of disappearing. However, I believe that receiving a letter is special and cannot be replaced by any other way of communicating. There is excitement when a letter arrives, joy in seeing who it is from, and pleasure in reading its contents.

Letter writing has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. It probably started with the little notes I wrote to my mother. She always made sure I wrote my own thank-you letters for Christmas and birthday gifts. It didn’t matter if they were short or messy, as long as they were letters.

When I left home at 18 to study medicine in London, I wrote to my parents every week, and they wrote back. Sometimes my father would write long, funny letters, which I loved. Most of the letters from home shared everyday news about my parents and their friends. We also made phone calls, but I remember the letters the most.

I also received letters from my boyfriends. Many of them had to work or study far away, so we kept in touch through letters. Instead of hurting our relationships, writing letters seemed to make them stronger. I found it easier to express my feelings in writing than in conversation.

I enjoy the letters that come with birthday or Christmas cards. Short notes are nice, but it’s even better to get a whole year’s worth of news! I especially love receiving letters in airmail envelopes with beautiful stamps. I get letters from friends in different countries, like Mangala in Sri Lanka, a penfriend in Australia, and another in Vancouver. There’s also a lady from France who writes to me. We started talking in a restaurant after a holiday, and I asked for her address. If she hadn’t replied, we would have missed out on a great friendship. Now, we write to each other regularly, which helps me improve my French since she doesn’t speak English. We have visited each other’s homes twice.

My biggest success in letter writing happened this summer when my family and I visited my American penfriend in Texas. We had been writing to each other for 29 years but had never met. Everyone was surprised that our friendship lasted so long, and the local newspaper even wrote about it on the front page.

I am happy that my children are continuing this tradition. Like my mother, I make sure they write their own thank-you letters. My daughter writes me little letters, just as I did to my mother. She and my son also have penfriends in Texas, organized by my penfriend. I strongly encourage everyone not to let letter writing become a lost art."
FCE_54,"**Careless Tourists Damage Ancient Rock Art**

Many ancient pictures carved into the rocks at one of France's most important tourist sites are being slowly destroyed. Scientists are worried that the 36,000 drawings on rocks in Mont Bego in the French Alps are being damaged so quickly that they may not survive for future generations. The mountain is believed to have been a place for prayer and worship, and it has drawings that are 4,000 years old. These include images of cows, fields, and various gods and goddesses. However, as more people visit the site, the pictures are being ruined by careless graffiti.

Jean Clottes, the chairman of the International Committee on Rock Art, says, ""People think that because the pictures have been there for so long, they will always be there. But if the damage continues at this rate, there will be nothing left in 50 years."" He has seen tourists stepping on the drawings, which wears away the rock and damages the artwork. Some visitors even take pieces of the rock as souvenirs. ""When people can't take a good photograph, they rub the drawings to make them clearer,"" he explains. ""The drawings are already polished by the weather, and if the sun is shining and they can't see them well, they rub and scrape them to make them look fresher.""

Other researchers have noticed that some people come with long sticks to scratch their own drawings or names into the rocks. Experts disagree on the best way to protect the drawings. Henry de Lumley, director of the Museum of Natural History in Paris, believes the only way to save the site is to make the whole mountain a ""no-go"" area, allowing the public to visit only on guided tours. He warns that if this is not done, the site will be completely destroyed, and important research will be lost.

Clottes disagrees with de Lumley's strict plan. He says, ""While it is the most effective, it will also cause protests from local people."" The site was declared a historic monument years ago by the Ministry of Culture, and we must do everything we can to protect it. David Lavergne, a regional architect, also wants to keep the site open. He believes that while it is difficult to prevent damage, it is important for people to see it. However, he mentions that there is not enough money to hire enough guards to protect the area, and they may need to consider charging a fee for visitors.

In Nice, Annie Echassoux, who has also researched the site, is worried that as the mountain becomes easier to reach—since tourists can now avoid a long walk by hiring vehicles—the damage will increase quickly. She believes the best solution is to close off parts of the area and provide guides. ""We can't say the plan can't go ahead because there is no money,"" she says. ""That is not good enough. Money must be provided because the Ministry of Culture has classified this area as a historic site. If we don't take action, we will be responsible for losing these drawings for future generations."""

Parents also admit they are sometimes inconsistent in how they respond to their children’s requests. Mike, a father of a seven-year-old son and a three-year-old daughter, says, ""We refuse to buy sweets for him because we say they are bad for him, but we fill our trolley with cream and chocolate for ourselves. It’s nice to buy good things, and it’s normal for children to want to share that. But I still get annoyed by their requests. It depends on my mood. If I’m feeling good, I’m more likely to say yes. It’s hard to be consistent.""

Supermarkets could help reduce conflicts between parents and children by removing sweets from checkout areas or providing supervised play areas. Even if parents spend less when their children are not with them, the idea of shopping without their children’s demands could attract more customers, making up for any loss in sales."
FCE_65,"**Going Up the Wall**

In the past, climbers went to the mountains to climb. Now, people can enjoy climbing in many places, both indoors and outdoors. The audience watches closely as the French climber Francois Lombard hangs upside down by just two fingers on a climbing wall. He is competing in the World Cup Climbing Championships at the National Indoor Arena in Birmingham. This arena is better known for the TV show Gladiators, but both events have one thing in common: The Wall. The ability to hold these events is thanks to new and quickly advancing technology.

Before the mid-1960s, climbers practiced on natural cliffs where there were good climbing spots. In winter, they had to deal with cold weather, go for walks, or climb on snow and ice in Scotland. As climbing became more popular, it was important for top climbers to stay fit. Since they could not use cliffs for much of the year, they started to train on brick edges or stone buildings. This helped them keep their fingers strong and avoid getting bored.

Soon, many sports centers began to build climbing walls specifically for training. These walls used bricks with special edges for climbers to hold on to. One of the first climbing walls was built by Don Robinson, a physical education teacher, in a corridor at Leeds University in the mid-1960s. He created a wall with natural rock set in concrete.

Throughout the 1970s, many climbing walls like this were built in sports halls, but they had some problems. These walls were only vertical, while real cliffs have features like overhangs and slanted rocks. Once a wall was built, it could not be changed, and climbers would eventually get bored with the same routes.

In 1985, a Frenchman named Francois Savigny invented a new material that could be shaped like the rocks found on cliffs. These shapes could be attached to any wall and removed when climbers wanted a change. French manufacturers also started to create climbing panels on steel frames. Unlike heavy concrete, steel frames could be built anywhere as free-standing structures. This system allowed climbers to have many different holds to choose from, giving them endless options for climbing."
FCE_61,"**So You Want to Be an Actor**

If you tell someone you want to be an actor, they will probably mention that it is a ""risky"" career. Acting is indeed risky because there are many more actors than there are acting jobs. When you decide to become an actor, some people you thought were your friends might think you are making a bad choice, while others may support you. Everyone will give you different advice, but this is a personal decision, and you are the one responsible for your choices and dreams.

There are no easy paths to becoming an actor. There are no exams to pass, and even after training, there is no guarantee you will succeed in the profession. Success often depends on a mix of luck and talent. However, there is always a need for new actors, and acting can bring excitement, glamour, and sometimes good rewards.

Many people ask what talent is. I think talent is a combination of natural skill and imagination, with imagination being the hardest to measure. It also involves courage and belief in what you are doing. 

The desire to act can be hard to explain. In theater, the important moment is the connection between the actor and the audience. This connection is what motivates actors to perform. When you ask successful actors how they achieved their success, they often don’t have a clear answer. They know some things about their skills and techniques, but they also understand that their success can change quickly. 

Disappointment is a big challenge for actors. One month you might be out of work, doing other jobs, and the next month you could be asked to audition for a role. Even if you really want the job, you might not get it. Because of this, actors often avoid discussing their chances of getting a role. They find ways to cope with the stress of competition and the fear of rejection, which is something no one enjoys. 

From the moment you start auditioning, you are saying you are available and hopeful that you have the talent for the job. Ultimately, it is up to you; if you don’t care enough about your acting career, others may not care about you either."

FCE_28,"Text: 

It's true - we are all getting taller. Chris Greener was fourteen when he told his careers teacher he wanted to join the navy. The teacher jokingly asked, ""What do you want to be? The flagpole on a ship?"" This was funny because Chris was already almost two meters tall. Today, at 228 cm, he is the tallest man in Britain. 

Every decade, the average height of people in Europe increases by about one centimeter. More tall people are being born, but this does not mean we are becoming a super race. Instead, we are returning to how our ancestors looked. According to Professor Chris Stringer, a palaeontologist, we are becoming like Cro-Magnons, the people who lived 40,000 years ago.

For most of human history, our ancestors had a varied diet. Women gathered fruits and herbs, while men hunted animals. One study found they ate from 85 different wild plants. However, about 9,000 years ago, agriculture started, which changed everything. Farmers took over many natural areas, and now just three plants—wheat, rice, and maize—provide more than half of the calories we eat. This limited diet has harmed our health. 

In a study in Ohio, scientists found that when healthy hunter-gatherers began farming corn, they became sick and underweight. Tooth decay and diseases increased. Although corn was thought to be a good food, it actually caused health problems. Farming spread because one piece of land could feed many more people than hunting could. 

Today, many people who rely on farming are still poorly nourished. Only in Europe, the US, and Japan are diets starting to reflect the variety of our ancestors' diets again. As a result, the average height of men is now 179 cm in the US, 180 cm in Holland, and 177 cm in Japan. This is a positive change, but it also brings challenges. 

Even though people are getting taller, standard bed lengths have not changed since 1860, remaining at 190 cm. Legroom in planes and trains seems to be getting smaller, and clothing companies have to adjust their sizes. The question is: how tall can we get? 

According to Robert Fogel from the University, we might reach a height of 193 cm this century. However, scientists warn that while individuals may be growing taller due to better nutrition, as a species, we are actually getting smaller. During the last ice age, humans were slightly rounder and taller to keep warm. Now that the climate is warmer, we seem to be getting thinner and shorter, even with good food. As the planet continues to warm, we might shrink even more. In other words, our growth could be affected by global warming."

**The Farmer**  
Matt Froggatt used to work as an insurance agent in London, but now he runs a sheep farm. He says, ""After 14 years in the City, it became boring and no one was enjoying their work anymore. I didn’t plan to leave for another five or ten years, but then I lost my job unexpectedly. I didn’t get a great pay-off, but it was enough to start the farm. My big break came when I met the head chef of a well-known hotel restaurant. By supplying them, my reputation grew, and now I also sell meat online. I’m happy to be out of the office, but surprisingly, not much has changed for me: I still work 80 to 90 hours a week and sell a product.""

**The Painter**  
Ron Able was a manager in advertising, but now he makes a living as an artist. He explains, ""I started painting as a hobby, but I found it much more exciting than my job. It made sense to take redundancy and become an artist. The career counselor I spoke to was very supportive. I think I was the first person to tell him, 'I don’t want to go back to my old job.' He was surprised because most people in their mid-forties need to find work quickly for money. My wife and I married young, and our children are grown, so we took a risk and moved to northern England, where we didn’t know anyone. We left our friends behind, but we’ve been lucky; many of them still visit us.""

**The Hat Maker**  
Katherine Goodison worked as a lawyer for five years before starting her own hat-making business in her London flat. She says, ""Being a lawyer was fun and paid well, but the hours were terrible. I didn’t want to become a senior partner and work even more, so I left. Many people thought I would get bored, but that hasn’t happened. The key is to set deadlines. In fashion, there are always collections and new designs to work on, so I keep a strict schedule. I feel happier now and less stressed. However, I miss the social interaction with colleagues. What I love about this job is that I am fully responsible for my work. If I do a bad job, I am the one to blame. When you work for a company, you care, but when your name is on the product, you care even more.""

**The Masseur**  
Paul Drinkwater worked in finance for 16 years before becoming a masseur at the Life Centre in London. He shares, ""I was in finance from the age of 22, making deals. I enjoyed the excitement, but I didn’t find the work fulfilling. I almost lost my job in 1989, but I decided to resign and travel for a year. During that time, I thought about what I wanted to do. I was interested in health, so I visited top gyms and spoke to the owners about how they started. I knew I needed qualifications to change careers, so I took massage courses. Then, I got a part-time job at the Life Centre. I have no regrets. I used to feel out of control, but now I have peace of mind and control over my life, which is the best part."""
FCE_5,"**A Winning Game**

Two brothers have found that their childhood game is great for business. Dave and Norm Lagasse, who are in their forties, are sitting in their simple home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA, and enjoying their childhood memories. In front of them is a wooden board with round plastic pieces. They are playing pichenotte, an ancient game that they believe is unique. Their grandfather, Lucien Rajotte, who was a grocer from Quebec, Canada, brought the game to the USA and taught it to his family. Soon, every weekend and holiday, the family would play together and have a wonderful time. 

Later, the family moved to New Mexico, but they did not forget their grandfather's pichenotte board, which he made from old wooden crates. They continued to play regularly. When visitors came over, they were often curious because the game was unknown in the southern USA. 

Three years ago, Dave noticed that their old pichenotte board was cracked and worn out, so he decided to make a new one. The new board was beautiful, and soon a relative wanted one, followed by a friend. To see how much interest there was, the brothers took one of Dave's new boards to a sports bar in Santa Fe. Dave said, ""People started to watch and say, 'No way I'm playing that silly game.' But then they would sit down, and soon they couldn't get up from the table!"" 

When people asked about the game's origins, Dave did some research. He found that the game likely started in India, where a similar game called 'carroms' is played. This game was adapted into 'squails' in British pubs, and British immigrants brought it to Canada. The French-Canadian version is called pichenotte, which can be played by two to four people. 

Pichenotte is a game of skill. Each player has 12 pieces, or 'pucks', which they flick across a wheel-like board using their fingers. Getting a puck into a small hole is worth 20 points, while three rings around the hole are worth 15, 10, and 5 points. There are also eight small posts that act as obstacles. The game usually lasts about two minutes. 

After seeing how popular the game was at the bar, the Lagasse brothers made more boards and took them to markets and craft fairs. Crowds gathered, money was exchanged, and the game's popularity grew. Soon, championships were held, and a trophy called the 'Lord Pichenotte Cup' was created. As word spread, the boards sold quickly, and the brothers decided to start a pichenotte business full-time. 

They set up a workshop in their garage and have made over 450 boards so far. Each board is made of birchwood and mahogany, weighs 12 kg, and is 1 cm thick. Norm explains, ""They're very durable because they need to handle a lot of use."" The boards are sold for $595 each on the brothers' website. 

Currently, there are no professional pichenotte players or TV shows about the game. However, the brothers hope that one day their garage will be home to a luxury car instead of tools and wood. Until then, they are happy to spend their free time playing the game that they hope will bring them success."
FCE_41,"**WELCOME TO THE MODEL VILLAGE**

When you first enter the Model Village, it is hard to believe that just a few years ago, this area was a messy piece of land, covered in brambles. For a long time, it was seen as useless land. However, with careful planning and hard work from one man, supported by his wife, this land has been transformed into the beautiful place you see today.

During the construction of the village, many thousands of tons of soil and clay were moved to change the flat land into the shaped landscape you see now. Although machines like bulldozers helped, a lot of hard work was also done by hand. Once the land was shaped, about 1,000 tons of topsoil were added to create lawns, flower beds, and rock gardens. 

In building the Model Village, hundreds of trees and shrubs were planted. These plants were carefully chosen to survive in the salty air near the sea and to withstand strong winter winds. Most plants came from local garden centers, but some were brought from as far away as Canada and New Zealand.

The whole idea for the village came from Colin Sims, who made over 100 models by hand over nine years after the village opened in 1972. The models are made from different materials like stone, concrete, treated wood, and plastics to resist all kinds of weather. At first, Colin needed help from experts to learn how to choose materials that would last. Soon, he became an expert himself.

You will notice that all the models are built to the same scale and that great care has been taken with even the smallest details. This was achieved through patience and special building techniques. The Model Village has become a popular attraction, known for its high-quality work and maintenance. The methods used to create these realistic models have been used in other model villages in England and have even been included in some college courses on modeling.

All the buildings in the village show traditional British architectural styles and are not based on any one specific place. One of the most impressive buildings is the Manor House, a typical 13th-century stone building with a brick tower and stone walls, inspired by manor houses found in the West Country. As you walk around the village, you will also see a Castle, St Mary's Church, a zoo, and a mini golf course, which is the newest addition.

We ask you to stay on the paths during your visit and not to touch any of the models, as any damage can take a long time to repair. You can take photos from the pathways only. Dogs are welcome on a short lead.

To make your visit more enjoyable, you will find buttons in front of some models. Press these buttons to see the models move. At the end of your visit, we would love to hear your comments. We are always planning new models, and your ideas can help us create a more interesting display. We also want to know if any models did not meet your expectations, as we are always updating and replacing them.

We hope you enjoy your visit and look forward to seeing you again. Please tell your friends about us!"
FCE_69,"Every week, British tabloid newspapers publish pictures that invade people's privacy and break the rules set by newspaper editors. While some pop stars do pose for paparazzi sometimes, this is not common. More often, serious harm is done to public figures when their private moments are shown on the front page. However, very few people report these issues to the Press Complaints Commission (PCC), which was created to handle such problems. These pictures rarely serve the public interest. For example, how do private photos of pop stars help solve a crime? How did a picture of a famous actress on a hotel balcony protect public health and safety? The actress has complained about long-lens photos before, and since she was in a hotel—a place where people expect privacy—she had a good reason to complain, but she did not take any action. It is a scandal that the PCC did not start an investigation on its own. 

The PCC should also look into a recent shocking story about a pop star's love life. Like the actress, the pop star has not made a formal complaint. Shouldn't the PCC take action against these shameful attacks? This seems like a good idea because it could lead to many decisions against newspapers. These decisions would be reported by other media, and the public would not support such behavior. Editors would have to stop publishing this kind of material, and photographers would find it hard to make a living by hiding to take pictures of celebrities.

If the PCC decided to act like a ""police officer,"" there would be several challenges. How would it decide whether to start an investigation? Should it contact the victim and encourage them to complain? If the person still refused to act, should the PCC proceed anyway? Celebrities and royals might expect the PCC to take up their stories and be upset if it does not. The role of the PCC is too big. How could it realistically monitor all of the British press, including national and regional newspapers and magazines? 

There is also the issue of embarrassment. Even if someone's privacy is invaded, would they want the added embarrassment of an investigation? Most people probably just want to move on with their lives. Some might have other reasons for staying quiet, like hiding a worse story from the press that could come out if they complain. In this way, the PCC could become an enemy.

One British comedian faced problems with the press when he and his wife were secretly photographed on their honeymoon in the Caribbean. He did not complain then, nor did he complain later when a photographer took pictures of him and his family during a holiday. He was afraid that the newspaper, News of the World, would publish the pictures again with a new story about his anger, claiming they thought it was just a joke and that he would find it funny because he is a comedian. This fear is understandable. People believe they will become targets again if they challenge the tabloids. It is difficult to find an easy solution to this serious problem."
FCE_38,"Many college graduates receive advice about starting their first job. This article focuses on what to consider when moving to a second job. We are not talking about those who are looking for a temporary job while searching for a permanent one, or those who leave a job they don’t like within a few weeks. Instead, we will discuss how to choose a second job that fits your career goals after you have gained some experience and skills.

What kind of job should you look for? It depends on your long-term goals. Think about whether you want to specialize in a certain area, aim for higher positions, or explore a wider field. Whatever you choose, it is important to select your second job carefully, as you should plan to stay in it for two to three years. Future employers will look closely at this job when you apply for your next position. It should show that you are serious about your career and that it helps you grow and take on more responsibilities.

If you feel the urge to travel, this might be a good time to do so. You can work temporarily while you travel and then return to find your second job later. Employers will appreciate that you have satisfied your desire to travel and are ready to settle down.

Now, Juliette works as a Personal Assistant to Brenda Cleverdon, the Chief Executive of Business in the Community. She says, ""In two and a half years, I have become more skilled, and my job has really developed."" From the start, her boss wanted to help her grow.

FCE_17,"**Confident People: What’s Their Secret?**

Confident people may seem like they were born that way, but many say it is a skill they learned over time. Nina Hathway talks to five people about how they became confident.

**A. Jenny**  
When I finished school, I was very shy and thought I would always be that way. At twenty-five, I helped at my daughter’s school. I was nervous but did well, and someone suggested I take a university course. On my first day, I was very anxious, but my confidence grew over time. Working at the school changed my life and helped me become more outgoing.

**B. Michaela**  
My journey began four years ago when my father got sick, and I had to run the family business. I was scared and became too aggressive at first. I learned that to be confident, you need to believe in yourself. If work gets too hard, I don’t feel guilty about leaving some tasks for the next day. When facing challenges, I remind myself that I have nothing to lose. Fear can make you feel unconfident, so I talk to myself to calm those fears.

**C. Lisa**  
People see me as confident, but I often feel scared inside. I learned to appear confident because it is important in my job in TV. Interviewing people showed me that many of us feel nervous in important situations. My mother once told me that everyone is too busy worrying about themselves to notice me. I remember this advice often. I also believe that facing your fears helps build confidence. I was very nervous during my driving test, but after passing, I felt I could handle anything.

**D. Barbara**  
I feel confident because I enjoy my work, and I have built this confidence over the years. If you keep working and learn from mistakes, you will feel more confident next time. I work hard and am liked at my restaurant, but not everyone will like you, and that’s okay. You need to accept yourself and not try to be what others want. My company offers training courses, which have helped me feel better about myself. Setting small goals is also helpful because it shows you are making progress.

**E. Kim**  
After college, I worked as a secretary and often sat in meetings without sharing my thoughts because I was too scared. Eventually, I found the courage to speak up. When I started working in politics, I had never spoken in public and was very nervous. I told myself that many people do this every day, so I could too. Writing down my thoughts helped me feel more prepared. I believe everyone feels a bit nervous when speaking in public. The key to confidence is to keep telling yourself, “Nothing is impossible.”"
FCE_47,"**Visit to Malaysia**

Paul Forster attends a kite-flying festival and spends a nervous night in the forest. Adnan Ali smiled widely when I gave him his torn kite. ""You have to keep it,"" he said. ""It's traditional - if the line breaks, the finder keeps it... and I have many more."" He pointed to a pile of beautifully decorated kites at his feet. All the kites were exactly 120 cm wide and long, made of tissue paper and split bamboo. We sat in the shade of the tall trees behind the Beach of the Seven Lagoons in Kelantan, looking at Malaysia's biggest kite festival.

In the center of the beach, there were 10 platforms where helpers held up the kites. A line of nervous competitors held the strings of their kites, waiting for the countdown. When the whistle blew, the crowd cheered, and the kites flew into the sky like rockets. More than 500 men and boys had signed up for the competition, which lasts for five days every year. Each participant entered four different kite designs, which were judged on decoration, stability in the air, and flying ability. 

""Flying kites isn't very hard,"" Adnan said, ""but making them takes real skill. Come visit me at home, and I'll show you how to make one."" This was one of five invitations I received that day, and I decided to accept. At his house, I drank cold milky tea and ate fish crackers in a large, shiny room. As night fell, he asked me to come back the next day to start rebuilding his kite, but I couldn't. Instead, I explored the southern part of the state, driving towards Kuala Lumpur, through beautiful mountains covered in lush rainforest.

I took a wrong turn, and the smooth road suddenly ended at a river. A small boat was waiting to take people across. Nearby, I saw a sign that pointed up a path into the forest, saying: ""Jelawang Jungle 3 km."" Before I started, it would have been good to know that most of the path was steep and slippery. When I reached the campsite, I found a man named Baba waiting with a flask of tea. He managed a kitchen and a few bamboo huts. I decided to stay there, trying not to think about the insects crawling under my thin mattress. 

At night, it was completely dark, filled with different sounds. A waterfall roared nearby, and many creatures moved and made noise. In the morning, I enjoyed a stunning view of five ranges of green mountains. In the afternoon, it rained. First, the wind blew, then lightning struck the treetops. Moments later, I was soaked. As I slid down the hill, I wondered how the giant butterflies avoided the heavy rain. I also worried about my car getting washed away (which sometimes happens) and the chance of drowning if I opened my mouth. Luckily, my car was still there at the bottom of the hill, covered in mud.

In Kota Bahru, the capital of Kelantan, everyone asked me questions: ""Where are you from?"" ""How old are you?"" But their questions were friendly. While Kelantan is famous for its kites, I will always remember it for the kindness of its people."

D. Anita, 35, TV producer: ""I like to look around sometimes, but I usually know what I want and where to find it. I don’t waste time and try to shop quickly. However, I do have some clothes in my wardrobe that I regret buying, so maybe I’m a careful shopper who makes mistakes.""

E. Lizzie, 41, secretary: ""I really dislike shopping. I can never find what I want or get help. The shops are too noisy and messy, which makes it a nightmare for me. Luckily, I don’t have to shop for clothes often because I get most of my clothes as gifts. For food, I go to the supermarket once a week and do it quickly.""

F. Lisa, 22, actress: ""I’m probably a happy shopper. Sometimes I go shopping with my friends, and we often end up buying things. I don’t usually have something specific in mind, but if I see something I like, I buy it.""

G. Suki, 26, art gallery assistant: ""I’m a careful shopper. I enjoy shopping, but I don’t buy much. I usually know what I want and don’t spend too much. Sometimes I shop to feel better, but then I often regret spending too much money.""

H. Ann-Marie, 29, nursery worker: ""I love shopping, but only on certain days and never on Saturdays because it’s too busy. I’m a careful shopper. I have a good idea of what I want and I take my time to look in different shops for the best deals.""

I. Linda, 32, restaurant manager: ""I’m an unwilling shopper. Since I work in the city center, shopping isn’t exciting for me anymore. When I have to shop, I don’t try things on because it’s too much trouble. The clothes I buy don’t always fit, but I don’t mind making mistakes rather than putting in a lot of effort."""

**New Picture**  
The Gallery now has a beautiful still life painting by the Dutch artist Jan van Os from the 18th century. This large painting (89.1 cm x 71 cm) shows flowers and fruit in bright colors on wood. It is one of the first paintings of this kind in the Gallery. The painting is signed and dated 1777 and 1778. It is common for artists to date their work in two years because they wait for certain flowers to bloom in different seasons. This painting was kindly given to the Gallery by Miss Violet Churchman in memory of her sister, Ida Nancy. It is now displayed in Room 25.

**Special Exhibition**  
The exhibition ""Painting in Spain during the Late 18th Century"" opened in the Sunley Room on 15 March. The Gallery has recently acquired works by three Spanish painters from this time: Paret, Melendez, and Francisco Bayeu, who are the main focus of the exhibition. They are joined by Francisco's brother Ramon, Antonio Gonzalez, and two Italian artists who worked in Spain during this period: Corrado Giaquinto and Giovanni Battista Tiepolo. The exhibition will be open until 31 May.

Bill, who is ten years old, says, ""I love my mum's cooking, and now I can do it better than her. The teachers make us laugh, especially when we sit down to eat the food we've made."" 

Flora, who is twelve, has some trouble with onions. She says, ""I love cooking. I made a meal for ten friends, and they really enjoyed it. My mum suggested I find a hobby instead of doing nothing on weekends. I was happy at home, so I wasn't very excited at first. But I'm really glad I decided to come."" 

Their teacher, Philippe, says, ""It's a lot of fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, even if the kitchen isn't always clean when they cook! As adults, we keep learning more about food. If parents get their children interested in cooking when they are young, they will have the skills to cook for themselves when they leave home."""
PET_13,"**Outdoor Centre Fees**  
The fees for the Outdoor Centre are for a car with four people. If you have more than four people, it costs an extra 50p for each additional person. Please pay the fees at the main office. The centre is not a private club; it is open to everyone and aims to provide outdoor sports and recreation for the public. If you are coming with a group, please let the centre know in advance.

**Windsurfing - One-Day Course**  
We offer beginner windsurfing courses on Saturdays and Sundays when the weather is good.

The course fee is £32.50, which includes all the equipment.

**One-Day Adventure Course**  
This is a great chance to try sailing, climbing, surfing, and archery. This course is designed to introduce outdoor activities to adults in a fun and relaxed way. You do not need to be very fit or have any previous experience. All you need is an interest in trying new things. The course fee is £22.50.

**Play Park**  
The Play Park is for children aged two to ten years. It is one of the best parks of its kind in the country. It has sand and water play, slides, a large ball pool, a play castle, and much more. Next year, we will open a new Play Palace and Play Ship.

PET_21,"**MONEY**

What is money? The pound, the dollar, and the franc are types of money, similar to how a gram or a kilometer are units of measurement. The main difference is that you can use money to buy things. For example, a five-pound note can be used to buy a book, a large bag of sweets, or a few cinema tickets. However, the note itself is just a piece of paper that costs very little to produce.

Thousands of years ago, people did not have money like we do today. There were no banks or shops. Back then, Mr. Green, a farmer, would trade the corn he grew for Mr. Hive's honey. This was a direct exchange between two people, each with something the other wanted. Over time, most societies created their own forms of money, called 'currencies', to make trading easier. Eventually, different currencies started to connect, which is why today we all use a national currency."
PET_46,"**Write a Winning Story!**

You could win £1,000 in this year's Fiction Prize and have your story published in *Keep Writing* magazine. Ten other lucky winners will receive a cheque for £100. We are looking for people who can write good stories. The judges include Mary Littlejohn, a novelist, Michael Brown, a television reporter, and Susan Hitchins, the editor of *Keep Writing*. They want interesting and original stories. Last year, detective fiction was very popular, but the winner wrote a love story.

You can write about anything you like, but here are some tips to help you:

1. **Write About What You Know**: This is important for every writer. Last year, many stories were about love, family, and friendship problems. Try to make ordinary situations interesting so that people want to read them.

2. **Get Your Facts Right**: Make sure your descriptions are accurate. If you write about a town or how a jet engine works, be sure you have the correct information.

3. **Hold the Reader's Attention**: Start your story in an interesting way and end it with a surprise. A weak ending can ruin a good story. Develop your story carefully and think of something unusual for the ending.

4. **Think About the Characters**: Make your characters feel real by using good descriptions. 

Your story must be your own work, between 2,000 and 2,500 words, typed, double-spaced, and printed on one side of each page. We cannot accept stories sent by fax or email, even if you are close to the deadline. You must include the application form with your story. Unfortunately, we cannot return your story or discuss our decisions.

You should not have had any fiction published in any magazine or book in this country. This is a new rule based on popular request. Your story must not have been published in any form, such as on radio or TV, anywhere in the world.

You need to pay a fee of £5 to the Writers' Association. Make your cheque payable to *Keep Writing* and send it with the application form and your story to us. The closing date is 30 July, and we will inform the winner within one month. If you win, you must agree to have your story published in our magazine."
PET_3,"**THE FIRST WOMAN SCIENTIST**

Hypatia was born in Alexandria, Egypt, in 370 A.D. For many centuries, she was the only woman scientist recognized in history. Her father was the director of Alexandria University, and he ensured that she received the best education possible. This was rare because most women at that time had few chances to study.

After studying in Athens and Rome, Hypatia returned to Alexandria and started teaching mathematics. She quickly became well-known for her understanding of new ideas. Although we do not have any of her books today, we know she wrote several important works on mathematics. Hypatia was also interested in technology and created several scientific tools to assist her work.

During her time, many rulers were afraid of science, and people involved in it were often in danger. In March 415, Hypatia was attacked in the street and killed."

PET_27,"**Grass**

Grass is one of the most successful plants in the world. There are more than 9,000 different types of grasses, and they can be found in every part of the earth. Grass is unique because it can grow in very cold places like the Arctic and Antarctic. 

Grasslands are home to many animals, from small insects and birds to large animals like cows and lions. All these animals rely on grass for food in some way. 

One interesting thing about grass is that it grows back quickly after being cut or damaged. Unlike other plants, new leaves grow from below the ground, not from the top. This is why many animals can live together in one area. When they eat all the grass, new grass starts to grow again, providing fresh food for them."
PET_44,"Kal Kaur Rai, the Young Achiever of the Year, has always loved fashion. She recently won this title at the Asian Business Awards. Since she was a child, she enjoyed drawing clothes and creating designs. However, she never told her parents, who run a supermarket, about her dream to make fashion her career. She thought they wanted her to choose a more traditional job, so she studied management at university.

After finishing university, Kal moved to London and worked at an advertising agency. She had to go to many industry events but couldn’t afford the designer clothes she admired. To solve this, she started making skirts and tops for herself. When her friends saw her creations, they asked her to make clothes for them too. 

Kal then found a small shop in London that agreed to sell her designs on a sale-or-return basis. Her clothes became very popular, and nothing was returned. This success encouraged her to leave her advertising job, take out a £20,000 loan, and start her own womenswear brand. 

Her parents were supportive of her decision to change careers, which made her very happy. Now, her clothes are sold in over 70 stores, and her business earns more than £500,000. Her designs are featured in fashion magazines, she creates outfits for pop stars, and she gained public recognition by winning this award. Kal feels grateful for her journey, saying, ""What I do is my hobby - and I get paid for it! But remember, I've worked hard for this."""
PET_22,"**Sunningdale Hotel**

The Sunningdale Hotel was built in 1913 and opened by Princess Louise. It has provided great service to guests from all over the world, welcoming people of all ages and nationalities. In the past 80 years, over 50,000 guests from 174 different countries have stayed at Sunningdale.

The hotel is located on a main road that leads to the town center. It is about a 20-minute bus ride from the center, and many buses stop outside the hotel. Guests should avoid buses with a blue ""Express"" sign, as they do not stop near the hotel. There is also an underground station less than 100 meters away.

The main building has 200 comfortable, centrally-heated single rooms, each with hot and cold water basins. Showers, baths, and toilets are located at the end of the corridors. The hotel offers a shop, sitting rooms, four television rooms, a table tennis room, a library, and a laundry. There are also eight pianos for guests to use. Parking is available in the hotel driveway. Daily newspapers are provided for free, and guests can buy stamps at the office.

Guests who stay for a long time must pay for their rooms weekly in advance and give one week's notice before leaving. Both short-term and long-term guests are welcome, but long-term guests are given priority for rooms.

Meal times are as follows: breakfast from 7 am to 9:30 am, lunch from 1 pm to 2 pm, and dinner from 5:30 pm to 7 pm. For those studying or working late, dinner can be requested until 11 pm by writing your name on a list or calling before 7 pm. There are 10 menu choices available for breakfast and dinner.

No animals or fires (for cooking or heating) are allowed in the hotel, and guests are asked to be considerate of others. If you have tapes or CDs, please keep the noise down, especially between 11 pm and 8 am. Guests arriving by train are advised to take a taxi to the hotel, as it is a bit far from the main railway station."

Tom Cruise is one of the most successful actors in movie history. However, his life has not always been easy. As a young boy, Tom was shy and found it hard to make friends, but he loved being in school plays. After finishing high school, Tom moved to New York to find work. He got a job as a porter and also took drama classes. In 1980, the film director Franco Zeffirelli gave Tom his first role in a movie. Ten years later, he became very successful and was one of the highest-paid actors in Hollywood, earning millions of dollars for each film. Today, Tom still acts in movies and remains very popular with his many fans around the world."
PET_18,"**Little Cat, Little Cat, Where Have You Been?**

When Bo the cat decided to explore a furniture van, she had a bigger adventure than she thought. The driver found her after he had driven over 500 kilometers. It was the end of a long day, and both the driver and Bo were hungry. He gave her some milk and started to ask questions. He called his last customers, but they had not lost a cat. 

As it was getting late, he took Bo home for the night. The next morning, he took her to an animal hospital. Meanwhile, Bo's owner was also looking for her. After searching everywhere, he remembered the furniture van that had delivered to a neighbor. Luckily, he remembered the name of the company. He called their office, and soon Bo was safely returned to her owner."
PET_49,"**The Ghan Train**

Mark Ottaway took a train journey from Darwin, in northern Australia, to Adelaide, in the south. The Ghan train travels across Australia, from the warm northern coast through vast deserts to the cooler Southern Ocean. It is often called the ""famous Ghan,"" but it is known for being late.

The idea of a train link between Darwin and Adelaide started in the 1920s, with a line reaching Alice Springs. However, heavy flooding often made it hard for trains to run. A new line was finished just a few months before my trip. The railway was built for speeds up to 115 kph, but the Ghan is not a fast train. It has few stops, and most passengers are on holiday. The Ghan does not offer luxury like the Orient Express, but the food on board is very good. The railway was originally built to transport goods, not passengers. It was believed that sending goods from Europe to southern Australia through Darwin and the train would save time and money compared to shipping around the continent.

It is rare to complete a transcontinental railway, and the Ghan claims to be the world's first north-south railway. As I waited to board, I noticed that everyone was excited about the journey. Many of my fellow travelers were Australian retirees who were especially eager to get on the train.

Our first stop was Katherine, where the Ghan stayed for four hours. Some passengers got off to take a boat trip in the gorge. I stayed on the train until Alice Springs, where I joined a two-day trip to Uluru (Ayers Rock) with a small group and a guide. Climbing the rock is not encouraged now, and few people do it. Our group walked around the rock and enjoyed the beautiful sunset.

From Alice Springs, there are two trains a week going south, so many passengers stop their journey there. The view from the train after Alice Springs is not very interesting; there is a lot of flat land with only cattle to see. But on the third day at dawn, we reached the foothills near the Southern Ocean. My journey was ending, and even though the train did not meet all the promises made in advertisements, it took me to some of the most amazing sights in Australia."
PET_31,"**Climbing to the Top of Britain**

Every year, thousands of people climb Ben Nevis in Scotland. Because it is in the north, the weather can be very cold. Climber Keith Hewitt shares his experience of climbing Ben Nevis for the first time.

It was February, and it was my first big winter climb. We chose a route up the north face of the mountain to Tower Ridge. This climb is six hundred meters high, making it one of the longest in Britain. We planned to camp for three days in the 'Carries', which are large bowl-shaped areas cut into the mountain halfway up. We carried tents, sleeping bags, and metal spikes for our boots. You really need these spikes on Ben Nevis because the snow can be so hard that it feels like walking on ice. 

Even though some people in our group were very experienced, we packed a lot of safety equipment, including lights to signal for help, hard hats, and extra clothes. The weather forecast was good, with no strong winds, but we still felt nervous when we started our climb. Climbing Ben Nevis in winter is always difficult.

As we climbed, the path became steeper, and my legs felt heavy. I was the weakest member of the group, so I needed to take more breaks. The others sometimes stopped to let me catch up, but as soon as I did, they would start climbing again. I promised myself that I would train better before my next climb.

After climbing 200 meters, we reached the start of Tower Ridge, the path that leads to the top of Ben Nevis. This path is only a meter and a half wide, and the mountain drops hundreds of meters on both sides. We knew we had to stay calm and focus on every step as we moved slowly along it. After seven hours of climbing, we finally reached the top. On a clear day, you can see the sea and the island of Skye, which is 48 kilometers away. Unfortunately, we were not lucky that day because a mist had come down.

Getting back down to camp can be just as hard as going up. You need to read a map well because a wrong turn could lead to dangerous slopes in winter. I was glad we took turns reading the map. It was only when I was safe in the tent that I could say I really enjoyed the experience. But at least I made it to the top!"
PET_58,"**Anna's New School**

This week has been very exciting because we have moved into our new school building! It is a wonderful place. The builders used wood for the whole building, just like in our old school, but this one is also designed to be environmentally friendly. It took many months to build, and we watched the construction happen. It was exciting to see the builders clear the land, but it also meant that some nice open space was lost. The noise from the machines was very loud, and sometimes the builders had to stop because of heavy rain. We started to think the building would never be finished.

Now, we have five classrooms that are very big—much larger than the old school next door, which was very old. We share one room with people from the town for meetings. There is also a nursery, a nice dining room, and large changing rooms that we are excited to use when our new sports field is ready.

When you enter the school, you will notice that there are no heaters! Instead, the heat comes from everyone inside—the children, the teachers, and the computers. The building is designed to keep the heat inside, and it also keeps the sound in, so when we sing in our classrooms, it feels like we are in a concert hall!

Another interesting thing is that the school roof has a tree on it! The builders put it there after finishing the roof because it is a custom in Austria, where the roof was made. The electricity for the lights and computers comes from a wind turbine on a hill behind the school. We visited it with our teacher yesterday, and it spins very fast. It is so big that we can see it from far away! We took some pictures to put on our website.

Even though we are already using the school, some parts are still being finished. For example, we are putting on a play for our parents, but we have to go back to our old school hall to do it. The new hall will be ready by next year. We are very happy with our new school, and our teachers say we will learn much faster now that we are here!"

PET_2,"A month ago, I never thought I would be hanging 30 meters above the ground on a Saturday afternoon in November and actually enjoying it. Now, as I looked down at the river far below, I understood why people love rock climbing. My friend Matt and I arrived at the Activity Centre on Friday evening. The place we stayed wasn’t great, but it had everything we needed: beds, blankets, and food. We were happy to be out of the city and breathing fresh air.

On Saturday morning, we met the other ten members of our group. Cameron came with his friends Kevin and Simon, while sisters Carole and Lynn were with their friend Amanda. We all came from different places and didn’t know the area well. We knew we would spend the weekend outside, but we weren’t sure how.

Half of us went caving in the morning, while the others went rock climbing. We switched activities at lunchtime. Matt and I went to the caves first. Climbing out was harder than going in, but after a lot of effort, we finally made it out—covered in mud but happy and excited about what we had done."
PET_23,"**Letter to the Newport Evening News**

On Saturday afternoon, I left my handbag on the bus. Inside it were my cheque book, address book, and my purse, which had about £50 in cash and some credit cards. When I realized I had lost it, it was too late. I didn’t know what to do. I am 72 years old, far from home, and I felt very worried. I stood by the road and cried.

A young man saw me and asked what was wrong. I told him what happened, and he gave me some money for my bus fare home. When I explained the situation to the bus driver, he said I could keep the fare. I got home safely, and soon after, the phone rang. It was the manager of CityBus, the company that owned the bus. He told me they had found my handbag and offered to bring it back to me.

I was amazed to get my handbag back with everything inside still there. I want to thank everyone who helped me that day. I really appreciate their kindness and honesty.

PET_60,"**Sharks**

Sharks are some of the most frightening animals in our oceans. They are very good at hunting underwater because they can see well and feel movement through special lines on the sides of their bodies. This makes sharks dangerous for smaller sea animals that they eat.

Although sharks are similar to other fish in some ways, their bodies are different. For example, most sharks need to swim all the time to breathe and stay alive, so they hardly ever sleep. Also, if sharks are turned upside down, they can stop moving completely. This is a useful technique for researchers who need to study sharks. It helps them learn more about these interesting creatures."

PET_53,"**Joining the Kirov Ballet**

My name is Nathalie. Last year, I became one of the youngest foreign students to join the Kirov ballet school in St Petersburg, Russia. On my first day of ballet class, I felt nervous because I didn’t know anyone. Everyone came over to ask me questions in Russian. I tried to speak in Russian, and they switched to English, so we could understand each other. 

Now, six months later, everyone is very nice to me, my Russian has improved a lot, and I can understand my teachers. For the first two weeks after I arrived, my mom stayed with me, and when she left, I felt a bit sad. I even called home one night because I was feeling lonely. 

The classes in Russia are much harder than those in my ballet school in England, and I eat a lot to keep my energy up. This helps me meet the school’s high standards. In the evenings, I like to watch my favorite movies on my computer, but sometimes I fall asleep before they finish. 

Now that I have settled in, I feel at home here. I enjoy walking around the city and visiting different shops, even in December when it was very cold. I bought a fur hat because it was minus 10 degrees Celsius, but the Russians said it was mild for that time of year! At least my room is warm and cozy. 

Right now, we are getting ready for a new performance, and there is also a competition for young dancers that I plan to enter. I feel very lucky to be here."
PET_55,"**THE ICEHOTEL**

For many years, the Arctic was a popular place to visit in the summer to see the land of the midnight sun. However, in winter, the few people living there enjoyed the snow and ice by themselves. By the end of the 1980s, people started to see the dark and cold winter as a good thing. 

In the winter of 1990, a French artist named Jannot Derit was invited to open an exhibition in a special igloo (a building made of snow) in the small town of Jukkasjarvi, located on the frozen Torne River. This building, called Arctic Hall, attracted many visitors. One night, a group of foreign guests decided to sleep in Arctic Hall. The next morning, they were very happy with their experience, and the idea of an ice hotel was created. Today, it is famous around the world.

When winter starts, a team of snow builders, architects, and artists from different countries come to Jukkasjarvi to build the hotel for that year. As each part is finished, it opens to visitors and guests, while the other parts are still being built. The first part is completed in December, and every week after that, a new part opens until January 7th, when the hotel is fully completed. Because the ICEHOTEL is built outside using natural winter materials, the finishing date can change depending on the weather.

In spring, as the weather gets warmer, the hotel melts. Inside the hotel, the temperature is never colder than -5 to -8 degrees Celsius, no matter how cold it is outside. Guests receive warm winter clothes like overalls, hats, and gloves as part of their stay. It is also a good idea for guests to bring sweaters, scarves, and plenty of woollen socks. They should choose shoes that are a bit larger than normal to fit the thick socks.

If you plan to visit the hotel, you can buy warm sweaters, woollen socks, and more on the ICEHOTEL website. You can order these items along with your booking, and they will be delivered to your room when you check in. The hotel is located in the village of Jukkasjarvi, 200 km above the Arctic Circle, but only 15 km from Kiruna airport and 17 km from Kiruna train station. You can arrange bus transport from the airport or train station to the ICEHOTEL."
PET_50,"**Shopping for Furniture**

A report by Dave Worthington

Homestyle, a new furniture shop, had to close shortly after it opened at midnight last Thursday. Up to 6,000 people rushed to the shop because of many special offers. For example, a leather sofa was on sale for £45, but only until 3 am, and a bed was £30, but only between 3 am and 8 am. The shop's regular hours will be from 9 am to 9 pm every day, but Homestyle had planned to stay open for the first 24 hours without closing. However, it had to shut down just half an hour after opening.

A police officer who came to the shop said, ""We knew a large crowd was coming, but people were not patient. The shop quickly became full, and the managers wisely decided to close the doors. The people outside got angry because they thought everything would be sold out before they could get in, and they refused to wait quietly in line until there was space for them. Another problem was that there was a long line of cars trying to get to the parking lot. I couldn't believe that many people just left their cars in the middle of the road and walked the last few meters to the shop, which blocked the road completely.""

One customer, Jenny Smith, who got into the shop, said, ""I waited in line for three hours, but I didn't have time to buy what I wanted. The staff were very calm and explained what was happening. They had no choice because it wasn't safe. I will come back when they reopen, but I don't want to wait in line again."""

PET_34,"**Free-diving in the Caribbean**

Tanya Streeter is a free-diver who holds four world records in this sport. Free-diving is when people dive deep into the ocean using only one breath of air. In 2003, Tanya made history by becoming the first person to dive 120 meters deep while holding her breath and then swim back up without any help. A year earlier, she had dived deeper but used a balloon to come back up. This time, she held her breath for over three and a half minutes, making her the first woman to break a world record previously held by a man.

During her dive, a team of fourteen safety divers watched her from different depths. Some people think free-diving is too dangerous because of accidents that have happened, but Tanya believes that safety and training are very important. 

Most free-divers focus on one or two types of events, but Tanya follows a consistent training schedule. Two-thirds of her training is done in the gym, while the rest is split between the pool and the ocean. She uses an exercise bike to improve her heart fitness but avoids running to protect her knees. Instead, she prefers fast walking to stay fit.

When she practices diving, she usually travels away from home. She aims to complete fourteen dives over four weeks, taking a rest day between each dive. It is crucial for her to avoid getting tired, as this could affect her performance.

When Tanya is not training, she often makes public appearances to promote sports products and supports environmental organizations through research and films. Growing up on the Caribbean island of Grand Cayman, she loved swimming and exploring rock pools to see sea life. Tanya feels that her life now is like living her childhood dreams. Because she is famous in some countries, she believes people listen to her when she talks about environmental issues.

Looking to the future, Tanya, who is now in her thirties, plans to continue breaking her own world records. She started free-diving at the age of twenty-five and is excited to keep competing for many more years."
PET_12,"**CARTOON FILMS**

Cartoon films have very few limits. If you can draw something, you can make it move on the screen. New ideas and advanced computer programs are making cartoons exciting for people of all ages. By the end of the 1970s, many in the film industry thought cartoons were only for children. However, a few directors came up with original ideas that showed cartoons could be fun for both adults and children. 

Not every cartoon film was a success, though. For example, ""The Black Cauldron"" did not do well because it was too scary for children and too silly for adults. Directors learned from this mistake, and film companies started to make a lot of money again."
PET_26,"New TV Star Caroline Benson talks about her first role on television. 

""I never thought I would spend part of my first year at university filming The Finnegans. I had only acted in school plays, but I loved the book since I was eleven. My grandmother used to say I was just like Polly Finnegan, and I always dreamed of playing her. 

Before starting university, I took a year off to travel. While I was in Chile, my mother emailed me to say they were planning to make the book into a TV drama. I knew I had to try for the role. My mother was surprised at first, but she sent my photo to the director and convinced him to meet me. I flew back and got the part. 

Filming started a week after university began, so I asked for permission to be away for three weeks. When I returned to university, I woke up at 6:00 am to catch up on the essays I had missed. I didn’t tell my friends at university, but they found out and thought it was amazing. It was a wonderful experience, and I feel very lucky. 

After university, I definitely want to make acting my career. I’m not from an acting family, but my grandfather was an opera singer. I have tried for other TV roles, but I haven’t received any offers yet. I’m not sure how I managed everything because I also had a busy social life. 

When filming ended, I didn’t know what to do next. Since then, I have acted in two college plays. Unfortunately, I haven’t been home much, and now that my first year at university is over, I’m going to Greece for the summer with friends."""
PET_8,"**No Title**

When I opened the first 'Body Shop' in 1976, my main goal was to earn enough money to feed my children. Today, 'The Body Shop' is a fast-growing international company. Over the years, I have learned a lot, and much of this knowledge is shared in this book. I believe our company has valuable insights on how to run a successful business while staying true to our beliefs.

This is not a typical business book, nor is it just about my life. The main message is that to succeed in business, you need to be different. Business can be enjoyable, it can be run with love, and it can make a positive impact. In both business and life, I want to feel happy, have a sense of family, and be excited by new experiences. I have always wanted the people who work for 'The Body Shop' to feel the same way.

Now, this book shares my ideas with the world. I believe there are no limits to our 'family' or to what we can achieve. I find this thought exciting, and I hope you do too."
PET_4,"**A Journey Along the Beautiful Douro River**

Jules Verne operates a 'hotel ship' on the Douro River in Portugal. The MV Lady Ivy May can accommodate 160 guests in double cabins, all with outside views and private bathrooms. On the ship, you will find air-conditioning, a sun-deck, lounge, bar, dining room, shop, and library.

**Itinerary**

**Day 1:** You will leave London Heathrow in the early evening and arrive in Oporto. Your guide will meet you and take you to the Lady Ivy May, where you will spend the night.

**Day 2:** After sightseeing in Oporto in the morning, you will return to the ship and sail to Entre-os-Rios. This part of the journey takes four hours.

**Day 3:** You will continue up the river. In the early evening, the ship will stop at Peso da Regua, known for its port wine. At dinner, you can enjoy delicious local food and drinks.

**Day 4:** After breakfast, you will travel by bus to the ancient town of Lamego. You will visit the cathedral, several churches, and a museum that used to be a palace. The museum has a great collection of paintings, tapestries, and sculptures. After the visit, you will return to the ship and sail to Tua.

**Day 8:** You will arrive in Oporto with enough time for sightseeing and last-minute shopping before your flight back to London Heathrow."
PET_30,"**HONEY**

Honey is a sweet liquid made by bees. It is made up of water and sugars. To make just half a kilo of honey, bees can travel up to seventy-five thousand kilometers and visit over two million flowers. The color and taste of honey depend on the type of flower the bees visit. There are more than three hundred different types of honey. Generally, lighter-colored honey has a milder taste than darker honey.

In ancient times, honey was the main sweet food because sugar was very rare. The ancient Egyptians valued honey so much that they used it as a form of payment. Today, honey is produced and consumed all over the world. Research shows that honey can help reduce tiredness and improve athletic performance. Additionally, honey is not only a food; it can also be used to soothe sore throats and is found in many skin and hair-care products."
PET_7,"**Norwich**

Norwich is the capital of East Anglia, a region in Britain, and has been a place to live for over two thousand years. It started as a small village by the River Wensum. By the time of the Norman invasion in 1066, it had grown into one of the largest towns in England. Norwich has two cathedrals and a mosque, making it an important center for different religions. The first cathedral was built in 1095 and recently celebrated its 900th anniversary. In 1994, Norwich celebrated its 800th anniversary of becoming a city, which allowed it to govern itself.

Today, Norwich is smaller than cities like London or Manchester, with a population of about 150,000. However, in the 16th century, it was the second city of England. For the next 300 years, it continued to grow and became wealthy, known for having as many churches as there are weeks in a year and as many pubs as there are days in a year. Nowadays, there are fewer churches and pubs, but in 1964, the University of East Anglia was established in Norwich. With a growing number of students and its success as a commercial center (it is the largest center for insurance services outside London), Norwich now offers many entertainment options, including theatres, cinemas, nightclubs, busy cafes, excellent restaurants, and arts and leisure centers. The city also has a football team known as 'The Canaries', which wears green and yellow, though the reason for the name is unclear.

One of the city's new attractions is a modern shopping center called 'The Castle Mall'. For over two years, the people of Norwich dealt with a large hole in the city while builders worked on the main car park. They moved nearly a million tons of earth to create a park on the roof of the Mall, complete with water features and many trees. The local people are happy that the old open market still exists in the city center, next to the new development. Both areas continue to thrive, showing that Norwich has successfully combined the old and the new."
PET_43,"**The Albuquerque Balloon Festival**

Every autumn, the sky above Albuquerque, a city in the southwestern United States, fills with bright colors. This is the Albuquerque Balloon Festival, a nine-day event that happens every year. The first festival took place in 1972 to celebrate the 50th birthday of a local radio station. It started with about twelve hot-air balloons taking off from a parking lot in the city. Since then, the festival has grown a lot. This year, at least a thousand balloons from over a third of the countries in the world are expected to join the event at its new location outside the city.

**What to See**

The balloon pilots communicate with each other using radios, and they all light up their balloon burners at the same time. This event is called a ""balloon glow,"" and it is a great chance to take beautiful photos. To see the balloon glows, you should arrive just after dark or before 5:30 am. During the day, you can walk among the balloons and talk to the pilots as they get ready for take-off. The balloons come in many sizes and colors, with some shaped like animals or cartoon characters, as well as popular products like soft drinks and fast food. Kids will really enjoy it!

In the afternoon, you can also take a balloon ride over the desert with one of the many companies that offer this experience. Another option is to ride the cable car from the desert floor to the top of the nearby mountains, which is the longest cable car ride in the world, and enjoy a great view of the festival.

There are many other attractions for visitors of all ages, including balloon races and fireworks on the first night and the last three nights of the festival.

**The Albuquerque Box**

This is a local wind pattern that creates perfect conditions for balloon flying. The Sandia Mountains protect the balloons from strong winds and create gentler winds at different heights. This allows skilled pilots to control the direction of their balloons by going up or down.

**Practical Advice**

Buy your tickets in advance online to avoid long waits at the festival. Wear several layers of light clothing because it can be cool at night and in the early morning, but during the day, you will need sunglasses and sunscreen. Bring a flashlight for night events and, of course, don’t forget your camera. If you use film instead of a digital camera, make sure to bring high-speed film for evening and night photos."
PET_51,"The Eden Project

Since it opened, the Eden Project in the south-west of England has become one of the most popular tourist attractions in the UK. At first glance, the large 'biospheres' on this old industrial site look like something from a science-fiction movie. Each biosphere represents a different climate zone, showing visitors how important the connection between people and plants is. It is surprising to see how many everyday products come from plants, such as wood, rubber, fruit, rice, sugar, coffee, and chocolate. Over 135,000 different types of plants are grown here. No matter how cold it is outside, computer-controlled heaters keep the plants at the right temperature. In the Rainforest Zone, the air is always humid because of a large waterfall. Another zone mimics the environment of the Mediterranean, California, and South Africa, and there are plans to create a desert zone in the near future."
PET_11,"Some people have said they do not like this year's collection, New Writing 3, but I don’t understand why. It is amazing to have 500 pages of original writing for just £6.99. Most of the book is fiction, including parts of novels and complete short stories. There are enjoyable pieces by well-known writers like Candia McWilliam and Rose Tremain. Interestingly, many lesser-known writers have written mainly about food. I recommend you avoid reading Jane Harris's Those Nails right after eating, as it has some very unpleasant scenes that might upset you! 

The collection also features great work from nineteen poets, including R. S. Thomas and John Burnside. There are excerpts from novels that are still being written by Jim Crace and Jane Rogers. Additionally, there is a bit of non-fiction, including a funny article by Alan Rusbridger about certain newspapers and a remarkable piece by Ursula Owen about her life. Overall, this is an exceptional collection, and I am excited to see what next year's edition will bring."
PET_14,"**The Best Age to Start Learning the Violin**

Margaret Porter, a violinist and music teacher, believes that the best age to start learning the violin is between three and six years old. She says this is when children are discovering the world around them. Margaret, who lives in London, usually teaches children who are three or four years old, but she sometimes makes exceptions for enthusiastic five-year-olds.

When she began teaching in 1972, her first class included her children’s five-year-old friends. Margaret teaches in groups, with about twelve students in each class. Each lesson lasts one hour and takes place every two weeks. In addition, each student has one individual lesson with her every week. Parents are also required to attend the classes because it is important for them to be involved in their child's learning.

From the very first lessons, students learn to play music by ear. They do not start reading music until they have been playing for several years. For a long time, there is a noticeable difference between how well they can play and how well they can read music. Margaret explains that her teaching method is not meant to create expert violinists. She often advises students who excel to leave and study the violin using more traditional methods."
PET_56,"**Moonshine**

The band Moonshine released their third CD last week. The new album, called ""Here Again,"" follows their previous one, ""The Waves."" There have been some changes in the band since the last CD. Tom Wilcott is now playing bass guitar, replacing Simon McVee, who left the band last year. Also, Tom Simpson has joined as the new drummer.

From the first song, which is a dance track, it is clear that the band is moving away from slow songs. The second song is also a dance tune and is even louder and heavier. Many fans might be surprised by these two tracks, as they are different from the band's usual style. However, both songs are excellent and could easily become popular singles. 

Singer Rob Letchford shows off his talent by hitting every note perfectly. Fans should be thankful that he recorded these songs before he had problems with his throat, which has caused the band to cancel their upcoming tour. Anyone who bought tickets does not need to worry, as the concerts will be rescheduled once Rob has recovered.

In this CD, Moonshine demonstrates that they can create great music in different styles, from the slow songs fans know to the upbeat tracks that make you want to dance. However, I felt that the best songs were at the beginning, and the last few tracks were not as strong. Despite this, ""Here Again"" is sure to be a big success and will bring more recognition to the band."
PET_36,"**San Francisco**

San Francisco is located on the northern California coast. The first Europeans to find this area were led by a Spanish explorer named Gaspar de Portola, who saw it for the first time in 1769. Interestingly, even though San Francisco Bay is a beautiful natural harbor, it was discovered by land, not by sea.

In 1849, many people came to San Francisco hoping to find gold. However, it was not the gold seekers who became rich. The wealthiest people were those who owned banks and law firms, and they built large houses on a hill called Nob Hill.

Today, many tourists visit San Francisco to see famous sites like Chinatown and the Golden Gate Bridge. Many also take a short boat trip to Alcatraz Island to visit the old prison there."
PET_6,"**SAMUEL PEPYS**

The most famous diary in English was written by Samuel Pepys. It gives a detailed and interesting look at everyday life in England from 1660 to 1669. Pepys writes about important events of that time, such as diseases, an enemy navy coming up the River Thames, and the Great Fire of London. He also shares personal stories, including his own mistakes—like often falling asleep in church or looking at pretty girls. 

He talks about his home life, including arguments with his wife and how they made up, as well as his worries about her health. Besides reading, he enjoyed music, the theatre, card games, and parties with good food and fun. Pepys was a busy man with many important jobs; he was a Member of Parliament and the President of the Royal Society. He is also remembered for his contributions to the British Navy."
PET_33,"**The History of Shoes**

In the past, people did not think much about whether shoes were comfortable or stylish. Early shoes were likely made from animal skins, which people tied around their ankles to keep warm. Today, we still use leather, but other materials like silk, plastic, and cotton are also common, depending on current fashion trends. 

It was only about 150 years ago that people started wearing different shoes for each foot. Before that, shoes were straight and could be worn on either foot. All shoes used to be made by hand, but now most shoes are made by machines in large factories. The invention of sewing machines helped the shoe industry produce many more shoes at lower prices, making them available to more people."
PET_20,"**No Title**

When I hurt my back, I had to stop running for a while. I wanted to help more women get into running, to show them how enjoyable it can be and to help them feel confident enough to start. So, I decided to create a running club for women in my area. I was frustrated with many race organisers who complain about not having enough women in the sport but do not provide separate changing rooms for them.

I put up posters, and 40 women of different ages and fitness levels joined the club. Most of them were interested in losing weight, but I don’t think they had considered running before. If they did, they only thought about the hard training. They didn’t imagine running could be fun, with chatting and smiling in beautiful places, like by a river.

At first, they could only run for one minute, but now they can run for thirty minutes. They have also learned about healthy eating and staying fit from other runners. I wanted to do something for women’s running, and it has been a joy to see their progress, almost as much as they have enjoyed it themselves."
PET_40,"**THE HISTORY OF THE IDITAROD - THE LAST GREAT RACE ON EARTH**

In the 1880s, gold was found in Alaska, the northernmost state in the USA. Many people came to Alaska hoping to become rich. New towns were built quickly, including one called Iditarod, which means ""far, distant place."" In 1909, Iditarod grew so fast that it briefly became the largest city in Alaska.

In the summer, supplies could be delivered to these towns by boat. However, in winter, the rivers and ocean froze, making it hard to reach them. To solve this problem, a winter trail was built in 1910 for dog teams pulling sleds. These teams delivered mail, food, and clothes to gold miners. This trail became known as the Iditarod Trail. It took about three weeks for a team of dogs to travel across Alaska, stopping at ""roadhouses"" where drivers could find a warm bed and food for themselves and their dogs.

The trail was used every winter until the 1920s when airplanes replaced dog teams and boats as the main way to transport goods. However, in 1925, dogs became famous again when a disease called diphtheria struck the city of Nome. The medicine needed to cure the disease was in Anchorage, on the other side of Alaska. At that time, airplanes were new, and no one was sure if they could fly in the cold weather. The only skilled pilot, Carl Eielson, was away on a trip. So, it was decided to use dog teams to transport the medicine instead.

The journey was over 1,000 kilometers, mostly along the Iditarod Trail. Twenty dog teams completed the trip in just six days. Leonhard Seppala, a Norwegian who had come to Alaska for gold, traveled the first 400 kilometers. He relied on his dog Togo to guide them through the heavy snow, and Togo proved to be a great help. The last part of the journey was done by Gunnar Kaasen, who had driven dog teams in Alaska for 21 years. His lead dog was Saito. At one point, Balto, another dog, refused to go further, preventing the team from falling into icy water. Thanks to their efforts, the diphtheria outbreak was stopped, and Balto became a hero.

Today, a dog sled race is held every year from Anchorage to Nome, following the route of that famous journey in 1925. This race is called the Iditarod and is known as ""The Last Great Race on Earth."""
PET_45,"**Sweden's Ice Hotel**

The village of Jukkasjarvi is located in Swedish Lapland, where winter temperatures can drop to -40°C. Despite the cold, around 6,000 tourists visit each year to see one of the most unique hotels in Europe. In this hotel, everything is made of ice, including the rooms where you eat, drink, and sleep. You can even have a wedding there! The bar is also made of ice, so it is not a good idea to put hot drinks on it.

The bedrooms are kept at about -4°C, but guests receive special sleeping bags to keep warm in the cold. If needed, the hotel can also provide suitable outdoor clothing. The Ice Hotel is rebuilt every winter because it melts in the summer, and it is never older than six months. Building the hotel requires 10,000 tonnes of ice and 30,000 tonnes of snow."
PET_29,"**Maria Mutola**

In 1988, Maria Mutola was the only girl playing football on an all-boys team in a local competition in Mozambique. ""We won,"" she said. ""At first, no one thought it was a problem that I was a girl. But then the team we beat complained."" This story was published in a local newspaper, and Jose Craveirinha, who supported other African athletes, learned about Maria. He went to meet her and saw her kicking a ball outside the football club. He quickly realized she was very fast.

""He talked to me about athletics,"" Maria said. ""I didn’t understand what he meant. The only sport I knew was football. Then he bought me running shoes and took me to train. It was very hard work, and my legs hurt a lot."" Jose also spoke to her parents and convinced them that she could be successful, which would help their family. They agreed to let him take her away to train.

In 1991, Maria accepted an invitation to train in the United States. She had said no before because she was worried about missing her family. Her life was very different from the girls she met in the US. She explained, ""They were good athletes, but while I worried about my parents having enough food, they worried about dresses and make-up. They didn’t know much about me or my problems. But I knew I was lucky to be there. The trainers were amazing, and I learned a lot.""

Today, Maria still runs and spends most of the year happily living in South Africa with her mother."
PET_57,"**The Skywalk**

The Grand Canyon in the United States was formed by the Colorado River. Many people visit Grand Canyon Park to walk, run, and especially to enjoy the view. The view is amazing, and it is even more impressive because of the Skywalk. The Skywalk is 1,219 meters above the bottom of the Grand Canyon. It is a platform made of glass, allowing you to see the beautiful rocks below. Up to 120 people can stand on it at the same time. The Skywalk opened in 2007, and since then, thousands of visitors have experienced it. To protect the glass, you must wear special covers over your shoes. Walking on the Skywalk feels like flying high in the air, just like a bird."
PET_9,"**THE ROCKIES**

The Rocky Mountains stretch almost the entire length of North America. They begin in the Northwest and are only a few hundred miles from the center in the southern areas. Although the Rockies are smaller than the Alps, they are still very beautiful. There are many roads that go through the Rockies, but the best way to see them is by train. 

You can start your journey from Vancouver, which is one of the most beautiful cities in Canada. This city is located by the water and near the mountains, allowing people to ski just 15 minutes by car from the city center. 

In the past, thirty passenger trains left Vancouver every day for the cross-continent railway. Now, there are only three trains a week, but the trip is still an exciting adventure. You can sleep on the train, which is fun, but you will see some of the best views at night."
PET_42,"**ZOOS**

People have kept animals in zoos for over 3,000 years. The first big zoo was called the Gardens of Intelligence, opened by the rulers of China. In the past, animals in zoos were trained to perform for visitors, but this is no longer done. Now, the main purpose of zoos is to let people see animals behaving naturally.

Today, most cities have a zoo or wildlife park. However, not everyone agrees with the idea of zoos. Supporters believe that zoos help us learn about nature and allow us to see wild animals up close. They think these experiences would not be possible without zoos.

On the other hand, some people do not support zoos. They believe it is wrong to keep animals in cages. They also argue that in poorly managed zoos, animals may live in dirty conditions and eat the wrong food."
PET_59,"**JAZZ**  
By Katie Atkins, aged 14  

I play the trumpet in my school jazz band. Last month, we had a jazz competition with bands from local high schools, and our band won! Each band wore different costumes, from black school uniforms like mine to bright T-shirts. We may not have looked like professional adult bands, but we were all used to performing in competitions, so the quality of our playing was amazing, especially since we are all so young. Players from each band even made up new songs right on stage. It was exciting to watch, but even better when my band performed!  

My school has a great jazz band, but not everyone who wants to join gets in—only about half of the applicants. However, anyone who is eager to play can attend jazz practice before school, and we often spend time together after school, listening to jazz and learning about it. We also go on trips to jazz summer camps around the country. I have been to a couple and learned a lot.  

Adults are often surprised that young people are interested in jazz. My music teacher thinks it’s because pop music is not challenging enough for serious music lovers like me. I find jazz exciting because it feels both new and old at the same time. You can create your own music, but you also feel connected to its history, playing on stage like the great jazz performers before you. My school is very lucky to have great teachers and supportive parents. Without them, we wouldn’t get far with our music!"
PET_54,"**Watering the Desert**

In Marrakesh, Morocco, it can rain anytime from November to March. However, it does not rain often. When it does rain, the city's water pipes cannot handle the sudden floods, causing the streets to become like rivers. Many winters have been dry recently, so when it finally rains, the local people are very happy.

The parks and gardens in Marrakesh do not rely on rain. Instead, they get water from a system of underground channels that were built in the 11th century. These channels bring water from the mountains all year round. Places that are mostly dry but receive water this way are called oases.

If you travel south from Marrakesh, you will reach Skoura. In Skoura, every piece of land is divided into small squares by water channels, and people use this land to grow food. The snow-covered Atlas mountains in winter create a beautiful view in the background."

Gareth Ellis is 13 years old and the youngest son of Alan, an engineer, and Kath, a nursery teacher. His older brothers work in banking and computers, but Gareth has always wanted to be a clown. Three years ago, the whole family joined a circus. Kath says, ""People laugh when we tell them, but it's true. Gareth has wanted to be a clown since we took him to the circus when he was three.""

When Alan lost his job, he and Kath decided to look for full-time jobs in the circus. They both found jobs with a well-known circus, and Gareth started training to be a clown. He calls himself Bippo. They travel with the circus in the summer and go home in the winter. Gareth's brothers are old enough to take care of the house while they are away.

Kath explains, ""I can't say it was easy. There was a lot to think about and organize. We only had a car and a small caravan to sleep in, and we were leaving our nice house. The only thing Gareth missed was his long, hot baths.""

Gareth shares, ""People ask about my education, but from the start, someone has always come to teach me wherever we go. I use the same books as my friends at school, and I have a computer. I've never fallen behind my classmates.""

What about the future? Kath says, ""It was a hard decision, but there was no other way to teach Gareth about being a clown. I'm happy to say it's working, and we're enjoying it."" And Gareth? He says, ""I'm going to be the main clown in a circus one day, maybe Bippo's circus."""
PET_52,"**Eight-eighteen News**

Eight-eighteen News is a news agency for young people aged 8 to 18. We collect news and write reports, stories, and articles. We send these to important newspapers, magazines, TV, radio, and websites to be published. You can read or listen to the news stories and articles by our members on the Eight-eighteen website.

We have three centers across the country where young people can meet others and join projects. We plan to open more centers soon. Since we started in 1994, when we were called 'Young News', over 2,500 young people have been members. Sophie is one of them. She says, ""I first heard about Eight-eighteen when they interviewed me for an article about young people's views on hip hop music. I was amazed by the opportunities the young journalists had. Age didn’t matter; they were trusted to do stories on their own. I started going to the Eight-eighteen center in my city, got some training, and was a member until I turned 18. Eight-eighteen helped me achieve more than I thought I could. With the skills I learned, I got a job at 19 and am now the youngest employee on a major news website, checking articles before they are published.""

**Get Involved at Every Level**

When you join Eight-eighteen, you will receive training and participate in monthly meetings to decide who will write each news story. Eight-eighteen encourages members to share their skills. 'Peer trainers' are experienced members aged 12 and older who train new members and teach them basic journalism skills. As they gain more experience, some members present sessions to young people and adults outside of Eight-eighteen, often in youth clubs and summer camps. These young trainers are always supported by older staff during these trips.

Eight-eighteen News holds training sessions for new members three times a year. Our next training for new members will be in February. If you or someone you know is interested in joining, call Director Den Ley at 01622 657874 for more information. The Eight-eighteen program is suitable for children with reading and writing skills at all levels. Membership is free, and there is no test to join."
PET_28,"**Antarctica Sightseeing Flights Website**

Welcome to our website! Here, you will find all the information you need before booking a flight.

During the short summer in Antarctica, we offer sightseeing flights from Sydney, Australia, on a Boeing 747. These flights take you over Antarctica and then back to Sydney. The exact dates for next year are not confirmed yet, but if you book now, your deposit can be moved to a different date if needed.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**How long is the flight?**  
The average flight lasts 12 hours. About four hours into the flight, we usually see the first sea ice and icebergs. We spend four hours flying over Antarctica and the rest of the time returning home. During the flight, experts who have worked in Antarctica will give talks about the environment and history, and they will answer your questions. There is also a camera next to the pilot that shows a view from the cockpit throughout the flight.

**Will I get a seat next to a window?**  
All passengers receive two boarding passes. At the halfway point of the flight, you will need to move to the seat shown on your second boarding pass. Business and first-class passengers will have a window seat for half of the flight and a seat next to a window for the other half. Economy passengers will have either a window seat or a seat next to a window for half of the flight and an end-of-row seat for the other half. While we are over Antarctica, we encourage passengers to get up and move around the plane so everyone can enjoy the views. The pilot will fly in long 'figure 8s' over interesting sights to ensure everyone can see well from both sides of the plane.

**What happens if the weather is bad?**  
We have 17 different approved flight plans. On the morning of the flight, our captain will check the satellite images of the clouds and choose the direction that offers the best views.

**Will I see penguins and other wildlife?**  
Most wildlife in Antarctica lives at sea level, which is over 3,000 meters below the plane, so we cannot see them clearly. We do not land in Antarctica for environmental reasons. If you want to see Antarctic wildlife, you would need to join a boat tour.

**Can I take photographs?**  
Yes! You can bring all types of cameras. We also have some fun photo opportunities on board where you can try on Antarctic cold weather clothes."
PET_35,"**Little Chefs**

A group of children aged ten to fifteen spends their Saturdays learning how to cook. Their small classes are very popular, and there is a waiting list of 30 children who want to join. Parents pay £280 for the course, where kids can have fun and learn to make delicious food. 

Bill, who is ten years old, says, ""I love my mum's cooking, and now I can do it better than her. The teachers make us laugh, especially when we sit down to eat the food we've made."" 

Flora, who is twelve, has some trouble with onions. She says, ""I love cooking. I made a meal for ten friends, and they really enjoyed it. My mum suggested I find a hobby instead of doing nothing on weekends. I was happy at home, so I wasn't very excited at first. But I'm really glad I decided to come."" 

Their teacher, Philippe, says, ""It's a lot of fun. Children pay attention and remember things better than adults, even if the kitchen isn't always clean when they cook! As adults, we keep learning more about food. If parents get their children interested in cooking when they are young, they will have the skills to cook for themselves when they leave home."""
PET_5,"**Winter Driving**

Winter can be dangerous because it is hard to predict what will happen, and accidents can happen easily. Fog can appear suddenly over a hill, and ice can be hidden under melting snow, making it easy to lose control of your car. A car coming towards you might slide across the road unexpectedly.

**Rule Number One** for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly. Quick or rough movements can make it hard to control your car. When you turn the wheel, brake, or speed up, do it gently and slowly. You can think of it like driving with a full cup of hot coffee next to you; drive carefully so you don’t spill it.

**Rule Number Two** is to pay attention to what could happen. The more ice there is, the further ahead you should look. Test how long it takes to stop by braking gently. Remember, you might be driving faster than you realize. Generally, you should allow double your normal stopping distance on wet roads, three times this distance on snow, and even more on ice. Always try to keep control of your car to avoid problems."
PET_41,"**Craigie Aitchison**

Craigie Aitchison was a painter from Scotland. He moved to London to study law but decided to go to art school instead. He found the traditional drawing classes hard, but he continued to paint. In his late twenties, the Italian government gave him money to study art, and he became interested in early Italian artists. This influence can be seen in some of his paintings. He loved the greens and browns of the Italian countryside and the bright light there, and he wanted to capture this light in his work.

To do this, he painted colors in thin layers from light to dark, but he admits he is never sure how it will turn out. He says, ""It's a secret - because I don't know myself. I don't start by painting yellow, knowing I'm going to put anything on top."" Like many talented artists, Aitchison makes it sound easy. He believes anyone can use colors because they can be bought. He simply pays attention to how colors look next to each other.

Unlike some artists, Aitchison does not make drawings before starting a painting. He feels that if he did, he might lose interest and not finish the painting. Instead, he often changes his paintings many times before they are complete. This is why he prefers to paint people who do not ask to see their portraits while he is working. He says, ""If I feel they're worried and want to look at the painting, I can't do it.""

Since moving to London, Aitchison has not felt connected to the Scottish art scene. He says he is not interested in following any tradition; he just paints in his own way. However, his work still inspires many young British painters."
PET_38,"**Rock Band**

Two years ago, our 14-year-old son, Ben, asked us for a drum set for his birthday. At first, we didn’t like the idea because of the noise. Ben argued, “It’s better than watching TV or playing video games in my free time, and it will keep me out of trouble.” In the end, we agreed. We said, “Okay, but you must think about the rest of the family and the neighbors when you play.”

That was just the start. Since drums are hard to move, Ben's band members began coming to our house with their guitars and other equipment. Now, for several hours each week, our house shakes with their music and singing. At least Ben's hobby is good for our health: whenever the band practices, my husband and I go for a long walk. 

I must admit that, even though their music can sound a bit strange, they are a friendly and polite group of young men. I can’t judge their musical talent—after all, I didn’t expect my parents to like the same music I did when I was a teenager—but they do play regularly in local clubs for young people. 

Our main concern is that they might not spend enough time on their schoolwork because of their music, but this hasn’t happened yet. I always remind Ben how important his studies are. One thing is clear: Ben was right; playing music has kept him out of trouble and he is never bored."
PET_17,"**Atlantic College**

Last week, I visited Atlantic College, a great private college in Wales. This college offers students important experiences outside the classroom, along with the chance to study for their exams. The students, aged 16 to 18 and from all over the world, study in the morning. In the afternoon, they participate in useful activities, such as helping on a farm, caring for people with learning difficulties, or checking rivers for pollution.

One of the best things about Atlantic College is that its students come from many different backgrounds and countries. Since the fees are £20,000 for two years, many students receive financial support. About a quarter of the students are British, and many of them can only attend because they get help from the government.

Barbara Molenkamp, a student from the Netherlands, said, ""I really admire the college for encouraging international understanding among young people. You learn to live with people and respect them, even those you don’t like. During the summer holidays, my mother couldn’t believe how much less I argued with my sister.""

In conclusion, Atlantic College provides its students with an excellent education through methods that really work."
PET_47,"**Being an Older Student**

At 32 years old, I have just completed my first year at university. I attend lectures regularly and have learned to read books quickly and write long essays. I decided to go to university after being away from school for fourteen years. As a secretary, I earned a decent salary, but I felt bored because my job did not challenge me. I became more and more unhappy, feeling stuck in my job. I envied the students at the local university who seemed happy, carefree, and excited about their future. I wanted to be part of that.

Now that I am a student, I find it difficult to connect with younger classmates. They often mistake me for a teacher and ask me questions I cannot answer. I also feel distant from the professors because, even though we are the same age, I know much less than they do. However, I am grateful for this chance to study because I understand that having a qualification is important for getting a good job.

Unlike most eighteen-year-olds, I prefer spending my weekends studying rather than going out to parties. I also enjoy the typical student benefits, like long holidays and discounts for theaters and cinemas. I sometimes worry about what I will do after university, but I hope that continuing my education at this age is a smart decision."
PET_48,"**Henry Ford**

Henry Ford was born on a farm in Michigan in 1863, but he did not enjoy farming. When he was fifteen, he started working as a mechanic. In 1893, he built his first car. After driving it for 1,500 kilometers, he sold it and made two larger cars. In 1903, he founded the Ford Motor Company. He used strong but light steel to create affordable cars for regular people. In 1908, he introduced the first Ford Model 'T', which cost $825. Soon, he was selling 100 cars every day. By 1927, the Ford Motor Company was valued at $700 million. Early Ford cars were simple and inexpensive, but this simplicity sometimes meant fewer options. Henry Ford famously said about the Model T, ""You can have any color you like, as long as it's black."""
KET_15,"Dear Sir,

KET_19,"**Rebecca Stevens**

Rebecca Stevens was the first woman to climb Mount Everest. Before this achievement, she worked as a journalist and lived in a small apartment in south London. In 1993, Rebecca decided to leave her job and family to travel to Asia with a group of climbers. She discovered that life on Everest is very difficult. 

""You have to carry everything on your back,"" she said. ""This means you can only take what you really need. You can't wash on the mountain, and in the end, I didn't even bring a toothbrush. I usually like to be clean, but there is no water, only snow. Water is very heavy, so you only take enough to drink!""

When Rebecca reached the top of Mount Everest on May 17, 1993, it was the happiest moment of her life. Suddenly, she became famous. Now, she has written a book about her journey, and people often invite her to speak about it. She also has a new job on a science program on television. 

Today, Rebecca is well-known and has more money, but she still lives in her small apartment in south London, surrounded by her pictures and books about mountains!"
KET_24,"Dear Mike, 

I’m sorry you couldn’t come to my party yesterday. Jon told me you had a bad cold and chose to stay in bed. Are you feeling better now? The party was great; it was the best one I’ve ever had! Many of my friends were there, and they gave me some nice presents. I will tell you more about the party when you come to school on Monday.

KET_13,"**CANADA GEESE**

Canada Geese are large birds with blue and white feathers. When autumn comes, they need to fly south to find warmer weather. The winters in Canada are very cold, and the birds can die if they stay there. 

Last spring, a man named Bill Lishman found sixteen young Canada Geese on his farm. These young birds had lost their parents. Bill thought, ""These young birds won’t know how to fly south in autumn."" He had a small plane, so he decided to teach the geese to follow him. 

All summer long, Bill took short flights in his plane, and the young geese flew after him. When autumn arrived and the weather got colder, Bill flew to Virginia in the United States, which is 600 miles south of his home in Canada. The geese followed him the whole way. 

After reaching Virginia, Bill left the geese there and returned home. This spring, he waited for the birds to come back, but they did not arrive. So, Bill flew back to Virginia to find them. He searched for two weeks but could not find them. 

When he returned home, Bill was surprised to see the geese waiting for him. They had found their way back home without his help!"
KET_16,"**ESTHER'S STORY**

When Esther finished school at sixteen, her aunt Flory gave her £500 for her birthday. While most of Esther's friends chose to go to college, Esther decided to use her aunt's money to start her own business. She bought fruit, sugar, and glass jars to make her own jam. She sold the jam for £1 a jar to her friends and quickly made back her aunt's £500.

At first, Esther's parents were not happy with her decision. They wanted her to study and hoped she would become a teacher or a doctor. However, Esther ignored their advice and continued making jam. After a few months, she began selling her jam at the local market. She also started making orange juice, which she sold to a school where one of her friends worked.

After two years, her business grew very large, and her parents were proud of her. She made many different types of food and sold them to shops and supermarkets. She became so busy that she needed to hire some people to help her."

KET_46,"**Corryvale Farm**

Corryvale Farm is located in the west of England. Stephen and Jenny Blackler raise cows and chickens and sell milk and eggs. However, most of their income comes from Jenny's sheep. She has 50 sheep, and each sheep produces enough wool for six sweaters. Every six months, Stephen shears the wool from the sheep to keep them cool.

Five years ago, Jenny tried to sell sweaters made from the wool at country markets, but it was summer and too hot for people to buy sweaters. Instead, she made socks, which everyone loved because they were cheap, strong, and easy to wash. This is how Jenny's business began. 

At first, she made the socks at home, but soon she had thousands of customers. So, she started sending the wool to a factory, where machines now make all the socks. There are six colors, five sizes for all ages, and different types of socks for walkers, sportsmen, and skiers. 

Jenny is especially busy at Christmas because Corryvale socks are a popular gift. In her office, she has many letters from happy customers from all over the world."

KET_10,"**BURGLARS PREFER THE AFTERNOON**

Most house burglaries happen between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m., according to the police. Inspector Ian Saunders told our newspaper that the number of burglaries has increased by more than 30% compared to last year. He also mentioned that 67% of burglaries occur when people leave their homes and forget to close a door or a window. 

Night-time burglaries are rare because families are usually at home during that time. However, winter afternoons are the best for burglars because it gets dark, making it hard for them to be seen. Many houses are empty during this time since people are often still at work.

Inspector Saunders suggested that it is a good idea to leave lights on in living rooms and bedrooms when you go on holiday. This can help keep burglars away. He also encouraged neighbors to watch over each other’s houses when someone is not home and to call the police if they notice anything suspicious. 

""We will also give you tips on how to make your house safer,"" Inspector Saunders said. ""This kind of help is free."""
KET_27,"Dear Lynne and Tony,

KET_44,"**The History of Farming**

Before farming started, people searched in forests for plants and fruits to eat. This meant they had to move around a lot to find food. About 12,000 years ago, in the Middle East, people began to grow their own food. These early farmers were the first to practice agriculture. 

Farming allowed people to stay in one place, and over time, their villages grew larger. Some villagers could then focus on other jobs, like making clothes, because the farmers provided food for everyone. However, farming was challenging, especially during bad weather, which sometimes led to food shortages.

Today, farmers can produce much more food, and it can travel thousands of kilometers from where it is grown to our homes."
KET_22,"**WORKING FOR AN AIRLINE**

Nicola Peet finished school at eighteen, went to college, and then worked at a local airport. After nine months, she started working for Saudi Arabian Airlines and later became an air hostess for British Airways. Four years later, she got her current job as a manager. Here is what she said about her job:

""My office is at Heathrow Airport, but I spend 60% of my time in the air. I teach air hostesses and help them with any problems they have. I also attend many meetings. My working hours are usually from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., but sometimes I work from 1 p.m. to 9 p.m. 

At work, the first thing I do is check flight times on my computer, and then I talk with some of the air hostesses. Sometimes, I go on long flights to see how the air hostesses are doing. That is my favorite part of the job, but I also enjoy office work. Traveling can be tiring. When I return from a long trip, all I want to do is eat something and then go to bed! I don’t earn a lot of money, but I am happy with British Airways and want to stay there and keep traveling."""
KET_39,"Dear Maria,

I am happy to be back home in my country, but I still think about all the friends I made in our English class, especially you. I cried when I left England because my visit was too short.

KET_62,"The Weather People study the weather for many reasons, and it is important for many jobs. For instance, the weather is very important for farmers. In the past, farmers spent a lot of time watching the sky, animals, and flowers to understand the weather better. Now, we have many computer programs that help us learn about the weather, and people can even get weather updates on their mobile phones. 

Today, many people still believe in old weather sayings. For example, some say that if the sky is red in the evening, it will be sunny the next day. Others think that if cows lie down in the fields, it will soon rain."
KET_49,"A great idea! Frazer and Peter are two 14-year-old boys from the same small town in Canada. They have always been friends and classmates. Like their other friends, they enjoy fishing and swimming on weekends. However, for the last few months, they have spent every weekend in Peter's room working on his laptop. This is not because they have a lot of homework. They have created a new computer word game. 

The idea for the game came from Frazer's little brother, Kevin, who has trouble with reading. Kevin learns words better when he can see pictures and hear sounds rather than just reading. His brother wanted to help him. Frazer and Peter worked together for over 200 hours to create this computer game, and now it is ready to use. 

The game combines speaking and pictures. For example, when you see the word 'hat', there is a drawing of a hat next to it, and you can hear Peter saying 'Hat! Hat!' at the same time. The two boys have won many prizes for their game, and it will soon be sold around the world. Many schools are interested in buying it."
KET_31,"**How Does the Irish Pop Group 'Boyzone' Live a Healthy Life?**

Sleeping well is very important. When I can go back to my mother's house, I sleep for ten hours. However, after a concert, I find it hard to sleep because my mind is full of music. 

Sports are also important. Before my car accident, I went to the sports center for two and a half hours a day, five days a week. Now, I can't do that, so I do about 150 sit-ups every day. I do not drink alcohol or smoke, and I try to eat healthy food. I also drink a lot of water because it is good for your health. I should drink about eight glasses a day, but I don’t always manage that.

People should not work all the time. I love my job, but I also enjoy other activities. In my free time, I like to listen to music or watch TV. It is good to relax sometimes. Since the doctor advised me to eat better, I don’t feel tired anymore. Now, I eat many healthy foods like carrots and spinach every day, but I still enjoy burgers sometimes!"
KET_58,"**Bollywood**

Bollywood is the name of the film industry in Mumbai, India. It produces almost 1,000 films every year. Since its first film in 1913, Bollywood has created over 29,000 films, making it the largest film industry in the world, much bigger than that of the USA. Many Indians prefer watching films to any other leisure activity, with ten million people going to the cinema every day.

Bollywood films often tell romantic love stories, and singing and dancing are important parts of these movies. Indian films are also popular outside of India. Last year, Bollywood earned over $500 million by selling its films to other countries. 

Indian actors make more films each year than American actors in Hollywood, but they earn less money. This is why most Bollywood films cost about $2 million to make, while Hollywood films usually cost at least $5 million. Most Bollywood actors are young and work hard, but they often have short careers. Amitabh Bachchan, who many consider India's greatest actor, is an exception. He has starred in more than 140 films over a career that has lasted almost 40 years."
KET_37,"Bill Bryson

I was born in the United States, but I have written many travel books about England. I lived in England with my wife and four children for 20 years. For the last three years, we have been back in the United States. Our children are now learning about life here, and I believe they will be happier because they have experienced living in two countries. I love Britain and want to return, but my daughter, Felicity, is starting college here soon, so we will not go back for another four years.

Recently, I spent six weeks in England to work on a radio program about the English language and to promote my new book. Most writers do not enjoy this; they do not like traveling around to sell their books. However, I do not mind it. I enjoy visiting new places and meeting many people. This experience is very different from my life in the United States when I am writing. In England, I was driven around in large cars and stayed in nice hotels. It was great because I did not have to pay for anything. Everyone was very kind to me, and I had a lot of fun."
KET_2,"**Schnauzer Dogs**

There are three sizes of Schnauzer dogs. The two smaller sizes came to England more than 50 years ago, but the Giant Schnauzer is newer to the country. The name ""Giant"" is fitting because these dogs are 65 to 67.5 cm tall. All Schnauzers have long hair that needs to be cut regularly. Most smaller Schnauzers are grey, while the Giant Schnauzer is usually black. 

Schnauzers come from Germany, where farmers use them to help with sheep. They are also used by the police because they are very intelligent. Schnauzers make great family pets. They are friendly and good with young children."
KET_23,"The Ruwenzori Mountains

Mary Daniels is a student from England. This year, she had a very interesting summer holiday. She traveled with fifteen other people to the Ruwenzori Mountains in Africa. They went there to help build a road through a forest between two large towns.

""It was very difficult because there was no water to drink and no shops to buy food,"" said Mary. ""It was also very cold and wet in the mountains. It is one of the wettest places in the world.""

Mary stayed in the mountains for six weeks. Although it was hard work, she says it was the best experience she has ever had. She hopes to return next year to do more work there."

**The Long Night**  
This is David Reilly's first book. David became a writer after teaching English for many years. The story is about Maha, a nurse in northern Australia, who works in a small hospital. One day, a baby is very sick, and Maha must drive all night to take her to the nearest big city. They face many challenges on their journey.

**Hard Work**  
This exciting story is Joanna Jones's twentieth book. It tells the story of Sombat, who works with his father, a carpenter, in Thailand. They spend long hours making tables and chairs, but they do not earn much money. One day, a man dressed in black comes and buys the most beautiful table in their shop.

**Hospital or Cinema?**  
Marcie Jacome, who studies English in London, wrote this story earlier this year. It is about Tina, a young woman from Brazil who dreams of becoming a doctor. She goes to London to study English and medicine. However, one day she meets a man who invites her to the USA to become a film star. What choice will Tina make?"
KET_53,"**The History of Horse Racing**

Horse racing has been an important sport since the earliest history books were written. It began in Central Asia around 4,500 years ago and was popular in ancient Greece and Rome. Modern horse racing started in the 12th century when Arab horses were brought to Europe. 

At first, races were long and only involved two horses. However, in the early 18th century, this changed. Races became shorter and included several horses competing against each other. 

Today, horse racing is one of the most-watched sports in the USA, second only to baseball. It is also very popular in many other parts of the world."

He doesn't pack many personal items, just a few shirts and trousers, but he always makes sure to bring some books in his suitcase. His wife, Helen, is supportive of his travels. She has many friends and keeps herself busy while he is away. When he returns, she enjoys listening to his travel stories.

However, sometimes there are challenges. While he was in the Malaysian rainforest, Nick learned that his wife was sick in the hospital. ""I felt awful because I couldn't help her, but she didn't want me to come home. I was so relieved when I found out she was better."""
KET_50,"**Parrots**

You may have seen parrots, which are beautiful birds with bright colors and long tails, in forests or zoos. Parrots live in countries like Brazil, Australia, and India. They usually stay in large groups and enjoy eating fruit, which can sometimes cause problems for farmers.

There are many types of parrots, but they all have strong beaks and feet that help them climb and hold their food. Some of the largest parrots can live for up to 80 years. They are very loud, but they are also intelligent and can be taught to talk easily. Some zoos have parrot shows where you can watch these birds perform tricks they have learned."
KET_25,"HOWARD BONNIER

Bray is a lovely village about fifty kilometers west of London. A young Englishman named Howard Bonnier opened a restaurant called The Palace there about three and a half months ago. Not many people in Britain know Mr. Bonnier yet, but he is already quite famous in France. This is because he has written for French magazines about many of the best restaurants in that country. He is only 29 years old.

When Howard was a teenager, he often went to restaurants with his parents. He enjoyed this so much that he chose to spend his money on visiting France and eating at good restaurants instead of buying many clothes and CDs. He also collected a lot of French and English cookbooks—he says he has more than two hundred and fifty!

So, why did he decide to open a restaurant? Simply because he loves cooking. Has it been easy? He says it is expensive to start your own restaurant and much harder to cook for fifty people than for your family, but he believes he has made the right choice."
KET_34,"**John Pickering**

In a small town in central England, John Pickering cuts the grass and waters the flowers in a park. Last week, he was in Tokyo, where millions of Japanese people watched him on television because he is currently the top singer in Japan. A few months ago, John went to Japan to perform in dance clubs in Osaka and Nagoya. A disc jockey heard his songs and played them on his radio show. Many young people called the radio station to ask for his songs to be played again.

John, who goes by the name Jon Otis when he sings in Japan, plans to keep working in the park in England. He is not sure how much money he will make from his music. ""I must keep my job in the park,"" he says. ""I still have to pay my bills!"" The other gardeners do not know that he is famous in Japan and have never heard him sing. John's wife, Denise, who works in a hospital, says, ""This will not change the way we live. I only know John Pickering, not Jon Otis!"""

KET_26,"**Line Dancing**

Many people in Britain have started a new hobby called line dancing. In almost every town, you can find clubs and classes for this fun activity. 

Line dancing is easy to learn. Fiona Lever, a teacher, says, ""If you have two feet and can walk, then you can do it!"" You don’t need a partner because you dance in groups. It’s a great way to meet new friends. In my classes, there are people of all ages. Boys enjoy it because they can make a lot of noise with their feet while dancing!

When did line dancing start? Most people believe it began about fifteen years ago when American country music became popular in Britain."
KET_8,"**The Rhino**

There are five types of rhinos in the world today. The Black and White Rhinos live in the open fields of Africa, while the other types live in forests in Asia. All rhinos have large, heavy bodies. Their skin is very tough, and they have very little hair. A rhino stands on four short legs, and each foot has three toes. They usually walk slowly, but they can run at speeds of up to 50 kilometers per hour. 

Rhinos are generally quiet and calm animals, and they eat grass and other plants. A baby rhino weighs about 40 kilos when it is born and stays inside its mother for around fifteen months. An adult rhino can weigh over 200 kilos and may live for up to 50 years."
KET_4,"**THE HISTORY OF THE LONDON POLICE**

Today, we see policemen everywhere, but in 1700, London had no police force. A few old men tried to protect the streets at night, but they were not paid much. About 300 years ago, London was growing larger. The city was very dirty, and many people were poor. There were many thieves who stole money in the streets, so people preferred to stay at home.

In 1750, Henry Fielding began to pay a group of people to catch thieves. They were like policemen and were called the 'Bow Street Runners' because they worked near Bow Street. Fifty years later, there were 120 Bow Street Runners, but London had grown so much that it needed more police.

In 1829, the first Metropolitan Police Force was created with 3,000 officers. Most of the men worked on foot, but some rode horses. Until 1920, all police officers in London were men. Today, London police officers are paid well, and those who still ride horses earn even more than the others."
KET_30,"Attention Students: 

Would you like to join a camping trip this weekend? We will travel to the forest by school bus and stay at a campsite from Friday to Sunday. The campsite has hot showers, a small shop, and you can rent bicycles. The cost of the trip is £25. It gets very cold at night, so please bring warm clothes and wear sturdy shoes. If you want to come, please let me know today.

KET_7,"Visit the Edinburgh Festival! Every year, many people come to Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland, to enjoy the Edinburgh Festival. For three weeks in August and September, the city is full of actors and artists from around the world. They come to take part in the largest arts festival in Britain. During this time, the streets are filled with music and dance from morning until night. You can even see artists painting on the streets. 

One of the highlights of the Festival is the 'Fringe', where students perform comedy shows in small venues and cafes. Many tourists visit the Festival to watch new films, plays, and listen to music from famous musicians. This year, there are over five hundred performances featuring actors from more than forty countries. Tickets for these shows are quite affordable, and it is often easier to see your favorite star in Edinburgh than in London. 

So, plan to visit Edinburgh next summer! Just remember that finding a place to stay can be hard, so it’s a good idea to book your hotel now!"
KET_43,"**ICE FISHING**

If you drive north from Toronto for three hours, you will reach Lake Nipissing. In winter, the lake freezes, and many Canadian fishermen go there every weekend. They build small wooden houses on the ice and paint them in bright colors. Inside these houses, they try to catch fish that swim under the ice.

Bob Marvisch has been coming here for twenty-five years during this season. He says, ""You need clothes that are light but warm: two pairs of socks, gloves, several thin sweaters, and a snow suit on top. Catching fish is easy."" 

To catch fish, first, you break the ice and make a small round hole. Then, you take a fishing line, put some bread on it, and lower it through the hole into the water. You pull the line up when the fish eat the bread. The fish are usually between ten and twenty centimeters long. Some people like to eat them, but Bob prefers to have chocolate or another snack after catching three or four fish. 

Today, he has caught twenty-five! He thinks it is a great sport, and you can meet nice people while fishing!"

Hi Anna,  

I’m having a tough week! Yesterday, my volleyball team played a match, but we lost. The other team was much better than us! Then, my friend Jeff, who lives in Australia, called with bad news. He can’t visit us during the holidays because he got a summer job. Now we can’t go camping together.  

This morning, my sister woke up late and took my bike to school without telling me. I’m really angry with her.  

I hope you have some good news! Please write back today if you can.

KET_11,"Madame Tussaud's

One well-known place for tourists in London is Madame Tussaud's museum. In this museum, visitors can see wax figures of famous people. Madame Tussaud was born in France in 1761. Her uncle, who was a doctor, made wax figures and opened a museum in Paris. Marie helped him with this work. 

In 1789, during the French Revolution, Marie was sent to prison. While in prison, she had to create wax models of famous people who had died, including Queen Marie Antoinette. In 1795, Marie married Francois Tussaud, and in 1802, she moved to London with her wax figures. She opened a museum there, and her figures can still be seen today."
KET_14,"**BICYCLES**

Bicycles are an affordable and environmentally friendly way to travel. The first bicycle was created about 150 years ago. At that time, bicycles were very expensive, so only wealthy people could afford them. These early bicycles looked quite different from the ones we use today. 

As bicycles became cheaper, more people started to buy them. Many began to ride bicycles to work and for leisure. Nowadays, people often use cars instead of bicycles because cars are faster and keep you dry in the rain. However, some people still choose to cycle to work. They believe there are too many cars in city centers, making it hard to find parking."
KET_63,"The Elephant Show by Daniel Allsop, age 14

Last summer, I went to Thailand for a beach holiday with my family. One day, we visited a park near our hotel. The park had beautiful flower gardens, but we were excited to see the elephant show. 

We went to a large area with seats on three sides. Three elephants came in with their trainers and stood in front of a big piece of white card. Each elephant was given a paintbrush and started to paint on its own card. The trainers would give them a new brush with paint and take away the old one. Slowly, following their trainers' instructions, the elephants created pictures on the cards. I couldn’t believe my eyes! One picture showed a river, another a tree, and the third a bunch of flowers. When the trainers held up the paintings, everyone wanted to buy one.

We also gave the elephants the bananas we had brought for our lunch. Twenty years ago, elephants worked in the forest. Now, they do not work there anymore, but the smartest elephants live in special centers where visitors can watch them."
KET_56,"**Big Cats**

There are many types of cats, and they vary in size, appearance, and behavior. Tigers are the largest cats, measuring up to 3.7 meters from head to tail. While most cats avoid water, tigers often enjoy lying in pools when it is hot outside. 

Lions are unique because they live in large family groups. These groups work together to hunt for food. Lions usually inhabit flat, open areas where they can see far and easily track other animals. 

All cats have excellent eyesight, which helps them catch smaller animals for food. They also need to be fast and strong."
KET_36,"Dear Mrs. Brian,

KET_20,"**THE OSTRICH**

The ostrich is the largest bird in the world, and an adult can weigh more than 90 kilos. Most wild ostriches live in southern Africa, but there are only a few left in the wild. Like all birds, ostriches have wings, but they cannot fly. They use their wings to help them turn while running. Ostriches can run very fast, at speeds of 65 to 90 kilometers per hour, making it hard for other animals to catch them. Baby ostriches are about the same size as chickens and take around 3 years to grow into adults. Ostriches eat plants and can survive for many days without water."
KET_40,"**Snowboarding**

Victoria Jamieson is a 23-year-old snowboarder from Britain. She started snowboarding when she was 20 and has won many competitions. Last week, we talked to her at a snowboarding competition in Switzerland. We asked her why she began snowboarding. She said, ""I have always enjoyed sports, especially skiing, so it felt natural to try snowboarding. It’s easy to learn, and you can get really good in just a few months.""

We also asked her about practice. She replied, ""In winter, I snowboard in the mountains every day from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. I also run and bike. I love all of it! I enjoy the competitions and being in the mountains because it is so beautiful. But for me, free-riding—doing what you want when you’re not in a competition—is the best part.""

Finally, we asked her what is important when learning to snowboard. She explained, ""You can learn quickly, but you need lessons. It’s also important to wear the right clothes so you don’t get wet, especially because you will fall a lot at first!"""

KET_64,"**Mount Kilimanjaro**

Mount Kilimanjaro is the tallest mountain in Africa. Many people have climbed it, including a seven-year-old boy and an 87-year-old man. There are different paths to reach the top. The Marangu path, which is five kilometers long, is considered the easiest. It usually takes about five days to climb and is very popular with tourists. 

However, only half of the climbers who attempt to reach the summit succeed. This is often due to sudden changes in the weather. At the start of the climb, it can be hot and rainy, but when climbers reach the top, they encounter ice and snow, and the temperature can drop below 20 degrees Celsius. Therefore, climbers should bring both sunglasses and warm clothing!"
KET_29,"**Otters**

Not many people have seen an otter. These animals live near rivers and build their homes using small pieces of wood. They usually come out at night. Otters are excellent swimmers and can swim faster than 10 kilometers per hour. They have thick brown fur that keeps them warm in the water. An otter can close its ears and nose, which allows them to stay underwater for several minutes.

Twenty years ago, there were very few otters in Great Britain. The rivers were very dirty, which caused many fish and insects to die, leaving otters without food. However, today there is plenty of food for them because the rivers are clean again."

KET_59,"**Buildings**

People have always built structures. We need houses to keep us warm and dry, and we create stadiums to watch football matches and concerts. Other buildings, like museums, are used to display beautiful items. 

Many people work together to create a building. The architect decides how the building will look and draws plans to show their ideas. Engineers ensure that the building is strong and safe. Then, workers carefully construct it.

The Sydney Opera House is a famous modern building known for its beautiful roof. However, the building is attractive from all sides, not just the top. Another well-known roof is on the Olympic Stadium in Munich, which looks like a glass tent."

KET_32,"The Cerne Giant

Sherborne and Dorchester are two towns in the south of England that are close to each other. Between these towns, there are many green hills and fields. On one of these hills, there is a large image of a man. This man is called the Cerne Giant because the nearby village is named Cerne. No one knows exactly when the Cerne Giant was created, but it is believed to be a very long time ago. You can walk from Cerne to get closer to the picture. If you visit on the first of May at sunrise, you will see the villagers dancing around the giant on the hill."
KET_61,"Gail Rollins is one of the best runners in Edinburgh. This summer, she wants to compete in the 10,000 metres and maybe the 5,000 metres at the European Championships. In the past, Gail was known for finishing second in big competitions. She always smiled and laughed, which made people in her city love her. However, everything changed in 2004 when she ran her first half-marathon, a long road race. She won with a very good time, the fastest of any British woman that year.

Gail's manager and husband, Mike Rollins, used to race when he was younger, but he had to stop because he hurt his right leg. He can still run a little and sometimes trains with Gail, but it’s not fun for him when she runs faster and leaves him behind.

Gail trains hard. She does a long run in the morning and fast runs in the afternoon, but she always takes Sundays off from running. Mike says, ""I am with her all the time. Sometimes I ask, 'Are you sure you should be eating that?' It's usually cakes, but she can eat almost anything."""
KET_52,"**Piano Players - Their Early Years**

**Ivan Petrov**  
Ivan was born on a farm in Russia. From the age of twelve to eighteen, he studied in Poland. His first music teacher could not play the piano but taught him and his sister songs from operas. His mother started teaching him the piano when he was six years old. At the age of ten, he decided he wanted to write music and soon began working on his first song.

**Oleg Gagarin**  
Oleg was the youngest of five children. When he was four, his father, who enjoyed playing the piano, taught him some traditional Russian music. At six, he began taking lessons from a piano teacher in his city. Oleg quickly started winning prizes for his piano playing. When he was fourteen, he attended a music college in Austria for two years before returning to Russia.

**Josef Heptmann**  
Josef's father was German and taught music in Poland, where Josef was born. The family moved to Germany when Josef was two years old, and he started playing the piano a year later. He gave his first concert at the age of six. When he was ten, he performed fifty-two concerts in two months during a trip to England! Josef loved music but was also interested in physics and languages. Although he is very busy now, he hopes to write his own music one day."
KET_28,"**Bill Prince-Smith**

Bill Prince-Smith was a farmer, a teacher, and a dentist before he became a writer of children's books at the age of 60. Now, thirteen years later, he has written more than 80 books. Every day, he goes to his office to write. In the evening, he gives his work to his wife to read. ""She tells me when she doesn't like something,"" says Bill. His ten grandchildren do not live nearby, but they also read his stories and give their opinions on them. This helps Bill understand what young children want to read.

Bill writes about life in his village and the farms around it. His favorite book is his fifth one, called *The Sheepdog*, which is about a farmer and the dog that helps him. ""I have always liked animals,"" says Bill, ""and dogs are very clever; they learn quickly."" Last year, this book was made into a film with real animals and actors. The filmmakers used the latest computer technology to make it look like the animals are speaking. Bill was very happy with the film. ""Sometimes filmmakers change books, but they didn't change mine, and I love the film."""
KET_35,"**POSTCARDS**

Today, many people enjoy sending postcards to their friends and family. These postcards usually have images of beaches, mountains, or castles, and you can write a message on the back. A lot of people send postcards while they are on holiday because they are inexpensive, and the pictures are often nicer than the photos people take themselves.

The first postcard was sent at the end of the 1800s. It had a picture of a seaside town. Later, postcards featured images related to current events, like accidents or visits from important people. People liked these postcards because newspapers at that time did not include many pictures."
KET_5,"Dinosaurs

No one has ever seen a dinosaur because the last one died about 60 million years ago, long before people existed on Earth. We do not know exactly why they all disappeared. The closest living relatives of dinosaurs are birds. 

Dinosaurs were not all the same; there were more than 5,000 different kinds. Some were very small, while others were huge. The largest dinosaurs were bigger than any other land animals that have ever lived. For example, the Brontosaurus was twenty meters long and ate plants. The Tyrannosaurus Rex was not as long, but it was very strong. It had sharp teeth for eating meat and could run fast because it had long back legs."
KET_41,"**Bears**

Bears can be dangerous animals. An adult bear is very strong and can harm a person. They are good at climbing trees and can run very fast. However, bears do not see well, and like many animals, they use their sense of smell to find food.

There are seven types of bears. The largest is the polar bear, which can be almost three meters tall. There are two types of black bears: one lives in the forests of North America, and the other is found in South-East Asia. Not all black bears are actually black; some can be dark brown or reddish-brown.

Many people love the black and white panda bear, which comes from China. Unfortunately, not many pandas live in the wild today because it is hard for them to find food."
KET_38,"CROCODILES

Crocodiles live in warm areas of the world, such as Africa, South America, and Northern Australia. They usually stay in slow-moving water, but they can swim quickly and also move fast on land. You often see crocodiles in large groups. They eat many things, including fish, birds, and small animals. Sometimes, they even eat larger animals or people.

There are more than ten different types of crocodiles, and they all have very sharp teeth. They often lose their teeth, but they grow new ones quickly. Most crocodiles are about 3.5 meters long, but some can be much larger. Crocodiles can live for a long time; the oldest one in a zoo lived to be 66 years old."
KET_17,"A HISTORY OF AIR TRAVEL

In 1783, two French brothers created the first balloon that could carry people into the sky. One hundred and twenty years later, in 1903, the Wright brothers built the first powered airplane and flew it in the United States. In 1918, the US Post Office started the first airmail service. 

Over the next thirty years, airplanes changed a lot. In the 1950s, they became much faster because they were equipped with jet engines. In 1976, Concorde was built in the UK and France. It is the fastest passenger plane in the world, flying at 2,500 kilometers per hour, which means the trip from London to New York takes only four hours. 

Today, millions of people travel by airplane, and it is hard to imagine a world without them."
KET_47,"The Globe Theatre

Visiting the theatre in London 400 years ago was very different from today. The building was round and had no roof, so people could get cold and wet if it rained. The queen enjoyed going to the Globe Theatre, located by the River Thames, to watch the plays of William Shakespeare. At that time, all the actors were men. Visitors would eat, talk to their friends, walk around during the show, and some even threw things at the actors! 

Today, you can still visit the Globe Theatre. A new theatre has been built in the same place near the river. You can enjoy a Shakespeare play there or learn about life in the seventeenth century."
